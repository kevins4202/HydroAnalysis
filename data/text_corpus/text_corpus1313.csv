6565,megacities are facing a twofold challenge regarding resources i ensure their availability for a growing urban population and ii limit the impact of resource losses to the environment this paper focuses on two essential resources nitrogen and phosphorus and challenges their sustainable management in the water agro food system of paris megacity an in depth analysis of the nitrogen and phosphorus imprint of paris megacity was conducted originally centered on human metabolism through consumption and excretion of these two elements upstream the whole agricultural production that feeds paris megacity was scrutinized and nitrogen and phosphorus flows in the agro system were fully documented downstream the analysis of solid waste and wastewater management in paris megacity showed the fate of nitrogen and phosphorus imported into the city paris megacity appears to rely on a very complex and international agro food system requiring high levels of chemical fertilizers and strongly impacting the environment through nutrient environmental losses on the other hand solid waste and wastewater management appears to be mostly disconnected from the agro food system even if the release of nitrogen and phosphorus into the environment has largely decreased in recent years their recycling rate remains very low this overview of the water agro food system of paris megacity suggests that an optimal management of nitrogen and phosphorus in the three subsystems agriculture waste management and sanitation should be integrated within a comprehensive approach linking agriculture and urban residues this analysis thus constitutes a groundwork on which paradigm shift scenarios of the global water agro food system could be constructed keywords biogeochemical imprint water agro food system urban metabolism megacity nitrogen cycle phosphorus cycle 1 introduction born of a process of sociospatial specialization cities are characterized by the externalization of most of their metabolism the flows of material and energy necessary to sustain urban life and urban functioning and by their dependence upon various areas and ecosystems located outside their boundaries for both the supply of resources and the disposal of waste the industrial era has increased this dependence and remoteness to the point that the urban environmental impact is greater in these supply and emission areas than in the city itself barles 2015 today the imprint of urban environments can be found throughout the world billen et al 2012a and for every environmental compartment water being one of the most impacted cities dependence upon remote areas also questions their sustainability and their ability to face socioecological crises that could impact their metabolism as a whole climate change and extreme climate events change in geopolitical conditions economic crises etc more than other cities megacities are characterized by their huge need for material and energy kennedy et al 2015 among which food and water are of utmost importance for the life of their inhabitants megacities are not just bigger than most cities their large and diverse populations their spatial extension the amount and diversity of activities that characterize them the complexity of their functioning make the organization of megacities metabolism particularly delicate especially regarding food and water from the point of view of both supply and discharge through waste and wastewater these have a strong impact on biogeochemical cycles the characterization of this impact is a key to understanding megacities metabolism and to considering change in water and food management this makes it necessary to i identify the main biogeochemical flows in terms of socioecological relevance and to analyze the biogeochemical processes involved ii quantify these flows and iii locate them at the different stages of their circulation nitrogen n and phosphorus p can be considered as the most critical biogeochemical flows regarding their socioecological impact steffen et al 2015 put forward nine main control variables of the earth system and suggested planetary boundaries under which these control variables should stay to prevent major shifts in the regulation of the earth system s stability along with biosphere integrity n and p flows are considered to be in the highest risk zone ahead of the climate change control variable the concern about disruption of n and p cycles has been broadly studied and documented it is of particular significance in europe where the n cycle intensity is about fivetimes greater than the biospheric cycle leading to substantial negative damage from aquatic and terrestrial eutrophication to poor air quality and climate change sutton et al 2011 the environmental dispersion of p is also a matter of concern regarding fertilizer and therefore food production cordell 2010 phosphate rock has recently been added to the list of critical raw materials by the european commission european commission 2014 megacities play a major role in n and p flows and depend on them urban dwellers metabolism is embedded in a complex worldwide water agro food system resulting in an equally complex biogeochemical imprint some studies have provided an overview of urban metabolism through substance flow analysis regarding n or p svirejeva hopkins et al 2011 færge et al 2001 forkes 2007 barles 2007 or considered the impact of urban waste and or wastewater on the environment morée et al 2013 others have focused on the urban food print and show the relevance of a spatialized approach billen et al 2009 2012a b c chatzimpiros and barles 2013 however it seems important to entertain a broader view and to explore both the downstream and the upstream imprint of urban metabolism as demonstrated by schmid neset et al 2008 for p this approach contributes to characterizing the current socioecological regime fischer kowalski and haberl 2007 of megacities in this paper we therefore focus on paris megacity and the n and p flows involved in its food production supply consumption and discharge to determine the biogeochemical imprint of human metabolism in paris megacity its water agro food system has been divided into three subsystems i food production in the agricultural system that feeds paris megacity ii food waste management from production at the farm to the actual ingestion of food by humans and iii human excreta management in the city itself in each of these subsystems a detailed and regionalized analysis of n and p flows was conducted we aimed at qualitatively and quantitatively comprehending the stakes of the biogeochemical imprint for sustainable development of a megacity such as paris for the sake of this study we therefore characterized the imprint of paris megacity by the magnitude of the flows of resources here n and p required to sustain its food supply and the flows of wastes discharged into the environment as a consequence of food consumption we also determined the spatial distribution of these flows 2 material and methods as recommended in the early work by baccini and brunner 1991 the borders of our system are defined in this section as well as the key issues selected 2 1 spatial and temporal frame 2 1 1 spatial frame the urban agglomeration of paris is ranked the 25th largest city in the world by the united nations united nations 2014 it is the largest city of the european union and with a population of more than 10 million inhabitants it is classified as a megacity the definition of a city remains controversial and the setting of its boundaries can vary greatly depending on the definition adopted in this paper we choose to follow the french national institute of economic statistics and studies insee www insee fr definition of the urban unit the main characteristic of an urban unit is that the distance between two inhabited buildings does not exceed 200 m in this sense paris megacity is composed of 412 municipalities totaling 10 550 350 inhabitants in the official 2012 census and has a density of 3 700 cap km2 insee the term paris megacity will be used in this paper to refer to the paris urban unit paris megacity as an urban unit should be distinguished from three other perimeters that are also commonly used to define paris illustrated in table 1 and fig 1 i the paris city center this is the core municipality of paris megacity representing 21 of its population it is one of the densest city centers in the world with more than 21 000 cap km2 insee ii the paris urban area the insee definition adds to the paris urban unit the municipalities where at least 40 of the residents and working population work in the paris urban unit paris megacity accounts for 85 of the population of the paris urban area and is five times denser iii the ile de france region this is the administrative region in which paris megacity is included its population is about the same as the paris urban area but their respective perimeters differ slightly this study covers the metabolism of people who are actually inside paris megacity and the results are expressed in yearly averaged figures data from the population census commuting patterns tourism and business trips have been gathered from studies conducted by french public institutions insee authorities in charge of economy and tourism institut d aménagement et d urbanisme de la région ile de france they have been used to obtain the yearly average instantaneous number of people actually eating discarding waste and excreting urine and feces dwellers temporarily out of the city for holidays or work have been deducted pro rata temporis nondwellers coming to the city for tourism or work have been added pro rata temporis as stated the imprint of paris megacity largely exceeds its boundaries and each of the three subsystems studied covers a specific imprint zone that can sometimes overlap paris megacity lies within the seine river basin it is located 220 km upstream from the estuary where the seine river flows into the baie de seine seine bay as well as into the contiguous north west channel and southern bight of the north sea and is responsible for the development of harmful algal blooms causing severe damage to fish and shellfish populations lancelot et al 2007 passy et al 2013 2016 the seine river basin has therefore been classified as a sensitive area subject to eutrophication in the sense of the 1991 urban waste water treatment uwwt directive european council directive 91 271 eec the 2015 seine river basin management plan aims at reaching good ecological potential for 2021 as required by the european water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ce including reduction of n and p concentrations moreover the 1992 oslo paris convention required the seine river basin to halve its n and p flows to the sea between 1985 and 1995 the target on p has been reached but the flows of n show an opposite trend of 1 per year over the last 30 years aesn 2013 2 1 2 temporal frame in recent years the most significant changes in the water agro food system of paris megacity have been the works on wastewater treatment plants in order to comply with the uwwt directive this directive requests that the wastewater treatments withdraw 70 of the n and 80 of the p contained in the urban wastewater in sensitive areas subject to eutrophication this objective was first reached for paris megacity s main wastewater treatment system in 2012 cf the dedicated internet site of the french ministry of ecology for detailed information on the compliance with this directive on http assainissement developpement durable gouv fr therefore we chose to describe the imprint of paris megacity in 2012 however because of constraints related to the availability of data our analysis of the agro food system is based on figures from 2006 there has been no major shift in the agriculture since this period le noë et al 2017 2 2 the agro food system that feeds paris megacity evaluating the environmental imprint of paris megacity over its food supplying areas requires i quantifying paris megacity s consumption ii identifying the areas supplying food to paris megacity iii evaluating agricultural production and environmental losses from agriculture for each area contributing to the food supply of paris megacity and iv calculating the environmental imprint of paris megacity as the fraction of the environmental losses attributable to food supply of paris megacity in each contributing area 2 2 1 apparent food consumption availability data on the availability of food commodities based on the analysis of national accounts are provided by insee these data correspond to the apparent food consumption of the french population as a whole including wasted or discarded parts at the retail and domestic level we have considered that national data on food consumption can appropriately be applied to paris megacity as confirmed by more detailed inquiries on dietary habits in france afssa 2009 owing to a detailed compilation of the n and p content of each item from the insee nomenclature based on information from the ciqual and usda databases on food composition https pro anses fr tableciqual http ndb nal usda gov all data collected have been converted to tons of n per year tn y and tons of p per year tp y 2 2 2 agricultural trade the trade exchanges of agricultural products between french departments nuts3 in the european union geocode standard the administrative district between the municipality and the region were obtained from the french database sitram système d information sur le transport des marchandises http www statistiques developpement durable gouv fr sources methodes it annually identifies the transport of 50 categories of agricultural products between french departments by roads railways and navigable waterways as well as exchanges with foreign countries customs database automated software has been developed by silvestre et al 2015 for the analysis of these data le noë et al 2016 used it to establish a complete matrix of the flows of agricultural commodities exchanged between 33 french agricultural areas defined by groupings of departments based on the similarity of their agricultural system see fig 3 as well as foreign countries grouped into 12 macroregions lassaletta et al 2014 from these data the relative contribution of each of these 47 agricultural regions to the total ile de france food supply was calculated separately for vegetal and animal proteins we assumed that there was no significant typological difference between paris megacity s food supply and ile de france s food supply therefore the food supply of paris megacity was deduced by simple application of population ratios 2 2 3 agricultural production and environmental losses of supplying territories the grafs approach generalized representation of agro food systems first developed for n flows by billen et al 2014 then extended to p and c by le noë et al 2017 describes the agro food system of a given region by considering four main compartments exchanging n and p flows arable lands grasslands livestock biomass and local population the grafs approach makes it possible to draw direct links between different aspects of the hydro agro food system e g the relation between livestock breeding grassland areas and forage crops and the relation between fertilization of arable lands and grasslands and n environmental losses the grafs approach is based on a detailed budget of n and p flows including production transformation and consumption of animal and vegetal products inputs of n and p fertilizers atmospheric n and p deposition symbiotic n2 fixation p embedded in feed additives leaching and erosion in each agricultural region the agricultural and livestock production arable land and grassland surface areas were obtained from the french database agreste www agreste agriculture gouv fr at the scale of french departments nuts3 and from the fao data base www faostat fao org for foreign countries they are converted into n or p flows based on coefficients compiled from various sources fao usda databases lassaletta et al 2014 fertilizer application rates were obtained by the unifa union des industries de la fertilisation which provides detailed data at the regional administrative scale http www unifa fr le marche en chiffres la fertilisation en france html the grafs approach expresses the n and p budgets on both arable land and grassland yet n and p have very different behaviors in soil n tends to be easily leached after its conversion into nitrate by nitrifying micro organisms while p is strongly sorbed onto soil particles as a consequence the environmental losses associated with these elements differ and budgets need to be calculated separately to integrate these specificities for n nitrate leaching generates water pollution the n soil surplus is represented by the difference between n inputs to the soil through fertilizer and manure application symbiotic n fixation by legumes and atmospheric deposition and n export with harvested products about 70 of the n surplus of arable land is leached to sub surface runoff or aquifers while a much lower fraction is leached from grassland billen et al 2013a b in the case of p erosion is the major output flux accounting for p environmental losses p erosion from grasslands and arable lands is estimated from the soil p content cartography established for france by delmas et al 2015 and the erosion rates for arable lands and grasslands proposed by cerdan et al 2010 the p soil balance the difference between fertilizer and manure inputs atmospheric deposition and export with harvested products and erosion informs on the accumulation or depletion trend of the p stock in the soils garnier et al 2015 another discrepancy between n and p budgets rely in the gap of the n p ratio of vegetal and animal biomass and as a consequence the need for p feed additives to sustain the livestock production in the present study the feed additives were deduced as the unmet needs of p by the ingestion of vegetal products 2 2 4 evaluation of ile de france s environmental imprint over its supply areas the relative contribution to the total import to ile de france of either vegetal or animal proteins as calculated from the sitram database is used as an index for calculating the imprint in terms of agricultural area in each region by considering their main orientation into either crop or livestock production the environmental imprint of ile de france was calculated only over regions that contribute to more than 1 of ile de france vegetal or animal supply we thus define the imprint of crop production of a given region as the total resource consumption and environmental losses attributable to the portion of crop dedicated to vegetal food supply to ile de france this may include some of the resources and environmental losses associated with livestock farming in so far as manure is used for crop production conversely the imprint of meat and milk production is calculated by considering all resources and pollution associated with livestock farming including those linked to crop production dedicated to animal feeding without double counting the details of these calculations are provided in le noë et al 2017 in some cases animal husbandry is based on imported feed such as soybean or oil seed cakes as a consequence n and p imports embedded in animal feed need to be accounted for in ile de france s environmental imprint this is particularly true for regions depending on massive import of animal feed from south america brazil paraguay uruguay argentina and bolivia accordingly the environmental imprint ofsouth america vegetal production has been calculated and the share of this production imported to the regions of intensive livestock farming supplying ile de france has been included in the environmental imprint of ile de france 2 3 solid food waste generation and management 2 3 1 food waste generation food waste appears at all stages of the food supply chain transformation transport and storage distribution and consumption by far the largest amount concerns the transformation of animal products particularly slaughtering and cutting activities taking into account the cutting balance available for each type of livestock benhalima et al 2015 as well as the n and p composition of each fraction ciqual usda mello et al 1978 ternouth 1990 little 1984 waste generation as blood viscera grease bones etc associated with edible meat production can be evaluated food waste generated at the latest stages of the supply chain can be evaluated by direct comparison of the above mentioned data on food availability provided by insee with the data on actual food consumption given by a national detailed inquiry organized in 2006 2007 by the agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l alimentation de l environnement et du travail www anses fr which provides detailed information on the actual ingestion of food commodities afssa 2009 using again the n and p content given by the ciqual and usda databases on food composition the direct comparison of food availability and food ingestion has been made possible and losses of n and p at the latest stages of the supply chain have been evaluated by subtraction 2 3 2 food waste management n and p flows of food waste management were evaluated by compiling data related to food waste collection and treatment national data on food waste production and collection are provided by surveys conducted by the french environment energy management agency ademe www ademe fr a 2007 campaign characterizing domestic and economic refuse ademe 2010 and a 2008 survey of food waste management at the household level ademe 2008 the former study estimates that 75 of the collected food wastecomes from households the latter study is only semiquantitative so several hypotheses regarding actual flows of food waste being managed on site had to be considered a proportion of 10 of household food waste was assumed to be managed on site in paris megacity the obligation of biowaste source separation by the largest producers is very recent and the circular that specifies these obligations dates from 2012 circulaire du 10 janvier 2012 relative aux modalités d application de l obligation de tri à la source des biodéchets par les gros producteurs article l 541 21 1 du code de l environnement nor devp1131009c given the temporal frame used herein we consider that only two biowaste source separations are implemented by the largest producers oil separation in which n and p contents are considered negligible and bone collection from slaughterhouses and butchers for the latter we considered that 5 10 of bones were not collected although some bone collection and animal processing takes place inside the city mostly within butchers we have considered slaughterhouses and butchers as a whole and excluded them from the perimeter of urban economic activities management of biowaste by economic activities and the rungis international market were evaluated by a local survey conducted by the french ministry in charge of food and agriculture driaaf 2012 food waste treatment data were collected locally the ile de france region waste management observatory ordif www ordif com has produced a survey of waste treatment facilities in the ile de france region ordif 2014 that distinguishes waste treatment for paris megacity and waste treatment of the other ile de france municipalities paris megacity has one major waste treatment authority the joint central household waste treatment authority for the agglomeration of paris syctom http www syctom paris fr it covers the densest zones of paris megacity and serves 54 of the population of paris megacity fig 2 syctom is in charge of the treatment of waste and does not receive any separate collection of food waste all food waste treated by the syctom currently goes into three incineration plants located close to the paris city center in ivry sur seine issy les moulineaux and saint ouen there are 14 other incineration plants that receive the waste of paris megacity data on waste composition and waste treatment from the syctom were analyzed in their annual activity reports and exploitation data syctom data personal communication and extrapolated to paris megacity 2 4 wastewater management in paris megacity the final stage of our n and p imprint analysis stems from human metabolism food transformation in the body and the fate of its by products mostly as urine and feces directed to the sewers of paris megacity detailed calculations are presented in supplementary material 2 4 1 flows of n and p outside wastewater collection three types of losses were considered before release of n and p in sewers i human by products of metabolism that are not in the form of urine and feces these by products can take three forms integumentary and accidental losses sweat hair menstruation bleeding etc breathing and n and p stocked in the body sutton et al 2000 estimated that n volatilization related to sweat excretion accounts for 14 gn cap y i e about 0 3 of n excretion through urine and feces and less than 0 1 of n loss through breathing taking into account that many integumentary losses reach the sewers through showering or clothes washing a general value of 0 5 metabolized n and p not reaching the sewers was taken into account for breathing and integumentary losses n stock in the human body is estimated at less than 0 5 of total n ingested during an individual s lifetime p is mostly stocked in bones and is not negligible we assume a 1 p content in the human body for a mean weight of 70 kg insee thus 0 7 kgp total stock in the body ii excretions by children strictly under 3 years of age they were excluded from the calculation given that the intensity of their metabolism is very limited and excretions are mostly directed to waste bins via diapers the flow of n and p of their excretions is estimated around 1 of the flow corresponding to the population of more than 3 years of age iii excretions of urine and feces that do not reach the sewer network these excretions mostly consist of on site sanitation systems adapted from lesavre 1995 2 of the population of paris megacity has been considered to use on site sanitation or open urination and defecation 2 4 2 flows of n p in wastewater the flows of n p in paris megacity wastewater were calculated on the basis of operational data provided by the siaap syndicat interdépartemental d assainissement de l agglomération parisienne www siaap fr the siaap is a public institution in charge of wastewater transport and treatment and it covers 85 of the population of paris megacity fig 2 the siaap operates six wastewater treatment plants including seine aval located on the municipality of achères 20 km to the northwest of the center of paris which treats the wastewater of 53 of the population of paris megacity about 35 other wastewater treatment plants treat the remaining 15 of the population of paris megacity see http assainissement developpement durable gouv fr for detailed information and their operational results do not significantly differ we thus extrapolated the results obtained on the basis of siaap operational data to the whole population of paris megacity we used siaap operational data between 2004 and 2014 siaap personal communication the year 2013 was selected for the results of the treatment plants because it was the first year when routine denitrification in achères was in full operation it was also considered representative in terms of rain events and collection efficiency discharges from the sewer network were calculated as the sum of dry weather discharges and rain weather discharges as combined sewer overflows these data were evaluated from the sanitation master plan of the siaap area approved in 2017 siaap personal communication n p discharges to the sewer network unrelated to human metabolism were calculated by the difference between metabolic inputs sewer discharges and treatment plant inputs food waste inflows were estimated on the basis of grey water composition deshayes 2015 friedler et al 2013 chaillou et al 2011 n and p discharge in rivers and n and p content in sewage sludge were calculated on the basis of siaap data n2 emissions were deduced by subtraction and n2o emissions were calculated from measurements taken at the achères wastewater treatment plant bollon et al 2016a 2016b and extrapolated to paris megacity siaap sludges are either incinerated or recycled in agriculture through direct spreading or composting sludge spreading plans were examined to quantify and localize n and p recycling on agricultural lands 3 results 3 1 the agro food system supplying paris megacity 3 1 1 food supplying areas the analysis of the transport matrix concerning the 33 french agricultural regions and foreign countries reveals strong spatial segregation between regions supplying vegetal or animal products to paris megacity five regions currently provide 80 of the paris megacity supply of vegetal proteins namely ile de france 55 champagne ardennes yonne 9 loire centrale 8 picardie 5 and eure et loir 4 those regions are highly specialized in field crop production le noë et al 2016 2017 and their production of animal proteins is negligible in view of their spatial distribution around paris megacity fig 3 the whole area is hereafter called the central paris basin and classified as a crop farming region the animal protein supply is much more dispersed 19 french regions contribute more than 1 each and together supply 55 of paris megacity animal proteins three of these regions bretagne loire aval and manche account for 32 of the paris megacity animal protein supply they are strongly specialized in intensive livestock production which depends on massive imports of animal feed from south america le noë et al 2016 2017 as those regions are spatially distributed in western france fig 3 the whole area is hereafter called the great west and is classified as an intensive livestock farming region on the other hand the 16 remaining regions total 23 of the animal protein supply they are much less specialized in one or another type of production but they occupy a larger agricultural area in addition the proportion of permanent grassland is largely equivalent to that of arable land these features characterize these regions as mixed crop and livestock farming we call the great east a territory formed by six regions loire amont grande lorraine cantal corrèze ain rhône isère drôme ardèche and bourgogne which supply 13 of paris megacity animal proteins furthermore various foreign countries contribute to the animal food supply fig 3 their local environmental imprint is not directly calculated because of the lack of information regarding the functioning of the agro food system and the uncertainties regarding their n and p environmental losses yet based on literature data billen et al 2014 we have classified foreign countries as being close to the intensive livestock farming or mixed crop and livestock farming typologies this allows us to estimate the share of animal proteins provided by intensive livestock farming regions or mixed crop and livestock farming regions fig 5 regarding imports of feed to the great west region from south america they represent 67 of the 302ktn y imported to france these imports are undoubtedly essential to support cattle breeding in the great west which satisfies about one third of paris megacity animal protein requirement hence south america takes a significant yet indirect part in the food supplying area of paris megacity that we define as a soybean cultivation area in summary our analysis reveals four distinct typical areas contributing to the paris megacity food supply each with its own agricultural system orientation these regions are i the central paris basin specialized in crop farming ii the great west with intensive livestock farming strongly dependent on iii south american countries as feed suppliers and iv the great east with mixed crop and livestock farming fig 4 a h 3 1 2 the agro food system of the supplying territories to gain better insight into the agricultural metabolism of each of the four types of territory supplying paris megacity we established the full grafs diagram of n and p flows across their agricultural systems fig 4a h the grafs representations highlight the fact that all regions use high inputs of synthetic n and p fertilizers this is especially true for the central paris basin region since there is no other significant source of n and p inputs to agricultural areas in the absence of livestock the very high crop production even leads to a negative p soil budget i e a depletion of p on cropland the very specialized great west region is characterized by a strong dependency on feed import low grassland area and intense n surplus from arable land the source of environmental losses in contrast the great east region is characterized by a large grassland area food and feed self sufficiency and smaller surplus on arable land finally south america is also defined by large grassland areas food and feed self sufficiency but shows a very export oriented metabolism since 58 of its vegetal production is traded internationally 3 1 3 environmental imprint of paris megacity food supply as stated above the imprint of paris megacity food consumption in each supplying area is defined as the resources consumed and the environmental nutrient losses which are attributable to the food supply of paris megacity table 2 summarizes the calculated imprints over the four main supplying areas which contribute 62 of the total protein supply of paris megacity overall this agricultural area is estimated at about 2 5 million ha of which approximately one third are grassland areas almost all located in the mixed crop and livestock farming area when these absolute numbers are reduced to the population of paris megacity it appears that 0 26 ha is required for this part of the food supply per inhabitant 62 of these only 0 011 ha less than 5 is dedicated to the supply of vegetal proteins the remaining being mostly devoted to meat and milk production the total nitrogen imprint of these agricultural activities across these areas is estimated to be a surplus of 114 ktn y with about one fourth of this surplus in grassland and a nh3 volatilization of 38 ktn y yet it is necessary to take into account that environmental consequences of the n surplus on arable land and on grasslands are significantly different on arable land about 70 of the n surplus ends up in the hydrosystem billen et al 2013a b in contrast n inputs contributing to the n surplus in grassland below a threshold of 100 kgn ha y keep accumulating in the soil organic matter pool billen et al 2013a b accordingly the surplus observed in grassland should not necessarily be viewed as a negative environmental impact as it accompanies the increase of the soil organic matter pool the p eroded from those areas feeding paris megacity is estimated to reach 3 2 ktp y with 95 derived from arable land however it is difficult to determine the amount of p reaching the surface water because eroded particles can accumulate in downhill and riparian sectors more specifically it appears that the mixed crop and livestock farming area is the most costly in terms of the surface required to feed paris as well as of n and p fertilizers and n surplus on arable land however this area is almost self sufficient since it requires low net imports of feed from other regions to sustain its livestock production in contrast the intensive livestock farming area imports a substantial amount of feed from south america making these two areas part of a same system with this in mind it appears that the environmental imprint of paris megacity is not so different for both systems and is higher in terms of p surplus on arable lands over the intensive livestock farming soybean cultivation regions to summarize fig 5 shows the main flows of n and p resources mobilized and or lost to the environment attributable to the animal and vegetal food supply of paris megacity 3 2 food waste flows in paris megacity 3 2 1 waste generation in the food transformation industry wastes are generated along the entire supply chain from agriculture production to the final urban consumer the largest proportion of these wastes concerns the meat slaughtering and cutting stage the transformation of living animals into edible products generates a huge amount of waste evaluated at 1 1 kgn per kgn in edible form for n and 8 2 kgp per kgp for p the very high level of waste generated in terms of p is related to the high p content of bones this represents a per capita production of slaughtering and cutting wastes for paris megacity of 3 9 kgn cap y and 0 8 kgp cap y respectively 3 2 2 food waste at the retail and consumer level the data on food commodity availability insee expressed in kgn cap y have been stable since 1990 after an overall increase of the values since the 1950s especially for animal products compared to these the food ingestion data collected by afssa 2009 show a per capita consumption approximately 35 lower when expressed in n or p this difference can be attributed to waste production between the retail and the final ingestion stage evaluation of these losses per food commodity group table 3 shows figures varying from 19 for cereals to 50 for fruits and vegetables in terms of n content overall this leads to a per capita domestic waste generation of 2 4 kgn cap y and 0 24 kgp cap y excluding bones 3 2 3 food waste management the n and p food waste flows in paris megacity are illustrated in fig 6 a and b apart from bone collection and other recovery of animal waste the main form of reuse is represented as on site food waste disposal by households according to ademe 2008 this on site disposal mainly takes the form of animal feeding pets and wild animals since excretions of urban animals are seldom recovered animal feeding ultimately adds to the environmental losses of n and p in the city composting food waste is a minor form of on site reuse it is of course more common in the parts with the lowest population density only about 100 collective composters were counted in the paris city center in 2012 www paris fr compost section we can therefore assume that less than 1 of household food waste is composted in paris megacity s densest areas however when food waste is composted it is used for garden food production in two cases out of three which therefore contributes to effective n and p recycling food production inside paris megacity is nevertheless considered negligible in the end more than 80 of food waste is collected by municipalities together with other residual waste whereas green waste from the garden is often collected separately only one waste treatment plant located in saint ouen l aumône receives source separated food waste and composts it in paris megacity ordif 2014 three other waste treatment plants in paris megacity carry out mechanical biological sorting of residual waste for composting or methanization however they receive less than 1 of the total paris megacity food waste production in fig 6a and b economic activities represent all places where food waste is handled out of the households markets supermarkets restaurants canteens bakeries etc except for activities leading to bone collection as specified in section 2 3 2 the rungis international market reportedly the largest market of agricultural products in the world performs food waste composting or methanization but this accounts for less than 1 of paris megacity food waste production except for collection of bones within butchers other economic activities mostly rely on mixed residual waste collection for food waste disposal finally incineration is the prevailing destination of paris megacity food waste it entails negligible releases of reactive n and p in the environment but it does not achieve any form of n p reuse n content in food waste turns back into the atmosphere as n2 p stays in the bottom ash and is stabilized in clinker clinker is mostly used as construction material which does not allow specific p reuse 3 3 wastewater flows in paris megacity compiled results of n p flows related to human metabolism and wastewater management are presented in fig 7 a and b apart from p stocking in bones n p ingestion overwhelmingly ends up in wastewater and 98 of it is collected by sewer networks the impact of commuting people is very small the balance is in favor of people coming daily to paris megacity to work with more than one third coming from outside the ile de france region but most of their n p excretion takes place at home and their final contribution to n p flows in paris megacity is around 1 the largest impact comes from the inhabitants of paris megacity leaving the city for holidays which on average accounts for 26 days per person per year i e 7 of paris megacity inhabitants are absent on a yearly basis tourists coming to paris megacity do not offset these departures and increase the population of paris megacity by only 4 in the end the population census in paris megacity is evaluated at 10 6 million inhabitants but only 9 8 million inhabitants over 3 years old actually excrete n p on this territory as an annual average direct dry weather discharges from the sewer network to rivers that are identified in the sanitation master plan of the siaap area are very low and account for only 25 000 population equivalents most losses occur during rain events from combined sewer overflows and are estimated to around 3 of total inputs the proportion of p collected in the sewers that is not related to excretion or food waste is much higher than for n mainly because of the use of p in detergents it accounts for 30 of the total collected phosphorus in 2013 i e 0 17 kgp cap y in the last 10 years this figure has been steadily decreasing by about 0 03 gp cap y due to bans of p in detergents it is expected to continue decreasing with a new limitation on p in dishwashers that will come into effect in 2017 by application of eu regulation no 259 2012 of the european parliament and of the council of 14 march 2012 total p discharge in the rivers represents 18 of total p entering the networks but only half of the sludge is directly spread on agricultural land or composted the other half is incinerated in various facilities and p is not recovered from incineration ashes n is mostly emitted from wastewater treatment plants in the form of gas predominantly n2 but also in small proportions in the form of n2o kampschreur et al 2009 reported a considerable range of uncertainty regarding n2o emissions in wastewater treatment plants varying from 0 05 to 25 of n load recent measurements at achères wastewater treatment plant lead to a 2 ratio n recycling to agriculture is negligible total n discharge in the river from the area s wastewater treatment plants respects the uwwt directive regulatory threshold of 30 but the effective global rate of n river discharge from the wastewater system is about 38 for a megacity like paris this means that the metabolic n of about 4 million people is discharged daily into the seine river in a reactive form mostly no3 3 4 overview of the nitrogen and phosphorus imprint of human metabolism in paris megacity the results on the biogeochemical imprint of human metabolism in paris megacity from all three subsystems of agro food production waste management and wastewater management are compiled and summarized in fig 8 a and b the imprint for other agricultural regions than the four supply areas studied was deduced by extrapolation considering the same characteristics for these regions as for their corresponding studied counterpart n and p loads to the wastewater management that are not directly related to food and excretion were also removed and subsequent flows proportionally recalculated they allow a general vision of this imprint that contributes to characterizing a socioecological regime fischer kowalski and haberl 2007 as discussed in section 4 2 4 discussion 4 1 quality of results and uncertainties the majority of the flow accounts are based on local data mostly provided by french administration surveys and inventories this method presents the advantage and the originality of providing an accurate overview of the biogeochemical imprint of human metabolism in paris megacity rather than a theoretical estimation of its imprint based on literature data this advantage is counterbalanced by two main drawbacks i the high dependence on the reliability of the locally available data and ii the low availability of results expressed in n and p content in local data the uncertainties concerning the grafs flows are extensively discussed in le noë et al 2017 in the present study the p imprint of paris megacity has been calculated on the basis of the n imprint by using of n p ratios it leads to a slightly unbalanced p budget showing a 21 38 gap between inputs and outputs on fig 5 and fig 8 regarding our n p flow calculations in the waste management subsystems their reliability is difficult to establish most data on food waste are given in kilograms of food waste but our approach is based on n and p to trace the actual nutrients contained in food necessary for human metabolism figures in kilograms of food waste are difficult to interpret given the variability of the moisture in food waste some of the collected studies take liquids into accounts and others exclude them moreover it is difficult to accurately analyze the composition of a trash bin and its specific content in food waste ademe 2010 syctom data all types of waste are usually mixed in residual waste bins and it is difficult to sort them again however syctom data enable the calculation of n and p content of a sample of collected waste bins and we found values of 1 9 kgn cap y and 0 35 kgp cap y if we consider that most n and p comes from food waste these values tend to show a correct estimation for n and p collected in waste bins data on p could not be cross checked with local analysis of bottom ash since this element is not measured on syctom ash calculated values of n and p losses between the slaughter cutting and packaging steps are taken into account in the grafs representation but the fate of these flows remains uncertain yet a complete analysis of p recovery and recycling from waste is provided by senthilkumar et al 2014 this study was conducted at the national scale so it is difficult to convert it to local food waste management considerations application of the literature values on p content in bottom ash in france aouad et al 2006 gives a total production of 0 24 kgp cap y for paris megacity as compared to 0 31 kgp cap y in our calculations n can unfortunately not be measured after combustion since it eventually goes back to the atmosphere as n2 n and p excretion values based on afssa 2009 ingestion data are compatible with literature values on the excretions of westerners friedler et al 2013 with a 4 difference on n values but a higher 25 difference on p values finally data on wastewater seem to be the most reliable since n and p are actually measured by wastewater operators as monitoring variables uncertainties on the values of losses in the sewer network are the most difficult to estimate dry and wet weather losses are given by the sanitation master plan of the siaap area but it is by nature very difficult to estimate the losses that are not known by the wastewater authorities in particular two sources of losses have not been taken into account in these calculations ground infiltration of n and p from leaking sewers and discharges by the smallest sewers however the good correlation between n and p originating from human excretion and n and p arriving at the wastewater treatment plant tends to confirm that estimated losses by the sewer network of paris megacity are acceptable interannual variability of quantities of n per capita received by the siaap in recent years is quite low 5 and 2013 is in the middle of this variability range the decrease of p values is known to stem from the limitation of p use in detergent and confirms the validity of the measured values as a whole the data used in this study come from a variety of sources with some more reliable than others and according to courtonne et al 2015 can be classified as such water quality measurements official statistics available for the long term e g agricultural data n and p content coefficient recent declaration based statistics e g biowastes 4 2 the main characteristics of the water agro food socioecological regime of paris megacity 4 2 1 a minimized local imprint on paris megacity area the local imprint calculated through the discharge of n and p on paris megacity area is minimized by intensive treatment units p in incinerated food waste ash is stabilized in construction materials and food waste n mainly goes back to the atmosphere as harmless n2 less than 20 of the p excreted by human metabolism ends up in the seine which is compatible with international regulations applied to the seine given the population of paris megacity it still represents an imprint in absolute figures of 1 3 106 kgp losses per year n releases from the wastewater system account for 38 of human excreted n although its main form is nitrate which does not contribute to major local disruptions in the seine inside paris megacity n released as ammonium and nitrites are still at high levels compared to the expected level for good ecological potential romero et al 2016 as required by the wfd the wastewater authorities of paris megacity are currently undertaking or scheduling complementary intensive pollution mitigation works the seine in the paris city center only has a monthly minimum flow with a 5 year return period of 94 m3 s driee if 2014 which leaves only 830 l cap day of dilution capacity the wfd threshold of 0 5 mgnh4 l in the seine river thus requires at least 98 efficiency in reduced n removal despite reaching the limits of the technical feasibility of centralized wastewater treatment ammonium concentrations in the river should be lowered in the coming years to values compatible with the wfd on the other hand nitrite concentrations remain an issue even with advanced wastewater treatment the compatibility of the centralized environmental impact of treated water discharge with the preservation of the local environment remains an issue in a megacity the expected decrease of the seine river flow in the coming years due to climate change will challenge this paradigm even more moreover two main forms of n release have an imprint at a larger scale than paris megacity area more than 20 106 kgn annual export of n to the estuary mainly in the form of nitrates and about 400 ktco2eq annual n2o emissions from the wastewater treatment plants 4 2 2 poor reuse of nitrogen and intermediate reuse of phosphorus urban reuse of n and p flows is assessed by their recovery rates the n cycle is the most extreme in terms of linear management since only 3 of the n entering the city 7 3 kgn cap y goes back to the agro food system 0 2 kgn cap y whereas the agricultural production system requires about 570 of the n 37 4 kgn cap y that is eventually supplied as food 6 6 kgn cap y the fate of p is more contrasted first bone collection and other agro industrial waste reuse enable recycling 75 of p senthilkumar et al 2014 second the overall recycling rate of the wastewater system is only 41 and urban food waste recycling is negligible thus 70 of the p of urban food 0 79 kgp cap y ends up unrecovered in clinker 0 48 kgp cap y or water discharges 0 08 kgp cap y sewage sludge recycling is quite problematic for paris megacity low acceptance of sewage sludge by farmers and limitations on the use of sewage sludge in agriculture lead paris megacity to export its sludges relatively long distances around 200 km for direct sludge spreading and 300 km for sludge composting with half of the sewage sludge of paris megacity being incinerated these figures would probably be higher if sludge spreading was chosen for the whole megacity the geographic spread of food supply and urban residue reuse appears dissymmetrical there is a political commitment not to exceed 200 km for the spreading of sewage sludge cf public debate on achères wastewater treatment plant in 2007 e g question answer no 80 http cpdp debatpublic fr cpdp seineaval participer reponses questionsdcfd html id 4 whereas the agro food system of paris megacity is based on 2 7 105 ha of soybean cultivation in south america and 5 105 ha of intensive livestock farming in the great west mostly located more than 300 km from the paris city center this effect is exacerbated by the high concentration of more than 10 million people it is also worth noting that most food waste recycling processes documented by ordif 2014 in the ile de france region concern periurban areas located outside paris megacity the scale of paris megacity most probably contributes to the implementation of processes poorly connected to agricultural recycling also in food waste management our regionalized approach also makes it possible to calculate the amount of n and p that is recycled through sewage sludge spreading or composting on agricultural lands that supply food to paris megacity an effective nutrient recycling loop this figure is totally negligible for n given the low amount of n in sewage sludges for p the figure also remains very low and we estimate that 0 03 of the total vegetal p ingested by the inhabitants of paris megacity comes from effective recycling of excreted p around 80 of the recycled sludges are effectively spread on the paris central basin that supplies paris megacity with vegetal food but this region is largely dedicated to the export of cereals so the recycled p of paris megacity is mostly exported assuming that three quarters of the daily ingestion of 100 g of bread per person per day afssa 2009 is in the form of the baguette we can still estimate that on average the p of 1000 daily baguettes ingested by the inhabitants of paris megacity out of more than 3 million comes from direct recycling of the p contained in their urine and feces 4 2 3 the externalized imprint of paris megacity with the environmental imprint of paris megacity becoming less and less significant on the urban area itself paris megacity has nearly completely externalized the environmental imprint of human metabolism on agricultural lands it makes it largely invisible for urban dwellers seldom conscious that pollution in south america or in the great west is directly related to their consumption of food as stated above the food supply of paris megacity is supported by four areas characterized by four distinct metabolisms for its vegetal food supply paris megacity is almost only provided by a close hinterland specialized in crop production for its animal food supply paris megacity relies on two quite different systems namely the great west characterized by intensive livestock farming and importing large amounts of feed from south america and a more diffuse area of mixed crop and livestock farming when looking only at the absolute figures the imprint of the vegetal product supply to paris is much lower than the impact of the intensive livestock farming coupled with its south american feed supplier s area which is itself similar to that of the mixed crop and livestock farming areas however when compared with the corresponding surface area involved the figures of nutrient losses per hectare show a different picture where the large mixed crop and livestock farming areas are characterized by much more diluted losses than the intensive livestock farming area and even than the specialized crop farming area with lower impact on hydrosystems for instance the n leaching reaches 37 kgn ha y in the intensive livestock farming area compared to 30 kgn ha y in the specialized crop farming area and 12 kgn ha y in the mixed crop and livestock farming area the p erosion expressed per hectare is 4 5 2 4 and 1 0 kgp ha y in the specialized crop farming the intensive livestock farming and the mixed crop and livestock farming system respectively accordingly although the environmental imprint of paris megacity appears to be strong on the mixed farming system we believe that the dilution of the calculated values over a large surface area leads to the least impact on the surrounding agro ecosystem this externalized imprint of paris megacity can also be noted on the quality of water resources for the drinking water supply a large number of wells are being de commissioned in france with about one public well closed every week due to n contamination particularly in ile de france ministère de la santé 2012 most bodies of groundwater around paris and in the central paris basin appear in the 2015 seine river basin management plan to have a poor chemical status mainly because of their high concentration in nitrate on the other hand paris megacity mainly relies on treated surface water less contaminated by nitrates for its water supply 4 2 4 the central issue of human metabolism as mentioned above human metabolism appears to be the key element around which the whole water agro food system is organized since ingestion of food and the resulting excretion are one of the core vital drivers of sustaining human life the intensity of the megacity s socioecological regime depends enormously on the human diet two thirds of the ingested n and p come from animal products but they account for more than 90 of n and p agricultural inputs and more than 95 of surfaces dedicated to food production depending on the diet of an inhabitant of paris megacity the contribution of each subsystem to the global imprint can be significantly different for example n leaching from crop farming lands is 0 4 kgn cap y whereas n discharge in water from the wastewater management is 1 9 kgn cap y it means that the n imprint on water bodies of a paris megacity inhabitant following a vegan diet could be higher at the wastewater treatment plant than on the agricultural lands feeding him the total amount of ingested n and p is also an important characteristic that impacts all subsystems of the water agro food system compared to the needs of n ingestion of 3 3 kgn cap y who et al 2007 paris megacity s mean diet currently contains 150 of this level 4 3 changes in the imprint of human metabolism in paris megacity the description provided above of the current environmental imprint of the human metabolism in paris megacity can trigger the conception of possible optimization paths toward a more sustainable food supply and waste management 4 3 1 possible optimization paths according to our analysis agriculture through resource consumption and nutrient release to the hydrosphere and the atmosphere produces by far the largest imprint of urban metabolism compared to waste and wastewater management yet since the late 1980s considerable effort has been expended to optimize agricultural practices and fertilizer use in the scope of what is called reasoned agriculture this effort has succeeded in stabilizing agricultural n pollution to a level that is however still incompatible with good ecological status of most water bodies passy et al 2016 romero et al 2016 not only because of the slow response of long residence time soil and aquifers nutrient pools but also because of the unavoidable losses generated by intensive and specialized chemical agriculture billen et al 2016 it is clear therefore that deep structural changes of the agro food system beyond the mere optimization of agricultural practices will be necessary to further reduce the environmental imprint of paris megacity food supply one of the most striking characteristics of the current agricultural system supplying paris megacity is its spatial specialization into either crop farming or livestock farming areas with very few connections between them le noë et al 2016 inverting this specialization trend and reconnecting crop and livestock farming is likely to be the best option for reducing agricultural nutrient pollution lemaire et al 2014 bonaudo et al 2014 garnier et al 2016 billen et al 2016 exploring scenarios several studies at the regional and global scale have demonstrated that a reduction in animal protein in the diet while reconnecting crop and livestock production would clearly reduce ground and surface water nitrate contamination major changes that are compatible with organic farming billen et al 2015 garnier et al 2016 lassaletta et al 2016 the present study also showed that by far the largest imprint of paris megacity food supply is related to livestock breeding rather than to vegetal production this implies that any reduction of the proportion of animal products in the human diet as advocated by the 2009 barsac declaration http www nine esf org barsac declaration would have a tremendous lever effect on the agricultural imprint lowering the total quantity of ingested proteins is also not only possible but recommended by french health authorities haut comité de la santé publique 2000 it would trigger a decrease in the intensity of the imprint of paris megacity on agricultural land as well as for the wastewater treatment if the current population increase of approximately 0 5 per year continues reducing by half the excess in the total quantity of proteins ingested with respect to official recommendations would make current wastewater treatment plants compatible with the development of paris megacity for the next 35 years food waste management should be substantially optimized in the coming years two recent laws address biowaste management in france i the above mentioned legislation on large biowaste producers section 2 3 2 since the beginning of 2016 all producers of more than 10 tons on biowaste per year e g a canteen serving 300 people per day are required to specifically reuse their biowaste ii the law on energetic transition loi n 2015 992 du 17 août 2015 relative à la transition énergétique pour la croissance verte this law requires that waste management public services should enable all citizens to reuse their biowaste by 2025 art 70 v i 4 in this perspective experimental collection of biowaste has started in 2017 for 157 000 inhabitants of the paris city center unfortunately these laws are mainly carbon oriented and do not point to n and p recovery as an important issue the future trajectory of food waste n and p in paris megacity will then depend not only on the effective application of these laws but also on the actual implication on n and p in the general concept of biowaste reuse concerning n and p in wastewater this study reveals that n management has not been considered in terms of its imprint and reuse of p is limited no legislation in france mentions resource recovery of n and p in wastewater and the sustainable development goals adopted by the united nations in 2015 on sanitation do not mention any stake of resource recycling since 1 january 2016 switzerland is reported to be the first country in the world to have made p recycling from sewage sludge mandatory http www phosphorusplatform eu platform news 1061 switzerland makes phosphorus recycling obligatory in countries with a nutrient deficit in soils the potential for using human waste especially excreta has been shown to be high e g in uganda lederer et al 2015 in developed countries many studies have explored the possibility of evolving wastewater management through source separation of human excreta or changes at the wastewater treatment plant villarroel walker et al 2014 wilsenach et al 2003 larsen and lienert 2007 some european districts have already implemented source separation of human excreta see e g the case studies by the sustainable sanitation alliance www susana org en resources case studies for instance urine separation has specifically been studied at the scale of france paris megacity and in paris saclay a new district of paris megacity although already implemented in paris at the beginning of the 19th century reintroducing urine source separation requires the implementation of french pilot projects to test the possibility of its larger scale and longer term development caby 2013 besson et al 2015 crolais et al 2016 4 3 2 the limits to minimizing the imprint of paris megacity this study shows that there is considerable room for improvement in minimizing the biogeochemical imprint of paris megacity nevertheless it has to be kept in mind that our approach based on n and p flows is necessarily limited in its findings describing the water agro food system of paris megacity solely through n and p flows leaves aside many other aspects of this system water consumption greenhouse gas emissions energy requirements sanitary issues etc moreover accounting for flows in terms of n and p does not take into consideration the specific form in which n and p are embedded and the constraints related to the management of these flows fertilizers manure food food waste human excreta etc nonetheless given the importance of the stake of proper management of n and p in terms of both resource management and environmental disruptions the low efficiency of water agro food system of paris megacity remains striking urban and agricultural n and p management appears mostly disconnected which reflects disconnected sectorial policies of food production waste and wastewater management efficient n and p management of the water agro food system of paris megacity appears to be a neglected part of the equation and this study highlights this point as stated by rosemarin 2010 for p and sutton et al 2011 for n the importance of correct management of n and p flows is currently an outcome of the research led by the scientific community but awareness and transposition into policies is not yet fully effective although several improvements are on going as stated in section 4 3 1 an integrative analysis appears useful for supporting decision making and integrating social health and economic issues into the urban rural metabolism framework kennedy et al 2011 much is still expected from the agricultural sector to reduce n s environmental impact on water contamination despite the implementation of a number of agricultural practice measures reduction of fertilization implantation of grassed strips and catch crops etc that at best have stabilized nitrate concentrations concerning p although its application as a fertilizer has been reduced its content in soils is still high and requires avoiding its losses to the environment e g by limiting erosion the improvement of urban residue management requires shifting waste and wastewater treatment into a paradigm of integrated resource management for this purpose wilsenach et al 2003 conclude that dilution is never a solution advocating source separation of flows if its implementation is partly on its way for solid waste implementation of wastewater source separation in paris megacity implies more fundamental changes in the design of houses and the sewerage system its large scale deployment can only be considered over the long term and constitutes a major obstacle to short term improvement of the imprint of paris megacity eventually minimizing the imprint of paris megacity requires forging an integrated nutrient policy linking agricultural and urban policies if this process seems to be on its way in some countries see e g sru 2015 france and paris megacity currently lack an integrated n and p policy the development of such a policy will be a crucial step to make the imprint of paris megacity compatible with the stakes of n and p resource availability and of their environmental impact 5 conclusion this case study highlights the particularities of megacities in terms of their water agro food socioecological regime megacities attract huge amounts of nutrients but paradoxically they are not at present able to return them to agricultural systems an option that was hotly debated during the 19th century when urban waste and wastewater management was founded barles 2005 in developed countries these megacities limit their local n and p impact using technological solutions this paradigm is embedded in the linear metabolism that characterizes the industrialized and post industrialized societies to which they contribute resulting in the externalization of the urban biogeochemical imprint these characteristics are particularly well illustrated in paris megacity most of the environmental impacts that concern the local scale are managed within a paradigm of pollution treatment in incineration plants and wastewater treatment plants but disconnected from resource management issues in the four main agricultural supply areas of paris megacity moreover given the respective size of paris megacity and the seine river centralized management of water pollution mitigation limits the capacity of paris megacity to have a sustainable environmental impact n and p management shows contrasted patterns the p imprint of paris megacity requires optimizing its efficiency in p use and minimizing soil storage soil erosion and losses in incineration ash which represents about seven times the p actually ingested urban n recycling conceals considerable room for improvement with a current recycling rate of 3 n release into the environment is a major concern mostly in agriculture but also in wastewater treatment with an overall imprint of nearly four times the n actually ingested the water agro food system of paris megacity for the most part is not in phase with the stakes of integrated n and p management the results reported herein call for the development of an integrated nutrient policy that would transcend the sectorial policies of agriculture as well as solid waste and wastewater management the global vision of the n and p imprint that we have developed could help pave the way for establishing socioecological trajectory scenarios that would improve the sustainability of paris megacity acknowledgments the

6565,megacities are facing a twofold challenge regarding resources i ensure their availability for a growing urban population and ii limit the impact of resource losses to the environment this paper focuses on two essential resources nitrogen and phosphorus and challenges their sustainable management in the water agro food system of paris megacity an in depth analysis of the nitrogen and phosphorus imprint of paris megacity was conducted originally centered on human metabolism through consumption and excretion of these two elements upstream the whole agricultural production that feeds paris megacity was scrutinized and nitrogen and phosphorus flows in the agro system were fully documented downstream the analysis of solid waste and wastewater management in paris megacity showed the fate of nitrogen and phosphorus imported into the city paris megacity appears to rely on a very complex and international agro food system requiring high levels of chemical fertilizers and strongly impacting the environment through nutrient environmental losses on the other hand solid waste and wastewater management appears to be mostly disconnected from the agro food system even if the release of nitrogen and phosphorus into the environment has largely decreased in recent years their recycling rate remains very low this overview of the water agro food system of paris megacity suggests that an optimal management of nitrogen and phosphorus in the three subsystems agriculture waste management and sanitation should be integrated within a comprehensive approach linking agriculture and urban residues this analysis thus constitutes a groundwork on which paradigm shift scenarios of the global water agro food system could be constructed keywords biogeochemical imprint water agro food system urban metabolism megacity nitrogen cycle phosphorus cycle 1 introduction born of a process of sociospatial specialization cities are characterized by the externalization of most of their metabolism the flows of material and energy necessary to sustain urban life and urban functioning and by their dependence upon various areas and ecosystems located outside their boundaries for both the supply of resources and the disposal of waste the industrial era has increased this dependence and remoteness to the point that the urban environmental impact is greater in these supply and emission areas than in the city itself barles 2015 today the imprint of urban environments can be found throughout the world billen et al 2012a and for every environmental compartment water being one of the most impacted cities dependence upon remote areas also questions their sustainability and their ability to face socioecological crises that could impact their metabolism as a whole climate change and extreme climate events change in geopolitical conditions economic crises etc more than other cities megacities are characterized by their huge need for material and energy kennedy et al 2015 among which food and water are of utmost importance for the life of their inhabitants megacities are not just bigger than most cities their large and diverse populations their spatial extension the amount and diversity of activities that characterize them the complexity of their functioning make the organization of megacities metabolism particularly delicate especially regarding food and water from the point of view of both supply and discharge through waste and wastewater these have a strong impact on biogeochemical cycles the characterization of this impact is a key to understanding megacities metabolism and to considering change in water and food management this makes it necessary to i identify the main biogeochemical flows in terms of socioecological relevance and to analyze the biogeochemical processes involved ii quantify these flows and iii locate them at the different stages of their circulation nitrogen n and phosphorus p can be considered as the most critical biogeochemical flows regarding their socioecological impact steffen et al 2015 put forward nine main control variables of the earth system and suggested planetary boundaries under which these control variables should stay to prevent major shifts in the regulation of the earth system s stability along with biosphere integrity n and p flows are considered to be in the highest risk zone ahead of the climate change control variable the concern about disruption of n and p cycles has been broadly studied and documented it is of particular significance in europe where the n cycle intensity is about fivetimes greater than the biospheric cycle leading to substantial negative damage from aquatic and terrestrial eutrophication to poor air quality and climate change sutton et al 2011 the environmental dispersion of p is also a matter of concern regarding fertilizer and therefore food production cordell 2010 phosphate rock has recently been added to the list of critical raw materials by the european commission european commission 2014 megacities play a major role in n and p flows and depend on them urban dwellers metabolism is embedded in a complex worldwide water agro food system resulting in an equally complex biogeochemical imprint some studies have provided an overview of urban metabolism through substance flow analysis regarding n or p svirejeva hopkins et al 2011 færge et al 2001 forkes 2007 barles 2007 or considered the impact of urban waste and or wastewater on the environment morée et al 2013 others have focused on the urban food print and show the relevance of a spatialized approach billen et al 2009 2012a b c chatzimpiros and barles 2013 however it seems important to entertain a broader view and to explore both the downstream and the upstream imprint of urban metabolism as demonstrated by schmid neset et al 2008 for p this approach contributes to characterizing the current socioecological regime fischer kowalski and haberl 2007 of megacities in this paper we therefore focus on paris megacity and the n and p flows involved in its food production supply consumption and discharge to determine the biogeochemical imprint of human metabolism in paris megacity its water agro food system has been divided into three subsystems i food production in the agricultural system that feeds paris megacity ii food waste management from production at the farm to the actual ingestion of food by humans and iii human excreta management in the city itself in each of these subsystems a detailed and regionalized analysis of n and p flows was conducted we aimed at qualitatively and quantitatively comprehending the stakes of the biogeochemical imprint for sustainable development of a megacity such as paris for the sake of this study we therefore characterized the imprint of paris megacity by the magnitude of the flows of resources here n and p required to sustain its food supply and the flows of wastes discharged into the environment as a consequence of food consumption we also determined the spatial distribution of these flows 2 material and methods as recommended in the early work by baccini and brunner 1991 the borders of our system are defined in this section as well as the key issues selected 2 1 spatial and temporal frame 2 1 1 spatial frame the urban agglomeration of paris is ranked the 25th largest city in the world by the united nations united nations 2014 it is the largest city of the european union and with a population of more than 10 million inhabitants it is classified as a megacity the definition of a city remains controversial and the setting of its boundaries can vary greatly depending on the definition adopted in this paper we choose to follow the french national institute of economic statistics and studies insee www insee fr definition of the urban unit the main characteristic of an urban unit is that the distance between two inhabited buildings does not exceed 200 m in this sense paris megacity is composed of 412 municipalities totaling 10 550 350 inhabitants in the official 2012 census and has a density of 3 700 cap km2 insee the term paris megacity will be used in this paper to refer to the paris urban unit paris megacity as an urban unit should be distinguished from three other perimeters that are also commonly used to define paris illustrated in table 1 and fig 1 i the paris city center this is the core municipality of paris megacity representing 21 of its population it is one of the densest city centers in the world with more than 21 000 cap km2 insee ii the paris urban area the insee definition adds to the paris urban unit the municipalities where at least 40 of the residents and working population work in the paris urban unit paris megacity accounts for 85 of the population of the paris urban area and is five times denser iii the ile de france region this is the administrative region in which paris megacity is included its population is about the same as the paris urban area but their respective perimeters differ slightly this study covers the metabolism of people who are actually inside paris megacity and the results are expressed in yearly averaged figures data from the population census commuting patterns tourism and business trips have been gathered from studies conducted by french public institutions insee authorities in charge of economy and tourism institut d aménagement et d urbanisme de la région ile de france they have been used to obtain the yearly average instantaneous number of people actually eating discarding waste and excreting urine and feces dwellers temporarily out of the city for holidays or work have been deducted pro rata temporis nondwellers coming to the city for tourism or work have been added pro rata temporis as stated the imprint of paris megacity largely exceeds its boundaries and each of the three subsystems studied covers a specific imprint zone that can sometimes overlap paris megacity lies within the seine river basin it is located 220 km upstream from the estuary where the seine river flows into the baie de seine seine bay as well as into the contiguous north west channel and southern bight of the north sea and is responsible for the development of harmful algal blooms causing severe damage to fish and shellfish populations lancelot et al 2007 passy et al 2013 2016 the seine river basin has therefore been classified as a sensitive area subject to eutrophication in the sense of the 1991 urban waste water treatment uwwt directive european council directive 91 271 eec the 2015 seine river basin management plan aims at reaching good ecological potential for 2021 as required by the european water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ce including reduction of n and p concentrations moreover the 1992 oslo paris convention required the seine river basin to halve its n and p flows to the sea between 1985 and 1995 the target on p has been reached but the flows of n show an opposite trend of 1 per year over the last 30 years aesn 2013 2 1 2 temporal frame in recent years the most significant changes in the water agro food system of paris megacity have been the works on wastewater treatment plants in order to comply with the uwwt directive this directive requests that the wastewater treatments withdraw 70 of the n and 80 of the p contained in the urban wastewater in sensitive areas subject to eutrophication this objective was first reached for paris megacity s main wastewater treatment system in 2012 cf the dedicated internet site of the french ministry of ecology for detailed information on the compliance with this directive on http assainissement developpement durable gouv fr therefore we chose to describe the imprint of paris megacity in 2012 however because of constraints related to the availability of data our analysis of the agro food system is based on figures from 2006 there has been no major shift in the agriculture since this period le noë et al 2017 2 2 the agro food system that feeds paris megacity evaluating the environmental imprint of paris megacity over its food supplying areas requires i quantifying paris megacity s consumption ii identifying the areas supplying food to paris megacity iii evaluating agricultural production and environmental losses from agriculture for each area contributing to the food supply of paris megacity and iv calculating the environmental imprint of paris megacity as the fraction of the environmental losses attributable to food supply of paris megacity in each contributing area 2 2 1 apparent food consumption availability data on the availability of food commodities based on the analysis of national accounts are provided by insee these data correspond to the apparent food consumption of the french population as a whole including wasted or discarded parts at the retail and domestic level we have considered that national data on food consumption can appropriately be applied to paris megacity as confirmed by more detailed inquiries on dietary habits in france afssa 2009 owing to a detailed compilation of the n and p content of each item from the insee nomenclature based on information from the ciqual and usda databases on food composition https pro anses fr tableciqual http ndb nal usda gov all data collected have been converted to tons of n per year tn y and tons of p per year tp y 2 2 2 agricultural trade the trade exchanges of agricultural products between french departments nuts3 in the european union geocode standard the administrative district between the municipality and the region were obtained from the french database sitram système d information sur le transport des marchandises http www statistiques developpement durable gouv fr sources methodes it annually identifies the transport of 50 categories of agricultural products between french departments by roads railways and navigable waterways as well as exchanges with foreign countries customs database automated software has been developed by silvestre et al 2015 for the analysis of these data le noë et al 2016 used it to establish a complete matrix of the flows of agricultural commodities exchanged between 33 french agricultural areas defined by groupings of departments based on the similarity of their agricultural system see fig 3 as well as foreign countries grouped into 12 macroregions lassaletta et al 2014 from these data the relative contribution of each of these 47 agricultural regions to the total ile de france food supply was calculated separately for vegetal and animal proteins we assumed that there was no significant typological difference between paris megacity s food supply and ile de france s food supply therefore the food supply of paris megacity was deduced by simple application of population ratios 2 2 3 agricultural production and environmental losses of supplying territories the grafs approach generalized representation of agro food systems first developed for n flows by billen et al 2014 then extended to p and c by le noë et al 2017 describes the agro food system of a given region by considering four main compartments exchanging n and p flows arable lands grasslands livestock biomass and local population the grafs approach makes it possible to draw direct links between different aspects of the hydro agro food system e g the relation between livestock breeding grassland areas and forage crops and the relation between fertilization of arable lands and grasslands and n environmental losses the grafs approach is based on a detailed budget of n and p flows including production transformation and consumption of animal and vegetal products inputs of n and p fertilizers atmospheric n and p deposition symbiotic n2 fixation p embedded in feed additives leaching and erosion in each agricultural region the agricultural and livestock production arable land and grassland surface areas were obtained from the french database agreste www agreste agriculture gouv fr at the scale of french departments nuts3 and from the fao data base www faostat fao org for foreign countries they are converted into n or p flows based on coefficients compiled from various sources fao usda databases lassaletta et al 2014 fertilizer application rates were obtained by the unifa union des industries de la fertilisation which provides detailed data at the regional administrative scale http www unifa fr le marche en chiffres la fertilisation en france html the grafs approach expresses the n and p budgets on both arable land and grassland yet n and p have very different behaviors in soil n tends to be easily leached after its conversion into nitrate by nitrifying micro organisms while p is strongly sorbed onto soil particles as a consequence the environmental losses associated with these elements differ and budgets need to be calculated separately to integrate these specificities for n nitrate leaching generates water pollution the n soil surplus is represented by the difference between n inputs to the soil through fertilizer and manure application symbiotic n fixation by legumes and atmospheric deposition and n export with harvested products about 70 of the n surplus of arable land is leached to sub surface runoff or aquifers while a much lower fraction is leached from grassland billen et al 2013a b in the case of p erosion is the major output flux accounting for p environmental losses p erosion from grasslands and arable lands is estimated from the soil p content cartography established for france by delmas et al 2015 and the erosion rates for arable lands and grasslands proposed by cerdan et al 2010 the p soil balance the difference between fertilizer and manure inputs atmospheric deposition and export with harvested products and erosion informs on the accumulation or depletion trend of the p stock in the soils garnier et al 2015 another discrepancy between n and p budgets rely in the gap of the n p ratio of vegetal and animal biomass and as a consequence the need for p feed additives to sustain the livestock production in the present study the feed additives were deduced as the unmet needs of p by the ingestion of vegetal products 2 2 4 evaluation of ile de france s environmental imprint over its supply areas the relative contribution to the total import to ile de france of either vegetal or animal proteins as calculated from the sitram database is used as an index for calculating the imprint in terms of agricultural area in each region by considering their main orientation into either crop or livestock production the environmental imprint of ile de france was calculated only over regions that contribute to more than 1 of ile de france vegetal or animal supply we thus define the imprint of crop production of a given region as the total resource consumption and environmental losses attributable to the portion of crop dedicated to vegetal food supply to ile de france this may include some of the resources and environmental losses associated with livestock farming in so far as manure is used for crop production conversely the imprint of meat and milk production is calculated by considering all resources and pollution associated with livestock farming including those linked to crop production dedicated to animal feeding without double counting the details of these calculations are provided in le noë et al 2017 in some cases animal husbandry is based on imported feed such as soybean or oil seed cakes as a consequence n and p imports embedded in animal feed need to be accounted for in ile de france s environmental imprint this is particularly true for regions depending on massive import of animal feed from south america brazil paraguay uruguay argentina and bolivia accordingly the environmental imprint ofsouth america vegetal production has been calculated and the share of this production imported to the regions of intensive livestock farming supplying ile de france has been included in the environmental imprint of ile de france 2 3 solid food waste generation and management 2 3 1 food waste generation food waste appears at all stages of the food supply chain transformation transport and storage distribution and consumption by far the largest amount concerns the transformation of animal products particularly slaughtering and cutting activities taking into account the cutting balance available for each type of livestock benhalima et al 2015 as well as the n and p composition of each fraction ciqual usda mello et al 1978 ternouth 1990 little 1984 waste generation as blood viscera grease bones etc associated with edible meat production can be evaluated food waste generated at the latest stages of the supply chain can be evaluated by direct comparison of the above mentioned data on food availability provided by insee with the data on actual food consumption given by a national detailed inquiry organized in 2006 2007 by the agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l alimentation de l environnement et du travail www anses fr which provides detailed information on the actual ingestion of food commodities afssa 2009 using again the n and p content given by the ciqual and usda databases on food composition the direct comparison of food availability and food ingestion has been made possible and losses of n and p at the latest stages of the supply chain have been evaluated by subtraction 2 3 2 food waste management n and p flows of food waste management were evaluated by compiling data related to food waste collection and treatment national data on food waste production and collection are provided by surveys conducted by the french environment energy management agency ademe www ademe fr a 2007 campaign characterizing domestic and economic refuse ademe 2010 and a 2008 survey of food waste management at the household level ademe 2008 the former study estimates that 75 of the collected food wastecomes from households the latter study is only semiquantitative so several hypotheses regarding actual flows of food waste being managed on site had to be considered a proportion of 10 of household food waste was assumed to be managed on site in paris megacity the obligation of biowaste source separation by the largest producers is very recent and the circular that specifies these obligations dates from 2012 circulaire du 10 janvier 2012 relative aux modalités d application de l obligation de tri à la source des biodéchets par les gros producteurs article l 541 21 1 du code de l environnement nor devp1131009c given the temporal frame used herein we consider that only two biowaste source separations are implemented by the largest producers oil separation in which n and p contents are considered negligible and bone collection from slaughterhouses and butchers for the latter we considered that 5 10 of bones were not collected although some bone collection and animal processing takes place inside the city mostly within butchers we have considered slaughterhouses and butchers as a whole and excluded them from the perimeter of urban economic activities management of biowaste by economic activities and the rungis international market were evaluated by a local survey conducted by the french ministry in charge of food and agriculture driaaf 2012 food waste treatment data were collected locally the ile de france region waste management observatory ordif www ordif com has produced a survey of waste treatment facilities in the ile de france region ordif 2014 that distinguishes waste treatment for paris megacity and waste treatment of the other ile de france municipalities paris megacity has one major waste treatment authority the joint central household waste treatment authority for the agglomeration of paris syctom http www syctom paris fr it covers the densest zones of paris megacity and serves 54 of the population of paris megacity fig 2 syctom is in charge of the treatment of waste and does not receive any separate collection of food waste all food waste treated by the syctom currently goes into three incineration plants located close to the paris city center in ivry sur seine issy les moulineaux and saint ouen there are 14 other incineration plants that receive the waste of paris megacity data on waste composition and waste treatment from the syctom were analyzed in their annual activity reports and exploitation data syctom data personal communication and extrapolated to paris megacity 2 4 wastewater management in paris megacity the final stage of our n and p imprint analysis stems from human metabolism food transformation in the body and the fate of its by products mostly as urine and feces directed to the sewers of paris megacity detailed calculations are presented in supplementary material 2 4 1 flows of n and p outside wastewater collection three types of losses were considered before release of n and p in sewers i human by products of metabolism that are not in the form of urine and feces these by products can take three forms integumentary and accidental losses sweat hair menstruation bleeding etc breathing and n and p stocked in the body sutton et al 2000 estimated that n volatilization related to sweat excretion accounts for 14 gn cap y i e about 0 3 of n excretion through urine and feces and less than 0 1 of n loss through breathing taking into account that many integumentary losses reach the sewers through showering or clothes washing a general value of 0 5 metabolized n and p not reaching the sewers was taken into account for breathing and integumentary losses n stock in the human body is estimated at less than 0 5 of total n ingested during an individual s lifetime p is mostly stocked in bones and is not negligible we assume a 1 p content in the human body for a mean weight of 70 kg insee thus 0 7 kgp total stock in the body ii excretions by children strictly under 3 years of age they were excluded from the calculation given that the intensity of their metabolism is very limited and excretions are mostly directed to waste bins via diapers the flow of n and p of their excretions is estimated around 1 of the flow corresponding to the population of more than 3 years of age iii excretions of urine and feces that do not reach the sewer network these excretions mostly consist of on site sanitation systems adapted from lesavre 1995 2 of the population of paris megacity has been considered to use on site sanitation or open urination and defecation 2 4 2 flows of n p in wastewater the flows of n p in paris megacity wastewater were calculated on the basis of operational data provided by the siaap syndicat interdépartemental d assainissement de l agglomération parisienne www siaap fr the siaap is a public institution in charge of wastewater transport and treatment and it covers 85 of the population of paris megacity fig 2 the siaap operates six wastewater treatment plants including seine aval located on the municipality of achères 20 km to the northwest of the center of paris which treats the wastewater of 53 of the population of paris megacity about 35 other wastewater treatment plants treat the remaining 15 of the population of paris megacity see http assainissement developpement durable gouv fr for detailed information and their operational results do not significantly differ we thus extrapolated the results obtained on the basis of siaap operational data to the whole population of paris megacity we used siaap operational data between 2004 and 2014 siaap personal communication the year 2013 was selected for the results of the treatment plants because it was the first year when routine denitrification in achères was in full operation it was also considered representative in terms of rain events and collection efficiency discharges from the sewer network were calculated as the sum of dry weather discharges and rain weather discharges as combined sewer overflows these data were evaluated from the sanitation master plan of the siaap area approved in 2017 siaap personal communication n p discharges to the sewer network unrelated to human metabolism were calculated by the difference between metabolic inputs sewer discharges and treatment plant inputs food waste inflows were estimated on the basis of grey water composition deshayes 2015 friedler et al 2013 chaillou et al 2011 n and p discharge in rivers and n and p content in sewage sludge were calculated on the basis of siaap data n2 emissions were deduced by subtraction and n2o emissions were calculated from measurements taken at the achères wastewater treatment plant bollon et al 2016a 2016b and extrapolated to paris megacity siaap sludges are either incinerated or recycled in agriculture through direct spreading or composting sludge spreading plans were examined to quantify and localize n and p recycling on agricultural lands 3 results 3 1 the agro food system supplying paris megacity 3 1 1 food supplying areas the analysis of the transport matrix concerning the 33 french agricultural regions and foreign countries reveals strong spatial segregation between regions supplying vegetal or animal products to paris megacity five regions currently provide 80 of the paris megacity supply of vegetal proteins namely ile de france 55 champagne ardennes yonne 9 loire centrale 8 picardie 5 and eure et loir 4 those regions are highly specialized in field crop production le noë et al 2016 2017 and their production of animal proteins is negligible in view of their spatial distribution around paris megacity fig 3 the whole area is hereafter called the central paris basin and classified as a crop farming region the animal protein supply is much more dispersed 19 french regions contribute more than 1 each and together supply 55 of paris megacity animal proteins three of these regions bretagne loire aval and manche account for 32 of the paris megacity animal protein supply they are strongly specialized in intensive livestock production which depends on massive imports of animal feed from south america le noë et al 2016 2017 as those regions are spatially distributed in western france fig 3 the whole area is hereafter called the great west and is classified as an intensive livestock farming region on the other hand the 16 remaining regions total 23 of the animal protein supply they are much less specialized in one or another type of production but they occupy a larger agricultural area in addition the proportion of permanent grassland is largely equivalent to that of arable land these features characterize these regions as mixed crop and livestock farming we call the great east a territory formed by six regions loire amont grande lorraine cantal corrèze ain rhône isère drôme ardèche and bourgogne which supply 13 of paris megacity animal proteins furthermore various foreign countries contribute to the animal food supply fig 3 their local environmental imprint is not directly calculated because of the lack of information regarding the functioning of the agro food system and the uncertainties regarding their n and p environmental losses yet based on literature data billen et al 2014 we have classified foreign countries as being close to the intensive livestock farming or mixed crop and livestock farming typologies this allows us to estimate the share of animal proteins provided by intensive livestock farming regions or mixed crop and livestock farming regions fig 5 regarding imports of feed to the great west region from south america they represent 67 of the 302ktn y imported to france these imports are undoubtedly essential to support cattle breeding in the great west which satisfies about one third of paris megacity animal protein requirement hence south america takes a significant yet indirect part in the food supplying area of paris megacity that we define as a soybean cultivation area in summary our analysis reveals four distinct typical areas contributing to the paris megacity food supply each with its own agricultural system orientation these regions are i the central paris basin specialized in crop farming ii the great west with intensive livestock farming strongly dependent on iii south american countries as feed suppliers and iv the great east with mixed crop and livestock farming fig 4 a h 3 1 2 the agro food system of the supplying territories to gain better insight into the agricultural metabolism of each of the four types of territory supplying paris megacity we established the full grafs diagram of n and p flows across their agricultural systems fig 4a h the grafs representations highlight the fact that all regions use high inputs of synthetic n and p fertilizers this is especially true for the central paris basin region since there is no other significant source of n and p inputs to agricultural areas in the absence of livestock the very high crop production even leads to a negative p soil budget i e a depletion of p on cropland the very specialized great west region is characterized by a strong dependency on feed import low grassland area and intense n surplus from arable land the source of environmental losses in contrast the great east region is characterized by a large grassland area food and feed self sufficiency and smaller surplus on arable land finally south america is also defined by large grassland areas food and feed self sufficiency but shows a very export oriented metabolism since 58 of its vegetal production is traded internationally 3 1 3 environmental imprint of paris megacity food supply as stated above the imprint of paris megacity food consumption in each supplying area is defined as the resources consumed and the environmental nutrient losses which are attributable to the food supply of paris megacity table 2 summarizes the calculated imprints over the four main supplying areas which contribute 62 of the total protein supply of paris megacity overall this agricultural area is estimated at about 2 5 million ha of which approximately one third are grassland areas almost all located in the mixed crop and livestock farming area when these absolute numbers are reduced to the population of paris megacity it appears that 0 26 ha is required for this part of the food supply per inhabitant 62 of these only 0 011 ha less than 5 is dedicated to the supply of vegetal proteins the remaining being mostly devoted to meat and milk production the total nitrogen imprint of these agricultural activities across these areas is estimated to be a surplus of 114 ktn y with about one fourth of this surplus in grassland and a nh3 volatilization of 38 ktn y yet it is necessary to take into account that environmental consequences of the n surplus on arable land and on grasslands are significantly different on arable land about 70 of the n surplus ends up in the hydrosystem billen et al 2013a b in contrast n inputs contributing to the n surplus in grassland below a threshold of 100 kgn ha y keep accumulating in the soil organic matter pool billen et al 2013a b accordingly the surplus observed in grassland should not necessarily be viewed as a negative environmental impact as it accompanies the increase of the soil organic matter pool the p eroded from those areas feeding paris megacity is estimated to reach 3 2 ktp y with 95 derived from arable land however it is difficult to determine the amount of p reaching the surface water because eroded particles can accumulate in downhill and riparian sectors more specifically it appears that the mixed crop and livestock farming area is the most costly in terms of the surface required to feed paris as well as of n and p fertilizers and n surplus on arable land however this area is almost self sufficient since it requires low net imports of feed from other regions to sustain its livestock production in contrast the intensive livestock farming area imports a substantial amount of feed from south america making these two areas part of a same system with this in mind it appears that the environmental imprint of paris megacity is not so different for both systems and is higher in terms of p surplus on arable lands over the intensive livestock farming soybean cultivation regions to summarize fig 5 shows the main flows of n and p resources mobilized and or lost to the environment attributable to the animal and vegetal food supply of paris megacity 3 2 food waste flows in paris megacity 3 2 1 waste generation in the food transformation industry wastes are generated along the entire supply chain from agriculture production to the final urban consumer the largest proportion of these wastes concerns the meat slaughtering and cutting stage the transformation of living animals into edible products generates a huge amount of waste evaluated at 1 1 kgn per kgn in edible form for n and 8 2 kgp per kgp for p the very high level of waste generated in terms of p is related to the high p content of bones this represents a per capita production of slaughtering and cutting wastes for paris megacity of 3 9 kgn cap y and 0 8 kgp cap y respectively 3 2 2 food waste at the retail and consumer level the data on food commodity availability insee expressed in kgn cap y have been stable since 1990 after an overall increase of the values since the 1950s especially for animal products compared to these the food ingestion data collected by afssa 2009 show a per capita consumption approximately 35 lower when expressed in n or p this difference can be attributed to waste production between the retail and the final ingestion stage evaluation of these losses per food commodity group table 3 shows figures varying from 19 for cereals to 50 for fruits and vegetables in terms of n content overall this leads to a per capita domestic waste generation of 2 4 kgn cap y and 0 24 kgp cap y excluding bones 3 2 3 food waste management the n and p food waste flows in paris megacity are illustrated in fig 6 a and b apart from bone collection and other recovery of animal waste the main form of reuse is represented as on site food waste disposal by households according to ademe 2008 this on site disposal mainly takes the form of animal feeding pets and wild animals since excretions of urban animals are seldom recovered animal feeding ultimately adds to the environmental losses of n and p in the city composting food waste is a minor form of on site reuse it is of course more common in the parts with the lowest population density only about 100 collective composters were counted in the paris city center in 2012 www paris fr compost section we can therefore assume that less than 1 of household food waste is composted in paris megacity s densest areas however when food waste is composted it is used for garden food production in two cases out of three which therefore contributes to effective n and p recycling food production inside paris megacity is nevertheless considered negligible in the end more than 80 of food waste is collected by municipalities together with other residual waste whereas green waste from the garden is often collected separately only one waste treatment plant located in saint ouen l aumône receives source separated food waste and composts it in paris megacity ordif 2014 three other waste treatment plants in paris megacity carry out mechanical biological sorting of residual waste for composting or methanization however they receive less than 1 of the total paris megacity food waste production in fig 6a and b economic activities represent all places where food waste is handled out of the households markets supermarkets restaurants canteens bakeries etc except for activities leading to bone collection as specified in section 2 3 2 the rungis international market reportedly the largest market of agricultural products in the world performs food waste composting or methanization but this accounts for less than 1 of paris megacity food waste production except for collection of bones within butchers other economic activities mostly rely on mixed residual waste collection for food waste disposal finally incineration is the prevailing destination of paris megacity food waste it entails negligible releases of reactive n and p in the environment but it does not achieve any form of n p reuse n content in food waste turns back into the atmosphere as n2 p stays in the bottom ash and is stabilized in clinker clinker is mostly used as construction material which does not allow specific p reuse 3 3 wastewater flows in paris megacity compiled results of n p flows related to human metabolism and wastewater management are presented in fig 7 a and b apart from p stocking in bones n p ingestion overwhelmingly ends up in wastewater and 98 of it is collected by sewer networks the impact of commuting people is very small the balance is in favor of people coming daily to paris megacity to work with more than one third coming from outside the ile de france region but most of their n p excretion takes place at home and their final contribution to n p flows in paris megacity is around 1 the largest impact comes from the inhabitants of paris megacity leaving the city for holidays which on average accounts for 26 days per person per year i e 7 of paris megacity inhabitants are absent on a yearly basis tourists coming to paris megacity do not offset these departures and increase the population of paris megacity by only 4 in the end the population census in paris megacity is evaluated at 10 6 million inhabitants but only 9 8 million inhabitants over 3 years old actually excrete n p on this territory as an annual average direct dry weather discharges from the sewer network to rivers that are identified in the sanitation master plan of the siaap area are very low and account for only 25 000 population equivalents most losses occur during rain events from combined sewer overflows and are estimated to around 3 of total inputs the proportion of p collected in the sewers that is not related to excretion or food waste is much higher than for n mainly because of the use of p in detergents it accounts for 30 of the total collected phosphorus in 2013 i e 0 17 kgp cap y in the last 10 years this figure has been steadily decreasing by about 0 03 gp cap y due to bans of p in detergents it is expected to continue decreasing with a new limitation on p in dishwashers that will come into effect in 2017 by application of eu regulation no 259 2012 of the european parliament and of the council of 14 march 2012 total p discharge in the rivers represents 18 of total p entering the networks but only half of the sludge is directly spread on agricultural land or composted the other half is incinerated in various facilities and p is not recovered from incineration ashes n is mostly emitted from wastewater treatment plants in the form of gas predominantly n2 but also in small proportions in the form of n2o kampschreur et al 2009 reported a considerable range of uncertainty regarding n2o emissions in wastewater treatment plants varying from 0 05 to 25 of n load recent measurements at achères wastewater treatment plant lead to a 2 ratio n recycling to agriculture is negligible total n discharge in the river from the area s wastewater treatment plants respects the uwwt directive regulatory threshold of 30 but the effective global rate of n river discharge from the wastewater system is about 38 for a megacity like paris this means that the metabolic n of about 4 million people is discharged daily into the seine river in a reactive form mostly no3 3 4 overview of the nitrogen and phosphorus imprint of human metabolism in paris megacity the results on the biogeochemical imprint of human metabolism in paris megacity from all three subsystems of agro food production waste management and wastewater management are compiled and summarized in fig 8 a and b the imprint for other agricultural regions than the four supply areas studied was deduced by extrapolation considering the same characteristics for these regions as for their corresponding studied counterpart n and p loads to the wastewater management that are not directly related to food and excretion were also removed and subsequent flows proportionally recalculated they allow a general vision of this imprint that contributes to characterizing a socioecological regime fischer kowalski and haberl 2007 as discussed in section 4 2 4 discussion 4 1 quality of results and uncertainties the majority of the flow accounts are based on local data mostly provided by french administration surveys and inventories this method presents the advantage and the originality of providing an accurate overview of the biogeochemical imprint of human metabolism in paris megacity rather than a theoretical estimation of its imprint based on literature data this advantage is counterbalanced by two main drawbacks i the high dependence on the reliability of the locally available data and ii the low availability of results expressed in n and p content in local data the uncertainties concerning the grafs flows are extensively discussed in le noë et al 2017 in the present study the p imprint of paris megacity has been calculated on the basis of the n imprint by using of n p ratios it leads to a slightly unbalanced p budget showing a 21 38 gap between inputs and outputs on fig 5 and fig 8 regarding our n p flow calculations in the waste management subsystems their reliability is difficult to establish most data on food waste are given in kilograms of food waste but our approach is based on n and p to trace the actual nutrients contained in food necessary for human metabolism figures in kilograms of food waste are difficult to interpret given the variability of the moisture in food waste some of the collected studies take liquids into accounts and others exclude them moreover it is difficult to accurately analyze the composition of a trash bin and its specific content in food waste ademe 2010 syctom data all types of waste are usually mixed in residual waste bins and it is difficult to sort them again however syctom data enable the calculation of n and p content of a sample of collected waste bins and we found values of 1 9 kgn cap y and 0 35 kgp cap y if we consider that most n and p comes from food waste these values tend to show a correct estimation for n and p collected in waste bins data on p could not be cross checked with local analysis of bottom ash since this element is not measured on syctom ash calculated values of n and p losses between the slaughter cutting and packaging steps are taken into account in the grafs representation but the fate of these flows remains uncertain yet a complete analysis of p recovery and recycling from waste is provided by senthilkumar et al 2014 this study was conducted at the national scale so it is difficult to convert it to local food waste management considerations application of the literature values on p content in bottom ash in france aouad et al 2006 gives a total production of 0 24 kgp cap y for paris megacity as compared to 0 31 kgp cap y in our calculations n can unfortunately not be measured after combustion since it eventually goes back to the atmosphere as n2 n and p excretion values based on afssa 2009 ingestion data are compatible with literature values on the excretions of westerners friedler et al 2013 with a 4 difference on n values but a higher 25 difference on p values finally data on wastewater seem to be the most reliable since n and p are actually measured by wastewater operators as monitoring variables uncertainties on the values of losses in the sewer network are the most difficult to estimate dry and wet weather losses are given by the sanitation master plan of the siaap area but it is by nature very difficult to estimate the losses that are not known by the wastewater authorities in particular two sources of losses have not been taken into account in these calculations ground infiltration of n and p from leaking sewers and discharges by the smallest sewers however the good correlation between n and p originating from human excretion and n and p arriving at the wastewater treatment plant tends to confirm that estimated losses by the sewer network of paris megacity are acceptable interannual variability of quantities of n per capita received by the siaap in recent years is quite low 5 and 2013 is in the middle of this variability range the decrease of p values is known to stem from the limitation of p use in detergent and confirms the validity of the measured values as a whole the data used in this study come from a variety of sources with some more reliable than others and according to courtonne et al 2015 can be classified as such water quality measurements official statistics available for the long term e g agricultural data n and p content coefficient recent declaration based statistics e g biowastes 4 2 the main characteristics of the water agro food socioecological regime of paris megacity 4 2 1 a minimized local imprint on paris megacity area the local imprint calculated through the discharge of n and p on paris megacity area is minimized by intensive treatment units p in incinerated food waste ash is stabilized in construction materials and food waste n mainly goes back to the atmosphere as harmless n2 less than 20 of the p excreted by human metabolism ends up in the seine which is compatible with international regulations applied to the seine given the population of paris megacity it still represents an imprint in absolute figures of 1 3 106 kgp losses per year n releases from the wastewater system account for 38 of human excreted n although its main form is nitrate which does not contribute to major local disruptions in the seine inside paris megacity n released as ammonium and nitrites are still at high levels compared to the expected level for good ecological potential romero et al 2016 as required by the wfd the wastewater authorities of paris megacity are currently undertaking or scheduling complementary intensive pollution mitigation works the seine in the paris city center only has a monthly minimum flow with a 5 year return period of 94 m3 s driee if 2014 which leaves only 830 l cap day of dilution capacity the wfd threshold of 0 5 mgnh4 l in the seine river thus requires at least 98 efficiency in reduced n removal despite reaching the limits of the technical feasibility of centralized wastewater treatment ammonium concentrations in the river should be lowered in the coming years to values compatible with the wfd on the other hand nitrite concentrations remain an issue even with advanced wastewater treatment the compatibility of the centralized environmental impact of treated water discharge with the preservation of the local environment remains an issue in a megacity the expected decrease of the seine river flow in the coming years due to climate change will challenge this paradigm even more moreover two main forms of n release have an imprint at a larger scale than paris megacity area more than 20 106 kgn annual export of n to the estuary mainly in the form of nitrates and about 400 ktco2eq annual n2o emissions from the wastewater treatment plants 4 2 2 poor reuse of nitrogen and intermediate reuse of phosphorus urban reuse of n and p flows is assessed by their recovery rates the n cycle is the most extreme in terms of linear management since only 3 of the n entering the city 7 3 kgn cap y goes back to the agro food system 0 2 kgn cap y whereas the agricultural production system requires about 570 of the n 37 4 kgn cap y that is eventually supplied as food 6 6 kgn cap y the fate of p is more contrasted first bone collection and other agro industrial waste reuse enable recycling 75 of p senthilkumar et al 2014 second the overall recycling rate of the wastewater system is only 41 and urban food waste recycling is negligible thus 70 of the p of urban food 0 79 kgp cap y ends up unrecovered in clinker 0 48 kgp cap y or water discharges 0 08 kgp cap y sewage sludge recycling is quite problematic for paris megacity low acceptance of sewage sludge by farmers and limitations on the use of sewage sludge in agriculture lead paris megacity to export its sludges relatively long distances around 200 km for direct sludge spreading and 300 km for sludge composting with half of the sewage sludge of paris megacity being incinerated these figures would probably be higher if sludge spreading was chosen for the whole megacity the geographic spread of food supply and urban residue reuse appears dissymmetrical there is a political commitment not to exceed 200 km for the spreading of sewage sludge cf public debate on achères wastewater treatment plant in 2007 e g question answer no 80 http cpdp debatpublic fr cpdp seineaval participer reponses questionsdcfd html id 4 whereas the agro food system of paris megacity is based on 2 7 105 ha of soybean cultivation in south america and 5 105 ha of intensive livestock farming in the great west mostly located more than 300 km from the paris city center this effect is exacerbated by the high concentration of more than 10 million people it is also worth noting that most food waste recycling processes documented by ordif 2014 in the ile de france region concern periurban areas located outside paris megacity the scale of paris megacity most probably contributes to the implementation of processes poorly connected to agricultural recycling also in food waste management our regionalized approach also makes it possible to calculate the amount of n and p that is recycled through sewage sludge spreading or composting on agricultural lands that supply food to paris megacity an effective nutrient recycling loop this figure is totally negligible for n given the low amount of n in sewage sludges for p the figure also remains very low and we estimate that 0 03 of the total vegetal p ingested by the inhabitants of paris megacity comes from effective recycling of excreted p around 80 of the recycled sludges are effectively spread on the paris central basin that supplies paris megacity with vegetal food but this region is largely dedicated to the export of cereals so the recycled p of paris megacity is mostly exported assuming that three quarters of the daily ingestion of 100 g of bread per person per day afssa 2009 is in the form of the baguette we can still estimate that on average the p of 1000 daily baguettes ingested by the inhabitants of paris megacity out of more than 3 million comes from direct recycling of the p contained in their urine and feces 4 2 3 the externalized imprint of paris megacity with the environmental imprint of paris megacity becoming less and less significant on the urban area itself paris megacity has nearly completely externalized the environmental imprint of human metabolism on agricultural lands it makes it largely invisible for urban dwellers seldom conscious that pollution in south america or in the great west is directly related to their consumption of food as stated above the food supply of paris megacity is supported by four areas characterized by four distinct metabolisms for its vegetal food supply paris megacity is almost only provided by a close hinterland specialized in crop production for its animal food supply paris megacity relies on two quite different systems namely the great west characterized by intensive livestock farming and importing large amounts of feed from south america and a more diffuse area of mixed crop and livestock farming when looking only at the absolute figures the imprint of the vegetal product supply to paris is much lower than the impact of the intensive livestock farming coupled with its south american feed supplier s area which is itself similar to that of the mixed crop and livestock farming areas however when compared with the corresponding surface area involved the figures of nutrient losses per hectare show a different picture where the large mixed crop and livestock farming areas are characterized by much more diluted losses than the intensive livestock farming area and even than the specialized crop farming area with lower impact on hydrosystems for instance the n leaching reaches 37 kgn ha y in the intensive livestock farming area compared to 30 kgn ha y in the specialized crop farming area and 12 kgn ha y in the mixed crop and livestock farming area the p erosion expressed per hectare is 4 5 2 4 and 1 0 kgp ha y in the specialized crop farming the intensive livestock farming and the mixed crop and livestock farming system respectively accordingly although the environmental imprint of paris megacity appears to be strong on the mixed farming system we believe that the dilution of the calculated values over a large surface area leads to the least impact on the surrounding agro ecosystem this externalized imprint of paris megacity can also be noted on the quality of water resources for the drinking water supply a large number of wells are being de commissioned in france with about one public well closed every week due to n contamination particularly in ile de france ministère de la santé 2012 most bodies of groundwater around paris and in the central paris basin appear in the 2015 seine river basin management plan to have a poor chemical status mainly because of their high concentration in nitrate on the other hand paris megacity mainly relies on treated surface water less contaminated by nitrates for its water supply 4 2 4 the central issue of human metabolism as mentioned above human metabolism appears to be the key element around which the whole water agro food system is organized since ingestion of food and the resulting excretion are one of the core vital drivers of sustaining human life the intensity of the megacity s socioecological regime depends enormously on the human diet two thirds of the ingested n and p come from animal products but they account for more than 90 of n and p agricultural inputs and more than 95 of surfaces dedicated to food production depending on the diet of an inhabitant of paris megacity the contribution of each subsystem to the global imprint can be significantly different for example n leaching from crop farming lands is 0 4 kgn cap y whereas n discharge in water from the wastewater management is 1 9 kgn cap y it means that the n imprint on water bodies of a paris megacity inhabitant following a vegan diet could be higher at the wastewater treatment plant than on the agricultural lands feeding him the total amount of ingested n and p is also an important characteristic that impacts all subsystems of the water agro food system compared to the needs of n ingestion of 3 3 kgn cap y who et al 2007 paris megacity s mean diet currently contains 150 of this level 4 3 changes in the imprint of human metabolism in paris megacity the description provided above of the current environmental imprint of the human metabolism in paris megacity can trigger the conception of possible optimization paths toward a more sustainable food supply and waste management 4 3 1 possible optimization paths according to our analysis agriculture through resource consumption and nutrient release to the hydrosphere and the atmosphere produces by far the largest imprint of urban metabolism compared to waste and wastewater management yet since the late 1980s considerable effort has been expended to optimize agricultural practices and fertilizer use in the scope of what is called reasoned agriculture this effort has succeeded in stabilizing agricultural n pollution to a level that is however still incompatible with good ecological status of most water bodies passy et al 2016 romero et al 2016 not only because of the slow response of long residence time soil and aquifers nutrient pools but also because of the unavoidable losses generated by intensive and specialized chemical agriculture billen et al 2016 it is clear therefore that deep structural changes of the agro food system beyond the mere optimization of agricultural practices will be necessary to further reduce the environmental imprint of paris megacity food supply one of the most striking characteristics of the current agricultural system supplying paris megacity is its spatial specialization into either crop farming or livestock farming areas with very few connections between them le noë et al 2016 inverting this specialization trend and reconnecting crop and livestock farming is likely to be the best option for reducing agricultural nutrient pollution lemaire et al 2014 bonaudo et al 2014 garnier et al 2016 billen et al 2016 exploring scenarios several studies at the regional and global scale have demonstrated that a reduction in animal protein in the diet while reconnecting crop and livestock production would clearly reduce ground and surface water nitrate contamination major changes that are compatible with organic farming billen et al 2015 garnier et al 2016 lassaletta et al 2016 the present study also showed that by far the largest imprint of paris megacity food supply is related to livestock breeding rather than to vegetal production this implies that any reduction of the proportion of animal products in the human diet as advocated by the 2009 barsac declaration http www nine esf org barsac declaration would have a tremendous lever effect on the agricultural imprint lowering the total quantity of ingested proteins is also not only possible but recommended by french health authorities haut comité de la santé publique 2000 it would trigger a decrease in the intensity of the imprint of paris megacity on agricultural land as well as for the wastewater treatment if the current population increase of approximately 0 5 per year continues reducing by half the excess in the total quantity of proteins ingested with respect to official recommendations would make current wastewater treatment plants compatible with the development of paris megacity for the next 35 years food waste management should be substantially optimized in the coming years two recent laws address biowaste management in france i the above mentioned legislation on large biowaste producers section 2 3 2 since the beginning of 2016 all producers of more than 10 tons on biowaste per year e g a canteen serving 300 people per day are required to specifically reuse their biowaste ii the law on energetic transition loi n 2015 992 du 17 août 2015 relative à la transition énergétique pour la croissance verte this law requires that waste management public services should enable all citizens to reuse their biowaste by 2025 art 70 v i 4 in this perspective experimental collection of biowaste has started in 2017 for 157 000 inhabitants of the paris city center unfortunately these laws are mainly carbon oriented and do not point to n and p recovery as an important issue the future trajectory of food waste n and p in paris megacity will then depend not only on the effective application of these laws but also on the actual implication on n and p in the general concept of biowaste reuse concerning n and p in wastewater this study reveals that n management has not been considered in terms of its imprint and reuse of p is limited no legislation in france mentions resource recovery of n and p in wastewater and the sustainable development goals adopted by the united nations in 2015 on sanitation do not mention any stake of resource recycling since 1 january 2016 switzerland is reported to be the first country in the world to have made p recycling from sewage sludge mandatory http www phosphorusplatform eu platform news 1061 switzerland makes phosphorus recycling obligatory in countries with a nutrient deficit in soils the potential for using human waste especially excreta has been shown to be high e g in uganda lederer et al 2015 in developed countries many studies have explored the possibility of evolving wastewater management through source separation of human excreta or changes at the wastewater treatment plant villarroel walker et al 2014 wilsenach et al 2003 larsen and lienert 2007 some european districts have already implemented source separation of human excreta see e g the case studies by the sustainable sanitation alliance www susana org en resources case studies for instance urine separation has specifically been studied at the scale of france paris megacity and in paris saclay a new district of paris megacity although already implemented in paris at the beginning of the 19th century reintroducing urine source separation requires the implementation of french pilot projects to test the possibility of its larger scale and longer term development caby 2013 besson et al 2015 crolais et al 2016 4 3 2 the limits to minimizing the imprint of paris megacity this study shows that there is considerable room for improvement in minimizing the biogeochemical imprint of paris megacity nevertheless it has to be kept in mind that our approach based on n and p flows is necessarily limited in its findings describing the water agro food system of paris megacity solely through n and p flows leaves aside many other aspects of this system water consumption greenhouse gas emissions energy requirements sanitary issues etc moreover accounting for flows in terms of n and p does not take into consideration the specific form in which n and p are embedded and the constraints related to the management of these flows fertilizers manure food food waste human excreta etc nonetheless given the importance of the stake of proper management of n and p in terms of both resource management and environmental disruptions the low efficiency of water agro food system of paris megacity remains striking urban and agricultural n and p management appears mostly disconnected which reflects disconnected sectorial policies of food production waste and wastewater management efficient n and p management of the water agro food system of paris megacity appears to be a neglected part of the equation and this study highlights this point as stated by rosemarin 2010 for p and sutton et al 2011 for n the importance of correct management of n and p flows is currently an outcome of the research led by the scientific community but awareness and transposition into policies is not yet fully effective although several improvements are on going as stated in section 4 3 1 an integrative analysis appears useful for supporting decision making and integrating social health and economic issues into the urban rural metabolism framework kennedy et al 2011 much is still expected from the agricultural sector to reduce n s environmental impact on water contamination despite the implementation of a number of agricultural practice measures reduction of fertilization implantation of grassed strips and catch crops etc that at best have stabilized nitrate concentrations concerning p although its application as a fertilizer has been reduced its content in soils is still high and requires avoiding its losses to the environment e g by limiting erosion the improvement of urban residue management requires shifting waste and wastewater treatment into a paradigm of integrated resource management for this purpose wilsenach et al 2003 conclude that dilution is never a solution advocating source separation of flows if its implementation is partly on its way for solid waste implementation of wastewater source separation in paris megacity implies more fundamental changes in the design of houses and the sewerage system its large scale deployment can only be considered over the long term and constitutes a major obstacle to short term improvement of the imprint of paris megacity eventually minimizing the imprint of paris megacity requires forging an integrated nutrient policy linking agricultural and urban policies if this process seems to be on its way in some countries see e g sru 2015 france and paris megacity currently lack an integrated n and p policy the development of such a policy will be a crucial step to make the imprint of paris megacity compatible with the stakes of n and p resource availability and of their environmental impact 5 conclusion this case study highlights the particularities of megacities in terms of their water agro food socioecological regime megacities attract huge amounts of nutrients but paradoxically they are not at present able to return them to agricultural systems an option that was hotly debated during the 19th century when urban waste and wastewater management was founded barles 2005 in developed countries these megacities limit their local n and p impact using technological solutions this paradigm is embedded in the linear metabolism that characterizes the industrialized and post industrialized societies to which they contribute resulting in the externalization of the urban biogeochemical imprint these characteristics are particularly well illustrated in paris megacity most of the environmental impacts that concern the local scale are managed within a paradigm of pollution treatment in incineration plants and wastewater treatment plants but disconnected from resource management issues in the four main agricultural supply areas of paris megacity moreover given the respective size of paris megacity and the seine river centralized management of water pollution mitigation limits the capacity of paris megacity to have a sustainable environmental impact n and p management shows contrasted patterns the p imprint of paris megacity requires optimizing its efficiency in p use and minimizing soil storage soil erosion and losses in incineration ash which represents about seven times the p actually ingested urban n recycling conceals considerable room for improvement with a current recycling rate of 3 n release into the environment is a major concern mostly in agriculture but also in wastewater treatment with an overall imprint of nearly four times the n actually ingested the water agro food system of paris megacity for the most part is not in phase with the stakes of integrated n and p management the results reported herein call for the development of an integrated nutrient policy that would transcend the sectorial policies of agriculture as well as solid waste and wastewater management the global vision of the n and p imprint that we have developed could help pave the way for establishing socioecological trajectory scenarios that would improve the sustainability of paris megacity acknowledgments the

6566,an overview of the urban shallow groundwater dynamics in jakarta is provided the modifications to the water budget at the micro and mesoscale due to anthropogenic influences are described and the diffusive nature of the interaction analysed the scale of urbanisation 10 million residents in conjunction with the lack of infrastructure for water related services is seen to have fostered a dependency on the shallow groundwater resources and in turn led to a tangible impact on the groundwater domain which is difficult to quantify and study using short duration yet high temporal resolution groundwater level data collected at an urban site within jakarta two metrics are developed that can describe the daily variation in groundwater levels driven by the human interaction numerical models of varying complexity for the urban shallow groundwater dynamics are then used here by employing a process of gradually improving the model s physical description while performing parameter estimation based on the new metrics the study provides evidence of the role of the unsaturated zone in influencing the urban shallow groundwater dynamics we further identify jakarta s wastewater seepage as the crucial yet overlooked component of the urban cycle having direct implications for the region s water security the innovation of this study lies at the combination of high temporal resolution data with flexible modelling frameworks that can be developed to give insights into rapidly growing unstructured stressors on water resources in data poor mega cities from the developing world keywords groundwater dependency water supply coupled surface groundwater modelling jakarta 1 introduction water supply and wastewater management infrastructure are two key water related services that are integral to the urbanisation process while discrepancy in quality of water supply between wealthier and poor segment of the urban population is not uncommon in the growing urban conglomerations of the world lawrence et al 1998 weak governance alongside increased proportions of residents of large cities without access to these facilities can propagate dependency on unsustainable resource exploitation un habitat 2006 estimated that 970 million urban dwellers are without access to adequate water supply with the lack of access to clean surface water resources and other economic as well as non economic factors bakker et al 2008 barring adequate access for the poor households shallow groundwater gw exploitation often substitutes as the supply strategy to fill the gap further the quality of the water available is compromised by lack of sanitation infrastructure foster et al 1994 estimated that up to 90 of water supply in unsewered cities can end up as recharge for the groundwater in many cases carrying pollutants with them to the subsurface the world bank characterizes jakarta s water and sanitation sector as one of the weakest in asia world bank 2004 and in this paper we argue that the scale of interaction between the urban denizens and groundwater domain these circumstances has created necessitates treating the shallow groundwater domain as a coupled human environmental system with diffusive anthropogenic pressure section 2 elaborates the human component of this system and assesses the scale and nature of the groundwater dependency here via results derived from structured interviews and a brief survey of policies in relation to the water sector a schematic of the human and environmental components acting of the shallow groundwater is developed it is observed that while these components likely have a direct bearing on the management of the system linked to all three critical water related sectors i e water supply sewerage and flood protection the diffusive nature of the pressure is difficult to capture by traditional groundwater monitoring methods thus the second part of the paper sections 3 4 and 5 develops the concept of using high temporal frequency data with physically based modelling of the groundwater system as a possible approach to gain insight into the impact on the urban shallow groundwater regime section 3 describes a small duration yet high temporal frequency monitoring of groundwater levels in the vicinity of a river in central jakarta the data analysis from the monitoring becomes the basis for development of a simple conceptual gw model section 4 and sw gw models of increasing complexity section 5 which demonstrate the capability to derive information regarding the drivers shaping the behaviour of the system as well as insights into its physical characteristics that needs to be taken into account 2 groundwater dependency and risk in jakarta 2 1 urban water supply security perusahaan daerah air minum jakarta raya pam jaya is the government owned utility responsible for water supply in jakarta two private parties palyja for west jakarta and aetra air for east jakarta via a concession agreement with pam jaya are responsible for the production and distribution of clean water for the urban area with asian development bank funding the water supply network was expanded and reinforced significantly over the period of 2008 2012 adb 2013 however due to constraints in availability of raw water accelerated growth of the city and non revenue water loss issues the coverage of the water supply network is still inadequate and disproportionally affects poor households the piped water supply network of jakarta is estimated to only have coverage of 44 with average consumption of 150 l per person per day cmea 2011 among its 10 million resident population among these adb 2012 estimates that the urban poor make up only 10 15 of those with access to piped water thus the majority are served by a variety of informal arrangements such as water vendors and typically pay much higher prices per unit volume for poorer quality of water than wealthier consumers shirley 2002 in these circumstances the proliferation of wells and jet pumps for shallow groundwater access forms a lucrative option groundwater and wells fall under the jurisdiction of national government s ministry of mines which has no formal mandate to collaborate with pam jaya and as a result initial plans by the private concessionaires to disallow users from accessing private wells have not been implemented bakker 2007 open dug wells are still in use by poorer communities in the vicinity of the river s but borewells using jet pumps are common and typically extract water from 15 to 40 m below the surface to compare the cumulative cost of securing water supply from groundwater and water supply network we estimate the running cost of utilising both these sources the results of which are plotted in fig 1 here the running cost of groundwater extraction is calculated as a combination of electricity tariff rates applicable to poor and mid income range households nugroho et al 2005 and estimated cost of procuring and installing pumps for extracting water from up to 40 m depth based on market survey this can be then compared with the charges expected for installing a water supply connection and subscription source aetra 2007 bakker 2007 for similar consumption trends from the plot it can be seen that while for large per person per day consumption p d the cost effectiveness of a water connection is clear for low income and low consumption households the economic advantage in the long run is not significantly different although the initial investment required is higher non economic factors such as perception of the reliability of water supply serve as further disincentives for poorer households from securing a water connection bakker 2007 lists some of the disincentives relevant to these households as insecure tenure the need for flexibility of payment convenience status and high transaction costs associated with dealing with the formal water utilities like infrastructure costs to build storage because networked water supply is only intermittent line ups and time off work to pay bills for those without bank accounts and regular income fear of time required to deal with meter misreading and bill over charging we carried out structured surveys covering 110 mid to low income households in central jakarta to document the groundwater dependency for water supply created due to the above listed pressures the survey covered the neighbourhoods of kampung melayu bukit duri and kebon baru in the vicinity of the ciliwung river and the main results are documented in table 1 at least 16 of the households had more than one source of water supply with only 9 dependence on the water network for drinking water and 22 dependence on it for water for daily use in contrast 73 had access to wells for water and only 18 of the interviewed households reported no dependency on groundwater for drinking or daily use water typically abstraction from the aquifers and the associated drop in water table levels is associated with industry and agriculture exploiting the deeper confined aquifers this has also been observed for jakarta where exploitation of the deeper aquifer by industry has been linked land subsidence and seawater intrusion delinom 2011 schmidt et al 1990 however in this case the wide spread pumping of the unconfined aquifer even at its low volume per capita volume can have a large impact on the urban shallow groundwater regime studies in other regions foster and vairamoorthy 2013 foster and chilton 2003 howard 2002 have also suggested links between such diffusive exploitation and aquifer degradation 2 2 limited wastewater management and diffused pollution of shallow gw the degradation of the shallow groundwater aquifer is also linked to the lack of sanitation and wastewater management in the city historically wastewater has been treated as a private responsibility bakker 2006 consequently till the early 1970s jakarta had little to no off site wastewater treatment plant or sewerage system although new buildings are required to have on site treatment of wastewater a majority of the population depends on septic tanks or drainage of waste in open channel as means for wastewater management with the current sewer network covering only 2 of jakarta 80 of the household black and grey water is channelled to septic tanks cmea 2011 from where the liquid part either drains off to the river via open channels or infiltrates in the groundwater the septic tanks in operation are in many cases not maintained resulting in leakages and spread of contamination results from the survey table 1 reflect this trend of the 56 reporting having a septic tank only half of them recalled having had the septic tank cleaned or maintained in many cases this was recorded to have been done infrequently and a number of years ago howard 2002 states that in most developing cities the signature of infiltrating wastewater is initially masked by the falling water table levels however with estimated 60 80 of water from domestic use ending up as wastewater the volume contributed by this source to the shallow water aquifer can be potentially large component of the urban shallow groundwater regime further in the densely packed urban setting the borewells in most cases are located only a few meters from the septic tank providing macro pore paths for the wastewater to infiltrate into the shallow groundwater anecdotal evidence recorded during the survey suggests that due to cases of black and smelly water coming out from borewells mid income families are now either investing into developing deeper wells or turning towards the formal water supply network to secure better quality water 2 3 impact of the modifying urban shallow gw regime jakarta and its surrounding areas have undergone a rapid pace of urbanisation over the past 40 years the landuse change maps of fig 2 demonstrate this degree of change for the pre dominantly natural system of the 1970s rainfall recharge and river aquifer interaction were likely the dominant components of the shallow groundwater budget infiltration into the deeper aquifers in the urban area is expected to be a few magnitudes smaller due to the geology schmidt et al 1990 and is neglected at this stage with paving of large proportion of the land reducing natural recharge and channelization of the rivers these natural components can have been expected to be altered further the analysis of the previous sub sections suggests that additional human driven components have become important for the shallow groundwater regime stemming from the dependency on the shallow groundwater for providing good quality water and absorbing waste to visualise the modifications to the natural system propagated by these circumstances we invoke the concept of an urban dominated shallow groundwater regime the main components of this system are illustrated in fig 3 and consist of the two natural albeit modified components of rainfall recharge and river exchange and two anthropogenic components of shallow groundwater extraction and wastewater infiltration however both anthropogenic components are diffused over the surface and difficult to measure without an estimate of scale and magnitude comparable to the natural components their role in shaping the dynamics of this coupled human environmental system that has implication for management and infrastructure development planning is hard to establish in these circumstances the drying of wells table 1 40 and poor quality groundwater raises serious questions about water security and health of the urban poor and for the long term with all the three sectors water supply network sanitation sewerage systems alongside flood protection systems requiring development and in turn modifying the dynamics of the system itself identifying and prioritizing goals can be a challenge the traditionally acquired long term groundwater level records with low temporal resolution even if available are either too sparse or irrelevant to these densely populated urban sites with its diffusive loading on the environment without long term trends and or detailed spatial coverage these records are inadequate to enable the separation of the effects of the components influencing the system the urban shallow groundwater regime presents a number of unique challenges to incorporate into monitoring and modelling strategies the following sections attempt to take this forward 3 high temporal frequency monitoring of gw 3 1 urban site and associated shallow aquifer monitoring the site selected for monitoring is a dense low rise urban area in the middle of jakarta with the ciliwung river flowing through its centre fig 4 a highlights part of the urban footprint the population density at the site is estimated at 30 50 thousand people per square kilometre local administrative office personal communication an understanding of the local heterogeneity of the shallow aquifer layers was built via unstructured interviews with local well diggers supported by the anecdotal evidence of the exploitation of the shallow groundwater gathered through interviews reported in section 2 based on this the unconfined layer is generally expected to extend up to 30 m below ground level with the top 10 m having clay and silts as the dominant material below this sand with silt becomes the main constituent after the 20 m mark soft rock is also reported in the constituents core samples reported as part of a study for the ministry of public works for a deep tunnel engineering project near the study area jcp 2013 corroborated these findings field work for groundwater level monitoring was carried out in two phases public open wells of interest in the site were identified by a field campaign during the first phase from april 2012 to december 2012 water levels in 5 wells were recorded manually april to september on a weekly basis september to december bimonthly to create a record of seasonal variation under the second phase data loggers set to record water level and temperature data at 10 min intervals were deployed in 3 wells fig 4a from december 2012 to march 2013 the observed wells for the second high frequency monitoring a b and c are at a distance of 15 8 m 84 5 m and 236 1 m from the river centreline respectively both wells a and b are 10 m deep and primarily in the clay silt layer well c extends to the sand silt layer the 3 month period falls during the wet season of the region and includes flood events like that occurred in jakarta on the 17th of january 2013 which inundated large sections of the city in the data obtained from the 3 month period a clear diurnal oscillation pattern was observed in the wells being monitored to verify that the signal is not due to malfunction of the probe or subject to specific location of the wells during the first week of may 2013 a short term controlled monitoring was conducted over a dry period in wells close to and located in similar geology as wells a and c respectively 3 2 field data analysis the general pattern observed for the diurnal fluctuation in groundwater follows that of a decaying sinusoid fig 4b as reported in shaad et al 2014 drop in water levels spans from around 5 am until evening the drop is not smooth and contains a number of peaks and troughs at night the water level begins to recover the recovery segment of the curve is relatively smooth the recharge from rainfall and flooding appears to have a good superposition with this pattern to analyse the pattern two metrics are defined to describe the fluctuating behaviour for the daily values of the 3 wells for the 3 months the first metric head drop hd measures the lowering of head from 5am on a day point 1 to 5am the next day point 2 as a proxy for drop in water table in a single day the second metric recovery r measures the change in head from the lowest point between the points 1 and 2 and the head at point 2 fig 4b graphically depicts both metrics using sampled data from a dry period fig 5 plots the frequency distribution over 5 bin range of the two metrics for each of the wells under observation even with the rainfall recharge and flooding events acting as noise in the distribution curves distinct clusters emerge the range and values of the hd and r for wells a and b both of which are located in clay slit dominated layer are similar well a records much more noise which can be attributed to its closeness to the river and thus to a greater propensity to be influenced by its level variation and flooding the mean value of hd in the highest frequency bins is 0 103 m and 0 12 m for wells a and b respectively the range is roughly between 3 m and 1 8 m with extremes caused by flooding for well c going into the sand silt layer the range and values of hd and r is consistently lower than observed for the clay wells the range of hd here is 0 44 m to 0 13 m with the mean hd for the highest frequency bin being 0 03 m this is in agreement with the controlled monitoring done during the dry period for a well reaching the sand silt layer where mean hd of 0 034 m was recorded the variation of level is identical in form to one observed to be caused by evapotranspiration as proposed by white 1932 and expanded by gribovszki et al 2010 however no natural factors as identified by lundquist and cayan 2002 can be linked to the observed trend these include evaporation from bare soil and water bodies and evapotranspiration from vegetation during day time which cannot explain the fluctuation as the water table at the site is sufficiently low and vegetation occurs only in the form of small patches infiltration in losing reaches due to changes in temperature during a day which can affect the hydraulic conductivity and viscosity of water and thus can influence the infiltration from stream to groundwater is a trivial case at the tropics and finally the diurnal cycle of precipitation with early afternoon rain events is a feature of the local tropical climate wain 1994 but the fluctuation is observed even on dry periods and at sufficient distance from the river to disqualify diurnal cycle of precipitation as the agent responsible therefore in the absence of a natural forcing that can be identified to explain the oscillations anthropogenic causes seem to be the likely candidates responsible with no major industrial or agricultural area and related pumping facilities located in the vicinity of the site groundwater dependency per household explored in section 2 with its diffusive loading effects emerges as the possible hypothesis to explain the observations to explore this and determine the scale of influence on shallow groundwater system created by groundwater dependency models of incremental complexity described in sections 4 and 5 attempt to link the metrics defined for observed patterns to the schematic developed in section 2 3 by simulating the diffusive interaction using different model assumptions 4 an example of simple model to analyse gw dynamics 4 1 modelling a loaded beam analogy using modflow here a conceptual model of the system based on some simplifying assumptions is proposed to explore the concept of diffusive interaction as the agent responsible for observed fluctuation and system parameters that could allow for it due to the diffusive nature of the abstraction by household pumps and infiltration of wastewater instead of using point based forcing the loading on the groundwater system can be considered analogous to uniform loading of a cantilever beam with the river acting as the fixed end of this beam fig 6 based on the trend seen in the data acquired during monitoring groundwater abstraction is treated as a 12 h daytime process while wastewater infiltration is treated as a continuous 24 h process modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 is used to simulate this conceptual system the defined model is 300 m long with the river end defined as a fixed head boundary the other boundaries are treated as no flow modelled as a homogenous system the model has a single layer 10 m wide and capable of modelling a water table up to 30 m below the surface the water budget of this system is thus q rainfall q river q abstraction q wastewater infiltration δ v storage for dry periods qrainfall 0 the contributors from the natural components are functions of the properties of the unconfined layer specific yield sy and hydraulic conductivity k m s as well as the varying position of the water table under the uniform loading assumption the daytime loss qabstraction qwastewater infiltration can be expressed as a function of uniform abstraction rate α m s while night time wastewater infiltration can be expressed as a fraction φ of the uniform abstraction rate α this abstraction infiltration is applied over the entire domain using the recharge package of modflow 2005 4 2 parameter field exploration and results from the model setup it follows that four parameters sy k α φ control the behaviour of the model using an ensemble of model runs where the parameters are allowed to vary within a pre determined range trends of behaviour are derived the range for sy and k is taken from literature and set to vary from 3 to 13 and 1e 8 m s to 1e 4 m s respectively to represent silty clay to sandy silt dominated systems the magnitude of α is calculated from population density and mean head water consumption and is set to vary between 1e and 5 m s to 1e 7 m s values considered for φ are 0 10 20 40 and 60 a set of initial conditions generated by a steady state run from flat water table to pre stressed are tested for in the transient mode the model runs for 5 days with 12 h stress periods and 1 h time step from the cluster of model runs thus generated the oscillation descriptive metrics hd and r are extracted for the 4th day at 250 m from the fixed river head boundary and compared qualitatively with observed fluctuation dynamics the conceptual model is deliberately formulated as a drastic simplification of the real conditions with the aim to understand and separate the important aspects behind the processes observed the modelling results show that hd is found to be much more sensitive to specific yield then hydraulic conductivity fig 6a it suggests that although the river to groundwater infiltration over larger time scales may be the process primarily feeding the groundwater system it may not play a major role for the observed short term fluctuations tested against a range of abstraction values the variation observed for hd is higher when the specific yield of the material decreases fig 6b for higher yield regions the range is very small this suggests that for low yield aquifers where reasonable estimates of either specific yield or abstraction infiltration are available observed values of metric hd could hold some predictive value in identifying the missing information by means of inverse modelling for high yield aquifers this seems unlikely the model also suggests that a significant amount of grey and other wastewater act as a constant recharge source in the region fig 6c with φ 0 the fluctuation pattern could not be reproduced with any value for the other parameters r for this case remains below zero thus implying a water table dropping constantly the range of r in the plot are only indicative but suggests that non zero higher values of φ will be required to explain the magnitudes of recovery observed in the recorded data 5 example of coupled model for simulating sw gw dynamics the heterogeneity of the surface domain is under represented in gw models and cannot capture the dynamics of river flow and spatial variation to improve this representation here coupled sw gw models are considered that can be used to simulate the exchange processes and interaction of the aquifer with the river coupled sw gw models maybe able to better describe the spatial heterogeneity of the site but will be limited by the data requirement for developing and validating detailed models the following section attempts to develop such a coupled model following the same parameter field exploration strategy described in section 4 and incrementally increasing model complexity in this case however the model domain will be spatially consistent with the real site and developed on the basis of the generic coupling framework described in shaad 2015 with the oscillation pattern highlighting the drying and wetting fronts in the subsurface one of the key aims is to gauge the importance of accounting for flows through the variably saturated zone in the groundwater domain the ability of the models to reproduce observed conditions is evaluated against the mean values of the metrics defined in section 3 derived from the monitored data the two metrics provide an effective method of summarising the temporal dynamics in these conditions by isolating the diffusive interaction between the surface subsurface from the variation is river flow which the results in section 4 suggest to generally influences long term recharge patterns rather than the observed mean daily oscillations with both the wells a b in the clay layer exhibiting similar patterns essentially 2 sets of the metrics are available one pair for the clay layer wells and one for the sand layer well referred henceforth as hd and r of wells b and c respectively 5 1 2dmb modflow coupling the surface component of the coupled model is derived from the work presented in shaad et al 2015 and uses 2dmb shaad 2015 faeh 2007 a full 2d finite volume hydrodynamic solver applied to a high resolution digital terrain model of the urban site the first coupled model in section 5 2 uses a simpler 2dmb modflow 2005 couple with a single layer gw component to attempt to inverse model the parameters that allow a best fit for the metrics head drop and recovery at well locations b and c percentage deviation pd and pearson s correlation pc are used to measure the performance of the coupled model section 5 3 replaces gw component of the coupled model with one developed using modflow vsf thoms et al 2006 that describes the variably saturated groundwater flows by solving the 3d richard s equation the resulting 2dmb modflow vsf couple consists of a 5 layer gw component that can be expected to more effectively model the different layers of the unconfined aquifer and their wetting drying the surface is modelled for both the saturated and unsaturated setup at 4 m resolution for the parameter field exploration a constant inflow at 5 cumecs estimated as in bank flow for the river is applied section 5 3 extends this to a flood wave outflow for the surface is modelled with a weir at the downstream end and a constant friction is used for the surface domain with currently no structures to modify the flow the modflow 2005 component is a single layer model with 8 m horizontal and 30 m vertical resolution the horizontal resolution of the modflow vsf component is still similar to the saturated version set at 8 m cell size however in the vertical direction the 30 m shallow aquifer is divided into 5 layers the first three layers l1 to l3 are 2 m thick while l4 is 4 m thick together layers 1 to 4 are treated as the top clay silt layer l5 is 20 m thick and analogous to the sand soft rock layer forming the base of the shallow aquifer for the simulations the initial conditions for the groundwater are generated by applying a distributed abstraction till the heads at the well locations are within the range observed from monitoring in the field it is assumed that the daily abstraction infiltration pattern will superimpose on these heads and a steady state starting point is difficult to define in the observed transient conditions for the short duration of each simulation period 48 h period modelled and metrics for well b and c derived from last 24 h it is assumed that the exchange the shallow water aquifer will have from the sides or below is negligible and no lateral flow boundary conditions are applied for the diffusive interaction use of well package of modflow applied to all non river rows and columns allowed better spatial control of adding subtracting the recharge and in multi layer cases will allow controlling in with which layer the interaction occurs similar to section 4 abstraction is applied as a 12 h process while re infiltration as a 24 h process over a day 5 2 inability to capture measured data metrics with saturated gw flow assumptions in a single layer model the same parameter set sy k α φ as section 4 controls the behaviour of the model in the parameter field exploration wastewater infiltration φ is treated as a pre set parameter with returns modelled at 10 40 and 70 respectively due to the inability of a single layer model to account for the different constituents of the geology and the sensitivity to sy highlighted in section 4 for a 50 m buffer around the river the specific yield is set as sy 4 to account for the lower yield of the clay silt domination in areas where water table is high the parameter field exploration algorithm functions by starting from an initial best guess provided as input with each run the algorithm varies the parameters by 10 making the set of parameters that give the best correlation for the metrics as its new best fit continues the optimisation process the best fit in this case is defined as the pearson s correlation coefficient for hd and r of wells b and c respectively fig 7 depicts the solution space explored over the 170 simulations with 10 40 and 70 infiltration returns respectively the percent deviation pd for the 4 derived measurements is also recorded defined as absolute value of prediction observation observation the algorithm terminates when no further improvement is made between consecutive runs the best runs from the 10 infiltration scenario was used to seed the cluster of simulations using 40 and 70 infiltration scenarios the results from the simulations are plotted in fig 7b correlation figs 8 and 9 percent deviation for well c and b respectively correlation can be seen to improve distinctly with increasing the percent of wastewater infiltration φ the correlation for low infiltration 0 1 or 10 of return scenarios remains in the negative for all the simulations in the parameter space the best correlation value obtained however is still below 0 2 and increasing φ did not improve the result flattening out the correlation curve after 40 infiltration or higher the percent deviation pd plots especially for hd of well c counters the interpretation offered by the correlation plot that higher re infiltration is required for a better measure of fit instead as it can be seen in the left column plots of fig 8 pd is in a range of 0 1 0 6 for hd of well c for 10 infiltration while for the other two it is 0 7 or higher thus the capability of the model to capture the magnitudes becomes worse with higher infiltration even if the correlation becomes better well b fig 9 sees similar results although the change in magnitude is much smaller for metric r pd in both wells is nearly insensitive to change in infiltration with higher infiltration rates performing slightly better the inability of the model to provide a satisfying fit one measure worsens as other improves is an important indicator in a physically based model it hints that either a forcing has been missed or misappropriated or that some of the simplifying assumptions does not provide a good representation of ground conditions arising possibly from negative correlation equifinality or non uniqueness of the parameters this second possibility can be tested for with the unsaturated gw component model 5 3 improved representation of data metrics with unsaturated gw flow assumptions the unsaturated gw component model is initially parameterised based on values obtained from the parameter field exploration in section 5 2 supplemented from literature for values of the unsaturated zone based on sandy and clay silt soils respectively the mean values fig 7 from the parameter field exploration simulations of the previous section form the basis of the first estimate for this model consequently the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the clay layers and the sand layer is set to 1e 7 and 1e 5 m s respectively distributed about the mean observed for those simulations specific yield for the sand is set as 0 2 and clay as 0 05 since it is suspected that the river is closely linked to the sand layer to enable the transmission seen during the flood wave the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the layers below the in bank extent of the river is allowed to have the same vertical conductivity as of the sand layer the improvement in model fit to the measures of correlation and percent deviation become apparent with the added physical description the plot in fig 10 a shows the results from the best parameter fit obtained from the 2dmb modflow 2005 runs for various infiltration scenarios and α 2 5e 6 m s compared with the 2dmb modflow vsf results for the same parameters the plot uses correlation on the x axis and percent deviation pd of hd for well c seen to be the most responsive pd in section 5 2 on the y axis thus the greater the tendency of the points to drift towards the lower right corner the better is the joint fit in the plot with 2dmb modflow vsf the range of α is tested with values of 5e 5 1e 5 2 5e 6 and 1e 6 m s respectively of these the 2 5e 6 m s diffusive extraction scenario gave the best joint fit further as seen in fig 10b best values for both correlation and pd of hd well c is achieved for φ 0 2 here unlike in section 5 2 both measures of fit improve simultaneously indicating that improving the physical description has improved the capability of the model with the model now capable of reproducing some of the observed processes for the in bank scenario it is applied to qualitatively reproduce some of the behaviour seen during observed flooding events namely the distinct recharge patterns in the groundwater layers in response to surface flooding monitored in january 2013 and seen in fig 11 a an estimated river discharge based on the real event fig 11b 1 is applied to drive the surface water component of the coupled model the results comparing the response of the flood wave in the sand and clay layers are plotted in fig 11b 2 the response is qualitatively similar to the measured data and plausible in terms of the expected exchange between surface and the layers of the aquifer this also appears to agree with the expected gradual head disturbance travelling through the deeper sand layer even after the main flood wave has passed since the model starts from dry conditions in contrast to the prevalent wet conditions at the time of the real event and the multiple flooding sources that characterised the real event the model is not able to capture the local dynamics completely consequently the recharge flood wave in the sand layer does not reach well c during the simulation period 6 discussion and conclusion this study has sought to analyse the groundwater dynamics in jakarta focusing on the challenges in quantifying its diffuse anthropogenic influences and on developing modelling approaches that could mimic the urban shallow groundwater regime a schematic of the human and environmental components acting on the shallow groundwater domain is described and illustrated through fig 3 through structured survey pressures driving the groundwater dependency are identified and the diffusive nature of the human impact on the shallow groundwater regime is established here it becomes clear that with rapid urbanisation the nature and magnitude of pressures on the subsurface due to the city s growth are also rapidly evolving groundwater dependency arises from a need to securing water access and disposing wastewater and thus is directly linked to infrastructure development in these two domains alongside modifications that alter the recharge from the two natural components rainfall and river aquifer interaction respectively in these circumstances due to the pace of change establishing baseline data for analysis of change is a challenge to overcome this we explore the use of high temporal frequency data alongside physically based models as the means to develop a suitable formulation of the components from the monitoring of the shallow water domain two metrics hd and r are defined that help us characterise the diffuse interaction in the coupled human environmental system here oscillations that appears to be caused by diffusive abstraction of water for daily use and wastewater re infiltration is seen in the data collected and captured by the metrics the representation of the physical system through the stand alone gw and couple sw gw models is explored alongside their parameterisation especially for the subsurface component and its connectivity to the river among the explored configuration a simple gw model section 4 uses a cantilever beam loading analogy to convert the system into a linear model of the water table in saturated conditions this model has no predictive capability but helped in understanding separating important aspects of the system firstly the system appears much more sensitive to local storage represented by specific yield over short time frames rather than long term spatially extensive recharge from the river also the model supports wastewater infiltration as a large significant forcing the coupled sw gw models section 5 use a full 2d hydrodynamic model for the surface in two configurations first coupled to a saturated groundwater flow single layer model only and second coupled to a multi layer variably saturated groundwater model the iterations with these configurations clearly show that expanding spatial representation alone is not sufficient to capture observed dynamics of the daily oscillation measured against metrics hd and r it is only by including additional physical dynamics of variably saturated flow that a satisfactory fit against observed behaviour can be achieved even then the capability to reproduce time series of observed events is limited due to poor knowledge of initial boundary conditions overall the exploration of the parameter space in the coupled models lends some evidence that the fit criteria used by means of the metrics hd and r have some skill in identifying the constraints of the system as the oscillating behaviour described by these metrics could not be easily reproduced by the model consequently for the urban river groundwater system improving the physical description of the shallow unconfined aquifer became a key factor for matching the model performance with observed phenomena the diffuse extraction and infiltration assumptions applied on the numerical models although with their obvious drawbacks of uniform application on the domain have proved to provide a decent match to ground conditions the final best fit value of extraction obtained 2 5e 6 m s is plausible and close to estimates made based on the density of population in the urban site and the prevalence of jet pumps bore wells for extraction section 2 the second estimation of interest is the re infiltration percentage calculating the final estimate of return in a range between 10 and 30 φ providing best fit the shallow unconfined aquifer under the urban site would receive between nearly 65 thousand to 20 thousand m3 per day of wastewater per sq km currently little is understood about the natural capability of the aquifer to filter out some of the associated relevant pollutants and about how much of this buffer has been exhausted with the ongoing exploitation as mentioned in section 2 anecdotal evidence indicates that residents economically capable move away from the shallow unconfined aquifer as the source of water and opt to install water network connection due to decreasing quality of the water from groundwater given the closeness of the bore wells and septic tanks in the region much of the re infiltration can be expected to go via the macro pores created for the bore wells more observations are however required to establish this and the impact that limiting exposure through macro pores may have in controlling the localised pollution these uncertainties notwithstanding the study clearly points also provides some quantification towards wastewater management as the critical component in the evolving urban shallow groundwater dynamics of the region

6566,an overview of the urban shallow groundwater dynamics in jakarta is provided the modifications to the water budget at the micro and mesoscale due to anthropogenic influences are described and the diffusive nature of the interaction analysed the scale of urbanisation 10 million residents in conjunction with the lack of infrastructure for water related services is seen to have fostered a dependency on the shallow groundwater resources and in turn led to a tangible impact on the groundwater domain which is difficult to quantify and study using short duration yet high temporal resolution groundwater level data collected at an urban site within jakarta two metrics are developed that can describe the daily variation in groundwater levels driven by the human interaction numerical models of varying complexity for the urban shallow groundwater dynamics are then used here by employing a process of gradually improving the model s physical description while performing parameter estimation based on the new metrics the study provides evidence of the role of the unsaturated zone in influencing the urban shallow groundwater dynamics we further identify jakarta s wastewater seepage as the crucial yet overlooked component of the urban cycle having direct implications for the region s water security the innovation of this study lies at the combination of high temporal resolution data with flexible modelling frameworks that can be developed to give insights into rapidly growing unstructured stressors on water resources in data poor mega cities from the developing world keywords groundwater dependency water supply coupled surface groundwater modelling jakarta 1 introduction water supply and wastewater management infrastructure are two key water related services that are integral to the urbanisation process while discrepancy in quality of water supply between wealthier and poor segment of the urban population is not uncommon in the growing urban conglomerations of the world lawrence et al 1998 weak governance alongside increased proportions of residents of large cities without access to these facilities can propagate dependency on unsustainable resource exploitation un habitat 2006 estimated that 970 million urban dwellers are without access to adequate water supply with the lack of access to clean surface water resources and other economic as well as non economic factors bakker et al 2008 barring adequate access for the poor households shallow groundwater gw exploitation often substitutes as the supply strategy to fill the gap further the quality of the water available is compromised by lack of sanitation infrastructure foster et al 1994 estimated that up to 90 of water supply in unsewered cities can end up as recharge for the groundwater in many cases carrying pollutants with them to the subsurface the world bank characterizes jakarta s water and sanitation sector as one of the weakest in asia world bank 2004 and in this paper we argue that the scale of interaction between the urban denizens and groundwater domain these circumstances has created necessitates treating the shallow groundwater domain as a coupled human environmental system with diffusive anthropogenic pressure section 2 elaborates the human component of this system and assesses the scale and nature of the groundwater dependency here via results derived from structured interviews and a brief survey of policies in relation to the water sector a schematic of the human and environmental components acting of the shallow groundwater is developed it is observed that while these components likely have a direct bearing on the management of the system linked to all three critical water related sectors i e water supply sewerage and flood protection the diffusive nature of the pressure is difficult to capture by traditional groundwater monitoring methods thus the second part of the paper sections 3 4 and 5 develops the concept of using high temporal frequency data with physically based modelling of the groundwater system as a possible approach to gain insight into the impact on the urban shallow groundwater regime section 3 describes a small duration yet high temporal frequency monitoring of groundwater levels in the vicinity of a river in central jakarta the data analysis from the monitoring becomes the basis for development of a simple conceptual gw model section 4 and sw gw models of increasing complexity section 5 which demonstrate the capability to derive information regarding the drivers shaping the behaviour of the system as well as insights into its physical characteristics that needs to be taken into account 2 groundwater dependency and risk in jakarta 2 1 urban water supply security perusahaan daerah air minum jakarta raya pam jaya is the government owned utility responsible for water supply in jakarta two private parties palyja for west jakarta and aetra air for east jakarta via a concession agreement with pam jaya are responsible for the production and distribution of clean water for the urban area with asian development bank funding the water supply network was expanded and reinforced significantly over the period of 2008 2012 adb 2013 however due to constraints in availability of raw water accelerated growth of the city and non revenue water loss issues the coverage of the water supply network is still inadequate and disproportionally affects poor households the piped water supply network of jakarta is estimated to only have coverage of 44 with average consumption of 150 l per person per day cmea 2011 among its 10 million resident population among these adb 2012 estimates that the urban poor make up only 10 15 of those with access to piped water thus the majority are served by a variety of informal arrangements such as water vendors and typically pay much higher prices per unit volume for poorer quality of water than wealthier consumers shirley 2002 in these circumstances the proliferation of wells and jet pumps for shallow groundwater access forms a lucrative option groundwater and wells fall under the jurisdiction of national government s ministry of mines which has no formal mandate to collaborate with pam jaya and as a result initial plans by the private concessionaires to disallow users from accessing private wells have not been implemented bakker 2007 open dug wells are still in use by poorer communities in the vicinity of the river s but borewells using jet pumps are common and typically extract water from 15 to 40 m below the surface to compare the cumulative cost of securing water supply from groundwater and water supply network we estimate the running cost of utilising both these sources the results of which are plotted in fig 1 here the running cost of groundwater extraction is calculated as a combination of electricity tariff rates applicable to poor and mid income range households nugroho et al 2005 and estimated cost of procuring and installing pumps for extracting water from up to 40 m depth based on market survey this can be then compared with the charges expected for installing a water supply connection and subscription source aetra 2007 bakker 2007 for similar consumption trends from the plot it can be seen that while for large per person per day consumption p d the cost effectiveness of a water connection is clear for low income and low consumption households the economic advantage in the long run is not significantly different although the initial investment required is higher non economic factors such as perception of the reliability of water supply serve as further disincentives for poorer households from securing a water connection bakker 2007 lists some of the disincentives relevant to these households as insecure tenure the need for flexibility of payment convenience status and high transaction costs associated with dealing with the formal water utilities like infrastructure costs to build storage because networked water supply is only intermittent line ups and time off work to pay bills for those without bank accounts and regular income fear of time required to deal with meter misreading and bill over charging we carried out structured surveys covering 110 mid to low income households in central jakarta to document the groundwater dependency for water supply created due to the above listed pressures the survey covered the neighbourhoods of kampung melayu bukit duri and kebon baru in the vicinity of the ciliwung river and the main results are documented in table 1 at least 16 of the households had more than one source of water supply with only 9 dependence on the water network for drinking water and 22 dependence on it for water for daily use in contrast 73 had access to wells for water and only 18 of the interviewed households reported no dependency on groundwater for drinking or daily use water typically abstraction from the aquifers and the associated drop in water table levels is associated with industry and agriculture exploiting the deeper confined aquifers this has also been observed for jakarta where exploitation of the deeper aquifer by industry has been linked land subsidence and seawater intrusion delinom 2011 schmidt et al 1990 however in this case the wide spread pumping of the unconfined aquifer even at its low volume per capita volume can have a large impact on the urban shallow groundwater regime studies in other regions foster and vairamoorthy 2013 foster and chilton 2003 howard 2002 have also suggested links between such diffusive exploitation and aquifer degradation 2 2 limited wastewater management and diffused pollution of shallow gw the degradation of the shallow groundwater aquifer is also linked to the lack of sanitation and wastewater management in the city historically wastewater has been treated as a private responsibility bakker 2006 consequently till the early 1970s jakarta had little to no off site wastewater treatment plant or sewerage system although new buildings are required to have on site treatment of wastewater a majority of the population depends on septic tanks or drainage of waste in open channel as means for wastewater management with the current sewer network covering only 2 of jakarta 80 of the household black and grey water is channelled to septic tanks cmea 2011 from where the liquid part either drains off to the river via open channels or infiltrates in the groundwater the septic tanks in operation are in many cases not maintained resulting in leakages and spread of contamination results from the survey table 1 reflect this trend of the 56 reporting having a septic tank only half of them recalled having had the septic tank cleaned or maintained in many cases this was recorded to have been done infrequently and a number of years ago howard 2002 states that in most developing cities the signature of infiltrating wastewater is initially masked by the falling water table levels however with estimated 60 80 of water from domestic use ending up as wastewater the volume contributed by this source to the shallow water aquifer can be potentially large component of the urban shallow groundwater regime further in the densely packed urban setting the borewells in most cases are located only a few meters from the septic tank providing macro pore paths for the wastewater to infiltrate into the shallow groundwater anecdotal evidence recorded during the survey suggests that due to cases of black and smelly water coming out from borewells mid income families are now either investing into developing deeper wells or turning towards the formal water supply network to secure better quality water 2 3 impact of the modifying urban shallow gw regime jakarta and its surrounding areas have undergone a rapid pace of urbanisation over the past 40 years the landuse change maps of fig 2 demonstrate this degree of change for the pre dominantly natural system of the 1970s rainfall recharge and river aquifer interaction were likely the dominant components of the shallow groundwater budget infiltration into the deeper aquifers in the urban area is expected to be a few magnitudes smaller due to the geology schmidt et al 1990 and is neglected at this stage with paving of large proportion of the land reducing natural recharge and channelization of the rivers these natural components can have been expected to be altered further the analysis of the previous sub sections suggests that additional human driven components have become important for the shallow groundwater regime stemming from the dependency on the shallow groundwater for providing good quality water and absorbing waste to visualise the modifications to the natural system propagated by these circumstances we invoke the concept of an urban dominated shallow groundwater regime the main components of this system are illustrated in fig 3 and consist of the two natural albeit modified components of rainfall recharge and river exchange and two anthropogenic components of shallow groundwater extraction and wastewater infiltration however both anthropogenic components are diffused over the surface and difficult to measure without an estimate of scale and magnitude comparable to the natural components their role in shaping the dynamics of this coupled human environmental system that has implication for management and infrastructure development planning is hard to establish in these circumstances the drying of wells table 1 40 and poor quality groundwater raises serious questions about water security and health of the urban poor and for the long term with all the three sectors water supply network sanitation sewerage systems alongside flood protection systems requiring development and in turn modifying the dynamics of the system itself identifying and prioritizing goals can be a challenge the traditionally acquired long term groundwater level records with low temporal resolution even if available are either too sparse or irrelevant to these densely populated urban sites with its diffusive loading on the environment without long term trends and or detailed spatial coverage these records are inadequate to enable the separation of the effects of the components influencing the system the urban shallow groundwater regime presents a number of unique challenges to incorporate into monitoring and modelling strategies the following sections attempt to take this forward 3 high temporal frequency monitoring of gw 3 1 urban site and associated shallow aquifer monitoring the site selected for monitoring is a dense low rise urban area in the middle of jakarta with the ciliwung river flowing through its centre fig 4 a highlights part of the urban footprint the population density at the site is estimated at 30 50 thousand people per square kilometre local administrative office personal communication an understanding of the local heterogeneity of the shallow aquifer layers was built via unstructured interviews with local well diggers supported by the anecdotal evidence of the exploitation of the shallow groundwater gathered through interviews reported in section 2 based on this the unconfined layer is generally expected to extend up to 30 m below ground level with the top 10 m having clay and silts as the dominant material below this sand with silt becomes the main constituent after the 20 m mark soft rock is also reported in the constituents core samples reported as part of a study for the ministry of public works for a deep tunnel engineering project near the study area jcp 2013 corroborated these findings field work for groundwater level monitoring was carried out in two phases public open wells of interest in the site were identified by a field campaign during the first phase from april 2012 to december 2012 water levels in 5 wells were recorded manually april to september on a weekly basis september to december bimonthly to create a record of seasonal variation under the second phase data loggers set to record water level and temperature data at 10 min intervals were deployed in 3 wells fig 4a from december 2012 to march 2013 the observed wells for the second high frequency monitoring a b and c are at a distance of 15 8 m 84 5 m and 236 1 m from the river centreline respectively both wells a and b are 10 m deep and primarily in the clay silt layer well c extends to the sand silt layer the 3 month period falls during the wet season of the region and includes flood events like that occurred in jakarta on the 17th of january 2013 which inundated large sections of the city in the data obtained from the 3 month period a clear diurnal oscillation pattern was observed in the wells being monitored to verify that the signal is not due to malfunction of the probe or subject to specific location of the wells during the first week of may 2013 a short term controlled monitoring was conducted over a dry period in wells close to and located in similar geology as wells a and c respectively 3 2 field data analysis the general pattern observed for the diurnal fluctuation in groundwater follows that of a decaying sinusoid fig 4b as reported in shaad et al 2014 drop in water levels spans from around 5 am until evening the drop is not smooth and contains a number of peaks and troughs at night the water level begins to recover the recovery segment of the curve is relatively smooth the recharge from rainfall and flooding appears to have a good superposition with this pattern to analyse the pattern two metrics are defined to describe the fluctuating behaviour for the daily values of the 3 wells for the 3 months the first metric head drop hd measures the lowering of head from 5am on a day point 1 to 5am the next day point 2 as a proxy for drop in water table in a single day the second metric recovery r measures the change in head from the lowest point between the points 1 and 2 and the head at point 2 fig 4b graphically depicts both metrics using sampled data from a dry period fig 5 plots the frequency distribution over 5 bin range of the two metrics for each of the wells under observation even with the rainfall recharge and flooding events acting as noise in the distribution curves distinct clusters emerge the range and values of the hd and r for wells a and b both of which are located in clay slit dominated layer are similar well a records much more noise which can be attributed to its closeness to the river and thus to a greater propensity to be influenced by its level variation and flooding the mean value of hd in the highest frequency bins is 0 103 m and 0 12 m for wells a and b respectively the range is roughly between 3 m and 1 8 m with extremes caused by flooding for well c going into the sand silt layer the range and values of hd and r is consistently lower than observed for the clay wells the range of hd here is 0 44 m to 0 13 m with the mean hd for the highest frequency bin being 0 03 m this is in agreement with the controlled monitoring done during the dry period for a well reaching the sand silt layer where mean hd of 0 034 m was recorded the variation of level is identical in form to one observed to be caused by evapotranspiration as proposed by white 1932 and expanded by gribovszki et al 2010 however no natural factors as identified by lundquist and cayan 2002 can be linked to the observed trend these include evaporation from bare soil and water bodies and evapotranspiration from vegetation during day time which cannot explain the fluctuation as the water table at the site is sufficiently low and vegetation occurs only in the form of small patches infiltration in losing reaches due to changes in temperature during a day which can affect the hydraulic conductivity and viscosity of water and thus can influence the infiltration from stream to groundwater is a trivial case at the tropics and finally the diurnal cycle of precipitation with early afternoon rain events is a feature of the local tropical climate wain 1994 but the fluctuation is observed even on dry periods and at sufficient distance from the river to disqualify diurnal cycle of precipitation as the agent responsible therefore in the absence of a natural forcing that can be identified to explain the oscillations anthropogenic causes seem to be the likely candidates responsible with no major industrial or agricultural area and related pumping facilities located in the vicinity of the site groundwater dependency per household explored in section 2 with its diffusive loading effects emerges as the possible hypothesis to explain the observations to explore this and determine the scale of influence on shallow groundwater system created by groundwater dependency models of incremental complexity described in sections 4 and 5 attempt to link the metrics defined for observed patterns to the schematic developed in section 2 3 by simulating the diffusive interaction using different model assumptions 4 an example of simple model to analyse gw dynamics 4 1 modelling a loaded beam analogy using modflow here a conceptual model of the system based on some simplifying assumptions is proposed to explore the concept of diffusive interaction as the agent responsible for observed fluctuation and system parameters that could allow for it due to the diffusive nature of the abstraction by household pumps and infiltration of wastewater instead of using point based forcing the loading on the groundwater system can be considered analogous to uniform loading of a cantilever beam with the river acting as the fixed end of this beam fig 6 based on the trend seen in the data acquired during monitoring groundwater abstraction is treated as a 12 h daytime process while wastewater infiltration is treated as a continuous 24 h process modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 is used to simulate this conceptual system the defined model is 300 m long with the river end defined as a fixed head boundary the other boundaries are treated as no flow modelled as a homogenous system the model has a single layer 10 m wide and capable of modelling a water table up to 30 m below the surface the water budget of this system is thus q rainfall q river q abstraction q wastewater infiltration δ v storage for dry periods qrainfall 0 the contributors from the natural components are functions of the properties of the unconfined layer specific yield sy and hydraulic conductivity k m s as well as the varying position of the water table under the uniform loading assumption the daytime loss qabstraction qwastewater infiltration can be expressed as a function of uniform abstraction rate α m s while night time wastewater infiltration can be expressed as a fraction φ of the uniform abstraction rate α this abstraction infiltration is applied over the entire domain using the recharge package of modflow 2005 4 2 parameter field exploration and results from the model setup it follows that four parameters sy k α φ control the behaviour of the model using an ensemble of model runs where the parameters are allowed to vary within a pre determined range trends of behaviour are derived the range for sy and k is taken from literature and set to vary from 3 to 13 and 1e 8 m s to 1e 4 m s respectively to represent silty clay to sandy silt dominated systems the magnitude of α is calculated from population density and mean head water consumption and is set to vary between 1e and 5 m s to 1e 7 m s values considered for φ are 0 10 20 40 and 60 a set of initial conditions generated by a steady state run from flat water table to pre stressed are tested for in the transient mode the model runs for 5 days with 12 h stress periods and 1 h time step from the cluster of model runs thus generated the oscillation descriptive metrics hd and r are extracted for the 4th day at 250 m from the fixed river head boundary and compared qualitatively with observed fluctuation dynamics the conceptual model is deliberately formulated as a drastic simplification of the real conditions with the aim to understand and separate the important aspects behind the processes observed the modelling results show that hd is found to be much more sensitive to specific yield then hydraulic conductivity fig 6a it suggests that although the river to groundwater infiltration over larger time scales may be the process primarily feeding the groundwater system it may not play a major role for the observed short term fluctuations tested against a range of abstraction values the variation observed for hd is higher when the specific yield of the material decreases fig 6b for higher yield regions the range is very small this suggests that for low yield aquifers where reasonable estimates of either specific yield or abstraction infiltration are available observed values of metric hd could hold some predictive value in identifying the missing information by means of inverse modelling for high yield aquifers this seems unlikely the model also suggests that a significant amount of grey and other wastewater act as a constant recharge source in the region fig 6c with φ 0 the fluctuation pattern could not be reproduced with any value for the other parameters r for this case remains below zero thus implying a water table dropping constantly the range of r in the plot are only indicative but suggests that non zero higher values of φ will be required to explain the magnitudes of recovery observed in the recorded data 5 example of coupled model for simulating sw gw dynamics the heterogeneity of the surface domain is under represented in gw models and cannot capture the dynamics of river flow and spatial variation to improve this representation here coupled sw gw models are considered that can be used to simulate the exchange processes and interaction of the aquifer with the river coupled sw gw models maybe able to better describe the spatial heterogeneity of the site but will be limited by the data requirement for developing and validating detailed models the following section attempts to develop such a coupled model following the same parameter field exploration strategy described in section 4 and incrementally increasing model complexity in this case however the model domain will be spatially consistent with the real site and developed on the basis of the generic coupling framework described in shaad 2015 with the oscillation pattern highlighting the drying and wetting fronts in the subsurface one of the key aims is to gauge the importance of accounting for flows through the variably saturated zone in the groundwater domain the ability of the models to reproduce observed conditions is evaluated against the mean values of the metrics defined in section 3 derived from the monitored data the two metrics provide an effective method of summarising the temporal dynamics in these conditions by isolating the diffusive interaction between the surface subsurface from the variation is river flow which the results in section 4 suggest to generally influences long term recharge patterns rather than the observed mean daily oscillations with both the wells a b in the clay layer exhibiting similar patterns essentially 2 sets of the metrics are available one pair for the clay layer wells and one for the sand layer well referred henceforth as hd and r of wells b and c respectively 5 1 2dmb modflow coupling the surface component of the coupled model is derived from the work presented in shaad et al 2015 and uses 2dmb shaad 2015 faeh 2007 a full 2d finite volume hydrodynamic solver applied to a high resolution digital terrain model of the urban site the first coupled model in section 5 2 uses a simpler 2dmb modflow 2005 couple with a single layer gw component to attempt to inverse model the parameters that allow a best fit for the metrics head drop and recovery at well locations b and c percentage deviation pd and pearson s correlation pc are used to measure the performance of the coupled model section 5 3 replaces gw component of the coupled model with one developed using modflow vsf thoms et al 2006 that describes the variably saturated groundwater flows by solving the 3d richard s equation the resulting 2dmb modflow vsf couple consists of a 5 layer gw component that can be expected to more effectively model the different layers of the unconfined aquifer and their wetting drying the surface is modelled for both the saturated and unsaturated setup at 4 m resolution for the parameter field exploration a constant inflow at 5 cumecs estimated as in bank flow for the river is applied section 5 3 extends this to a flood wave outflow for the surface is modelled with a weir at the downstream end and a constant friction is used for the surface domain with currently no structures to modify the flow the modflow 2005 component is a single layer model with 8 m horizontal and 30 m vertical resolution the horizontal resolution of the modflow vsf component is still similar to the saturated version set at 8 m cell size however in the vertical direction the 30 m shallow aquifer is divided into 5 layers the first three layers l1 to l3 are 2 m thick while l4 is 4 m thick together layers 1 to 4 are treated as the top clay silt layer l5 is 20 m thick and analogous to the sand soft rock layer forming the base of the shallow aquifer for the simulations the initial conditions for the groundwater are generated by applying a distributed abstraction till the heads at the well locations are within the range observed from monitoring in the field it is assumed that the daily abstraction infiltration pattern will superimpose on these heads and a steady state starting point is difficult to define in the observed transient conditions for the short duration of each simulation period 48 h period modelled and metrics for well b and c derived from last 24 h it is assumed that the exchange the shallow water aquifer will have from the sides or below is negligible and no lateral flow boundary conditions are applied for the diffusive interaction use of well package of modflow applied to all non river rows and columns allowed better spatial control of adding subtracting the recharge and in multi layer cases will allow controlling in with which layer the interaction occurs similar to section 4 abstraction is applied as a 12 h process while re infiltration as a 24 h process over a day 5 2 inability to capture measured data metrics with saturated gw flow assumptions in a single layer model the same parameter set sy k α φ as section 4 controls the behaviour of the model in the parameter field exploration wastewater infiltration φ is treated as a pre set parameter with returns modelled at 10 40 and 70 respectively due to the inability of a single layer model to account for the different constituents of the geology and the sensitivity to sy highlighted in section 4 for a 50 m buffer around the river the specific yield is set as sy 4 to account for the lower yield of the clay silt domination in areas where water table is high the parameter field exploration algorithm functions by starting from an initial best guess provided as input with each run the algorithm varies the parameters by 10 making the set of parameters that give the best correlation for the metrics as its new best fit continues the optimisation process the best fit in this case is defined as the pearson s correlation coefficient for hd and r of wells b and c respectively fig 7 depicts the solution space explored over the 170 simulations with 10 40 and 70 infiltration returns respectively the percent deviation pd for the 4 derived measurements is also recorded defined as absolute value of prediction observation observation the algorithm terminates when no further improvement is made between consecutive runs the best runs from the 10 infiltration scenario was used to seed the cluster of simulations using 40 and 70 infiltration scenarios the results from the simulations are plotted in fig 7b correlation figs 8 and 9 percent deviation for well c and b respectively correlation can be seen to improve distinctly with increasing the percent of wastewater infiltration φ the correlation for low infiltration 0 1 or 10 of return scenarios remains in the negative for all the simulations in the parameter space the best correlation value obtained however is still below 0 2 and increasing φ did not improve the result flattening out the correlation curve after 40 infiltration or higher the percent deviation pd plots especially for hd of well c counters the interpretation offered by the correlation plot that higher re infiltration is required for a better measure of fit instead as it can be seen in the left column plots of fig 8 pd is in a range of 0 1 0 6 for hd of well c for 10 infiltration while for the other two it is 0 7 or higher thus the capability of the model to capture the magnitudes becomes worse with higher infiltration even if the correlation becomes better well b fig 9 sees similar results although the change in magnitude is much smaller for metric r pd in both wells is nearly insensitive to change in infiltration with higher infiltration rates performing slightly better the inability of the model to provide a satisfying fit one measure worsens as other improves is an important indicator in a physically based model it hints that either a forcing has been missed or misappropriated or that some of the simplifying assumptions does not provide a good representation of ground conditions arising possibly from negative correlation equifinality or non uniqueness of the parameters this second possibility can be tested for with the unsaturated gw component model 5 3 improved representation of data metrics with unsaturated gw flow assumptions the unsaturated gw component model is initially parameterised based on values obtained from the parameter field exploration in section 5 2 supplemented from literature for values of the unsaturated zone based on sandy and clay silt soils respectively the mean values fig 7 from the parameter field exploration simulations of the previous section form the basis of the first estimate for this model consequently the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the clay layers and the sand layer is set to 1e 7 and 1e 5 m s respectively distributed about the mean observed for those simulations specific yield for the sand is set as 0 2 and clay as 0 05 since it is suspected that the river is closely linked to the sand layer to enable the transmission seen during the flood wave the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the layers below the in bank extent of the river is allowed to have the same vertical conductivity as of the sand layer the improvement in model fit to the measures of correlation and percent deviation become apparent with the added physical description the plot in fig 10 a shows the results from the best parameter fit obtained from the 2dmb modflow 2005 runs for various infiltration scenarios and α 2 5e 6 m s compared with the 2dmb modflow vsf results for the same parameters the plot uses correlation on the x axis and percent deviation pd of hd for well c seen to be the most responsive pd in section 5 2 on the y axis thus the greater the tendency of the points to drift towards the lower right corner the better is the joint fit in the plot with 2dmb modflow vsf the range of α is tested with values of 5e 5 1e 5 2 5e 6 and 1e 6 m s respectively of these the 2 5e 6 m s diffusive extraction scenario gave the best joint fit further as seen in fig 10b best values for both correlation and pd of hd well c is achieved for φ 0 2 here unlike in section 5 2 both measures of fit improve simultaneously indicating that improving the physical description has improved the capability of the model with the model now capable of reproducing some of the observed processes for the in bank scenario it is applied to qualitatively reproduce some of the behaviour seen during observed flooding events namely the distinct recharge patterns in the groundwater layers in response to surface flooding monitored in january 2013 and seen in fig 11 a an estimated river discharge based on the real event fig 11b 1 is applied to drive the surface water component of the coupled model the results comparing the response of the flood wave in the sand and clay layers are plotted in fig 11b 2 the response is qualitatively similar to the measured data and plausible in terms of the expected exchange between surface and the layers of the aquifer this also appears to agree with the expected gradual head disturbance travelling through the deeper sand layer even after the main flood wave has passed since the model starts from dry conditions in contrast to the prevalent wet conditions at the time of the real event and the multiple flooding sources that characterised the real event the model is not able to capture the local dynamics completely consequently the recharge flood wave in the sand layer does not reach well c during the simulation period 6 discussion and conclusion this study has sought to analyse the groundwater dynamics in jakarta focusing on the challenges in quantifying its diffuse anthropogenic influences and on developing modelling approaches that could mimic the urban shallow groundwater regime a schematic of the human and environmental components acting on the shallow groundwater domain is described and illustrated through fig 3 through structured survey pressures driving the groundwater dependency are identified and the diffusive nature of the human impact on the shallow groundwater regime is established here it becomes clear that with rapid urbanisation the nature and magnitude of pressures on the subsurface due to the city s growth are also rapidly evolving groundwater dependency arises from a need to securing water access and disposing wastewater and thus is directly linked to infrastructure development in these two domains alongside modifications that alter the recharge from the two natural components rainfall and river aquifer interaction respectively in these circumstances due to the pace of change establishing baseline data for analysis of change is a challenge to overcome this we explore the use of high temporal frequency data alongside physically based models as the means to develop a suitable formulation of the components from the monitoring of the shallow water domain two metrics hd and r are defined that help us characterise the diffuse interaction in the coupled human environmental system here oscillations that appears to be caused by diffusive abstraction of water for daily use and wastewater re infiltration is seen in the data collected and captured by the metrics the representation of the physical system through the stand alone gw and couple sw gw models is explored alongside their parameterisation especially for the subsurface component and its connectivity to the river among the explored configuration a simple gw model section 4 uses a cantilever beam loading analogy to convert the system into a linear model of the water table in saturated conditions this model has no predictive capability but helped in understanding separating important aspects of the system firstly the system appears much more sensitive to local storage represented by specific yield over short time frames rather than long term spatially extensive recharge from the river also the model supports wastewater infiltration as a large significant forcing the coupled sw gw models section 5 use a full 2d hydrodynamic model for the surface in two configurations first coupled to a saturated groundwater flow single layer model only and second coupled to a multi layer variably saturated groundwater model the iterations with these configurations clearly show that expanding spatial representation alone is not sufficient to capture observed dynamics of the daily oscillation measured against metrics hd and r it is only by including additional physical dynamics of variably saturated flow that a satisfactory fit against observed behaviour can be achieved even then the capability to reproduce time series of observed events is limited due to poor knowledge of initial boundary conditions overall the exploration of the parameter space in the coupled models lends some evidence that the fit criteria used by means of the metrics hd and r have some skill in identifying the constraints of the system as the oscillating behaviour described by these metrics could not be easily reproduced by the model consequently for the urban river groundwater system improving the physical description of the shallow unconfined aquifer became a key factor for matching the model performance with observed phenomena the diffuse extraction and infiltration assumptions applied on the numerical models although with their obvious drawbacks of uniform application on the domain have proved to provide a decent match to ground conditions the final best fit value of extraction obtained 2 5e 6 m s is plausible and close to estimates made based on the density of population in the urban site and the prevalence of jet pumps bore wells for extraction section 2 the second estimation of interest is the re infiltration percentage calculating the final estimate of return in a range between 10 and 30 φ providing best fit the shallow unconfined aquifer under the urban site would receive between nearly 65 thousand to 20 thousand m3 per day of wastewater per sq km currently little is understood about the natural capability of the aquifer to filter out some of the associated relevant pollutants and about how much of this buffer has been exhausted with the ongoing exploitation as mentioned in section 2 anecdotal evidence indicates that residents economically capable move away from the shallow unconfined aquifer as the source of water and opt to install water network connection due to decreasing quality of the water from groundwater given the closeness of the bore wells and septic tanks in the region much of the re infiltration can be expected to go via the macro pores created for the bore wells more observations are however required to establish this and the impact that limiting exposure through macro pores may have in controlling the localised pollution these uncertainties notwithstanding the study clearly points also provides some quantification towards wastewater management as the critical component in the evolving urban shallow groundwater dynamics of the region

6567,during the last years the city of hong kong has made large investments to make its urban water supply system more water efficient and sustainable as such its municipal water abstraction often defined as direct water use has decreased from 355 litre per capita per day l cap d in 2005 to 326 l cap d in 2013 due to its political history hong kong is unique in the world in data availability on urban food consumption it is therefore the ideal case study to show typical urban food consumption behaviour and its related indirect water use the objective of this paper is to show the large water quantities associated with indirect water use and that the citizens of hong kong can additionally save much more water by looking at this indirect water use the current average diet in hong kong is very different to the average chinese diet it is characterised by a high intake of water intensive products like animal products and sugar leading to a food related indirect water use or water footprint wfcons of 4727 l cap d according to recommendations from the chinese nutrition society for a healthy diet the intake of some product groups should be increased vegetables and fruit and of other product groups reduced sugar crop oils meat and animal fats this would result in a reduction of the wfcons of 40 to 2852 l cap d especially the reduced intake of meat including offals from currently 126 kg per capita per year kg cap yr to the recommended value 27 kg cap yrwould results in a substantial wfcons reduction meat consumption in hong kong is extremely high a pesco vegetarian diet would result in a reduction of 49 to 2398 l cap d and a vegetarian diet in a 53 to 2224 l cap d reduction hong kong citizens can thus save a lot of water through a change in their diet many of the products consumed contribute to different levels of blue water scarcity in the regions of origin hong kong imports from this poses a water related risk to food security in hong kong as all diet scenarios also result in a lower blue wfcons they decrease this risk in order to become sustainable mega cities should reduce their dependency on distant resources and ecosystems 1 introduction cities are hotspots of consumption the un has identified sustainable cities and communities as one of its sustainable development goals sdgs as such the extent to which urban dwellers consume resources is key on the path to a sustainable world one of these resources is water which is consumed in a direct and indirect way by city inhabitants vanham and bidoglio 2014 while most people are aware of their direct water consumption they are not of their indirect water consumption the latter is defined as the water that is required to produce the goods and services city inhabitants consume i e their water footprint hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 many modern cities have invested a lot of money in a more water efficient and sustainable urban water cycle e g by reducing water leakages koop and van leeuwen 2015 as such direct urban water use has decreased in the last decade in many modern cities awareness raising campaigns and policy have generally focused on increasing water efficiency in domestic and industrial water use e g by using tap water wisely or by increasing water efficiency of washing machines or dishwashers the hong kong special administration region hksar government has during recent years implemented a wide range of water conservation measures which include metering and a tiered water tariff large scale replacement and rehabilitation of ageing pipelines to reduce leakage the use of sea water for toilet flushing and education and publicity programmes hong kong statistics 2015b yue and tang 2011 although these measures are very important to reduce direct water use the objective of this paper is to show that the citizens of hong kong can additionally save much more water by looking at their indirect water use urban centres are very much dependent on distant resources ecosystems and populations more particularly our objective is to show that using hong kong as a case study 1 indirect water use is responsible for enormous water quantities in cities and 2 water can also be saved by urban dwellers by looking at their diets indeed based upon planetary boundaries rockstrom et al 2009 sustainable solutions in water management need to come from both the supply and demand side within a systems approach expo eu scientific committee 2015 addressing the water energy food ecosystems nexus context vanham 2016 supply side solutions include water efficiency in the urban water cycle or agricultural water production godfray et al 2010 whereas demand side solutions include diet habits godfray et al 2010 vanham et al 2013b or the reduction of food waste vanham et al 2015 although cities can never become fully self sufficient it is important that they contribute to global sustainability and resilience by optimizing resource use increasing efficiency and minimizing waste elmqvist 2014 in this paper we analyse the indirect water consumption related to food intake in the city of hong kong by means of the water footprint concept hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 vanham and bidoglio 2013 both direct water use and indirect water use together are defined as the water footprint of consumption wfcons of a city water footprint assessments on the city level have not been the focus of research in the past paterson et al 2015 during recent years several studies have however been conducted e g hoff et al 2014 jenerette et al 2006 kennedy et al 2015 ma et al 2015 rushforth and ruddell 2016 city water footprint analyses related to food consumption including diet scenarios have been conducted for a range of pan european cities i e for milan vanham and bidoglio 2014 dutch cities vanham et al 2016b mediterranean cities vanham et al 2016a and nordic cities vanham et al 2017 in our study we focus on indirect water use related to food consumption in hong kong today overconsumption and undernutrition go together in china there are now important differences in food consumption behaviour between urban and rural regions in china not at least related to increased income differences dong and hu 2010 zhang et al 2008 also in hong kong overconsumption and undernutrition go hand in hand with associated health problems a total of 47 of the hong kong population 54 of the males and 41 of the females are overweight or obese according to the world health organisation who proposed classification of weight by bmi in adult asians cuhk 2010 another 9 is underweight cuhk 2010 we assess the wfcons of food for the current situation reference period 1996 2005 or ref three diet scenarios o a healthy diet as recommended by the chinese food guide pagoda chinese nutrition society 2015 or healthy o a healthy pesco vegetarian diet or pesco veg o a healthy vegetarian diet or veg the production of certain agricultural products crop and livestock products can attribute to blue water scarcity hong kong might import food items from regions where water scarcity occurs thereby putting a risk to its food security therefore we make a general evaluation of whether products imported by hong kong are produced under blue water scarcity conditions the latter being the ratio between consumptive water use and ecologically available water 2 methodology 2 1 accounting framework a list of abbreviations used in this study is given in table 1 a workflow scheme of the methodology used in this study is displayed in fig 1 to assess wf values the volumetric approach of the water footprint network or wfn hoekstra et al 2011 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 is applied we use the blue and green wf components following the definition of rockström et al 2009 green water is the soil water held in the unsaturated zone formed by precipitation and available to plants blue water refers to liquid water in rivers lakes wetlands and aquifers irrigated agriculture receives blue water from irrigation as well as green water from precipitation while rainfed agriculture receives only green water the green wf is thus the rainwater consumed by crops the inclusion of green water is a necessity in integrated water resources management iwrm as argued by most authors and institutions working on iwrm gerten et al 2013 hoekstra 2016 hoff et al 2014 jalava et al 2016 2014 karimi et al 2013 miina et al 2016 ran et al 2016 rockström et al 2014 schyns et al 2015 vanham 2012 we do not use the grey wf as its quantification is very dependent on data availability thaler et al 2012 vanham and bidoglio 2013 to compute the water footprint of consumption wfcons related to food consumption we use fao food balance sheets fbs for hong kong for the reference period 1996 2005 and or 2010 2013 as indicated these data are unique as they provide for food consumption behaviour of a city when average annual food consumption data of a food item during 2010 2013 differed more than 5 from the 1996 2005 values we used 2010 2013 data with 2013 being the latest data available during the writing of this paper otherwise we used 1996 2005 data to compute wfcons values for hong kong we need wf of production wfprod values for the food product groups consumed in hong kong almost 100 of this food is imported therefore we use trade data per food item from the fao detailed trade matrix more specifically average annual values for the period 2010 2013 by using 4 years we account for interannual fluctuations we select countries so that they represent at least 50 of total food item imports for these countries we obtain average national green and blue wfprod values from mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 for crop products and from mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 for livestock products for the remaining food item import because it is practically almost impossible to account for all imports because some are very minor in quantity we use average global wfprod values to compute the green and blue wfcons of a food item consumed in hong kong we weigh the wfprod values of origin countries according to their contribution to the total import amounts all these values food item fao fbs values main countries of import origin with wfprod values food item wfcons values for hong kong are displayed in table s2 we also include a wf for fish and seafood because a recent publication pahlow et al 2015 has provided relevant wf quantifications for fish feed for pond evaporation the blue wf value of verdegem et al 2006 is taken aquaculture will soon surpass wild fisheries as the main source of seafood this reflects the transition which happened on land in the past with the evolution from hunting to farming neglecting the wf of fish and seafood consumption therefore underestimates the wfcons related to food consumption the fao fbs values for hong kong are data on food supply displayed as food supply data in table 2 i e food reaching the consumer in private households as well as that in the non household sector i e catering establishments schools hospitals prisons armed forces bases and other communities the data are given on an as purchased basis i e as the food leaves the retail shop or enters the household by other means quantities are provided on the basis of primary equivalents within the fao fbs food data are standardized in that processed commodities are converted back to their primary equivalent this is for standardization different countries report their data to the fao simplification and limitation of the number of commodities within the fbs e g instead of listing flour of wheat bread or pasta separately in the fbs they are quantified as wheat equivalent similarly meat is quantified as carcass weight in the fbs fish and seafood are expressed as live weight equivalents in order to compute food intake amounts food quantities people actually eat based upon faostat fbs food supply amounts two correction factors are necessary with the first one corr1 food consumption retail product amounts are computed from food supply amounts the second one corr2 accounts for consumer food waste both at home and at the food service catering level and computes food intake amounts from food consumption retail product amounts for all product groups these values are listed in table 2 this methodology was also used and described in vanham et al 2013a b product consumer food waste values for hong kong are not available as such other sources were used to determine corr2 values as listed in table 3 to determine the direct water use of hong kong citizens i e the municipal wf data on water use were assembled from the water supplies department of hong kong more particularly data on total and per capita municipal and domestic water abstraction were obtained from its annual reports hong kong water supplies department 2015 municipal water use 326 l cap d abstraction in 2013 includes domestic water use 192 l cap d in 2013 and commercial water use or water for services commercial water use includes the water use of small businesses hotels offices hospitals schools and other institutions municipal water use also represents water for non permanent residents like commuters or tourists in municipal water use we also include water use for flushing of pipes as well as water losses it is important to distinguish between water abstraction or water withdrawal and water consumption or consumptive water use the difference between the two is returned water the direct water use or blue wf blue water consumption of municipal water use is calculated based upon the municipal abstraction in 2013 326 l cap d the major sources of actual consumption consist of water lost through evapotranspiration from leaking supply and sewerage pipes from watering plants and recreational areas washing streets and garden plots the extent of the evapotranspiration also depends on climatic conditions for hong kong because generally all wastewater is directly discharged in the sea all abstraction can be regarded as consumptive use 2 2 diets apart from the reference situation 1996 2005 we analyse 3 diet scenarios the healthy diet scenario healthy we use the food based dietary guidelines of the chinese nutrition society 2015 as displayed in the chinese food guide pagoda fig 1 the third and last version of the chinese fbdg was compelled by the chinese nutrition society in 2007 and proclaimed by the ministry of health in early 2008 ge 2011 the second version dates from 1997 in fig 1 we show the latest version but also the values from 1997 the revised pagoda kept the previous food grouping and placement but altered the amount of some food groups especially for milk products the new recommendation is much higher based upon specific energy requirements for different population groups ge 2011 ge et al 2007 and the population distribution of hong kong hong kong statistics 2015a we calculate an average recommended energy requirement of 2122 kcal cap d 2204 kcal cap d for men and 2049 kcal cap d for women recommended food product intake values for this energy requirement are listed in table 4 the pesco vegetarian diet scenario pesco veg identical as healthy but all meat and offals are substituted with products from the product group pulses animal fats are substituted with crop oils all these substitutions results in the same total kcal and protein values the vegetarian diet scenario veg identical as pesco veg but all fish is substituted with products from the product group pulses with the same kcal and protein values 2 3 impact assessment we make a general evaluation identification of blue water scarcity related to the production of food items in countries where hong kong imports from thereby we can identify the level of water related risk to hong kong s food security to achieve this we use the blue water scarcity database described in mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 who assessed global blue water scarcity or water stress on a monthly basis at the level of grid cells of 30 30 arc minutes blue water scarcity ws is here defined as the ratio between consumptive blue water use the blue wf and environmentally available water the latter being available blue water resources minus environmental flow requirements efrs this definition of water stress is in line with the requirements of a water stress indicator vanham et al 2018 a widely used definition of environmental flow is the quality quantity and timing of water flows required to maintain the components functions processes and resilience of aquatic ecosystems which provide goods and services to people hirji 2009 regarding efrs mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 adopted the presumptive environmental flow standard according to which 80 of the natural runoff is allocated as efr the remaining 20 can be considered as blue water available for human use without affecting the integrity of downstream water dependent ecosystems and livelihoods to account for temporal changes in water availability and demand mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 provide their analysis on a monthly level annual average monthly blue ws per grid cell was estimated by averaging the monthly scarcity values blue ws is called low when in a grid cell ws 1 when the blue water footprint does not exceed blue water availability in which case efrs are met moderate when 1 ws 1 5 significant when 1 5 ws 2 and severe when ws 2 in our study we identify whether food items hong kong imports have a blue wf located in water scarce regions we then evaluate the average national ws in grid cells where a particular food item is produced for the main import source countries of hong kong we identify grid cells where these food items are produced by means of the data of the gis database on the wfprod bl of main crop products from mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 this database includes maize wheat rice sugarcane and soybeans only grid cells with a wfprod bl are selected grid cells with only a wfprod gn component are not selected to compute average national ws for a product item in countries hong kong imports from the gis database on crop production from monfreda et al 2008 this database includes additional products like oranges grapes or specific tree nuts pistachios or almonds here we select all grid cells in a country because we lack information on which grid cell is irrigated or not 3 results and discussion 3 1 the reference situation as shown in fig 2 both the municipal and domestic water withdrawals of hong kong have after a decade of steady increase stabilized and then gradually decreased since 2003 although the population has not stopped to grow hong kong has indeed put a lot of effort in decreasing its direct water use therefore the municipal wf blue water is calculated based upon the municipal water abstraction of 2013 326 l cap d and is 326 l cap d according to the database of mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 annual water stress in the hong kong area where the city takes it direct water use from is low 1 particular monthly values are however higher this database is course in its resolution and local ws values can differ the wfcons gn bl related to food consumption in hong kong amounts to 4727 l cap d fig 3 this indirect water use is about 15 times the amount of the direct water use of hong kong especially the intake of meat contributes a large part to this indirect water use interesting to see is the typical urban food consumption behaviour of hong kong as compared to the food consumption behaviour in china as a whole fig s1 and table s1 total food supply to china is 657 kg cap yr and to hong kong 794 kg cap yr with a large difference in the relative composition of the different food groups in china supply of cereals including potatoes 233 kg cap yr and vegetables 230 kg cap yr is much higher than in hong kong 131 respectively 112 kg cap yr but in hong kong the food supply of sugar crop oils fruit meat and offals fish and seafood and milk and milk products are much higher especially the amounts of meat 154 kg cap yr offals 24 kg cap yr and fish and seafood 63 kg cap yr are extremely high even as compared to the eu average 85 respectively 4 and 21 kg cap yr as a matter of fact meat supply in hong kong is amongst the highest in the world as a result the wfcons gn bl 4727 l cap d related to food consumption in hong kong is almost double the chinese wfcons gn bl 2413 l cap d that is because it requires a lot of water to produce product groups like meat fish sugar or milk i e their wfprod is very high as displayed in table s2 3 2 diet scenarios a comparison of the current hong kong diet with the scenario healthy shows that the current average diet is not healthy as displayed in table 5 the intake of some product groups should be increased vegetables fruits but also milk and milk products and of others decreased sugar crop oils meat offals and animal fats the intake of fish and seafood is as recommended current energy intake 2960 kcal cap d protein intake 114 1 g cap d and fat intake 127 5 g cap d related to the basic food groups not taking stimulants alcoholic beverages or spices into account will decrease with a healthy diet to 2260 kcal cap d 72 4 g cap d and 66 4 g cap d respectively this energy intake reaches the target energy intake of 2122 kcal cap d quite well the pesco veg and veg scenarios show about the same energy protein and fat values as the healthy scenario a shift to a healthy diet would reduce the wfcons gn bl substantially by 40 from 4727 l cap d to 2852 l cap d fig 3 especially the decrease in meat intake has a major effect on the wfcons gn bl reduction as the meat related wfcons gn bl decreases from 2134 l cap d to 466 l cap d the pesco veg scenario reduces the wfcons gn bl by 49 to 2398 l cap d the veg scenario decreases the wfcons gn bl by 53 to 2224 l cap d when the blue and green wf components are assessed separately the wfcons also decreases for all scenarios with respect to the current situation fig 4 for the wfcons gn the observations are generally the same as for the wfcons gn bl however for the wfcons bl the dominance of the meat fraction disappears decreases in the wfcons bl of meat and offals pulses nuts and oilcrops as well as sugar for all three diet scenarios contribute mainly to the overall decrease in the total wfcons bl increases in the wfcons bl of fruit and cereals partly compensate for these decreases in all three diet scenarios recommendations on the intake of milk and milk products by the chinese nutrition society increased from 100 g cap d in 1997 to 300 g cap d in 2007 fig 1 we used the most recent values these lead to high wfcons amounts figs 3 and 4 healthy as it requires a lot of water to produce milk table 2 the protein and fat intake with this milk intake is also high table 5 an increase to 500 g cap d would increase the wfcons of healthy significantly when visiting a dairy farm in chongqing in april 2006 premier wen jiabao made the 500 gram dairy declaration stating i have a dream that every chinese especially children could have 0 5 kg of dairy products every day jiabao 2008 3 3 impact of hong kong s food consumption wf the total wfcons bl related to food consumption in hong kong is 634 l cap d which equals about 1 6 km3 yr of blue water table 6 some main food items are responsible for the highest fractions of this amount as also displayed in fig 4 rice with a wfcons bl of 62 l cap d or 0 152 km3 yr has a relatively high value we chose this crop as more detailed example of hong kong s food consumption ws impact as it is a chinese staple crop with a relatively high wf the rice imported by hong kong is partly produced under conditions of water scarcity ws table 6 and fig 5 thai rice which represents 55 of consumed rice in hong kong is e g produced under an average ws condition of 3 2 severe ws vietnamese rice 30 of consumed rice in hong kong is produced under a ws of 2 0 significant for chinese australian and us rice 9 2 1 4 and 1 1 of consumed rice ws values are 1 5 moderate 4 8 severe and 1 4 moderate due to hong kong s relatively low total rice supply amount of 343 103 tonnes yr on the global market these imports represent generally only a low fraction of the total wfprod bl of rice in the countries of origin thai rice consumed in hong kong has a wfcons bl of 0 102 km3 yr which only represents about 1 of the total thai wfprod bl of rice 9 682 km3 yr nevertheless this shows the unsustainable production of rice in the countries hong kong imports rice from especially in australia with a ws value of 4 8 severe in the rice producing region of the murray darling basin khan et al 2009 it is questionable if this practice can be maintained in the long run from the viewpoint of hong kong rice import might be at risk from this location a global map on ws related to the production of food products with a high wfcons bl consumed in hong kong is shown in fig 6 this includes wheat rice sugar selected tree nuts pistachios and almonds oranges grapes and maize and soybeans as proxy for livestock products table 6 the areas identified in the map are hotspots with moderate to severe water scarcity it is clear that these imported products represent to a certain level a future water related risk for food security in hong kong a reduction in this risk is achieved in the three diet scenarios which all result in a decrease of the total wfcons bl fig 4 less meat intake results in a strong reduction of the total wfcons bl also less intake of sugar and products from the group pulses nuts and oilcrops contribute to a lower total wfcons bl especially nuts like pistachios and almonds have very high wfprod bl values on the other hand the recommended increased intake of fruit compensates for this decrease this is because in our analysis we kept the relative fractions of food items within their product groups constant for the diet scenarios choosing for an increased intake of fruit that has not such high wfprod bl values is a smart way to tackle this issue 3 4 limitations and further research the consumption of other goods leads to additional indirect water uses by hong kong citizens in our study we only focus on the indirect water use related to food consumption as such the total hong kong wfcons will be even higher when additional water uses will be included this includes green and blue water resources for non edible agricultural products e g cotton for clothes industrial goods or forestry e g paper or wood for energy a full list of water uses that lead to additional wfcons components is given in vanham 2016 we did not separate between surface and groundwater use in our analysis as recommended by vanham et al 2018 the ws data we used e g do not identify groundwater depletion although the rapidly depletion of aquifers is a major global issue dalin et al 2017 scanlon et al 2012 wada et al 2010 which poses a serious threat for global food security to assess the environmental sustainability of a wf not only the impact blue ws needs to be addressed vanham et al 2018 but also the water efficiency productivity of a wf sustainable development goal 6 4 states by 2030 substantially increase water use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity a way to assess water productivity of agricultural products is to work with wf benchmarks which include green and blue water as e g described in mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 recently a study addressing these 2 issues for the wf of the uk has been published hoekstra and mekonnen 2016 in addition by not integrating the grey wf component water quality has not been taken into account in our study increasing water productivity often comes at the expense of decreasing water quality in agriculture an important trade off these issues are subject to further research for the wfcons of hong kong there is a need for better food waste statistics for the city of hong kong our selection of food waste fractions for product groups corr2 values in table 2 is based upon literature values which have not a hong kong focus these were however best available data also liu et al 2013 indicate that there is a lack of detailed food waste data in china we only found one statistic on consumer food waste for hong kong i e the hong kong environmental protection department 2015 states that in 2014 a total of 2608 tonnes per day of domestic food waste from households were disposed of in landfills this equals about 132 kg cap yr we calculated a consumer household and catering sector food waste of 83 kg cap yr this value results from the difference between the total food intake 655 kg cap yr and the food consumption retail product 706 kg cap yr plus the waste resulting from the cleaning of fish 31 kg cap yr values displayed in table 2 we can thus conclude that our corr2 values are conservative underestimating a food waste quantification campaign in hong kong with differentiation between households and the catering sector as well as between different product groups would therefore be very valuable with such data this study could be even more refined 4 conclusions during the last decade direct urban water use has decreased in many modern cities in hong kong municipal water abstraction the municipal or direct water footprint has decreased from 355 l cap d in 2005 to 326 l cap d in 2013 although its population steadily increased during this period citizens and policy makers at the urban level are generally well informed on their direct water use and the possibilities for more sustainable water use this direct water use represents however only about 1 15th of the wf related to food consumption wfcons gn bl in hong kong 4727 l cap d fig 3 meat consumption accounts for 45 2134 l cap d of this total value most of this amount represents green water 4093 l cap d fig 4 blue water accounts for 634 l cap d about 1 6 km3 yr this blue water amount is partly imported through food products produced within a water scarcity setting ws most rice consumed in hong kong e g is produced under moderate to severe ws in thailand vietnam china the usa or australia fig 5 other food items consumed in hong kong with a high wfcons bl contributing to local ws are wheat sugar selected tree nuts pistachios and almonds oranges grapes and livestock products table 6 and fig 6 to some extent they pose a water related risk to food security in hong kong it can happen in future that producing countries will not export these product anymore because of several reasons e g focus on domestic food security addressing local water scarcity depleting aquifers less water availability due to climate change decreased production quantities the current average diet in hong kong is not healthy according to chinese dietary guidelines it contains too much meat offals sugar crop oils and animal fats and not enough vegetables fruit and milk products the intake of meat including offals needs to be reduced by 79 overall energy 2960 kcal cap d for basic food groups and protein 114 1 g cap d intakes are too high and need to be reduced we show that all three diet scenarios come close to the recommended energy requirement of 2122 kcal cap d which is calculated based upon the population distribution of hong kong they also achieve more recommendable protein and fat intake levels the diet scenarios result in substantial wf reductions the wfcons gn bl reduces 40 for healthy 49 for pesco veg and 53 for veg fig 3 the wfcons gn reduces 43 for healthy 53 for pesco veg and 55 for veg fig 4 for the blue wf the reductions are lower the wfcons bl reduces 21 for healthy 25 for pesco veg and 38 for veg these wfcons bl reductions contribute to a decrease in the water related risk for food security in hong kong these diet scenarios present a win win situation because 1 they result in a healthier lifestyle for hong kong citizens where 47 of the population is already overweight or obese 2 it is expected they save in healthcare costs and 3 they also save large quantities of the precious resource water resulting in a decreased water related risk for hong kong food security acknowledgements we would like to

6567,during the last years the city of hong kong has made large investments to make its urban water supply system more water efficient and sustainable as such its municipal water abstraction often defined as direct water use has decreased from 355 litre per capita per day l cap d in 2005 to 326 l cap d in 2013 due to its political history hong kong is unique in the world in data availability on urban food consumption it is therefore the ideal case study to show typical urban food consumption behaviour and its related indirect water use the objective of this paper is to show the large water quantities associated with indirect water use and that the citizens of hong kong can additionally save much more water by looking at this indirect water use the current average diet in hong kong is very different to the average chinese diet it is characterised by a high intake of water intensive products like animal products and sugar leading to a food related indirect water use or water footprint wfcons of 4727 l cap d according to recommendations from the chinese nutrition society for a healthy diet the intake of some product groups should be increased vegetables and fruit and of other product groups reduced sugar crop oils meat and animal fats this would result in a reduction of the wfcons of 40 to 2852 l cap d especially the reduced intake of meat including offals from currently 126 kg per capita per year kg cap yr to the recommended value 27 kg cap yrwould results in a substantial wfcons reduction meat consumption in hong kong is extremely high a pesco vegetarian diet would result in a reduction of 49 to 2398 l cap d and a vegetarian diet in a 53 to 2224 l cap d reduction hong kong citizens can thus save a lot of water through a change in their diet many of the products consumed contribute to different levels of blue water scarcity in the regions of origin hong kong imports from this poses a water related risk to food security in hong kong as all diet scenarios also result in a lower blue wfcons they decrease this risk in order to become sustainable mega cities should reduce their dependency on distant resources and ecosystems 1 introduction cities are hotspots of consumption the un has identified sustainable cities and communities as one of its sustainable development goals sdgs as such the extent to which urban dwellers consume resources is key on the path to a sustainable world one of these resources is water which is consumed in a direct and indirect way by city inhabitants vanham and bidoglio 2014 while most people are aware of their direct water consumption they are not of their indirect water consumption the latter is defined as the water that is required to produce the goods and services city inhabitants consume i e their water footprint hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 many modern cities have invested a lot of money in a more water efficient and sustainable urban water cycle e g by reducing water leakages koop and van leeuwen 2015 as such direct urban water use has decreased in the last decade in many modern cities awareness raising campaigns and policy have generally focused on increasing water efficiency in domestic and industrial water use e g by using tap water wisely or by increasing water efficiency of washing machines or dishwashers the hong kong special administration region hksar government has during recent years implemented a wide range of water conservation measures which include metering and a tiered water tariff large scale replacement and rehabilitation of ageing pipelines to reduce leakage the use of sea water for toilet flushing and education and publicity programmes hong kong statistics 2015b yue and tang 2011 although these measures are very important to reduce direct water use the objective of this paper is to show that the citizens of hong kong can additionally save much more water by looking at their indirect water use urban centres are very much dependent on distant resources ecosystems and populations more particularly our objective is to show that using hong kong as a case study 1 indirect water use is responsible for enormous water quantities in cities and 2 water can also be saved by urban dwellers by looking at their diets indeed based upon planetary boundaries rockstrom et al 2009 sustainable solutions in water management need to come from both the supply and demand side within a systems approach expo eu scientific committee 2015 addressing the water energy food ecosystems nexus context vanham 2016 supply side solutions include water efficiency in the urban water cycle or agricultural water production godfray et al 2010 whereas demand side solutions include diet habits godfray et al 2010 vanham et al 2013b or the reduction of food waste vanham et al 2015 although cities can never become fully self sufficient it is important that they contribute to global sustainability and resilience by optimizing resource use increasing efficiency and minimizing waste elmqvist 2014 in this paper we analyse the indirect water consumption related to food intake in the city of hong kong by means of the water footprint concept hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 vanham and bidoglio 2013 both direct water use and indirect water use together are defined as the water footprint of consumption wfcons of a city water footprint assessments on the city level have not been the focus of research in the past paterson et al 2015 during recent years several studies have however been conducted e g hoff et al 2014 jenerette et al 2006 kennedy et al 2015 ma et al 2015 rushforth and ruddell 2016 city water footprint analyses related to food consumption including diet scenarios have been conducted for a range of pan european cities i e for milan vanham and bidoglio 2014 dutch cities vanham et al 2016b mediterranean cities vanham et al 2016a and nordic cities vanham et al 2017 in our study we focus on indirect water use related to food consumption in hong kong today overconsumption and undernutrition go together in china there are now important differences in food consumption behaviour between urban and rural regions in china not at least related to increased income differences dong and hu 2010 zhang et al 2008 also in hong kong overconsumption and undernutrition go hand in hand with associated health problems a total of 47 of the hong kong population 54 of the males and 41 of the females are overweight or obese according to the world health organisation who proposed classification of weight by bmi in adult asians cuhk 2010 another 9 is underweight cuhk 2010 we assess the wfcons of food for the current situation reference period 1996 2005 or ref three diet scenarios o a healthy diet as recommended by the chinese food guide pagoda chinese nutrition society 2015 or healthy o a healthy pesco vegetarian diet or pesco veg o a healthy vegetarian diet or veg the production of certain agricultural products crop and livestock products can attribute to blue water scarcity hong kong might import food items from regions where water scarcity occurs thereby putting a risk to its food security therefore we make a general evaluation of whether products imported by hong kong are produced under blue water scarcity conditions the latter being the ratio between consumptive water use and ecologically available water 2 methodology 2 1 accounting framework a list of abbreviations used in this study is given in table 1 a workflow scheme of the methodology used in this study is displayed in fig 1 to assess wf values the volumetric approach of the water footprint network or wfn hoekstra et al 2011 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 is applied we use the blue and green wf components following the definition of rockström et al 2009 green water is the soil water held in the unsaturated zone formed by precipitation and available to plants blue water refers to liquid water in rivers lakes wetlands and aquifers irrigated agriculture receives blue water from irrigation as well as green water from precipitation while rainfed agriculture receives only green water the green wf is thus the rainwater consumed by crops the inclusion of green water is a necessity in integrated water resources management iwrm as argued by most authors and institutions working on iwrm gerten et al 2013 hoekstra 2016 hoff et al 2014 jalava et al 2016 2014 karimi et al 2013 miina et al 2016 ran et al 2016 rockström et al 2014 schyns et al 2015 vanham 2012 we do not use the grey wf as its quantification is very dependent on data availability thaler et al 2012 vanham and bidoglio 2013 to compute the water footprint of consumption wfcons related to food consumption we use fao food balance sheets fbs for hong kong for the reference period 1996 2005 and or 2010 2013 as indicated these data are unique as they provide for food consumption behaviour of a city when average annual food consumption data of a food item during 2010 2013 differed more than 5 from the 1996 2005 values we used 2010 2013 data with 2013 being the latest data available during the writing of this paper otherwise we used 1996 2005 data to compute wfcons values for hong kong we need wf of production wfprod values for the food product groups consumed in hong kong almost 100 of this food is imported therefore we use trade data per food item from the fao detailed trade matrix more specifically average annual values for the period 2010 2013 by using 4 years we account for interannual fluctuations we select countries so that they represent at least 50 of total food item imports for these countries we obtain average national green and blue wfprod values from mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 for crop products and from mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 for livestock products for the remaining food item import because it is practically almost impossible to account for all imports because some are very minor in quantity we use average global wfprod values to compute the green and blue wfcons of a food item consumed in hong kong we weigh the wfprod values of origin countries according to their contribution to the total import amounts all these values food item fao fbs values main countries of import origin with wfprod values food item wfcons values for hong kong are displayed in table s2 we also include a wf for fish and seafood because a recent publication pahlow et al 2015 has provided relevant wf quantifications for fish feed for pond evaporation the blue wf value of verdegem et al 2006 is taken aquaculture will soon surpass wild fisheries as the main source of seafood this reflects the transition which happened on land in the past with the evolution from hunting to farming neglecting the wf of fish and seafood consumption therefore underestimates the wfcons related to food consumption the fao fbs values for hong kong are data on food supply displayed as food supply data in table 2 i e food reaching the consumer in private households as well as that in the non household sector i e catering establishments schools hospitals prisons armed forces bases and other communities the data are given on an as purchased basis i e as the food leaves the retail shop or enters the household by other means quantities are provided on the basis of primary equivalents within the fao fbs food data are standardized in that processed commodities are converted back to their primary equivalent this is for standardization different countries report their data to the fao simplification and limitation of the number of commodities within the fbs e g instead of listing flour of wheat bread or pasta separately in the fbs they are quantified as wheat equivalent similarly meat is quantified as carcass weight in the fbs fish and seafood are expressed as live weight equivalents in order to compute food intake amounts food quantities people actually eat based upon faostat fbs food supply amounts two correction factors are necessary with the first one corr1 food consumption retail product amounts are computed from food supply amounts the second one corr2 accounts for consumer food waste both at home and at the food service catering level and computes food intake amounts from food consumption retail product amounts for all product groups these values are listed in table 2 this methodology was also used and described in vanham et al 2013a b product consumer food waste values for hong kong are not available as such other sources were used to determine corr2 values as listed in table 3 to determine the direct water use of hong kong citizens i e the municipal wf data on water use were assembled from the water supplies department of hong kong more particularly data on total and per capita municipal and domestic water abstraction were obtained from its annual reports hong kong water supplies department 2015 municipal water use 326 l cap d abstraction in 2013 includes domestic water use 192 l cap d in 2013 and commercial water use or water for services commercial water use includes the water use of small businesses hotels offices hospitals schools and other institutions municipal water use also represents water for non permanent residents like commuters or tourists in municipal water use we also include water use for flushing of pipes as well as water losses it is important to distinguish between water abstraction or water withdrawal and water consumption or consumptive water use the difference between the two is returned water the direct water use or blue wf blue water consumption of municipal water use is calculated based upon the municipal abstraction in 2013 326 l cap d the major sources of actual consumption consist of water lost through evapotranspiration from leaking supply and sewerage pipes from watering plants and recreational areas washing streets and garden plots the extent of the evapotranspiration also depends on climatic conditions for hong kong because generally all wastewater is directly discharged in the sea all abstraction can be regarded as consumptive use 2 2 diets apart from the reference situation 1996 2005 we analyse 3 diet scenarios the healthy diet scenario healthy we use the food based dietary guidelines of the chinese nutrition society 2015 as displayed in the chinese food guide pagoda fig 1 the third and last version of the chinese fbdg was compelled by the chinese nutrition society in 2007 and proclaimed by the ministry of health in early 2008 ge 2011 the second version dates from 1997 in fig 1 we show the latest version but also the values from 1997 the revised pagoda kept the previous food grouping and placement but altered the amount of some food groups especially for milk products the new recommendation is much higher based upon specific energy requirements for different population groups ge 2011 ge et al 2007 and the population distribution of hong kong hong kong statistics 2015a we calculate an average recommended energy requirement of 2122 kcal cap d 2204 kcal cap d for men and 2049 kcal cap d for women recommended food product intake values for this energy requirement are listed in table 4 the pesco vegetarian diet scenario pesco veg identical as healthy but all meat and offals are substituted with products from the product group pulses animal fats are substituted with crop oils all these substitutions results in the same total kcal and protein values the vegetarian diet scenario veg identical as pesco veg but all fish is substituted with products from the product group pulses with the same kcal and protein values 2 3 impact assessment we make a general evaluation identification of blue water scarcity related to the production of food items in countries where hong kong imports from thereby we can identify the level of water related risk to hong kong s food security to achieve this we use the blue water scarcity database described in mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 who assessed global blue water scarcity or water stress on a monthly basis at the level of grid cells of 30 30 arc minutes blue water scarcity ws is here defined as the ratio between consumptive blue water use the blue wf and environmentally available water the latter being available blue water resources minus environmental flow requirements efrs this definition of water stress is in line with the requirements of a water stress indicator vanham et al 2018 a widely used definition of environmental flow is the quality quantity and timing of water flows required to maintain the components functions processes and resilience of aquatic ecosystems which provide goods and services to people hirji 2009 regarding efrs mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 adopted the presumptive environmental flow standard according to which 80 of the natural runoff is allocated as efr the remaining 20 can be considered as blue water available for human use without affecting the integrity of downstream water dependent ecosystems and livelihoods to account for temporal changes in water availability and demand mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 provide their analysis on a monthly level annual average monthly blue ws per grid cell was estimated by averaging the monthly scarcity values blue ws is called low when in a grid cell ws 1 when the blue water footprint does not exceed blue water availability in which case efrs are met moderate when 1 ws 1 5 significant when 1 5 ws 2 and severe when ws 2 in our study we identify whether food items hong kong imports have a blue wf located in water scarce regions we then evaluate the average national ws in grid cells where a particular food item is produced for the main import source countries of hong kong we identify grid cells where these food items are produced by means of the data of the gis database on the wfprod bl of main crop products from mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 this database includes maize wheat rice sugarcane and soybeans only grid cells with a wfprod bl are selected grid cells with only a wfprod gn component are not selected to compute average national ws for a product item in countries hong kong imports from the gis database on crop production from monfreda et al 2008 this database includes additional products like oranges grapes or specific tree nuts pistachios or almonds here we select all grid cells in a country because we lack information on which grid cell is irrigated or not 3 results and discussion 3 1 the reference situation as shown in fig 2 both the municipal and domestic water withdrawals of hong kong have after a decade of steady increase stabilized and then gradually decreased since 2003 although the population has not stopped to grow hong kong has indeed put a lot of effort in decreasing its direct water use therefore the municipal wf blue water is calculated based upon the municipal water abstraction of 2013 326 l cap d and is 326 l cap d according to the database of mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 annual water stress in the hong kong area where the city takes it direct water use from is low 1 particular monthly values are however higher this database is course in its resolution and local ws values can differ the wfcons gn bl related to food consumption in hong kong amounts to 4727 l cap d fig 3 this indirect water use is about 15 times the amount of the direct water use of hong kong especially the intake of meat contributes a large part to this indirect water use interesting to see is the typical urban food consumption behaviour of hong kong as compared to the food consumption behaviour in china as a whole fig s1 and table s1 total food supply to china is 657 kg cap yr and to hong kong 794 kg cap yr with a large difference in the relative composition of the different food groups in china supply of cereals including potatoes 233 kg cap yr and vegetables 230 kg cap yr is much higher than in hong kong 131 respectively 112 kg cap yr but in hong kong the food supply of sugar crop oils fruit meat and offals fish and seafood and milk and milk products are much higher especially the amounts of meat 154 kg cap yr offals 24 kg cap yr and fish and seafood 63 kg cap yr are extremely high even as compared to the eu average 85 respectively 4 and 21 kg cap yr as a matter of fact meat supply in hong kong is amongst the highest in the world as a result the wfcons gn bl 4727 l cap d related to food consumption in hong kong is almost double the chinese wfcons gn bl 2413 l cap d that is because it requires a lot of water to produce product groups like meat fish sugar or milk i e their wfprod is very high as displayed in table s2 3 2 diet scenarios a comparison of the current hong kong diet with the scenario healthy shows that the current average diet is not healthy as displayed in table 5 the intake of some product groups should be increased vegetables fruits but also milk and milk products and of others decreased sugar crop oils meat offals and animal fats the intake of fish and seafood is as recommended current energy intake 2960 kcal cap d protein intake 114 1 g cap d and fat intake 127 5 g cap d related to the basic food groups not taking stimulants alcoholic beverages or spices into account will decrease with a healthy diet to 2260 kcal cap d 72 4 g cap d and 66 4 g cap d respectively this energy intake reaches the target energy intake of 2122 kcal cap d quite well the pesco veg and veg scenarios show about the same energy protein and fat values as the healthy scenario a shift to a healthy diet would reduce the wfcons gn bl substantially by 40 from 4727 l cap d to 2852 l cap d fig 3 especially the decrease in meat intake has a major effect on the wfcons gn bl reduction as the meat related wfcons gn bl decreases from 2134 l cap d to 466 l cap d the pesco veg scenario reduces the wfcons gn bl by 49 to 2398 l cap d the veg scenario decreases the wfcons gn bl by 53 to 2224 l cap d when the blue and green wf components are assessed separately the wfcons also decreases for all scenarios with respect to the current situation fig 4 for the wfcons gn the observations are generally the same as for the wfcons gn bl however for the wfcons bl the dominance of the meat fraction disappears decreases in the wfcons bl of meat and offals pulses nuts and oilcrops as well as sugar for all three diet scenarios contribute mainly to the overall decrease in the total wfcons bl increases in the wfcons bl of fruit and cereals partly compensate for these decreases in all three diet scenarios recommendations on the intake of milk and milk products by the chinese nutrition society increased from 100 g cap d in 1997 to 300 g cap d in 2007 fig 1 we used the most recent values these lead to high wfcons amounts figs 3 and 4 healthy as it requires a lot of water to produce milk table 2 the protein and fat intake with this milk intake is also high table 5 an increase to 500 g cap d would increase the wfcons of healthy significantly when visiting a dairy farm in chongqing in april 2006 premier wen jiabao made the 500 gram dairy declaration stating i have a dream that every chinese especially children could have 0 5 kg of dairy products every day jiabao 2008 3 3 impact of hong kong s food consumption wf the total wfcons bl related to food consumption in hong kong is 634 l cap d which equals about 1 6 km3 yr of blue water table 6 some main food items are responsible for the highest fractions of this amount as also displayed in fig 4 rice with a wfcons bl of 62 l cap d or 0 152 km3 yr has a relatively high value we chose this crop as more detailed example of hong kong s food consumption ws impact as it is a chinese staple crop with a relatively high wf the rice imported by hong kong is partly produced under conditions of water scarcity ws table 6 and fig 5 thai rice which represents 55 of consumed rice in hong kong is e g produced under an average ws condition of 3 2 severe ws vietnamese rice 30 of consumed rice in hong kong is produced under a ws of 2 0 significant for chinese australian and us rice 9 2 1 4 and 1 1 of consumed rice ws values are 1 5 moderate 4 8 severe and 1 4 moderate due to hong kong s relatively low total rice supply amount of 343 103 tonnes yr on the global market these imports represent generally only a low fraction of the total wfprod bl of rice in the countries of origin thai rice consumed in hong kong has a wfcons bl of 0 102 km3 yr which only represents about 1 of the total thai wfprod bl of rice 9 682 km3 yr nevertheless this shows the unsustainable production of rice in the countries hong kong imports rice from especially in australia with a ws value of 4 8 severe in the rice producing region of the murray darling basin khan et al 2009 it is questionable if this practice can be maintained in the long run from the viewpoint of hong kong rice import might be at risk from this location a global map on ws related to the production of food products with a high wfcons bl consumed in hong kong is shown in fig 6 this includes wheat rice sugar selected tree nuts pistachios and almonds oranges grapes and maize and soybeans as proxy for livestock products table 6 the areas identified in the map are hotspots with moderate to severe water scarcity it is clear that these imported products represent to a certain level a future water related risk for food security in hong kong a reduction in this risk is achieved in the three diet scenarios which all result in a decrease of the total wfcons bl fig 4 less meat intake results in a strong reduction of the total wfcons bl also less intake of sugar and products from the group pulses nuts and oilcrops contribute to a lower total wfcons bl especially nuts like pistachios and almonds have very high wfprod bl values on the other hand the recommended increased intake of fruit compensates for this decrease this is because in our analysis we kept the relative fractions of food items within their product groups constant for the diet scenarios choosing for an increased intake of fruit that has not such high wfprod bl values is a smart way to tackle this issue 3 4 limitations and further research the consumption of other goods leads to additional indirect water uses by hong kong citizens in our study we only focus on the indirect water use related to food consumption as such the total hong kong wfcons will be even higher when additional water uses will be included this includes green and blue water resources for non edible agricultural products e g cotton for clothes industrial goods or forestry e g paper or wood for energy a full list of water uses that lead to additional wfcons components is given in vanham 2016 we did not separate between surface and groundwater use in our analysis as recommended by vanham et al 2018 the ws data we used e g do not identify groundwater depletion although the rapidly depletion of aquifers is a major global issue dalin et al 2017 scanlon et al 2012 wada et al 2010 which poses a serious threat for global food security to assess the environmental sustainability of a wf not only the impact blue ws needs to be addressed vanham et al 2018 but also the water efficiency productivity of a wf sustainable development goal 6 4 states by 2030 substantially increase water use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity a way to assess water productivity of agricultural products is to work with wf benchmarks which include green and blue water as e g described in mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 recently a study addressing these 2 issues for the wf of the uk has been published hoekstra and mekonnen 2016 in addition by not integrating the grey wf component water quality has not been taken into account in our study increasing water productivity often comes at the expense of decreasing water quality in agriculture an important trade off these issues are subject to further research for the wfcons of hong kong there is a need for better food waste statistics for the city of hong kong our selection of food waste fractions for product groups corr2 values in table 2 is based upon literature values which have not a hong kong focus these were however best available data also liu et al 2013 indicate that there is a lack of detailed food waste data in china we only found one statistic on consumer food waste for hong kong i e the hong kong environmental protection department 2015 states that in 2014 a total of 2608 tonnes per day of domestic food waste from households were disposed of in landfills this equals about 132 kg cap yr we calculated a consumer household and catering sector food waste of 83 kg cap yr this value results from the difference between the total food intake 655 kg cap yr and the food consumption retail product 706 kg cap yr plus the waste resulting from the cleaning of fish 31 kg cap yr values displayed in table 2 we can thus conclude that our corr2 values are conservative underestimating a food waste quantification campaign in hong kong with differentiation between households and the catering sector as well as between different product groups would therefore be very valuable with such data this study could be even more refined 4 conclusions during the last decade direct urban water use has decreased in many modern cities in hong kong municipal water abstraction the municipal or direct water footprint has decreased from 355 l cap d in 2005 to 326 l cap d in 2013 although its population steadily increased during this period citizens and policy makers at the urban level are generally well informed on their direct water use and the possibilities for more sustainable water use this direct water use represents however only about 1 15th of the wf related to food consumption wfcons gn bl in hong kong 4727 l cap d fig 3 meat consumption accounts for 45 2134 l cap d of this total value most of this amount represents green water 4093 l cap d fig 4 blue water accounts for 634 l cap d about 1 6 km3 yr this blue water amount is partly imported through food products produced within a water scarcity setting ws most rice consumed in hong kong e g is produced under moderate to severe ws in thailand vietnam china the usa or australia fig 5 other food items consumed in hong kong with a high wfcons bl contributing to local ws are wheat sugar selected tree nuts pistachios and almonds oranges grapes and livestock products table 6 and fig 6 to some extent they pose a water related risk to food security in hong kong it can happen in future that producing countries will not export these product anymore because of several reasons e g focus on domestic food security addressing local water scarcity depleting aquifers less water availability due to climate change decreased production quantities the current average diet in hong kong is not healthy according to chinese dietary guidelines it contains too much meat offals sugar crop oils and animal fats and not enough vegetables fruit and milk products the intake of meat including offals needs to be reduced by 79 overall energy 2960 kcal cap d for basic food groups and protein 114 1 g cap d intakes are too high and need to be reduced we show that all three diet scenarios come close to the recommended energy requirement of 2122 kcal cap d which is calculated based upon the population distribution of hong kong they also achieve more recommendable protein and fat intake levels the diet scenarios result in substantial wf reductions the wfcons gn bl reduces 40 for healthy 49 for pesco veg and 53 for veg fig 3 the wfcons gn reduces 43 for healthy 53 for pesco veg and 55 for veg fig 4 for the blue wf the reductions are lower the wfcons bl reduces 21 for healthy 25 for pesco veg and 38 for veg these wfcons bl reductions contribute to a decrease in the water related risk for food security in hong kong these diet scenarios present a win win situation because 1 they result in a healthier lifestyle for hong kong citizens where 47 of the population is already overweight or obese 2 it is expected they save in healthcare costs and 3 they also save large quantities of the precious resource water resulting in a decreased water related risk for hong kong food security acknowledgements we would like to

6568,this article introduces the swat ag a modified swat for agro hydrological modeling as an enhanced hydrological model for simulating the hydrological processes in agricultural watershed with shallow water tables the model is developed based on the framework of the swat with significant improvements on describing the interactions of the vadose zone water groundwater salt and plant growth the main features of the swat ag include that it can simulate the close interactions of soil water and shallow groundwater with considering the capillary rise effects it provides functions to simulate the soil salt movement and salt stress on plant growth and it incorporates a balance based module on a sub basin scale for shallow aquifer with involving canal seepage and ditch drainage calculation model testing and application were conducted in jiyuan irrigation system located in the hetao of upper yellow river basin northwest china the comparison between simulated and observed data showed that the swat ag performed well and obviously better than the original swat in simulating the soil water and salt dynamics groundwater depth fluctuations and plant growth and water consumption the results showed that the nse averagely increased from 17 57 to 0 57 and from 0 71 to 0 79 for soil water storage and leaf area index respectively in typical croplands and natural patches in addition the effects of shallow groundwater in sustaining the agro ecosystems were reasonably revealed with the spatial analysis of evapotranspiration capillary rise and salt accumulation the test case proved that the proposed swat ag could efficiently enhance the functionality and practicality of hydrological models for agricultural watersheds with shallow groundwater keywords soil water and salt groundwater plant growth capillary rise balance based approach hydrological modeling 1 introduction hydrological models have become an efficient tool to quantitatively analyze watershed hydrological processes and regional water resources fatichi et al 2016 singh and woolhiser 2002 across the watershed irrigated agriculture is often one of the largest water users especially with the increasing food demand mclaughlin and kinzelbach 2015 rost et al 2008 sauer et al 2010 water use in irrigated areas has caused significant effects on various aspects of the hydrological cycle involving the surface runoff subsurface water movement salinity effects plant growth and evapotranspiration and water quality droogers et al 2000 scanlon et al 2007 tedeschi et al 2001 wang et al 2016 however the hydrological processes in agricultural areas i e agro hydrological processes are often oversimplified in most previous studies of watershed hydrological modeling in fact owing to the strong human interference agro hydrological processes are often far more different from the natural hydrological processes especially in the agricultural watershed with shallow groundwater environments the main distinctiveness of hydrological processes in agricultural watershed with shallow groundwater could be concluded as 1 the artificial infrastructure dominated surface water system i e with densely distributed irrigation canals and drainage ditches 2 the frequent and complex interactions among surface water vadose zone water groundwater and crops and natural vegetation 3 the soil salinity and its effects on crop production distributed from even the semi humid to arid regions kahlown et al 2005 liu et al 2010 northey et al 2006 satchithanantham et al 2014 wichelns and qadir 2014 therefore it is necessary and important to reasonably describe the distinctiveness for more realistic hydrological simulation and therefore to improve the model functionality and simulation accuracy in agricultural watersheds many simulation models have been developed and widely applied for the watershed hydrological modeling typically as the swat vic topkapi and mike she arnold et al 1998 ciarapica and todini 2002 liang et al 1994 refsgaard 1997 hydrological modeling is increasingly becoming integrated and interdisciplinary in recent years more aspects of or related to hydrological cycle e g groundwater flow overland flow vegetation growth and land surface energy have been involved in some models besides the traditional land surface hydrological processes such as swatmod gsflow and mike she kim et al 2008 markstrom et al 2008 sophocleous and perkins 2000 however these also bring very large computation loads and significant issues of model stability and parameter uncertainties this is especially significant for the physically based models that couple surface and subsurface flow as they implement a different set of one two and fully three dimensional representations and numerical solution techniques for coupling different hydrologic processes maxwell et al 2014 xu et al 2012 the problem has become a major factor of limiting the model practical use in watershed management at the meantime most of the existing watershed models still trend to oversimplify the agro hydrological processes and only a few researchers have attempted to involve the agricultural effects e g those from the canal ditch system and agronomic practices in watershed modeling ale et al 2012 santhi et al 2005 liu et al 2010 luo et al 2008 xie and cui 2011 however it is still far from sufficient when application in agricultural watersheds with shallow water tables in general the extended model development is necessary and deserved to be investigated for involving the distinctiveness of agro watersheds and especially making the model suitable for practical use the soil water assessment tools swat model is a conceptual semi distributed model having the advantages of modeling robustness comprehensiveness and effectiveness compared with other watershed hydrological models it is selected as the basis for our further model development swat model is an established watershed hydrological model gassman et al 2007 which has proven its potential to be adapted for simulation in agricultural areas e g simulating the soil water dynamics evapotranspiration crop growth and productivity in fields aouissi et al 2016 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 sinnathamby et al 2017 sun and ren 2014 panagopoulos et al 2014 it is efficient to simulate the hydrology of watersheds since it is mainly based on the balance based approach besides a key strength of swat is the flexibility of combining other modules and making deeper developments chen and wu 2012 sophocleous and perkins 2000 thus it is attractive to conduct the further model development for region scale agro hydrological modeling based on the framework of the swat therefore the objective of this study is to develop and enhance the hydrological model for simulating hydrology of agricultural watersheds with shallow water tables the original swat is thus significantly modified with improving the components of soil water and solute balance groundwater budget and plant growth the modification mainly involves 1 incorporating simulation on upward capillary rise to capture the interactions between vadose zone water and shallow groundwater 2 developing a multi layered salt balance module to describe the salt movement and salinity effects on plants and 3 establishing a groundwater balance module on a sub basin scale for shallow aquifer with involving various sinks sources especially including canal seepage and drainage the aims are to make the model be able to reasonably simulate the close interactions of surface water soil water and groundwater and the effects of water salt stress on plant growth the modified model hereinafter called swat ag was then applied and tested in a typical irrigated district with shallow water tables of the upper yellow river basin the case application could provide a comprehensive presentation of main features and applicability of our proposed model 2 model description 2 1 general description of swat ag the swat is a physically based watershed scale model developed to simulate hydrology and water quality under various land and water management practices it can predict the fates of water sediment and agricultural chemical yields with varying environmental conditions neitsch et al 2009 in swat simulation of the hydrology of a watershed is separated into two major phases the land phase and water routing phase for land phase swat divides a watershed into the sub basins which are further divided into hydrological response units hru an hru is a fundamental spatial unit with the homogenous slope land use and soil type the simulated processes are driven by the water balance equation that operates on a daily step on hru mainly including surface runoff estimated using the scs curve number or green ampt infiltration equation percolation simulated with a layered storage routing techniques soil evaporation and crop transpiration combined with the simplified epic plant growth model and groundwater storage and the discharge into streams from shallow aquifers with recess model arnold et al 2010 for water routing phase the model simulates the movement of water sediment etc through the channel network of the watershed to the outlet simulation of channel water routing is based on using the variable storage routing method or the muskingum river routing method which are both the variations of the kinematic wave model in addition the balance calculation for four types of water bodies is also included ponds wetlands and depressions potholes within the sub basin and reservoirs located on the main channels a comprehensive description of principles and algorithms of the swat can be found in neitsch et al 2009 the swat ag a modified swat for agro hydrological modeling is specially developed to strengthen the hydrological modeling in agricultural watersheds especially considering the features of shallow water tables the original version of swat2012 is adopted with the modifications on soil water and solute balance groundwater balance and plant growth first some new functions are added for the soil water balance module based on a hru scale including the description of upward capillary rise from groundwater and the effects of two agronomic measures soil bunds and surface mulching second based on the soil water balance based on a hru scale a multi layered salt balance module with ignoring the solute dispersion is newly developed to simulate the salt movement in soil profile third a groundwater balance module based on a sub basin scale is newly developed for shallow aquifer of corresponding sub basin with involving various sinks and sources i e canal seepage and lateral drainage deep percolation and capillary rise to from phreatic aquifer and groundwater exploitation the groundwater level on the sub basin scale and groundwater depth gwd on the hru scale can be calculated on a daily time step the interactions between vadose zone water and groundwater could be simulated by exchanging the daily information of gwd and net bottom flux fourth a salinity stress factor based on a hru scale is introduced to restrict the plant evapotranspiration et and growth moreover above mentioned functions could be optionally activated for a sub basin when irrigated areas located in the watershed this may make the swat ag more flexible and reasonable for most river basins that are generally affected by agricultural activities a detailed description of the model modification is presented in the following sections 2 2 detailed description of swat ag focusing on modification 2 2 1 configuration of agricultural watershed in swat the sub basin delineation is generally obtained from sub watershed boundaries defined by surface topography e g the digital elevation model dem and the topographic flow path within the sub basin is usually defined as the main channel these are suitable to the natural watersheds but may not reasonable to the agricultural watersheds with artificial facilities and flat topography because the runoff and water path are affected or even controlled by many infrastructures e g canal and drainage system and road network in order to overcome the problem when using the swat ag the main channels should be prescribed through the integration of natural rivers and artificial drainage ditches which form the channel network within the agricultural watershed meanwhile the sub basin delineation should be accomplished according to the distribution of irrigation canals and roads which dominate the inflow and surface runoff thus the watershed is divided into sub basins in which the canals and the drainage ditches are used as the border and main channel respectively the sub basin is then divided into many hrus to represent the unique combinations of land use soil type and slope 2 2 2 soil water balance the swat simulates soil water movement using a cascading water balance approach the soil profile is divided into layers in which the water may move along several different pathways including surface runoff infiltration soil evaporation percolation lateral flow and plant uptake the soil water balance equation in original swat is described as follows 1 s w j 1 s w j i p d l e t r where swj is the soil water storage at day j mm d 1 i is the amount of irrigation mm d 1 p is the precipitation mm d 1 d is the deep percolation mm d 1 l is the lateral flow mm d 1 et is the evapotranspiration mm d 1 and r is the surface runoff mm d 1 however the upward flux caused by capillary rise from groundwater cr mm d 1 is not involved in eq 1 actually the swat only calculates the groundwater evaporation which is assumed to directly lose into the atmosphere but not recharge to the vadose zone therefore in order to calculate the cr the soil profile is divided into two parts in the swat ag root zone and transition zone the cascading water balance approach is still applied for the root zone the transition zone is located between the root zone and aquifer assuming that it is able to reach an equilibrium state under shallow water tables the water table is also allowed to rise into the transition zone the groundwater capillary rise first recharges the transition zone and then recharges into the root zone thus the eq 1 is rewritten as eq 2 for the root zone as follows 2 s w j 1 s w j i p c r tz d l e t r where the crtz is the capillary rise from transition zone mm d 1 in addition the functions of describing effects of soil bunds and surface mulching on hydrological processes are introduced for the swat ag soil bunds could influence the surface runoff generation and infiltration and surface mulching could reduce the soil evaporation which may both have large effects on soil water use and redistribution infiltration and drainage these two agronomic measures are commonly used in many agricultural areas 1 capillary rise from groundwater the capillary rise submodule is developed and modified from the approaches proposed by raesa and deproost 2003 and raes et al 2009 it is described briefly as follows 1 the amount of total expected capillary rise from groundwater crg max mm d 1 is calculated at first 2 the field capacity fc is adjusted for equilibrium state 3 upward water movement is simulated starting from the transition zone and then to the upper lying layers of the root zone with considering the restriction of a low potential gradient affected by relative wetness and 4 the simulation stops till the top layer is reached or the total expected capillary rise equals the cumulative actual capillary rise the crg max is estimated as an exponential function of the depth of groundwater table z m and soil hydraulic parameters a and b as follows 3 c r g max exp ln z b a where a and b are parameters specific for the soil type and its hydraulic characteristics since the magnitude of capillary rise is strongly affected by the shape of the water retention curve and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity the parameters a and b vary with the soil textural class the determination of a and b values can be found in raes et al 2016 in addition the calculation of eq 3 requires the input of daily gwd that is calculated by the newly introduced groundwater balance module described in section 2 2 4 the adjustment of fc is necessary to accurately calculate the soil water movement in the presence of a shallow water table assuming an equilibrium state for soil water distribution in soil profile a parabolic function is used to adjust fc values for the ith layer affected by the shallow water as follows 4 θ fcadj i θ fc i δ θ fc i 5 δ θ fc i θ sat i θ fc i x e 2 x e z i 2 6 x e 10 2 0 3 100 θ fc i 10 20 100 where θfcadj i is the soil water content at equilibrium state m3 m 3 θfc i is the water content at filed capacity m3 m 3 δθfc i is the increase in water content m3 m 3 θsat i is the water content at saturation m3 m 3 zi is the height above the groundwater table m and xe is the height above the groundwater table where fc is no longer affected m the water movement in the soil is determined by 1 a driving force i e the water potential gradient and 2 the capacity of the soil to conduct the water i e the hydraulic conductivity therefore a capillary rise factor fcr i is used to calculate the actual capillary rise into the ith layer cri fcr i crg max as follows 7 f cr i 1 θ i θ wp i θ fcadj i θ wp i x cr θ i θ wp i θ fcadj i 2 2 θ i θ wp i θ fcadj i θ wp i θ i θ wp i θ fcadj i 2 where θi is the soil water content m3 m 3 θwp i is the soil water content at wilting point m3 m 3 and xcr is a power factor 2 treatment for field practices soil bunds and surface mulching in case the field is surrounded by soil bunds the surface pond is expected to develop when incoming water cannot infiltrate due to excessive rainfall or irrigation surface infiltration is limited by saturated hydraulic conductivity of the top soil layer or by the drainage ability of the soil profile thus compared with the original swat the surface runoff could be prevented by soil bounds in field and only water that overtops the bund height user specified is lost and contributes to the surface runoff the surface mulching is usually used by farmers in arid and semi arid regions to maintain soil temperature and to limit the evaporation loss the effect of mulches on soil evaporation reduction can be described by two factors i e the fraction of soil surface covered by mulch fc and the adjusted factor of mulch material fmm allen et al 1998 the maximum soil evaporation ep mm d 1 calculated by the swat is then adjusted with multiplying by a mulching reduction coefficient fm that is calculated as follows 8 f m 1 f c f mm where fm varies from 0 to 100 and fmm varies between 0 5 for mulches of plant material and is close to 1 0 for plastic mulches allen et al 1998 2 2 3 soil salt balance and salinity stress salt is transported with the soil water flow in the vertical soil profile in swat ag the downward movement of salt is due to the vertical water drainage percolation while the upward movement is caused by the capillary rise from the aquifer to transition zone and root zone the salt balance calculation is only applied for the root zone and transition zone in swat ag the groundwater concentration is not to be calculated and required to be specified by users because it is very difficult to calculate the groundwater concentration with a thick aquifer and also the groundwater concentration is relatively stable and easy to monitor compared with soil salinity concentration for the root zone the salt balance equation in each layer is established based on the water balance equation as follows 9 s i j 1 s i j i c ir c r i c i 1 d i c i l i c i i 1 10 s i j 1 s i j d i 1 c i 1 l 1 i c r l c i 1 l 1 i 1 c r l c i d i c i l i c i 2 i n l where subscript i refers to the ith layer s is the soil salt storage g m 2 cir is the salt concentration of the irrigation water g l 1 and c is the soil salinity concentration of the soil layer g l 1 cri 1 for the bottom layer is equal to the capillary rise from the transition zone the similar balance equation is applied for transition zone as follows 11 t s j 1 t s j d nl c nl d tz c tz c r g c g c r tz c tz where ts is the salt storage of transition zone g m 2 dtz is the percolation of transition zone mm crg is the actual total capillary rise mm d 1 and cg is the salinity concentration in the groundwater g l 1 the plant growth component of swat model is a simplified version of the epic plant growth module it can simulate the plant growth process i e the leaf area development light interception and the conversion of intercepted light into biomass and yield by considering the stress of unsuitable temperature and insufficient water nitrogen or phosphorus in the swat ag the stress caused by salinity is newly introduced for reasonably describing the plant transpiration and growth in salt affected areas the soil salinity stress coefficient ks is described by a reduction function proposed by maas and hoffman 1977 as follows 12 k s 1 b r 100 k y c rz θ rz 0 64 θ rz s e c t where br is the reduction factor ds m 1 ky is a reduction factor crz is the average soil salt content of the root zone g l 1 θrz is the average soil water content of the root zone m3 m 3 θrz s is the soil water content at saturation of the root zone m3 m 3 ect is the electrical conductivity of the saturation extract of the soil above which salt stress happens ds m 1 and 0 64 is a global conversion factor 1 ds m 1 0 64 g l 1 ks is to be multiplied by water stress coefficient strsw to restrict the plant transpiration as follows 13 e ts e t s t r s w k s where ets is the actual plant transpiration mm d 1 et is the maximum potential plant transpiration mm d 1 and strsw is the water stress the plant growth regulating factor used to quantify the fraction of potential growth achieved on a given day was calculated by including the ks as follows 14 γ reg 1 max str s w k s s t r s t s t r s n s t r s p where γreg is the plant growth factor 0 0 1 0 and strst strsn and strsp are the stress of temperature nitrogen and phosphorus respectively 2 2 4 groundwater balance the swat only simulates the storage change of shallow groundwater on the hru scale without considering the lateral exchange of groundwater between hrus however the lateral groundwater exchange may occur frequently among hrus in agricultural areas with shallow water tables due to the significant hydraulic gradients mainly caused by the different irrigation schedules in space ren et al 2016 2018a in swat ag we assume that the lateral exchange happens fast enough to achieve the same groundwater levels for different hrus within a sub basin thus the groundwater balance equations eqs 15 16 are applied to estimate the groundwater storage on a sub basin scale with integrating sink source terms estimated on a hru scale the calculation is operated on a daily time step the daily groundwater depth on day j in the kth hru is calculated by eq 17 which was the necessary information for eq 3 to estimate the groundwater capillary rise 15 δ g w k j d k j c s k j 1 e 1 δ gw d k j 1 c s k j 1 e 1 δ gw c r g k j q g k j q p k j 16 δ g w sub j δ g w k j a k a k 17 gw d k j 1 g w d k j δ g w sub j s y where subscript k refers to the number of the hru in the sub basin δgw is the storage change of shallow groundwater mm d 1 cs is the canal seepage mm d 1 qq is the drainage and qp is the remove water by

specific yield for the sub basin in addition the canal seepage is not considered in the swat however it is often an important recharge to groundwater in agricultural watershed thus its simplified calculation is included into groundwater balance for swat ag as follows 18 c s k j k c s a t x l c k a k where kc sat is the effective saturated hydraulic conductivity of canal bottom mm d 1 x is the wetted perimeter m and lc k is the length of the canal in the kth hru m the cross section of the canals is assumed as trapezoid that is a common used shape the geometric relationships can be derived simply as 19 x w 2 h 1 m 2 20 a cs w m h h 21 r ad a cs x where w is the bottom width of the canal m h is the depth of water in the canal m m is the slope coefficient of the canal acs is the cross sectional area of flow in the canal m2 and rad is the hydraulic radius for a given depth of flow m thus the cs j k is only the function of h further the manning s equation eq 22 for uniform flow in an open channel is used to describe the empirical relationship between the rate of flow and h in a canal segment for a given time step 22 q c k j a cs r ad 2 3 i c 1 2 n w m h 5 3 i c 1 2 w 2 h 1 m 2 2 3 n where q jc k is the rate of flow in the canal m3 s 1 at day j in the kth hru ic is the slope along the canal m m 1 and n is the manning s coefficient for the canal thus with a given amount of applied water for irrigation the h value can be obtained by using the iterative method based on eq 22 and then the cs j k value can be finally determined using eq 18 the drainage rate in groundwater module can be estimated with the steady state hooghoudt equation bouwer 1963 as follows 23 q g 4 k e m m l d 2 2 d e m m 24 m m d d g w d k j where qg is the drainage rate mm d 1 ke is the equivalent

of the drainage ditch mm and ld is the drain spacing mm 3 model testing case study in an irrigation district of upper yellow river basin 3 1 study area 3 1 1 site description in order to evaluate the proposed swat ag the jiyuan irrigation system jiyuan of hetao irrigation district hetao upper yellow river basin yrb was taken as a case study area in this paper fig 1 the hetao is one of the three largest irrigation districts in china covering a total area of 1 12 mha the major part 0 57 mha is the irrigated land while natural vegetation patches surrounding farmland occupy a considerable proportion about 25 of hetao the landscape is highly heterogeneous and fragmented with various crops and natural vegetation coverage due to the arid continental climate the irrigation is essential to crops and strongly dependent on the yellow river water xu et al 2010 under conditions of the flat topography 0 2 slope and specific hydrogeology a closed rift basin long term flood irrigation and poor drainage has resulted in shallow water depths varying at 0 5 3 0 m during the year this shallow aquifer system has caused secondary soil salinity meanwhile plays a critical role in supporting local agro ecosystems ren et al 2016 2017 2018b wang et al 1993 xu et al 2010 it is noted that about 5 2 billion m3 water is diverted each year from the yellow river for irrigation approaching about 10 of annual river flow of the yellow river these significantly affect the water flow and water use management in the mid and down stream yrb e g increase of water shortage decline of surface flows and over groundwater exploitation li et al 2004 yang et al 2010 jiyuan is located in the western region of hetao 40 45 40 52 n 106 59 107 07 e fig 1 it covers an area of 8490 ha where 60 7 and 30 3 are crop land and natural land respectively the topography is very flat varying from 1036 to 1043 m above mean sea level msl in south north direction besides that small elevation differences 0 50 cm exist among different land covers typically the natural land is usually distributed in the lower elevation compared with nearby cropland the average annual precipitation is about 140 mm mainly happens between june and september and the mean annual evaporation of 20 cm pan reaches to approximately 2000 mm the mean annual temperature is about 7 c with monthly average of 10 and 24 c in january and july respectively there are 135 to 150 frost free days and 3100 to 3300 h of sunshine per year ren et al 2016 2019 the irrigation and drainage system in jiyuan primarily consists of 1 two secondary canals the west jiyuan canal and the east jiyuan canal which allocate irrigation water from south to north through tertiary canals and 2 two secondary drainage ditches located in the middle part and on the east boundary and the discontinuous drainage ditches in the west part of jiyuan fig 1 the sunflower and maize are the major crops occupying nearly 90 of farmland area in jiyuan in recent years vegetables e g watermelon tomato and pepper are planted in other 10 farmland area the natural vegetation is mainly the shrubs and sparse grass and is often affected with varying degrees of salinization the tamarisk tamarix chinensis lour is the main species of shrubs according to on site survey 3 1 2 observation and data collection a two year observation experiment related to agro hydrological processes was carried out in jiyuan during 2012 and 2013 28 observation points were set on the regional scale to record soil water contents soil salinity concentrations and groundwater depths and salinity concentrations every month fig 1 39 observation wells were installed and were observed for groundwater depth and groundwater salinity concentration every 10 15 days besides the detailed observation was conducted in an experiment site called yangchang canal command area yca fig 1 it covered three typical crops maize sunflower and watermelon and a typical natural plant tamarisk the observations on soil groundwater and crop growth was carried out and a more detailed description of the experiments was provided in our previous studies ren et al 2016 2017 2019 the digital elevation model dem at 90 m spatial resolution was available from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm fig 2 a the soil map on a 1 1000000 scale was obtained from the harmonized world soil database hwsd fig 2b land use and crop pattern were generated by using the satellite images of landsat and quick bird covering various crop lands natural land water sand dune and resident land fig 2c and d the meteorological data were from the china meteorological assimilation driving datasets for the swat model the records of canal water conveyance in jiyuan were collected from the hetao irrigation district administration 3 2 model set up the ditches were used to serve as predefined streams while the canals were used to serve as the boundaries of sub basins within the jiyuan due to their dominant roles in affecting surface water system thus according to the distribution of water management infrastructures fig 3 a the jiyuan was divided into 28 sub basins as shown in fig 3b the watermelon and tamarisk were used to represent the vegetable and natural vegetation respectively then the sub basins were further subdivided into hrus through the combination of land use crop pattern soil type and slope finally 290 hrus and 350 hrus were identified for 2012 and 2013 respectively the agricultural management practices were considered involving irrigation planting mulching and harvesting operations the effects of nitrogen or phosphorus can be ignored because the applied fertilization is usually excessive in jiyuan the growing season was from april to september for different crops early or later during the growing season there were generally 4 to 6 water diversions based on the climate and river water conditions the corresponding management schedules are presented in table 1 the initial values of soil parameters were obtained from the hwsd dataset and our previous studies ren et al 2016 2017 2018b the parameters for capillary rise were referred to raes et al 2009 parameters that used to quantify plant growth of specific species were initialized as suggested by hao et al 2015 the initial values for salinity stress parameters are determined according to doorenbos and kassam 1979 and ren et al 2016 the groundwater parameters were obtained according to researches by bosch et al 2004 xu et al 2010 and on site survey the above mentioned parameters are listed in table 2 3 3 model calibration and evaluation the swat ag was calibrated and validated using the observation data in 2013 and 2012 respectively two types of datasets were used 1 the detailed observed data in yca for calibrating the process simulation and 2 the regional scale observed data in jiyuan with less frequency the datasets included the observed soil water storage and soil salinity concentration 0 100 cm depth i e the root zone leaf area index lai and gwd these terms draw more attentions in the case study area compared to the discharged stream flow which was very small the ranges of parameters were determined based on the relevant previous literatures especially those using the swat arnold et al 2012 douglas mankin et al 2010 tuppad et al 2011 ren et al 2016 2017 xu et al 2013 for process simulation in yca the sufi2 algorithm in the swat cup swat calibration uncertainty procedures abbaspour et al 2004 was used to conduct the sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation a more detailed description about the sufi2 algorithm and its application on the swat can be found in abbaspour et al 2007 2018 the results for process simulation will also be compared with the original swat in which the soil water storage and lai were the only two available terms because the original swat could not provide the information of soil salinity concentration and gwd the trial and error method was adopted for model calibration in jiyuan on a regional scale since the observation data was relatively limited in addition the calibrated parameters in yca could be used as the referenced values for regional simulation furthermore the model was evaluated by 1 comparing the simulated et with the remote sensing et in jiyuan with a 250 m resolution using modis data in 2012 yang et al 2012 and comparing the results with those obtained by our previous studies using the hydrus dualkc model as well as other balance models ren et al 2016 2017 2018b during above procedures some statistics evaluation criteria were employed including the nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr and the coefficient of determination r2 moriasi et al 2007 nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse and rsr both varies from 0 to 1 nse 1 represents a perfect fit nse 0 indicates that the mean observed value is a better predictor than the simulated value which indicates unacceptable performance r2 varies from 0 to 1 and r2 1 means the optimal fit rsr varies from 0 to rsr 0 means the optimal fit and the smaller rsr means the better performance 4 results and discussion 4 1 simulation and evaluation results the results of case study indicated that the swat ag could reasonably describe the agro hydrological processes under the environments of arid climate and shallow groundwater the evaluation with the detailed yca data showed that the swat ag could well capture the soil water salt dynamics groundwater level fluctuations and crop growth process in both calibration and validation periods 2013 and 2012 swat ag performed much better than the original swat in process simulation figs 4 6 and table 3 furthermore an acceptable agreement of simulated and observed data on a regional scale jiyuan were also obtained for two years related to soil water storage soil salinity concentration groundwater depth and actual evapotranspiration eta figs 7 and 8 the calibrated values for sensitive parameters are listed in table 2 the results of model evaluation were presented in detail in the following parts 4 1 1 evaluation of the process simulation using the detailed data in yca the comparison of simulated and measured data for three crop fields and a natural patch are presented in figs 4 6 and table 3 for the calibration 2013 and validation 2012 periods the results showed that the simulated soil water storage was in a good agreement with the measured soil water storage for various fields fig 4 the nse and r2 reached to 0 22 0 83 and 0 23 0 87 respectively in model calibration and validation meanwhile the rsr was almost less than 0 88 table 3 at the meantime the swat ag can reasonably capture the fluctuations of gwds especially reflecting the rapid rise to irrigation and the gradual decrease to subsequent groundwater evaporation and drainage fig 5 shows the observed data versus simulated gwd together with the precipitation and irrigation applied in the yca the fitness levels between simulated and observed gwds were both good for calibration nse 0 85 r2 0 89 and rsr 0 39 in 2013 and validation nse 0 81 r2 0 85 and rsr 0 44 in 2012 in addition it was obviously that the proposed swat ag had better performance in soil water simulation compared with the original swat fig 4 the nse r2 and rsr ranged from 55 8 to 0 23 0 22 to 0 87 and 1 11 to 7 54 respectively table 3 the simulated soil water storage can maintain and fluctuate at a high level by swat ag presenting reasonable responses to the gwd changes typically as in the first irrigation event in mid may figs 4 and 5 however the swat underestimated the soil water retention and its storages for all fields especially for maize and tamarisk fields fig 4 because it does not consider the effects of shallow aquifer on the root zone and could only capture the response to irrigation precipitation but no response to gwd fluctuations the simulated salt salinity concentrations were also in a reasonable agreement with the measured ones fig 4 producing nse 0 19 0 74 r2 0 29 0 82 and rsr 0 43 0 90 the simulation discrepancy of salinity concentration was a little larger than those of soil water this should be also acceptable considering that the salt had larger spatial heterogeneity than soil water and its movement was more uncertain and less stable ren et al 2016 2017 additionally the simulation for tamarisk patch was not as good as that for three crop fields due to the difficulties in simulation of plant growth of tamarisk overall the goodness of fit indicators obtained with the swat ag during the two years table 3 were within the range of values reported in previous studies with soil water models e g kumar et al 2015 ren et al 2016 xu et al 2013 2018b moreover the results indicated the swat ag seemed to more reasonably simulate the development of leaf area index lai than the swat for example the lai comparisons in maize simulation in fig 6 this simulation resulted in nse values of 0 72 and 0 86 r2 values of 0 83 and 0 89 and rsr values of 0 53 and 0 37 in 2013 and 2012 respectively the simulated lai by swat ag was relatively lower and fitted better with the observations than the original swat table 3 the improvement was especially significant in 2013 due to the relatively severe salinity problem because the swat ag can consider the effects of both water and salinity stress on et and crop biomass however the swat only included the water stress effects 4 1 2 regional performance in jiyuan fig 7 shows that the simulated data fitted well with the observed one during the calibration 2013 and validation 2012 on a regional scale related to the soil water storage salinity concentration and gwd for soil water storage it produced nse values of about 0 61 r2 values larger than 0 62 and rsr values smaller than 0 63 for two years meanwhile for soil salinity concentration the nse and r2 are higher than 0 87 and the rsr was lower than 0 37 the fitness indicators for gwds were nse values of 0 59 and 0 60 r2 values of 0 66 and 0 62 and rsr values of 0 64 and 0 63 for 2013 and 2012 respectively in addition the simulated drainage water amount at watershed outlet was about 19 mm and 16 mm during 2013 and 2012 which accounted for about 7 of irrigation water amount and was similar as that reported by ren et al 2018b in jiyuan the above comparison further indicated that the swat ag was able to simulate the regional agro hydrological processes with various ambient environments the swat ag can provide abundant regional information of water salt balance terms in space and time in this case the spatial distribution of the total eta the cumulative net water flux at 100 cm depth qc w and the soil salt storage change in 0 100 cm soil depth δs were presented in figs 8 and 9 in order to show the characteristics of the swat ag the simulated eta had a large spatial variance ranging from 147 to 1010 mm which was highly correlated with the land use cover types fig 2 the simulated eta had a visually similar spatial pattern with the remote sensing eta as presented in fig 8a the fitness results of simulated eta and remote sensing eta on a hru scale produced a nse 0 07 r2 0 03 and rsr 1 22 for the areas of croplands and natural lands the disagreement should be mainly attributed to that the remote sensing eta data had a coarse resolution 250 m which led to the mixed pixel problem i e one pixel often covers different kinds of land cover types and affected the data accuracy ren et al 2019 in addition there were relatively low values simulated for residential land and relatively high values simulated for water body fig 8b and c the simulated eta was reasonable in these two land use types compared to the remote sensing eta which obviously overestimated eta for residential land and underestimated eta for water body ren et al 2018b there was relatively higher evapotranspiration for croplands than natural lands figs 1 and 8 due to the irrigation water applied and less salinity effects with adequate irrigation typically as for sunflower the eta values reached average 511 mm and 540 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively although the vegetation was only irrigated once in crop growing season typically as for watermelon however the average eta values could reach to 427 mm and 385 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively because the non irrigated crops can grow well with using the lateral groundwater inflow from the surrounding irrigated croplands under shallow groundwater conditions this has been reasonably described by the swat ag in another aspect the natural vegetation can also utilize the groundwater contribution through capillary rise and survive in such arid climatic conditions however the eta for natural land was relatively lower average 422 mm and 428 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively showing a larger spatial variation 263 to 531 mm and 221 to 537 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively this was because the natural lands were generally the abandoned lands with different groundwater conditions and salinity levels the qc w and δs both varied greatly among different land use types due to the different management schedules and groundwater conditions figs 2 and 9 and table 4 results showed that there was significant groundwater contribution to the vegetable and natural vegetation during plant growing period resulting in a trend of salt accumulation in the root zone fig 9 the qc w was positive and averaged 153 mm and 159 mm for vegetation fields in 2012 and 2013 respectively because there was only once irrigation meanwhile the δs averaged 421 g m 2 and 376 g m 2 in 2012 and 2013 respectively for natural lands the qc w can reach to an average of 328 mm and 322 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively the trend of salt accumulation was much more serious with an average of δs reaching to 1340 g m 2 and 1361 g m 2 in 2012 and 2013 respectively for maize and sunflower the percolation and salt leaching were significant because there were 3 4 irrigation events during crop growing period however the upward groundwater capillary rise was also very large after the irrigation thus the qc w was still positive i e net upward flux for most fields of maize and sunflower e g qc w averaging 83 mm and 36 mm for maize and sunflower in jiyuan during 2013 respectively there was a slight trend of salt accumulation for maize with δs averaging 78 g m 2 and 47 g m 2 in 2012 and 2013 respectively due to the largest irrigation water applied for sunflower there was even a deceasing trend of salt storage with δs averaging 407 g m 2 and 855 g m 2 in 2012 and 2013 respectively in general the shallow groundwater system played an important role in contributing to crop water use and sustaining the local agroecosystems which were reasonably reflected by the swat ag it was worth noting that the values of qc w and δs both had the similar ranges and spatial distributions to those obtained by ren 2018 using the field scale hydrus model in a distributed manner there were also some differences because of the different model structure and conceptualization in model setup in summary the above regional evaluation further supported that the swat ag could efficiently improve the performance of agricultural hydrological modeling under arid and shallow water table environments with also reasonably describing the effects of shallow groundwater in sustaining the agroecosystems 4 2 discussion the test case indicated that the swat ag can successfully capture some key aspects of hydrological cycle in the agricultural watershed with shallow water tables these were mainly related to the close interactions of the vadose zone water groundwater salt and plant growth which were also still not solved in most hydrological models in this case the proposed swat ag could efficiently improve the simulation performance of the original swat acceptable agreement of the simulation and observation was obtained both in process simulation in yca and region simulation in jiyuan related to various terms of the soil water storage salinity concentration gwd and lai thus the case application supported that the swat ag should be an efficient tool for hydrological modeling in agricultural watershed and can strengthen the simulation capabilities of the well known swat model in addition the swat ag had some significant advantages in the practical application use typically when compared with the traditional agro hydrological models e g hydrus aquacrop and ahc raes et al 2009 šimůnek et al 2016 xu et al 2018 the swat ag can calculate the gwds and thus was efficient for the management scenario prediction for which the future gwds were not known however the traditional agro hydrological models generally required the input of observed gwds to drive the model both for farm scale simulation and the distributed manner simulation in another aspect the swat ag adopted the computationally efficient approaches e g hru based framework cascade approach for soil water and balanced based approach for groundwater and therefore it can simulate the complex agro hydrological processes efficiently with these approaches the swat ag may largely alleviate the computation burden and also avoid stability problems compared with the more complicated integrated numerical models designed for shallow aquifers e g mike she modflow hydrus and modflow swap twarakavi et al 2008 xu et al 2012 moreover the functionality of simulating the agricultural chemical yields e g nitrogen and phosphorus was not included in the present swat ag which will be the core of the follow up model development 5 conclusions in this paper the swat ag was developed to strengthen the simulation capability of hydrological model for watersheds with a large amount of irrigated areas especially considering the features of arid climate and shallow phreatic aquifer significant modifications were applied based on the swat framework in order to capture the agro hydrological processes in such watersheds they mainly included improving soil water module and crop growth module and newly incorporating salt balance module and groundwater module some new functions were developed for soil water module including the descriptions of the groundwater capillary rise and the effects of two agronomic measures soil bunds and surface mulching based on this a multi layered salt balance module was established for modeling the salt movement for groundwater a balance based module was constructed on a sub basin scale with considering the deep percolation capillary rise exploitation canal seepage and lateral drainage furthermore the effects of salinity stress were introduced to restrict the crop growth and water consumption the swat ag was then applied and tested in a case area of jiyuan irrigation system jiyuan in the upper yellow river basin with presenting good performance in model evaluation the evaluation of process simulation with detailed yca yangchang canal command area within jiyuan data showed that swat ag could well capture the soil water salt dynamics groundwater depth fluctuations and crop growth process and performed much better than the original swat model in addition the regional evaluation with jiyuan data showed that there was an acceptable agreement of simulated and observed data related to soil water storage soil salinity concentration groundwater depth and eta thus the swat ag was capable to describe the close interactions of vadose zone water and groundwater salt and plant growth which are important but still not solved in the swat and most hydrological models in addition the swat ag provided a lot of regional information of water salt balance terms in jiyuan with high computational efficiency analysis of spatial results indicated that the model could reveal the important role of shallow groundwater in supporting the plant growth and water use i e temporarily storing excessive irrigation water contributing crop water use in non irrigated croplands and natural lands and moving salt into natural lands to exert dry drainage effects and also seriously negative effects of salinity on some natural vegetation patches in summary this study presents the swat ag as an efficient tool for agro watershed hydrological modeling with maintaining a balance between complexity and practicality of the model it can also contribute to providing the improvement concepts for the other watershed models additionally our follow up investigation will mainly focus on incorporating the functionality of simulating the agricultural chemical yields e g nitrogen and phosphorus for watersheds with shallow groundwater conditions acknowledgements this

6568,this article introduces the swat ag a modified swat for agro hydrological modeling as an enhanced hydrological model for simulating the hydrological processes in agricultural watershed with shallow water tables the model is developed based on the framework of the swat with significant improvements on describing the interactions of the vadose zone water groundwater salt and plant growth the main features of the swat ag include that it can simulate the close interactions of soil water and shallow groundwater with considering the capillary rise effects it provides functions to simulate the soil salt movement and salt stress on plant growth and it incorporates a balance based module on a sub basin scale for shallow aquifer with involving canal seepage and ditch drainage calculation model testing and application were conducted in jiyuan irrigation system located in the hetao of upper yellow river basin northwest china the comparison between simulated and observed data showed that the swat ag performed well and obviously better than the original swat in simulating the soil water and salt dynamics groundwater depth fluctuations and plant growth and water consumption the results showed that the nse averagely increased from 17 57 to 0 57 and from 0 71 to 0 79 for soil water storage and leaf area index respectively in typical croplands and natural patches in addition the effects of shallow groundwater in sustaining the agro ecosystems were reasonably revealed with the spatial analysis of evapotranspiration capillary rise and salt accumulation the test case proved that the proposed swat ag could efficiently enhance the functionality and practicality of hydrological models for agricultural watersheds with shallow groundwater keywords soil water and salt groundwater plant growth capillary rise balance based approach hydrological modeling 1 introduction hydrological models have become an efficient tool to quantitatively analyze watershed hydrological processes and regional water resources fatichi et al 2016 singh and woolhiser 2002 across the watershed irrigated agriculture is often one of the largest water users especially with the increasing food demand mclaughlin and kinzelbach 2015 rost et al 2008 sauer et al 2010 water use in irrigated areas has caused significant effects on various aspects of the hydrological cycle involving the surface runoff subsurface water movement salinity effects plant growth and evapotranspiration and water quality droogers et al 2000 scanlon et al 2007 tedeschi et al 2001 wang et al 2016 however the hydrological processes in agricultural areas i e agro hydrological processes are often oversimplified in most previous studies of watershed hydrological modeling in fact owing to the strong human interference agro hydrological processes are often far more different from the natural hydrological processes especially in the agricultural watershed with shallow groundwater environments the main distinctiveness of hydrological processes in agricultural watershed with shallow groundwater could be concluded as 1 the artificial infrastructure dominated surface water system i e with densely distributed irrigation canals and drainage ditches 2 the frequent and complex interactions among surface water vadose zone water groundwater and crops and natural vegetation 3 the soil salinity and its effects on crop production distributed from even the semi humid to arid regions kahlown et al 2005 liu et al 2010 northey et al 2006 satchithanantham et al 2014 wichelns and qadir 2014 therefore it is necessary and important to reasonably describe the distinctiveness for more realistic hydrological simulation and therefore to improve the model functionality and simulation accuracy in agricultural watersheds many simulation models have been developed and widely applied for the watershed hydrological modeling typically as the swat vic topkapi and mike she arnold et al 1998 ciarapica and todini 2002 liang et al 1994 refsgaard 1997 hydrological modeling is increasingly becoming integrated and interdisciplinary in recent years more aspects of or related to hydrological cycle e g groundwater flow overland flow vegetation growth and land surface energy have been involved in some models besides the traditional land surface hydrological processes such as swatmod gsflow and mike she kim et al 2008 markstrom et al 2008 sophocleous and perkins 2000 however these also bring very large computation loads and significant issues of model stability and parameter uncertainties this is especially significant for the physically based models that couple surface and subsurface flow as they implement a different set of one two and fully three dimensional representations and numerical solution techniques for coupling different hydrologic processes maxwell et al 2014 xu et al 2012 the problem has become a major factor of limiting the model practical use in watershed management at the meantime most of the existing watershed models still trend to oversimplify the agro hydrological processes and only a few researchers have attempted to involve the agricultural effects e g those from the canal ditch system and agronomic practices in watershed modeling ale et al 2012 santhi et al 2005 liu et al 2010 luo et al 2008 xie and cui 2011 however it is still far from sufficient when application in agricultural watersheds with shallow water tables in general the extended model development is necessary and deserved to be investigated for involving the distinctiveness of agro watersheds and especially making the model suitable for practical use the soil water assessment tools swat model is a conceptual semi distributed model having the advantages of modeling robustness comprehensiveness and effectiveness compared with other watershed hydrological models it is selected as the basis for our further model development swat model is an established watershed hydrological model gassman et al 2007 which has proven its potential to be adapted for simulation in agricultural areas e g simulating the soil water dynamics evapotranspiration crop growth and productivity in fields aouissi et al 2016 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 sinnathamby et al 2017 sun and ren 2014 panagopoulos et al 2014 it is efficient to simulate the hydrology of watersheds since it is mainly based on the balance based approach besides a key strength of swat is the flexibility of combining other modules and making deeper developments chen and wu 2012 sophocleous and perkins 2000 thus it is attractive to conduct the further model development for region scale agro hydrological modeling based on the framework of the swat therefore the objective of this study is to develop and enhance the hydrological model for simulating hydrology of agricultural watersheds with shallow water tables the original swat is thus significantly modified with improving the components of soil water and solute balance groundwater budget and plant growth the modification mainly involves 1 incorporating simulation on upward capillary rise to capture the interactions between vadose zone water and shallow groundwater 2 developing a multi layered salt balance module to describe the salt movement and salinity effects on plants and 3 establishing a groundwater balance module on a sub basin scale for shallow aquifer with involving various sinks sources especially including canal seepage and drainage the aims are to make the model be able to reasonably simulate the close interactions of surface water soil water and groundwater and the effects of water salt stress on plant growth the modified model hereinafter called swat ag was then applied and tested in a typical irrigated district with shallow water tables of the upper yellow river basin the case application could provide a comprehensive presentation of main features and applicability of our proposed model 2 model description 2 1 general description of swat ag the swat is a physically based watershed scale model developed to simulate hydrology and water quality under various land and water management practices it can predict the fates of water sediment and agricultural chemical yields with varying environmental conditions neitsch et al 2009 in swat simulation of the hydrology of a watershed is separated into two major phases the land phase and water routing phase for land phase swat divides a watershed into the sub basins which are further divided into hydrological response units hru an hru is a fundamental spatial unit with the homogenous slope land use and soil type the simulated processes are driven by the water balance equation that operates on a daily step on hru mainly including surface runoff estimated using the scs curve number or green ampt infiltration equation percolation simulated with a layered storage routing techniques soil evaporation and crop transpiration combined with the simplified epic plant growth model and groundwater storage and the discharge into streams from shallow aquifers with recess model arnold et al 2010 for water routing phase the model simulates the movement of water sediment etc through the channel network of the watershed to the outlet simulation of channel water routing is based on using the variable storage routing method or the muskingum river routing method which are both the variations of the kinematic wave model in addition the balance calculation for four types of water bodies is also included ponds wetlands and depressions potholes within the sub basin and reservoirs located on the main channels a comprehensive description of principles and algorithms of the swat can be found in neitsch et al 2009 the swat ag a modified swat for agro hydrological modeling is specially developed to strengthen the hydrological modeling in agricultural watersheds especially considering the features of shallow water tables the original version of swat2012 is adopted with the modifications on soil water and solute balance groundwater balance and plant growth first some new functions are added for the soil water balance module based on a hru scale including the description of upward capillary rise from groundwater and the effects of two agronomic measures soil bunds and surface mulching second based on the soil water balance based on a hru scale a multi layered salt balance module with ignoring the solute dispersion is newly developed to simulate the salt movement in soil profile third a groundwater balance module based on a sub basin scale is newly developed for shallow aquifer of corresponding sub basin with involving various sinks and sources i e canal seepage and lateral drainage deep percolation and capillary rise to from phreatic aquifer and groundwater exploitation the groundwater level on the sub basin scale and groundwater depth gwd on the hru scale can be calculated on a daily time step the interactions between vadose zone water and groundwater could be simulated by exchanging the daily information of gwd and net bottom flux fourth a salinity stress factor based on a hru scale is introduced to restrict the plant evapotranspiration et and growth moreover above mentioned functions could be optionally activated for a sub basin when irrigated areas located in the watershed this may make the swat ag more flexible and reasonable for most river basins that are generally affected by agricultural activities a detailed description of the model modification is presented in the following sections 2 2 detailed description of swat ag focusing on modification 2 2 1 configuration of agricultural watershed in swat the sub basin delineation is generally obtained from sub watershed boundaries defined by surface topography e g the digital elevation model dem and the topographic flow path within the sub basin is usually defined as the main channel these are suitable to the natural watersheds but may not reasonable to the agricultural watersheds with artificial facilities and flat topography because the runoff and water path are affected or even controlled by many infrastructures e g canal and drainage system and road network in order to overcome the problem when using the swat ag the main channels should be prescribed through the integration of natural rivers and artificial drainage ditches which form the channel network within the agricultural watershed meanwhile the sub basin delineation should be accomplished according to the distribution of irrigation canals and roads which dominate the inflow and surface runoff thus the watershed is divided into sub basins in which the canals and the drainage ditches are used as the border and main channel respectively the sub basin is then divided into many hrus to represent the unique combinations of land use soil type and slope 2 2 2 soil water balance the swat simulates soil water movement using a cascading water balance approach the soil profile is divided into layers in which the water may move along several different pathways including surface runoff infiltration soil evaporation percolation lateral flow and plant uptake the soil water balance equation in original swat is described as follows 1 s w j 1 s w j i p d l e t r where swj is the soil water storage at day j mm d 1 i is the amount of irrigation mm d 1 p is the precipitation mm d 1 d is the deep percolation mm d 1 l is the lateral flow mm d 1 et is the evapotranspiration mm d 1 and r is the surface runoff mm d 1 however the upward flux caused by capillary rise from groundwater cr mm d 1 is not involved in eq 1 actually the swat only calculates the groundwater evaporation which is assumed to directly lose into the atmosphere but not recharge to the vadose zone therefore in order to calculate the cr the soil profile is divided into two parts in the swat ag root zone and transition zone the cascading water balance approach is still applied for the root zone the transition zone is located between the root zone and aquifer assuming that it is able to reach an equilibrium state under shallow water tables the water table is also allowed to rise into the transition zone the groundwater capillary rise first recharges the transition zone and then recharges into the root zone thus the eq 1 is rewritten as eq 2 for the root zone as follows 2 s w j 1 s w j i p c r tz d l e t r where the crtz is the capillary rise from transition zone mm d 1 in addition the functions of describing effects of soil bunds and surface mulching on hydrological processes are introduced for the swat ag soil bunds could influence the surface runoff generation and infiltration and surface mulching could reduce the soil evaporation which may both have large effects on soil water use and redistribution infiltration and drainage these two agronomic measures are commonly used in many agricultural areas 1 capillary rise from groundwater the capillary rise submodule is developed and modified from the approaches proposed by raesa and deproost 2003 and raes et al 2009 it is described briefly as follows 1 the amount of total expected capillary rise from groundwater crg max mm d 1 is calculated at first 2 the field capacity fc is adjusted for equilibrium state 3 upward water movement is simulated starting from the transition zone and then to the upper lying layers of the root zone with considering the restriction of a low potential gradient affected by relative wetness and 4 the simulation stops till the top layer is reached or the total expected capillary rise equals the cumulative actual capillary rise the crg max is estimated as an exponential function of the depth of groundwater table z m and soil hydraulic parameters a and b as follows 3 c r g max exp ln z b a where a and b are parameters specific for the soil type and its hydraulic characteristics since the magnitude of capillary rise is strongly affected by the shape of the water retention curve and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity the parameters a and b vary with the soil textural class the determination of a and b values can be found in raes et al 2016 in addition the calculation of eq 3 requires the input of daily gwd that is calculated by the newly introduced groundwater balance module described in section 2 2 4 the adjustment of fc is necessary to accurately calculate the soil water movement in the presence of a shallow water table assuming an equilibrium state for soil water distribution in soil profile a parabolic function is used to adjust fc values for the ith layer affected by the shallow water as follows 4 θ fcadj i θ fc i δ θ fc i 5 δ θ fc i θ sat i θ fc i x e 2 x e z i 2 6 x e 10 2 0 3 100 θ fc i 10 20 100 where θfcadj i is the soil water content at equilibrium state m3 m 3 θfc i is the water content at filed capacity m3 m 3 δθfc i is the increase in water content m3 m 3 θsat i is the water content at saturation m3 m 3 zi is the height above the groundwater table m and xe is the height above the groundwater table where fc is no longer affected m the water movement in the soil is determined by 1 a driving force i e the water potential gradient and 2 the capacity of the soil to conduct the water i e the hydraulic conductivity therefore a capillary rise factor fcr i is used to calculate the actual capillary rise into the ith layer cri fcr i crg max as follows 7 f cr i 1 θ i θ wp i θ fcadj i θ wp i x cr θ i θ wp i θ fcadj i 2 2 θ i θ wp i θ fcadj i θ wp i θ i θ wp i θ fcadj i 2 where θi is the soil water content m3 m 3 θwp i is the soil water content at wilting point m3 m 3 and xcr is a power factor 2 treatment for field practices soil bunds and surface mulching in case the field is surrounded by soil bunds the surface pond is expected to develop when incoming water cannot infiltrate due to excessive rainfall or irrigation surface infiltration is limited by saturated hydraulic conductivity of the top soil layer or by the drainage ability of the soil profile thus compared with the original swat the surface runoff could be prevented by soil bounds in field and only water that overtops the bund height user specified is lost and contributes to the surface runoff the surface mulching is usually used by farmers in arid and semi arid regions to maintain soil temperature and to limit the evaporation loss the effect of mulches on soil evaporation reduction can be described by two factors i e the fraction of soil surface covered by mulch fc and the adjusted factor of mulch material fmm allen et al 1998 the maximum soil evaporation ep mm d 1 calculated by the swat is then adjusted with multiplying by a mulching reduction coefficient fm that is calculated as follows 8 f m 1 f c f mm where fm varies from 0 to 100 and fmm varies between 0 5 for mulches of plant material and is close to 1 0 for plastic mulches allen et al 1998 2 2 3 soil salt balance and salinity stress salt is transported with the soil water flow in the vertical soil profile in swat ag the downward movement of salt is due to the vertical water drainage percolation while the upward movement is caused by the capillary rise from the aquifer to transition zone and root zone the salt balance calculation is only applied for the root zone and transition zone in swat ag the groundwater concentration is not to be calculated and required to be specified by users because it is very difficult to calculate the groundwater concentration with a thick aquifer and also the groundwater concentration is relatively stable and easy to monitor compared with soil salinity concentration for the root zone the salt balance equation in each layer is established based on the water balance equation as follows 9 s i j 1 s i j i c ir c r i c i 1 d i c i l i c i i 1 10 s i j 1 s i j d i 1 c i 1 l 1 i c r l c i 1 l 1 i 1 c r l c i d i c i l i c i 2 i n l where subscript i refers to the ith layer s is the soil salt storage g m 2 cir is the salt concentration of the irrigation water g l 1 and c is the soil salinity concentration of the soil layer g l 1 cri 1 for the bottom layer is equal to the capillary rise from the transition zone the similar balance equation is applied for transition zone as follows 11 t s j 1 t s j d nl c nl d tz c tz c r g c g c r tz c tz where ts is the salt storage of transition zone g m 2 dtz is the percolation of transition zone mm crg is the actual total capillary rise mm d 1 and cg is the salinity concentration in the groundwater g l 1 the plant growth component of swat model is a simplified version of the epic plant growth module it can simulate the plant growth process i e the leaf area development light interception and the conversion of intercepted light into biomass and yield by considering the stress of unsuitable temperature and insufficient water nitrogen or phosphorus in the swat ag the stress caused by salinity is newly introduced for reasonably describing the plant transpiration and growth in salt affected areas the soil salinity stress coefficient ks is described by a reduction function proposed by maas and hoffman 1977 as follows 12 k s 1 b r 100 k y c rz θ rz 0 64 θ rz s e c t where br is the reduction factor ds m 1 ky is a reduction factor crz is the average soil salt content of the root zone g l 1 θrz is the average soil water content of the root zone m3 m 3 θrz s is the soil water content at saturation of the root zone m3 m 3 ect is the electrical conductivity of the saturation extract of the soil above which salt stress happens ds m 1 and 0 64 is a global conversion factor 1 ds m 1 0 64 g l 1 ks is to be multiplied by water stress coefficient strsw to restrict the plant transpiration as follows 13 e ts e t s t r s w k s where ets is the actual plant transpiration mm d 1 et is the maximum potential plant transpiration mm d 1 and strsw is the water stress the plant growth regulating factor used to quantify the fraction of potential growth achieved on a given day was calculated by including the ks as follows 14 γ reg 1 max str s w k s s t r s t s t r s n s t r s p where γreg is the plant growth factor 0 0 1 0 and strst strsn and strsp are the stress of temperature nitrogen and phosphorus respectively 2 2 4 groundwater balance the swat only simulates the storage change of shallow groundwater on the hru scale without considering the lateral exchange of groundwater between hrus however the lateral groundwater exchange may occur frequently among hrus in agricultural areas with shallow water tables due to the significant hydraulic gradients mainly caused by the different irrigation schedules in space ren et al 2016 2018a in swat ag we assume that the lateral exchange happens fast enough to achieve the same groundwater levels for different hrus within a sub basin thus the groundwater balance equations eqs 15 16 are applied to estimate the groundwater storage on a sub basin scale with integrating sink source terms estimated on a hru scale the calculation is operated on a daily time step the daily groundwater depth on day j in the kth hru is calculated by eq 17 which was the necessary information for eq 3 to estimate the groundwater capillary rise 15 δ g w k j d k j c s k j 1 e 1 δ gw d k j 1 c s k j 1 e 1 δ gw c r g k j q g k j q p k j 16 δ g w sub j δ g w k j a k a k 17 gw d k j 1 g w d k j δ g w sub j s y where subscript k refers to the number of the hru in the sub basin δgw is the storage change of shallow groundwater mm d 1 cs is the canal seepage mm d 1 qq is the drainage and qp is the remove water by pump in the kth hru mm d 1 δgw is the delay time of groundwater recharge δgw is the groundwater storage change of the sub basin mm d 1 ak is the area m2 gwd is the groundwater depth mm and sy is the specific yield for the sub basin in addition the canal seepage is not considered in the swat however it is often an important recharge to groundwater in agricultural watershed thus its simplified calculation is included into groundwater balance for swat ag as follows 18 c s k j k c s a t x l c k a k where kc sat is the effective saturated hydraulic conductivity of canal bottom mm d 1 x is the wetted perimeter m and lc k is the length of the canal in the kth hru m the cross section of the canals is assumed as trapezoid that is a common used shape the geometric relationships can be derived simply as 19 x w 2 h 1 m 2 20 a cs w m h h 21 r ad a cs x where w is the bottom width of the canal m h is the depth of water in the canal m m is the slope coefficient of the canal acs is the cross sectional area of flow in the canal m2 and rad is the hydraulic radius for a given depth of flow m thus the cs j k is only the function of h further the manning s equation eq 22 for uniform flow in an open channel is used to describe the empirical relationship between the rate of flow and h in a canal segment for a given time step 22 q c k j a cs r ad 2 3 i c 1 2 n w m h 5 3 i c 1 2 w 2 h 1 m 2 2 3 n where q jc k is the rate of flow in the canal m3 s 1 at day j in the kth hru ic is the slope along the canal m m 1 and n is the manning s coefficient for the canal thus with a given amount of applied water for irrigation the h value can be obtained by using the iterative method based on eq 22 and then the cs j k value can be finally determined using eq 18 the drainage rate in groundwater module can be estimated with the steady state hooghoudt equation bouwer 1963 as follows 23 q g 4 k e m m l d 2 2 d e m m 24 m m d d g w d k j where qg is the drainage rate mm d 1 ke is the equivalent lateral hydraulic conductivity of the profile mm d 1 mm is the midpoint water table elevation above the drain mm de is the equivalent depth from the drain to the restrictive layer mm dd is the depth of the drainage ditch mm and ld is the drain spacing mm 3 model testing case study in an irrigation district of upper yellow river basin 3 1 study area 3 1 1 site description in order to evaluate the proposed swat ag the jiyuan irrigation system jiyuan of hetao irrigation district hetao upper yellow river basin yrb was taken as a case study area in this paper fig 1 the hetao is one of the three largest irrigation districts in china covering a total area of 1 12 mha the major part 0 57 mha is the irrigated land while natural vegetation patches surrounding farmland occupy a considerable proportion about 25 of hetao the landscape is highly heterogeneous and fragmented with various crops and natural vegetation coverage due to the arid continental climate the irrigation is essential to crops and strongly dependent on the yellow river water xu et al 2010 under conditions of the flat topography 0 2 slope and specific hydrogeology a closed rift basin long term flood irrigation and poor drainage has resulted in shallow water depths varying at 0 5 3 0 m during the year this shallow aquifer system has caused secondary soil salinity meanwhile plays a critical role in supporting local agro ecosystems ren et al 2016 2017 2018b wang et al 1993 xu et al 2010 it is noted that about 5 2 billion m3 water is diverted each year from the yellow river for irrigation approaching about 10 of annual river flow of the yellow river these significantly affect the water flow and water use management in the mid and down stream yrb e g increase of water shortage decline of surface flows and over groundwater exploitation li et al 2004 yang et al 2010 jiyuan is located in the western region of hetao 40 45 40 52 n 106 59 107 07 e fig 1 it covers an area of 8490 ha where 60 7 and 30 3 are crop land and natural land respectively the topography is very flat varying from 1036 to 1043 m above mean sea level msl in south north direction besides that small elevation differences 0 50 cm exist among different land covers typically the natural land is usually distributed in the lower elevation compared with nearby cropland the average annual precipitation is about 140 mm mainly happens between june and september and the mean annual evaporation of 20 cm pan reaches to approximately 2000 mm the mean annual temperature is about 7 c with monthly average of 10 and 24 c in january and july respectively there are 135 to 150 frost free days and 3100 to 3300 h of sunshine per year ren et al 2016 2019 the irrigation and drainage system in jiyuan primarily consists of 1 two secondary canals the west jiyuan canal and the east jiyuan canal which allocate irrigation water from south to north through tertiary canals and 2 two secondary drainage ditches located in the middle part and on the east boundary and the discontinuous drainage ditches in the west part of jiyuan fig 1 the sunflower and maize are the major crops occupying nearly 90 of farmland area in jiyuan in recent years vegetables e g watermelon tomato and pepper are planted in other 10 farmland area the natural vegetation is mainly the shrubs and sparse grass and is often affected with varying degrees of salinization the tamarisk tamarix chinensis lour is the main species of shrubs according to on site survey 3 1 2 observation and data collection a two year observation experiment related to agro hydrological processes was carried out in jiyuan during 2012 and 2013 28 observation points were set on the regional scale to record soil water contents soil salinity concentrations and groundwater depths and salinity concentrations every month fig 1 39 observation wells were installed and were observed for groundwater depth and groundwater salinity concentration every 10 15 days besides the detailed observation was conducted in an experiment site called yangchang canal command area yca fig 1 it covered three typical crops maize sunflower and watermelon and a typical natural plant tamarisk the observations on soil groundwater and crop growth was carried out and a more detailed description of the experiments was provided in our previous studies ren et al 2016 2017 2019 the digital elevation model dem at 90 m spatial resolution was available from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm fig 2 a the soil map on a 1 1000000 scale was obtained from the harmonized world soil database hwsd fig 2b land use and crop pattern were generated by using the satellite images of landsat and quick bird covering various crop lands natural land water sand dune and resident land fig 2c and d the meteorological data were from the china meteorological assimilation driving datasets for the swat model the records of canal water conveyance in jiyuan were collected from the hetao irrigation district administration 3 2 model set up the ditches were used to serve as predefined streams while the canals were used to serve as the boundaries of sub basins within the jiyuan due to their dominant roles in affecting surface water system thus according to the distribution of water management infrastructures fig 3 a the jiyuan was divided into 28 sub basins as shown in fig 3b the watermelon and tamarisk were used to represent the vegetable and natural vegetation respectively then the sub basins were further subdivided into hrus through the combination of land use crop pattern soil type and slope finally 290 hrus and 350 hrus were identified for 2012 and 2013 respectively the agricultural management practices were considered involving irrigation planting mulching and harvesting operations the effects of nitrogen or phosphorus can be ignored because the applied fertilization is usually excessive in jiyuan the growing season was from april to september for different crops early or later during the growing season there were generally 4 to 6 water diversions based on the climate and river water conditions the corresponding management schedules are presented in table 1 the initial values of soil parameters were obtained from the hwsd dataset and our previous studies ren et al 2016 2017 2018b the parameters for capillary rise were referred to raes et al 2009 parameters that used to quantify plant growth of specific species were initialized as suggested by hao et al 2015 the initial values for salinity stress parameters are determined according to doorenbos and kassam 1979 and ren et al 2016 the groundwater parameters were obtained according to researches by bosch et al 2004 xu et al 2010 and on site survey the above mentioned parameters are listed in table 2 3 3 model calibration and evaluation the swat ag was calibrated and validated using the observation data in 2013 and 2012 respectively two types of datasets were used 1 the detailed observed data in yca for calibrating the process simulation and 2 the regional scale observed data in jiyuan with less frequency the datasets included the observed soil water storage and soil salinity concentration 0 100 cm depth i e the root zone leaf area index lai and gwd these terms draw more attentions in the case study area compared to the discharged stream flow which was very small the ranges of parameters were determined based on the relevant previous literatures especially those using the swat arnold et al 2012 douglas mankin et al 2010 tuppad et al 2011 ren et al 2016 2017 xu et al 2013 for process simulation in yca the sufi2 algorithm in the swat cup swat calibration uncertainty procedures abbaspour et al 2004 was used to conduct the sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation a more detailed description about the sufi2 algorithm and its application on the swat can be found in abbaspour et al 2007 2018 the results for process simulation will also be compared with the original swat in which the soil water storage and lai were the only two available terms because the original swat could not provide the information of soil salinity concentration and gwd the trial and error method was adopted for model calibration in jiyuan on a regional scale since the observation data was relatively limited in addition the calibrated parameters in yca could be used as the referenced values for regional simulation furthermore the model was evaluated by 1 comparing the simulated et with the remote sensing et in jiyuan with a 250 m resolution using modis data in 2012 yang et al 2012 and comparing the results with those obtained by our previous studies using the hydrus dualkc model as well as other balance models ren et al 2016 2017 2018b during above procedures some statistics evaluation criteria were employed including the nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr and the coefficient of determination r2 moriasi et al 2007 nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse and rsr both varies from 0 to 1 nse 1 represents a perfect fit nse 0 indicates that the mean observed value is a better predictor than the simulated value which indicates unacceptable performance r2 varies from 0 to 1 and r2 1 means the optimal fit rsr varies from 0 to rsr 0 means the optimal fit and the smaller rsr means the better performance 4 results and discussion 4 1 simulation and evaluation results the results of case study indicated that the swat ag could reasonably describe the agro hydrological processes under the environments of arid climate and shallow groundwater the evaluation with the detailed yca data showed that the swat ag could well capture the soil water salt dynamics groundwater level fluctuations and crop growth process in both calibration and validation periods 2013 and 2012 swat ag performed much better than the original swat in process simulation figs 4 6 and table 3 furthermore an acceptable agreement of simulated and observed data on a regional scale jiyuan were also obtained for two years related to soil water storage soil salinity concentration groundwater depth and actual evapotranspiration eta figs 7 and 8 the calibrated values for sensitive parameters are listed in table 2 the results of model evaluation were presented in detail in the following parts 4 1 1 evaluation of the process simulation using the detailed data in yca the comparison of simulated and measured data for three crop fields and a natural patch are presented in figs 4 6 and table 3 for the calibration 2013 and validation 2012 periods the results showed that the simulated soil water storage was in a good agreement with the measured soil water storage for various fields fig 4 the nse and r2 reached to 0 22 0 83 and 0 23 0 87 respectively in model calibration and validation meanwhile the rsr was almost less than 0 88 table 3 at the meantime the swat ag can reasonably capture the fluctuations of gwds especially reflecting the rapid rise to irrigation and the gradual decrease to subsequent groundwater evaporation and drainage fig 5 shows the observed data versus simulated gwd together with the precipitation and irrigation applied in the yca the fitness levels between simulated and observed gwds were both good for calibration nse 0 85 r2 0 89 and rsr 0 39 in 2013 and validation nse 0 81 r2 0 85 and rsr 0 44 in 2012 in addition it was obviously that the proposed swat ag had better performance in soil water simulation compared with the original swat fig 4 the nse r2 and rsr ranged from 55 8 to 0 23 0 22 to 0 87 and 1 11 to 7 54 respectively table 3 the simulated soil water storage can maintain and fluctuate at a high level by swat ag presenting reasonable responses to the gwd changes typically as in the first irrigation event in mid may figs 4 and 5 however the swat underestimated the soil water retention and its storages for all fields especially for maize and tamarisk fields fig 4 because it does not consider the effects of shallow aquifer on the root zone and could only capture the response to irrigation precipitation but no response to gwd fluctuations the simulated salt salinity concentrations were also in a reasonable agreement with the measured ones fig 4 producing nse 0 19 0 74 r2 0 29 0 82 and rsr 0 43 0 90 the simulation discrepancy of salinity concentration was a little larger than those of soil water this should be also acceptable considering that the salt had larger spatial heterogeneity than soil water and its movement was more uncertain and less stable ren et al 2016 2017 additionally the simulation for tamarisk patch was not as good as that for three crop fields due to the difficulties in simulation of plant growth of tamarisk overall the goodness of fit indicators obtained with the swat ag during the two years table 3 were within the range of values reported in previous studies with soil water models e g kumar et al 2015 ren et al 2016 xu et al 2013 2018b moreover the results indicated the swat ag seemed to more reasonably simulate the development of leaf area index lai than the swat for example the lai comparisons in maize simulation in fig 6 this simulation resulted in nse values of 0 72 and 0 86 r2 values of 0 83 and 0 89 and rsr values of 0 53 and 0 37 in 2013 and 2012 respectively the simulated lai by swat ag was relatively lower and fitted better with the observations than the original swat table 3 the improvement was especially significant in 2013 due to the relatively severe salinity problem because the swat ag can consider the effects of both water and salinity stress on et and crop biomass however the swat only included the water stress effects 4 1 2 regional performance in jiyuan fig 7 shows that the simulated data fitted well with the observed one during the calibration 2013 and validation 2012 on a regional scale related to the soil water storage salinity concentration and gwd for soil water storage it produced nse values of about 0 61 r2 values larger than 0 62 and rsr values smaller than 0 63 for two years meanwhile for soil salinity concentration the nse and r2 are higher than 0 87 and the rsr was lower than 0 37 the fitness indicators for gwds were nse values of 0 59 and 0 60 r2 values of 0 66 and 0 62 and rsr values of 0 64 and 0 63 for 2013 and 2012 respectively in addition the simulated drainage water amount at watershed outlet was about 19 mm and 16 mm during 2013 and 2012 which accounted for about 7 of irrigation water amount and was similar as that reported by ren et al 2018b in jiyuan the above comparison further indicated that the swat ag was able to simulate the regional agro hydrological processes with various ambient environments the swat ag can provide abundant regional information of water salt balance terms in space and time in this case the spatial distribution of the total eta the cumulative net water flux at 100 cm depth qc w and the soil salt storage change in 0 100 cm soil depth δs were presented in figs 8 and 9 in order to show the characteristics of the swat ag the simulated eta had a large spatial variance ranging from 147 to 1010 mm which was highly correlated with the land use cover types fig 2 the simulated eta had a visually similar spatial pattern with the remote sensing eta as presented in fig 8a the fitness results of simulated eta and remote sensing eta on a hru scale produced a nse 0 07 r2 0 03 and rsr 1 22 for the areas of croplands and natural lands the disagreement should be mainly attributed to that the remote sensing eta data had a coarse resolution 250 m which led to the mixed pixel problem i e one pixel often covers different kinds of land cover types and affected the data accuracy ren et al 2019 in addition there were relatively low values simulated for residential land and relatively high values simulated for water body fig 8b and c the simulated eta was reasonable in these two land use types compared to the remote sensing eta which obviously overestimated eta for residential land and underestimated eta for water body ren et al 2018b there was relatively higher evapotranspiration for croplands than natural lands figs 1 and 8 due to the irrigation water applied and less salinity effects with adequate irrigation typically as for sunflower the eta values reached average 511 mm and 540 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively although the vegetation was only irrigated once in crop growing season typically as for watermelon however the average eta values could reach to 427 mm and 385 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively because the non irrigated crops can grow well with using the lateral groundwater inflow from the surrounding irrigated croplands under shallow groundwater conditions this has been reasonably described by the swat ag in another aspect the natural vegetation can also utilize the groundwater contribution through capillary rise and survive in such arid climatic conditions however the eta for natural land was relatively lower average 422 mm and 428 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively showing a larger spatial variation 263 to 531 mm and 221 to 537 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively this was because the natural lands were generally the abandoned lands with different groundwater conditions and salinity levels the qc w and δs both varied greatly among different land use types due to the different management schedules and groundwater conditions figs 2 and 9 and table 4 results showed that there was significant groundwater contribution to the vegetable and natural vegetation during plant growing period resulting in a trend of salt accumulation in the root zone fig 9 the qc w was positive and averaged 153 mm and 159 mm for vegetation fields in 2012 and 2013 respectively because there was only once irrigation meanwhile the δs averaged 421 g m 2 and 376 g m 2 in 2012 and 2013 respectively for natural lands the qc w can reach to an average of 328 mm and 322 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively the trend of salt accumulation was much more serious with an average of δs reaching to 1340 g m 2 and 1361 g m 2 in 2012 and 2013 respectively for maize and sunflower the percolation and salt leaching were significant because there were 3 4 irrigation events during crop growing period however the upward groundwater capillary rise was also very large after the irrigation thus the qc w was still positive i e net upward flux for most fields of maize and sunflower e g qc w averaging 83 mm and 36 mm for maize and sunflower in jiyuan during 2013 respectively there was a slight trend of salt accumulation for maize with δs averaging 78 g m 2 and 47 g m 2 in 2012 and 2013 respectively due to the largest irrigation water applied for sunflower there was even a deceasing trend of salt storage with δs averaging 407 g m 2 and 855 g m 2 in 2012 and 2013 respectively in general the shallow groundwater system played an important role in contributing to crop water use and sustaining the local agroecosystems which were reasonably reflected by the swat ag it was worth noting that the values of qc w and δs both had the similar ranges and spatial distributions to those obtained by ren 2018 using the field scale hydrus model in a distributed manner there were also some differences because of the different model structure and conceptualization in model setup in summary the above regional evaluation further supported that the swat ag could efficiently improve the performance of agricultural hydrological modeling under arid and shallow water table environments with also reasonably describing the effects of shallow groundwater in sustaining the agroecosystems 4 2 discussion the test case indicated that the swat ag can successfully capture some key aspects of hydrological cycle in the agricultural watershed with shallow water tables these were mainly related to the close interactions of the vadose zone water groundwater salt and plant growth which were also still not solved in most hydrological models in this case the proposed swat ag could efficiently improve the simulation performance of the original swat acceptable agreement of the simulation and observation was obtained both in process simulation in yca and region simulation in jiyuan related to various terms of the soil water storage salinity concentration gwd and lai thus the case application supported that the swat ag should be an efficient tool for hydrological modeling in agricultural watershed and can strengthen the simulation capabilities of the well known swat model in addition the swat ag had some significant advantages in the practical application use typically when compared with the traditional agro hydrological models e g hydrus aquacrop and ahc raes et al 2009 šimůnek et al 2016 xu et al 2018 the swat ag can calculate the gwds and thus was efficient for the management scenario prediction for which the future gwds were not known however the traditional agro hydrological models generally required the input of observed gwds to drive the model both for farm scale simulation and the distributed manner simulation in another aspect the swat ag adopted the computationally efficient approaches e g hru based framework cascade approach for soil water and balanced based approach for groundwater and therefore it can simulate the complex agro hydrological processes efficiently with these approaches the swat ag may largely alleviate the computation burden and also avoid stability problems compared with the more complicated integrated numerical models designed for shallow aquifers e g mike she modflow hydrus and modflow swap twarakavi et al 2008 xu et al 2012 moreover the functionality of simulating the agricultural chemical yields e g nitrogen and phosphorus was not included in the present swat ag which will be the core of the follow up model development 5 conclusions in this paper the swat ag was developed to strengthen the simulation capability of hydrological model for watersheds with a large amount of irrigated areas especially considering the features of arid climate and shallow phreatic aquifer significant modifications were applied based on the swat framework in order to capture the agro hydrological processes in such watersheds they mainly included improving soil water module and crop growth module and newly incorporating salt balance module and groundwater module some new functions were developed for soil water module including the descriptions of the groundwater capillary rise and the effects of two agronomic measures soil bunds and surface mulching based on this a multi layered salt balance module was established for modeling the salt movement for groundwater a balance based module was constructed on a sub basin scale with considering the deep percolation capillary rise exploitation canal seepage and lateral drainage furthermore the effects of salinity stress were introduced to restrict the crop growth and water consumption the swat ag was then applied and tested in a case area of jiyuan irrigation system jiyuan in the upper yellow river basin with presenting good performance in model evaluation the evaluation of process simulation with detailed yca yangchang canal command area within jiyuan data showed that swat ag could well capture the soil water salt dynamics groundwater depth fluctuations and crop growth process and performed much better than the original swat model in addition the regional evaluation with jiyuan data showed that there was an acceptable agreement of simulated and observed data related to soil water storage soil salinity concentration groundwater depth and eta thus the swat ag was capable to describe the close interactions of vadose zone water and groundwater salt and plant growth which are important but still not solved in the swat and most hydrological models in addition the swat ag provided a lot of regional information of water salt balance terms in jiyuan with high computational efficiency analysis of spatial results indicated that the model could reveal the important role of shallow groundwater in supporting the plant growth and water use i e temporarily storing excessive irrigation water contributing crop water use in non irrigated croplands and natural lands and moving salt into natural lands to exert dry drainage effects and also seriously negative effects of salinity on some natural vegetation patches in summary this study presents the swat ag as an efficient tool for agro watershed hydrological modeling with maintaining a balance between complexity and practicality of the model it can also contribute to providing the improvement concepts for the other watershed models additionally our follow up investigation will mainly focus on incorporating the functionality of simulating the agricultural chemical yields e g nitrogen and phosphorus for watersheds with shallow groundwater conditions acknowledgements this

6569,identifying the flood susceptible areas is a vital and substantial element of disaster management for every country to control and mitigate injuries of the natural hazards the current research presents a framework for the preparation of flood prone areas maps by the integration of geospatial information system gis fuzzy logic and multi criteria decision making mcdm to achieve this goal a spectrum of geophysical geomorphological meteorological hydrological and geographical criteria have been addressed considering the linkage and the interdependencies of the criteria decision making trial and evaluation laboratory dematel approach are used to form the network of relations among the criteria moreover considering inevitable uncertainty ambiguity vagueness of the experts opinions fuzzy theory is integrated with dematel to handle the issue finally analytic network process anp are implemented to calculate the final weight of every single criterion the kurdistan province located in the north west of iran is considered as the case study in which numerous flood events has had recently happened the efficiency of the model is assessed through the area under the curve auc and statistical measures such as the kappa index in order to evaluate the produced classified flood susceptibility map the map of historical flood events in the province is also used about 85 of validation area is classified as very high flood susceptible which implies the efficiency of proposed framework for flood susceptibility mapping furthermore for evaluating the functionality of the framework in comparison with traditional approaches the well known ahp methodology is implemented too the validation results demonstrate that the fuzzy dematel anp model auc roc 0 938 kappa 0 88 has a higher performance accuracy compare to the ahp model auc roc 0 918 kappa 0 79 moreover comparing the proposed and validation model shows that the proposed framework can effectively improve decision makers to provide flood susceptibility maps and recognize flood susceptible areas in data scarce and ungauged regions keywords flood susceptibility map mcdm fuzzy dematel anp gis 1 introduction occurrence of flood events always threat the human society due to the financial and social damages which follow its frequent occurrence the flood event plays a significant role among the different natural disasters dawod et al 2012 papaioannou et al 2015 nowadays climate change and changes of land use are known as the main important causes of flood events regarding the climate changes most of the rainfall happened in the form of cloud bursting showers heavy and sudden rainfall events immediately change into flood events because the intensity of the rain is much more than the soil infiltration capacity khosravi et al 2016 kjeldsen 2010 tehrany et al 2014b another source of the flood is land use change which plays an important role in hydrological processes such as infiltration evapotranspiration and also surface runoff rizeei et al 2018 szwagrzyk et al 2018 regarding the above highlighted issues iran is not an exception considering the spatiotemporal varying precipitation in the most of the iran s basins relatively large area multiple climate of iran and increase of urban area in flood prone zones numerous flood events happened in a way that the damages has increased with the rate of more than 2 5 times in the past decade khosravi et al 2016 szwagrzyk et al 2018 the main reasons of increasing flood losses are the absence of sufficient studies and information about flood susceptible areas and lack of appropriate plan to prevent flood khosravi et al 2016 even though the prevention of flood may be considered as an impossible mission it could be predicted using appropriate methodologies and analysis cloke and pappenberger 2009 khosravi et al 2016 therefore the prevention and mitigation actions are inevitable alvarado aguilar et al 2012 khosravi et al 2016 in recent years the paradigm of the flood coping has changed from the traditional concept of flood protection to the new ones of so called flood risk management meyer et al 2009 schanze 2006 flood risk management may be divided into two main folds including flood risk assessment and risk reduction actions the overall goal of the flood risk assessment could be described as the recognition of the places where the value of flood risk is high i e risk alleviating actions are urgently necessary meyer et al 2009 flood management and risk reduction strategies must be planned based on the characteristics of the estimation of the flood s damage including intensity frequency magnitude and the consequences flood risk analysis is based on the advanced hydrologic and hydrodynamic models in order to estimate flood s peak and magnitude and the spatiotemporal propagation of the flood waves in river and flood plains however this engineering procedure is commonly useful for the small regions i e a part of a river basin in order to estimate the flood risk for available structures e g buildings and hydraulic structures so in basin scale the aforementioned procedure cannot be used due to the data scarcity and information accessibility that s why even in the developed countries a comprehensive map of the flood risk in extent of a basin is an onerous task moel et al 2009 papaioannou et al 2015 one of the necessary preventive measures is to provide flood susceptibility maps in which a number of studies has investigated the issue bubeck et al 2012 khosravi et al 2016 liu et al 2008 lyu et al 2018 pradhan and youssef 2011 tehrany et al 2015 termeh et al 2018 flood susceptibility maps are beneficial for the planning of future urban development and also the reconnaissance of the flood susceptible areas büchele et al 2006 dawson et al 2006 liu et al 2008 pradhan and youssef 2011 rahmati et al 2016a tehrany et al 2014a to prevent and reduce flood damages it is vital to identify its effective factors in other words the behavior of the flood s procedures must be recognized before any controlling plan the outburst of flood could be under the effects of various factors such as the geomorphology vegetation geologic and hydrologic parameters and patterns that must be considered in providing of the flood susceptibility maps therefore flood susceptibility mapping is a multi criteria decision making mcdm process the analysis of mcdm is significantly helpful approach in order to analyze and evaluate complicated decisions which include incommensurable data or criteria hwang and lin 2012 malczewski 2006 these methods provide objective decisions as they can handle the inherent complexity and uncertainty of such problems as well as the knowledge arising from the participation of several experts yan et al 2011 zagonari and rossi 2013 despite the fact that there is a vast spectrum of decision making methodologies none of them is applicable and suitable for all of the decision making problems thus choosing a reasonable decision making tool depends on the type of the problem and managers objectives de brito and evers 2016 complex decision making such as flood susceptibility assessment which include various spatial criteria can be examined through geographic information systems gis capability of visualization analysis and management of spatial data meyer et al 2009 papaioannou et al 2015 tang et al 2018 gis plays an important role in analyzing and assessing the impact of natural disasters haq et al 2012 kanani sadat et al 2014 karimipour and kanani sadat 2016 pourghasemi et al 2013 therefore many researches has investigated flood analysis and developing flood susceptibility map via the capabilities of gis sanyal and lu 2009 strobl et al 2012 tehrany et al 2014a 2014b termeh et al 2018 white et al 2010 khosravi et al 2018 tested four decision trees based machine learning methods namely naive bayes trees logistic model trees alternating decision trees and reduced error pruning trees for flood susceptibility mapping at the haraz watershed in iran hong et al 2018a addressed the development of a flood susceptibility assessment who used intelligent methods and gis framework an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis was coupled with a differential evolution and genetic algorithm ga for flood spatial modelling hong et al 2018b proposed an approach to create a flood susceptibility map in the poyang county jiangxi province china by implementing data mining and fuzzy weight of evidence methods these machine learning methods used in the aforementioned articles are proper for the regions where the spatial distribution of historical flood events is available and thus cannot be applied in ungauged regions in order to cover the problem of data scarcity for flood susceptibility mapping mcdm could play an important role in ungauged area combination of gis and mcdm founds multi criteria spatial decision support systems mc sdss which leads to the solution of spatial decisions arabsheibani et al 2016 boroushaki and malczewski 2010 chen et al 2011 in many researches solutions are offered for the susceptibility assessment of natural disasters using syntheses of gis and mcdm malczewski 2006 paquette and lowry 2013 scheuer et al 2011 solín 2012 fernández and lutz 2010 has discussed the applicability of gis and multiple criteria decision analysis mcda for providing flood susceptibility maps in tucuman province in argentina this study indicates that coupling of ahp and gis framework acts as a powerful tool to prepare precise flood susceptibility maps it was also described by zou et al 2013 that ahp could be considered as an intelligible affordable and convenient approach for flood risk evaluation papaioannou et al 2015 presented a framework for mapping of flooded area using gis fuzzy logic and mcdm they have explored a set of criteria including geographical morphological climatological meteorological and hydrological factors of the basin as well as land use in the research ahp and fuzzy ahp methodologies were used to generate flood susceptible map in their research rahmati et al 2016b analyzed flood risk via gis and multi criteria evaluations it is also reported in this research that distance to rivers land use height and the slope are used as main four parameters for the study area of yasooj city in iran this research suggests the hybrid use of ahp and gis to assess the flood risk potential especially in ungauged areas de brito and evers 2016 have investigated the application of mcdm methodologies in flood risk management also research procedures and flaws of this field of study it is also stated that during their review research they have chosen the number of 128 papers from 72 different journals from 1995 to 2015 in which mcdm have been used for flood management this study implies the growth of the mcdm utilities in flood management systems in recent years which itself demonstrate the capabilities of mcdm ahp is the most favorite among numerous mcdm approaches due to eligibility and convenience of the method based on their research despite the fact that mcdms are very prevailed on the investigated researches the problem of uncertainty remained unsolved in most of the researches researches consider the uncertainty scarcely in case of the flood studies due to different opinions corresponding to different experts in each problem handling the uncertainty in case of the assessment of the experts judgments improves the quality of decision making procedure the current research presents an objective gis based framework to identify flood susceptible areas in multiple catchment scale at ungauged watershed the earth s digital elevation model dem and its geomorphologic and hydrological characteristics such as slopes and rivers have become standard tools for recognizing the flood susceptible areas noman et al 2001 papaioannou et al 2015 in the current paper the criteria for mapping of flood susceptible areas are considered as dem of land and its derivatives vegetation land use soil and rainfall which are integrated using multi criteria decision making susceptibility analysis and flood area mapping consist of various criteria which are geographically interconnected booij 2005 poussin et al 2014 rahmati et al 2016b consequently each criterion of flood analysis has different level of impact on the others so an efficient mcdm approach must be able to handle these interdependencies on the calculations in order to offer an optimum solution based on de brito and evers de brito and evers 2016 none of the researches that are related to flood susceptibility mapping has taken the criteria s dependencies into account moreover no study has implemented decision making trial and evaluation laboratory dematel method to investigate the inter dependencies between the criteria therefore in order to cover the gap of current methodology one novel point of this research is taking the advantage of dematel method to clarify the causal relationships between flood susceptibility criteria the process of decision making associated with flood management is a complicated procedure that is associated with uncertainty akter and simonovic 2005 kenyon 2007 part of this complexity is due to the presence of numerous experts with different perspectives knowledge interests and often with different goals de brito and evers 2016 in current paper the fuzzy theory is integrated with dematel concept to manage the aforementioned uncertainty of experts opinions then the results of fuzzy dematel have been used by anp in order to calculate the final weight of each criterion consequently the final flood potential map is prepared based on the calculated weight in a gis environment in order to evaluate the results the produced maps for the historical flood maps are used besides the well known objective measures of receiver operating characteristic roc curve area under the curve auc and kappa statistic were deployed for validation moreover for evaluating the functionality of implemented framework in comparison with traditional approaches flood susceptibility map is produced using ahp methodology and the results are compared the proposed framework enables decision makers in identifying the influenced areas by flood events caused by heavy rains and river outburst this framework can be used to generate a flood susceptibility map in areas with limited information or in areas where preliminary flood susceptibility assessment is required to provide flood mapping using conventional hydrologic and hydraulic methods then based on the primary evaluation and identification of susceptible areas it is possible to analyze the flood risk by collecting precise data and using hydraulic methods in short we have developed a new approach to assess flood susceptibility in data scarce and ungauged environments specific objectives of this study are i assessing the interdependencies among flood susceptibility criteria through fuzzy dematel method ii evaluating the role of various parameters that affect flood events iii modeling and validating flood susceptibility map using two models of fuzzy dematel anp and ahp and investigating the sensitivity of the resulted maps to the different classification methods the novelties of the present study lie in development of a new flood susceptibility assessment approach which is applicable in data scarce and ungauged regions through taking the advantage of dematel method to clarify the causal relationships between flood susceptibility criteria and integrating fuzzy theory with dematel to handle the uncertainty of experts opinions 2 methods and materials in the current paper an objective gis based hybrid multi criteria decision making ghmcdm framework is developed to identify flood susceptible area in region including number of basins the fuzzy dematel method is used to establish a relationship network between flood susceptibility criteria in the second step the anp method uses the dematel output to calculate the final weight of the criteria finally by combining the criteria with gis the preparation and representation of a spatial model of the flood risk is completed in this section computational steps of fuzzy dematel and anp methods are explained 2 1 fuzzy dematel in complex decision making problems many elements of a system may be directly indirectly interrelated büyüközkan and güleryüz 2016 dematel method developed for the first time at the geneva research center at battelle memorial institute gabus and fontela 1973 effectively analyzes the direct indirect relationships between components of the system based on its intensity and type arabsheibani et al 2016 dematel method examines the interdependencies between the criteria the causal relationships between them and the weight of each of the relationships taking advantage of matrices or directed graphs dematel is used to visualize the structure of complex causal relationships these matrices or graphs depict the relations between different system elements so that the numbers indicate the intensity of the relationships dou et al 2014 tseng and lin 2009 the dematel technique is based on directed graphs that can divide the factors involved into two groups including cause group and effected groups in this assessment the numbers 0 1 2 3 and 4 respectively represent no influence very low influence low influence high influence and very high influence for example the line between the c2 and c5 criteria in fig 1 shows that the c2 criterion has a very high influence on the c5 criterion analysis of the overall relationship between system components by the dematel method is an ideal approach for solving complex system problems and can provide a better comprehension of the structural relationship of the system therefore the dematel method can transform the relationship between the cause and effect into an understandable structure of the system arabsheibani et al 2016 büyüközkan and güleryüz 2016 jassbi et al 2011 in spite of the fact that dematel is an effective method for assessing the dependence between criteria it is not accurate to express the opinions and preferences of experts by exact numbers managers and decision makers decide about the weight of the causal relationship between the criteria based on their knowledge and experience which is a human centered operation which certainly happens in an environment of uncertainty therefore in order to have a reliable mcdm the ambiguity in the linguistic variables of the experts must be handled gigović et al 2016 jassbi et al 2011 sangaiah et al 2017 yeh and huang 2014 zadeh 1965 has introduced fuzzy logic as an effective approach for dealing with uncertainty to manage the ambiguity of human point of views fuzzy variables are used to express decision makers preferences arabsheibani et al 2016 kanani sadat et al 2015 vinodh et al 2016 lin and wu 2004 used triangular fuzzy numbers to introduce fuzzy dematel fig 2 shown in table 1 are linguistic variables and those corresponding triangular fuzzy numbers l ij k m ij k u ij k by integrating fuzzy logic and dematel fuzzy dematel method consists of procedure as follows arabsheibani et al 2016 jassbi et al 2011 lin et al 2018 tadić et al 2014 vinodh et al 2016 step 1 acquiring the fuzzy direct relation matrix experts provide a bundle of pairwise comparison between each two distinct criteria e ij k l ij k m ij k u ij k is a triangular fuzzy number where k denotes the number of corresponding experts in which k 1 n judgment of k th expert about the influence of i th criterion on j th one is e ij k fuzzy direct relation matrix a is calculated using eq 1 where n is the number of the experts hence a can be calculated as it is formulated in eq 2 1 a e 1 e 2 e n n 2 a 0 a 12 a 1 n a 21 0 a 2 n a n 1 a n 2 0 in this matrix triangular fuzzy numbers are a ij l ij m ij u ij besides a ii is equal to 0 0 0 for all i 1 n step 2 calculating the normalized fuzzy direct relation matrix the normalized fuzzy direct relation matrix x is obtained using the matrix a via eqs 3 and 4 3 x 0 x 12 x 1 n x 21 0 x 2 n x n 1 x n 2 0 4 x ij a ij s l ij s m ij s u ij s s max 1 i n j 1 n u ij step 3 acquiring the fuzzy total relation matrix the fuzzy total relation matrix t that contains the direct indirect relationships of the criteria is obtained through the following relationships in eqs 5 and 6 in this equilibrium i is identity matrix 5 t t 11 t 12 t 1 n t 21 t 22 t 2 n t n 1 t n 2 t nn t ij l ij m ij u ij i j 1 2 n 6 l ij x l i x l 1 m ij x m i x m 1 u ij x u i x u 1 in order to comprehend the effects between the criteria it is recommended to convert the fuzzy direct relation values to defuzzified numbers defuzzification of fuzzy numbers in the total relation matrix t offers a better understanding about the relations between the criteria in order to compute defuzzified total relation matrix elements of t must be defuzzified using eq 7 then using the α cut threshold which is defined by experts the minor influences will be filtered out a general schema of α cut total relation matrix t α is shown in eq 8 if t ij α then t ij α 0 otherwise t ij α t ij which t ij is the element of the defuzzified total relation matrix t def 7 t ij def l ij 4 m ij u ij 6 8 t α t 11 α t 1 j α t 1 n α t i 1 α t ij α t in α t n 1 α t nj α t nn α step 4 acquiring the fuzzy values of d and r r i sum up the i th row of the matrix t and expresses the direct indirect influences that criterion i has on other criteria eq 9 also d j which is the sum of the j th column of the matrix t represents the overall influences of all the criteria on the j criterion eq 10 9 r r i n 1 j 1 n t ij 10 d d j 1 n i 1 n t ij step 5 defuzzification of fuzzy values of r d and r d to acquire the importance of the criteria and understand the causal relationship between criteria r d and r d are being defuzzified using eq 11 indicator r i d i shows the intensity of the influence of the i criterion on the remaining criteria indeed r i d i shows the degree of i th criterion s importance in the problem the influence of the criteria in the system will be uncovered with the parameter r i d i if the r i d i value is positive the i th criterion is an effective criterion and falls into the category of causes also if the value r i d i is negative the i th criterion will be under the influence of others and fall into the category of effects measures with a higher r d value have a greater influence on other criteria and have higher priority and as a result criteria that have low r d values are under the effects of other criteria and have a lower priority 11 r d def r d l fuzzy 4 r d m fuzzy r d u fuzzy 6 2 2 analytic network process saaty 1996 presented anp methodology in 1996 which is more comprehensive method than ahp approach the calculations of these two methods are quite different so the corresponding results would not be the same too in the ahp method it is assumed that each criterion is independent of other criteria and there is no correlation between the criteria which defines the decision making as a one way hierarchical structure while there might be some dependencies in reality khosravi et al 2016 papaioannou et al 2015 yeh and huang 2014 to overcome this in the anp method the dependencies between the criteria is managed through a network model and the hierarchical structure restriction is eliminated which can lead to precise results büyüközkan and güleryüz 2016 ghorbanzadeh et al 2018 lee et al 2017 vinodh et al 2016 the anp method to determine the final weight of the criteria includes the following steps arabsheibani et al 2016 chang et al 2012 gölcük and baykasoğlu 2016 step 1 forming a super matrix by using comparison of the criteria the super matrix consists of the pairwise comparison of the criteria the relative importance values of the criteria in a pairwise comparison fall into the numerical scale 1 for the same importance to 9 for the very high importance saaty 1996 the general form of the super matrix is symbolized in the form of eq 12 in which cn refers to the n th criterion and wij points to the effect of j th criterion on the objective in comparison with the i th criterion 12 w c 1 c 2 c n w 11 w 12 w n 1 w 21 w 22 w 2 n w n 1 w n 2 w nn c 1 c 2 c n step 2 acquiring the weighted supermatrix sum of the elements of each row of the α cut total relation matrix which is derived using dematel can be calculated as formulated in eq 13 13 d i j 1 n t ij α hence the normalized α cut total relation matrix which is notated by ts can be calculated using eq 14 14 t s t 11 α d 1 t 1 j α d 1 t 1 n α d 1 t i 1 α d i t ij α d i t in α d i t n 1 α d n t nj α d n t nn α d n t 11 s t 1 j s t 1 n s t i 1 s t ij s t in s t n 1 s t nj s t nn s then the weighted supermatrix ww is obtained by applying eq 15 to the unweighted supermatrix w 15 w w t 11 s w 11 t 1 j s w j 1 t 1 n s w n 1 t i 1 s w 1 i t ij s w ji t in s w ni t n 1 s w 1 n t nj s w jn t nn s w nn step 3 limiting the weighted supermatrix by raising it to a sufficiently large power k as shown in eq 16 the weighted supermatrix ww converges and becomes a long term stable matrix by limiting ww powered to a large enough number finally the rows of wl offer the ultimate weights of the criteria 16 w l l i m k w w k 3 study area the interested area to implement the proposed method is kurdistan province located in western iran with area equal to 29 137 square kilometers and 1 6 million population the province is located in the western mountainous zone of iran with the lowest and highest elevations equal to 690 and 3210 m above mean see level and also with 13 different basins fig 3 in the region the highest and lowest annual rainfall is equal to 800 and 400 mm year respectively the climate of kurdistan is under the influence by the warm and sultry mediterranean climate that cause mass rain in the spring and snow in the winters each year due to heavy rainfall numerous floods occur in the kurdistan province which has been accompanied by financial losses and even many human casualties for example on april 14 2017 a severe flood occurred in the northern part of the kurdistan province which led to the deaths of 5 people in addition to its financial losses therefore providing a map of flood susceptible areas can help managers and decision makers to identify areas at risk of flood and take appropriate prevention and alleviation actions one of the important aspects in the preparation of a flood susceptibility map by using geomorphologic indices is the selection of the suitable criteria papaioannou et al 2015 there is no consensus about the issue that which factors should intervene the preparation of flood susceptibility maps rahmati et al 2016b however the researchers have investigated some of the criteria frequently which implies the vital role of those papaioannou et al 2015 precipitation is an important parameter in the flood process in the current research recorded monthly precipitation from 17 meteorological stations during 1975 up to 2015 is used for our case study the proprietary data was given in response to our official requests for educational purposes most of the data are provided in shapefile format containing both spatial and descriptive information the used basic data sets and layers of the study area in this research are as follows topography maps of scale 1 25000 with contour intervals equal to 10 m national cartographic center of iran land use map of scale 1 50000 provincial government of kurdistan soil type map of scale 1 50000 national cartographic center of iran rainfall statistics provided by synoptic stations iran meteorological organization river map of scale 1 50000 national cartographic center of iran landsat8 satellite images united states geological survey historical map of occurred flood in the northern part of kurdistan province to check the reliability of the method as validation area provincial government of kurdistan in order to evaluate the proposed model the analysis of historical flood events is inevitable in our research a flood inventory map is prepared based on the flood events that occurred during 2015 and 2018 therefore local reports and news are surveyed and flood inventory map is generated via the location mapping of 28 reported flood events moreover 40 points are randomly selected within the validation area and consequently the total number of 68 flooded points are used for evaluation besides 51 points are randomly selected within the non flooded zones tehrany et al 2014c flooded and non flooded points are assigned a value of 1 and 0 respectively 4 identification of flood susceptible areas in this paper in order to identify the flood susceptible areas in multiple catchment scale ghmcdm framework is proposed and evaluated shown in fig 4 is the overall structure of the mcdm model the first step includes the identification and normalization of the criteria after analyzing experts opinions using fuzzy dematel anp offers final weights of each criterion finally the criteria will be integrated in a gis environment based on their weights occurred in the past floods map are considered as validation area data using validation area the generated maps are evaluated all these stages are designed to reduce the subjectivity of the model as much as possible so the framework could be established for a variety of regions 4 1 identification of the criteria making any decision requires employing the measurable and comparable decision criteria according to the experts opinion and with the spatial processing of the collected data the proposed framework deal with a number of 10 effective flood criteria the selected criteria are horizontal overland flow distance c1 vertical overland flow distance c2 topographic wetness index c3 slope c4 flow accumulation c5 curve number c6 digital elevation model c7 topographic position index c8 modified fournier index c9 and vegetation index c10 each criterion is produced in a raster format with spatial resolution of 30 m due to the inhomogeneity of the criteria s essence the generated maps must be normalized the normalization process enhance the objectivity of the approach if the higher value of a layer is associated with higher flood susceptibility the layer would be normalized by eq 17 otherwise eq 18 would be used where x and y are un normalized and normalized layers respectively xmin and xmax are respectively the lowest and highest value of each layer demonstrated in the fig 5 are normalized criteria maps 17 y x x min x max x min 18 y x max x x max x min dem layer is prepared with gis using topographic maps lower the elevation of area in comparison with neighbors more flood susceptibility the area is faced horizontal overland flow distance hofd is the horizontal component of water movement to reach river network also the vertical overland flow distance vofd represents the vertical component between the height of each cell and the calculated height for the river network areas with lower hofd and vofd values have more potential to flood topographic wetness index twi which is a combination of two parameters including the area of upstream basin and slope can state the influence of the topography on flood quantitatively so twi is calculated using eq 19 where as is the area of upstream basin and β is slope angle beven and kirkby 1979 sörensen et al 2006 19 twi ln a s tan β in system for automated geoscientific analyses saga platform the so called saga wetness index is calculated for current paper this indicator is similar to the twi indicator except that it uses the modified area of the basin in such a way that it does not consider the flow as thin layer as a result for cells in a valley floor with a bit difference in elevation with the river a more realistic prediction is made and the value of potential soil moisture is calculated more than the usual twi method s results olaya and conrad 2009 higher the wetness of the area more flood potential for that slope and flow accumulation layers can be produced using typical gis platform areas that located in lower slope or flat and or more accumulated flow region are more susceptible by flood events curve number cn is an experimental indicator in practical hydrology to simulate direct runoff from rainfall this indicator was proposed by the us department of agriculture s soil conservation service scs it is worthwhile to mention that that cn is a function of soil type land use and soil moisture condition spatially distributed map of cn grid is calculated for the study area by combining the soil map and the land use information in hec geohms fleming and doan 2009 the cn value band within the range of 30 up to 100 and regions with larger cn values can generate more runoff versus areas with lower cn values ponce and hawkins 1996 topographic position index tpi shows the height difference of each cell with mean heights of its neighboring cells eq 20 for cells that are higher than their neighbors the amount of tpi is positive and for the cells below the neighbors tpi is negative therefore the relative topographic position of a location may be in one of the categories including valley low slope flat plain average and high slope and ridge weiss 2001 20 tpi z 0 i 1 n z i n spatially distributed layer of tpi is calculated with radius 3 cell size 90 m areas with lower tpi contribute more prone to occurring flood event rainfall intensity as another important factor in occurring flood event is prepared using the modified fournier index mfi eq 21 where p i is the average for i th month and p is the annual average rainfall gabriels 2006 mfi is calculated for all stations and by interpolating over the study area the mfi map is generated 21 mfi i 1 12 p i 2 p normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is a well known indicator to determine an area vegetation coverage regions covered by more sparse vegetation are more vulnerable to flood ndvi is calculated eq 22 where nir is near infrared band and r is the red band of satellite imagery khosravi et al 2016 22 ndvi nir r nir r in order to calculate the ndvi index for the study area landsat 8 satellite images of date june 2016 has been used the band 4 and 5 landsat 8 images are closely related to the red and infrared bands respectively by which the ndvi layer is determined 4 2 experts judgment survey in the current paper eight 8 experts from different fields four hydrology two geology and two gis experts have been selected to identify the factors and their relationships and their impact on the flood events experts presented their views on the severity of the internal dependencies between defined criteria via linguistic variables in order to determine the existence and intensity of relationships between the criteria using the fuzzy dematel method the pairwise comparison tables are converted to their corresponding triangular fuzzy values the average direct relation fuzzy matrix is obtained in accordance with eq 1 afterwards normalized fuzzy direct relation matrix is calculated using eq 4 then using eq 6 the fuzzy total relation is obtained which includes all direct and indirect relationships between the criteria besides to analyze the role of criteria in the system and to examine the impact of each criterion the sum of the rows r and the sum of the column d of the total relation fuzzy matrix are calculated using the relationships 9 10 and 11 next the total relation fuzzy matrix is converted to defuzzified matrix using eq 7 which illustrate the dependencies of the flood criteria via non fuzzy numbers minor dependencies of the criteria are filtered by defining an α cut threshold if the relations value is less than the introduced threshold they would be truncated and neglected on the afterward calculations in the next step in order to calculate anp weights the experts are asked to state their perspectives about the relational importance of each criterion amongst others thereupon the α cut total relation matrix is normalized and weighted super matrix is calculated using eq 14 eq 15 respectively final anp weights of the criteria is derived by self multiplication of weighted super matrix eq 16 the elements of the rows of this stabled matrix demonstrate the final weights of each criterion besides for evaluating the functionality of implemented framework in comparison with traditional approaches flood susceptibility map is produced using ahp methodology and finally the results are compared 4 3 susceptibility map production and classification ghmcdm has been implemented spatially distributed in the current study and the potential map of flood has been produced for each cell with which correspond a real spot on the ground the criteria have been integrated in a gis environment using eq 23 after finalization of their weights for both anp and ahp methods 23 fsi i 1 10 w i c i where fsi is the flood susceptibility index wi is the weight of each criterion and ci is the relevant normalized criterion therefore flood susceptibility indices have been spatially calculated over the study area pixel wise putting the results together in a color coded map the final flood susceptibility map is generated for the kurdistan province in order to facilitate the interpretation of the generated susceptibility map and identification of vulnerable areas it is possible to classify the susceptibility index map based on our experts consultations the final flood susceptibility index map is classified in five distinct susceptibility categories including very high high medium low and very low most of the conducted researches in the literature use simple classification tools provided generally in gis platform in this study in order to investigate the sensitivity of the resulted flood susceptibility map to the classification method the authors implemented five different classification methods including geometrical interval clara fcm natural breaks and k means 4 4 susceptibility map validation an essential stage of flood susceptibility modelling is accuracy validation in order to assess the performance of our model we have used receiver operator characteristic roc arabameri et al 2019 the roc curve represents the graphical relationship of the specificity and sensitivity for different possible threshold values the x axis of the roc curve eq 24 corresponds to false positive rate 1 specificity and the y axis eq 25 corresponds to true positive rate sensitivity while sensitivity value signifies the ratio of flooded points true positive that are correctly predicted specificity value represents the ratio of correctly predicted non flooded points true negative therefore higher value of 1 specificity shows a higher rate of false positives arabameri et al 2019 tehrany et al 2014c 24 x 1 s p e c i f i c i t y 1 tn tn f p 25 y s e n s i t i v i t y tp tp f n where tp true positive and tn true negative are the number of points that are correctly classified as flooded and non flooded respectively fp false positive demonstrates the number of non flooded points that are predicted as flooded and fn false negative the number of flooded points predicted as non flooded the area under the curve of roc auc roc is widely used for model validation and estimation of model performance arabameri et al 2019 falah et al 2019 frattini et al 2010 khosravi et al 2018 the quantitative qualitative relation between auc and prediction rate that lies between 0 and 1 is as follows excellent 0 9 1 very good 0 8 0 9 good 0 7 0 8 average 0 6 0 7 and weak 0 5 0 6 arabameri et al 2019 besides statistical measure of overall accuracy is calculated to assess the comparative efficiency of our model overall accuracy measures the proportion of validation points including flooded and non flooded that are correctly classified eq 26 shafapour tehrany et al 2019 26 overall a c c u r a c y tp t n tp f p t n f n in order to determine optimized threshold value the corresponding overall accuracy is iteratively calculated in which threshold value ranges from 0 to 1 with a step of 0 01 the threshold value which corresponds to the optimized overall accuracy is selected for classifying validation points to flooded and non flooded moreover for further assessment of model efficiency the kappa measure is investigated too khosravi et al 2018 the quantitative qualitative relation between kappa and model performance that falls from 0 to 1 is as follows perfect 0 99 1 excellent 0 85 0 99 good 0 55 0 85 moderate 0 4 0 55 and poor 0 0 4 monserud and leemans 1992 furthermore in order to evaluate the classified maps of flood susceptibility the map of historical flood event extent in the northern parts of the kurdistan province has been employed by overlaying the classified maps with the occurred flood map the rate of the validity of each category for each classification method is achieved 5 result and discussion in the proposed approach 10 criteria including geomorphologic and hydrologic parameters as well as land cover and land use have been investigated all the criteria have been integrated in a gis environment to generate the final flood susceptibility maps relative importance and dependencies of the criteria have been extracted using the pairwise comparison of experts judgments based on the surveyed opinions of a group of experts the procedure of fuzzy dematel and anp have been implemented tables s1 and s2 present the average direct relation fuzzy matrix and normalized fuzzy direct relation matrix respectively the fuzzy total relation which includes all direct indirect relationships between the criteria is presented in table s3 the sum of the rows r and the sum of the columns d of the total relation fuzzy matrix are calculated to analyze the role of criteria in the system and to examine the impact of each criterion the transformation of the fuzzy numbers d r and d r into defuzzified numbers facilitates the interpretation of the internal relations between the criteria table 2 based on the ri di indicator in table 2 twi c3 flow accumulation c5 curve number c6 and vegetation index c10 take influences from others and fall into the category of effects while hofd c1 vofd c2 slope c4 dem c7 tpi c8 and mfi c9 are classified in causes category ri di is an indicator which can prioritize the criteria hence dem c7 have most influence on others while vegetation index c10 is mostly under the influence of others also ri di indicator can be interpreted as the importance of a criterion among and in comparison with others so as illustrated in table 2 vofd c2 twi c3 flow accumulation c5 dem c7 and vegetation index c10 play the very vital roles on the system scenario and among all dem c7 is the most vital one this explains logically the fact that twi slope tpi flow accumulation hofd and vofd are derived from dem layer and consequently the dem have influence on these defuzzified total relation matrix which illustrates the dependencies of the flood criteria via non fuzzy numbers is presented in table s4 in order to filter out minor dependencies experts are asked to express their own opinion about the optimum α threshold by averaging all surveyed opinions the α is considered 0 025 table s5 table s6 presents the experts perspectives about the relational importance of each criterion amongst others the normalized α cut total relation matrix and weighted super matrix is shown in tables s7 and s8 respectively in our calculations limiting a supermatrix powered to 18 the weighted supermatrix ww converge to an idempotent matrix and final weights for each criterion is calculated moreover in order to compare the efficiency of the proposed method weights of the criteria are calculated using the ahp too illustrated in table 3 is the final weights of the investigated criteria in the present study for flood potential based on the table 3 twi c3 flow accumulation c5 and cn c6 are most important criteria respectively in the flood susceptibility modelling hence flood susceptible areas identification depends mainly on these three factors therefore the higher the twi flow accumulation and cn the more susceptible the area on the other hand the weight of slope and mfi is about 0 0292 and 0 0215 respectively which is the lowest weights in comparison of other criteria weights therefore the effect of these two criteria is less in flood potential in it is to note that the weights have been calculated for the case study and they may differ in another cases considering the final weights the flood susceptibility index map is produced fig 6 the performance and efficiency of fuzzy dematel anp and ahp is assessed according to the measures defined in section 4 4 table 4 based on the evaluation of flooded points fuzzy dematel anp shows the higher value of sensitivity 95 59 in comparison with ahp 94 12 this implies that fuzzy dematel anp has more successfully predicted the flooded points furthermore fuzzy dematel anp has a higher specificity 92 16 in prediction of non flooded points the overall accuracy of fuzzy dematel anp is 94 12 which implies that this method is modeled flood susceptibility more accurately than the ahp method 89 92 on the other hand the fact that the kappa measure of fuzzy dematel anp 0 88 excelent is higher than ahp 0 79 good signifies that fuzzy dematel anp approach would result in a more reliable modelling of reality fig 7 depicts that the auc roc value of fuzzy dematel anp 0 938 is higher that one of ahp 0 918 one can conclude from the validation results that fuzzy dematel anp is a more efficient model for detecting flood susceptible areas as it considers the interrelationship between flood criteria and calculation of criteria weights through a network model in order to facilitate the interpretation and identification of flood prone areas the generated susceptibility index map is classified using 6 different approaches the classified flood potential maps of kurdistan are demonstrated in fig 8 the distribution of resulted maps classified in 5 classes presented in table 5 for both fuzzy dematel anp and ahp approaches as demonstrated in fig 8 northwest a small part of in west and southwest and eastern part of the study area are highly affected by flood events considering the details of the fig 5 and table 3 one can infer that the role of the criteria that have more weights are more prominent i e the regions in which these layers have greater index the flood susceptibility classes are high and very high for instance in the eastern part of the province twi flow accumulation and river network are more and slope and vegetation are less besides the vertical distances to the river are less so it can be concluded that the flood potential of this regions is high on the other hand central area of the kurdistan province has less twi river network as well as more altitude and vegetation therefore these regions fall into low flood potential classes by overlaying our classified maps with validation area the rate of the validity of each category for each classification method is achieved table 6 and fig 9 demonstrate these evaluation results for both methods as illustrated in table 6 and fig 9 except for the geometrical interval classification method most parts of the validation area fall within the classes very high and high as presented in the fig 9 in the fuzzy dematel anp method more regions are included in the very high category in comparison with ahp method which is more consistent with the reality so in comparison with the ahp it can be concluded that proposed method has modeled the flood extent more efficiently clara method has the most percentage 85 01 of tendency for very high category also most part of the validation area are categorized as very high and high by fcm and k means methods geometrical interval did not show a very appropriate flood potentiality map the fact that most of the historical flood map is classified as very high in clara classification implies the efficiency of this method for the flood susceptibility mapping classification thus the results of the evaluation approve that the proposed framework for flood susceptibility map preparation is able to predict the vulnerability of each region with minimum amount of the subjectivity available in the procedures 6 conclusion the proposed ghmcdm framework enables decision makers to analyze with the minimum presence of the subjectivity the flood susceptibility in gauged ungauged basin considering data scarcity using fuzzy dematel the proposed framework handles the inherent ambiguity of the experts viewpoints and quantifies the internal dependencies among the criteria based on the fuzzy dematel results dem parameter plays an important role and has great influence on the other criteria fuzzy dematel outputs have been used in the anp procedure to calculate the final weights for estimating the potential of flood event between the weights twi has received the most weight value in mapping susceptibility of flood event the cn and flow accumulation have the next ranks moreover mfi have the lowest effect on the results the resulted map has been classified in five distinct categories to comprehensively describe the intensity of flood susceptibility on the region in question moreover for evaluating the functionality of implemented framework in comparison with traditional approaches flood susceptibility map is produced using ahp methodology and the results have been compared overlaying the generated classified maps and historical flood extent map for the region of interest kurdistan province demonstrate a suitable differentiation of the susceptible area which verifies the reliability of the proposed approach in comparison with ahp approach assessing flood susceptibility is a complicated procedure which is associated with various uncertainties while machine learning methods are able to efficiently handle uncertainty problem they need historical flood spatial distribution maps that make these methods unpractical for ungauged regions on the other hand one drawback of mcdm methods is that these are based on numerus experts point of views with different backgrounds perspectives knowledge interests and often with different goals which is one of the main sources of the model uncertainties hence we tried to manage experts uncertainty in our mcdm framework by using fuzzy logic overall this research illustrates that i combination of spatial information and mcdm developed in our framework enables decision makers for less expensive initial survey of the region they are meant to manage with high reliability ii the proposed framework reduces subjectivity of the model so it can be implemented for any place where hydrology and hydraulic data are limitedly provided while the initial analysis of the flood susceptibility is needed therefore the achievement of this study can assist the managers to identify the flood prone areas in ungauged basins more accurately after the estimation of the high susceptible areas managers can collect more precise and more expensive data about these regions such as rainfall and river debris data using hydrologic and hydraulic models in order to generate highly accurate flood maps which reduce flood damage conflict of interest the authors declared that there is no conflict of

6569,identifying the flood susceptible areas is a vital and substantial element of disaster management for every country to control and mitigate injuries of the natural hazards the current research presents a framework for the preparation of flood prone areas maps by the integration of geospatial information system gis fuzzy logic and multi criteria decision making mcdm to achieve this goal a spectrum of geophysical geomorphological meteorological hydrological and geographical criteria have been addressed considering the linkage and the interdependencies of the criteria decision making trial and evaluation laboratory dematel approach are used to form the network of relations among the criteria moreover considering inevitable uncertainty ambiguity vagueness of the experts opinions fuzzy theory is integrated with dematel to handle the issue finally analytic network process anp are implemented to calculate the final weight of every single criterion the kurdistan province located in the north west of iran is considered as the case study in which numerous flood events has had recently happened the efficiency of the model is assessed through the area under the curve auc and statistical measures such as the kappa index in order to evaluate the produced classified flood susceptibility map the map of historical flood events in the province is also used about 85 of validation area is classified as very high flood susceptible which implies the efficiency of proposed framework for flood susceptibility mapping furthermore for evaluating the functionality of the framework in comparison with traditional approaches the well known ahp methodology is implemented too the validation results demonstrate that the fuzzy dematel anp model auc roc 0 938 kappa 0 88 has a higher performance accuracy compare to the ahp model auc roc 0 918 kappa 0 79 moreover comparing the proposed and validation model shows that the proposed framework can effectively improve decision makers to provide flood susceptibility maps and recognize flood susceptible areas in data scarce and ungauged regions keywords flood susceptibility map mcdm fuzzy dematel anp gis 1 introduction occurrence of flood events always threat the human society due to the financial and social damages which follow its frequent occurrence the flood event plays a significant role among the different natural disasters dawod et al 2012 papaioannou et al 2015 nowadays climate change and changes of land use are known as the main important causes of flood events regarding the climate changes most of the rainfall happened in the form of cloud bursting showers heavy and sudden rainfall events immediately change into flood events because the intensity of the rain is much more than the soil infiltration capacity khosravi et al 2016 kjeldsen 2010 tehrany et al 2014b another source of the flood is land use change which plays an important role in hydrological processes such as infiltration evapotranspiration and also surface runoff rizeei et al 2018 szwagrzyk et al 2018 regarding the above highlighted issues iran is not an exception considering the spatiotemporal varying precipitation in the most of the iran s basins relatively large area multiple climate of iran and increase of urban area in flood prone zones numerous flood events happened in a way that the damages has increased with the rate of more than 2 5 times in the past decade khosravi et al 2016 szwagrzyk et al 2018 the main reasons of increasing flood losses are the absence of sufficient studies and information about flood susceptible areas and lack of appropriate plan to prevent flood khosravi et al 2016 even though the prevention of flood may be considered as an impossible mission it could be predicted using appropriate methodologies and analysis cloke and pappenberger 2009 khosravi et al 2016 therefore the prevention and mitigation actions are inevitable alvarado aguilar et al 2012 khosravi et al 2016 in recent years the paradigm of the flood coping has changed from the traditional concept of flood protection to the new ones of so called flood risk management meyer et al 2009 schanze 2006 flood risk management may be divided into two main folds including flood risk assessment and risk reduction actions the overall goal of the flood risk assessment could be described as the recognition of the places where the value of flood risk is high i e risk alleviating actions are urgently necessary meyer et al 2009 flood management and risk reduction strategies must be planned based on the characteristics of the estimation of the flood s damage including intensity frequency magnitude and the consequences flood risk analysis is based on the advanced hydrologic and hydrodynamic models in order to estimate flood s peak and magnitude and the spatiotemporal propagation of the flood waves in river and flood plains however this engineering procedure is commonly useful for the small regions i e a part of a river basin in order to estimate the flood risk for available structures e g buildings and hydraulic structures so in basin scale the aforementioned procedure cannot be used due to the data scarcity and information accessibility that s why even in the developed countries a comprehensive map of the flood risk in extent of a basin is an onerous task moel et al 2009 papaioannou et al 2015 one of the necessary preventive measures is to provide flood susceptibility maps in which a number of studies has investigated the issue bubeck et al 2012 khosravi et al 2016 liu et al 2008 lyu et al 2018 pradhan and youssef 2011 tehrany et al 2015 termeh et al 2018 flood susceptibility maps are beneficial for the planning of future urban development and also the reconnaissance of the flood susceptible areas büchele et al 2006 dawson et al 2006 liu et al 2008 pradhan and youssef 2011 rahmati et al 2016a tehrany et al 2014a to prevent and reduce flood damages it is vital to identify its effective factors in other words the behavior of the flood s procedures must be recognized before any controlling plan the outburst of flood could be under the effects of various factors such as the geomorphology vegetation geologic and hydrologic parameters and patterns that must be considered in providing of the flood susceptibility maps therefore flood susceptibility mapping is a multi criteria decision making mcdm process the analysis of mcdm is significantly helpful approach in order to analyze and evaluate complicated decisions which include incommensurable data or criteria hwang and lin 2012 malczewski 2006 these methods provide objective decisions as they can handle the inherent complexity and uncertainty of such problems as well as the knowledge arising from the participation of several experts yan et al 2011 zagonari and rossi 2013 despite the fact that there is a vast spectrum of decision making methodologies none of them is applicable and suitable for all of the decision making problems thus choosing a reasonable decision making tool depends on the type of the problem and managers objectives de brito and evers 2016 complex decision making such as flood susceptibility assessment which include various spatial criteria can be examined through geographic information systems gis capability of visualization analysis and management of spatial data meyer et al 2009 papaioannou et al 2015 tang et al 2018 gis plays an important role in analyzing and assessing the impact of natural disasters haq et al 2012 kanani sadat et al 2014 karimipour and kanani sadat 2016 pourghasemi et al 2013 therefore many researches has investigated flood analysis and developing flood susceptibility map via the capabilities of gis sanyal and lu 2009 strobl et al 2012 tehrany et al 2014a 2014b termeh et al 2018 white et al 2010 khosravi et al 2018 tested four decision trees based machine learning methods namely naive bayes trees logistic model trees alternating decision trees and reduced error pruning trees for flood susceptibility mapping at the haraz watershed in iran hong et al 2018a addressed the development of a flood susceptibility assessment who used intelligent methods and gis framework an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis was coupled with a differential evolution and genetic algorithm ga for flood spatial modelling hong et al 2018b proposed an approach to create a flood susceptibility map in the poyang county jiangxi province china by implementing data mining and fuzzy weight of evidence methods these machine learning methods used in the aforementioned articles are proper for the regions where the spatial distribution of historical flood events is available and thus cannot be applied in ungauged regions in order to cover the problem of data scarcity for flood susceptibility mapping mcdm could play an important role in ungauged area combination of gis and mcdm founds multi criteria spatial decision support systems mc sdss which leads to the solution of spatial decisions arabsheibani et al 2016 boroushaki and malczewski 2010 chen et al 2011 in many researches solutions are offered for the susceptibility assessment of natural disasters using syntheses of gis and mcdm malczewski 2006 paquette and lowry 2013 scheuer et al 2011 solín 2012 fernández and lutz 2010 has discussed the applicability of gis and multiple criteria decision analysis mcda for providing flood susceptibility maps in tucuman province in argentina this study indicates that coupling of ahp and gis framework acts as a powerful tool to prepare precise flood susceptibility maps it was also described by zou et al 2013 that ahp could be considered as an intelligible affordable and convenient approach for flood risk evaluation papaioannou et al 2015 presented a framework for mapping of flooded area using gis fuzzy logic and mcdm they have explored a set of criteria including geographical morphological climatological meteorological and hydrological factors of the basin as well as land use in the research ahp and fuzzy ahp methodologies were used to generate flood susceptible map in their research rahmati et al 2016b analyzed flood risk via gis and multi criteria evaluations it is also reported in this research that distance to rivers land use height and the slope are used as main four parameters for the study area of yasooj city in iran this research suggests the hybrid use of ahp and gis to assess the flood risk potential especially in ungauged areas de brito and evers 2016 have investigated the application of mcdm methodologies in flood risk management also research procedures and flaws of this field of study it is also stated that during their review research they have chosen the number of 128 papers from 72 different journals from 1995 to 2015 in which mcdm have been used for flood management this study implies the growth of the mcdm utilities in flood management systems in recent years which itself demonstrate the capabilities of mcdm ahp is the most favorite among numerous mcdm approaches due to eligibility and convenience of the method based on their research despite the fact that mcdms are very prevailed on the investigated researches the problem of uncertainty remained unsolved in most of the researches researches consider the uncertainty scarcely in case of the flood studies due to different opinions corresponding to different experts in each problem handling the uncertainty in case of the assessment of the experts judgments improves the quality of decision making procedure the current research presents an objective gis based framework to identify flood susceptible areas in multiple catchment scale at ungauged watershed the earth s digital elevation model dem and its geomorphologic and hydrological characteristics such as slopes and rivers have become standard tools for recognizing the flood susceptible areas noman et al 2001 papaioannou et al 2015 in the current paper the criteria for mapping of flood susceptible areas are considered as dem of land and its derivatives vegetation land use soil and rainfall which are integrated using multi criteria decision making susceptibility analysis and flood area mapping consist of various criteria which are geographically interconnected booij 2005 poussin et al 2014 rahmati et al 2016b consequently each criterion of flood analysis has different level of impact on the others so an efficient mcdm approach must be able to handle these interdependencies on the calculations in order to offer an optimum solution based on de brito and evers de brito and evers 2016 none of the researches that are related to flood susceptibility mapping has taken the criteria s dependencies into account moreover no study has implemented decision making trial and evaluation laboratory dematel method to investigate the inter dependencies between the criteria therefore in order to cover the gap of current methodology one novel point of this research is taking the advantage of dematel method to clarify the causal relationships between flood susceptibility criteria the process of decision making associated with flood management is a complicated procedure that is associated with uncertainty akter and simonovic 2005 kenyon 2007 part of this complexity is due to the presence of numerous experts with different perspectives knowledge interests and often with different goals de brito and evers 2016 in current paper the fuzzy theory is integrated with dematel concept to manage the aforementioned uncertainty of experts opinions then the results of fuzzy dematel have been used by anp in order to calculate the final weight of each criterion consequently the final flood potential map is prepared based on the calculated weight in a gis environment in order to evaluate the results the produced maps for the historical flood maps are used besides the well known objective measures of receiver operating characteristic roc curve area under the curve auc and kappa statistic were deployed for validation moreover for evaluating the functionality of implemented framework in comparison with traditional approaches flood susceptibility map is produced using ahp methodology and the results are compared the proposed framework enables decision makers in identifying the influenced areas by flood events caused by heavy rains and river outburst this framework can be used to generate a flood susceptibility map in areas with limited information or in areas where preliminary flood susceptibility assessment is required to provide flood mapping using conventional hydrologic and hydraulic methods then based on the primary evaluation and identification of susceptible areas it is possible to analyze the flood risk by collecting precise data and using hydraulic methods in short we have developed a new approach to assess flood susceptibility in data scarce and ungauged environments specific objectives of this study are i assessing the interdependencies among flood susceptibility criteria through fuzzy dematel method ii evaluating the role of various parameters that affect flood events iii modeling and validating flood susceptibility map using two models of fuzzy dematel anp and ahp and investigating the sensitivity of the resulted maps to the different classification methods the novelties of the present study lie in development of a new flood susceptibility assessment approach which is applicable in data scarce and ungauged regions through taking the advantage of dematel method to clarify the causal relationships between flood susceptibility criteria and integrating fuzzy theory with dematel to handle the uncertainty of experts opinions 2 methods and materials in the current paper an objective gis based hybrid multi criteria decision making ghmcdm framework is developed to identify flood susceptible area in region including number of basins the fuzzy dematel method is used to establish a relationship network between flood susceptibility criteria in the second step the anp method uses the dematel output to calculate the final weight of the criteria finally by combining the criteria with gis the preparation and representation of a spatial model of the flood risk is completed in this section computational steps of fuzzy dematel and anp methods are explained 2 1 fuzzy dematel in complex decision making problems many elements of a system may be directly indirectly interrelated büyüközkan and güleryüz 2016 dematel method developed for the first time at the geneva research center at battelle memorial institute gabus and fontela 1973 effectively analyzes the direct indirect relationships between components of the system based on its intensity and type arabsheibani et al 2016 dematel method examines the interdependencies between the criteria the causal relationships between them and the weight of each of the relationships taking advantage of matrices or directed graphs dematel is used to visualize the structure of complex causal relationships these matrices or graphs depict the relations between different system elements so that the numbers indicate the intensity of the relationships dou et al 2014 tseng and lin 2009 the dematel technique is based on directed graphs that can divide the factors involved into two groups including cause group and effected groups in this assessment the numbers 0 1 2 3 and 4 respectively represent no influence very low influence low influence high influence and very high influence for example the line between the c2 and c5 criteria in fig 1 shows that the c2 criterion has a very high influence on the c5 criterion analysis of the overall relationship between system components by the dematel method is an ideal approach for solving complex system problems and can provide a better comprehension of the structural relationship of the system therefore the dematel method can transform the relationship between the cause and effect into an understandable structure of the system arabsheibani et al 2016 büyüközkan and güleryüz 2016 jassbi et al 2011 in spite of the fact that dematel is an effective method for assessing the dependence between criteria it is not accurate to express the opinions and preferences of experts by exact numbers managers and decision makers decide about the weight of the causal relationship between the criteria based on their knowledge and experience which is a human centered operation which certainly happens in an environment of uncertainty therefore in order to have a reliable mcdm the ambiguity in the linguistic variables of the experts must be handled gigović et al 2016 jassbi et al 2011 sangaiah et al 2017 yeh and huang 2014 zadeh 1965 has introduced fuzzy logic as an effective approach for dealing with uncertainty to manage the ambiguity of human point of views fuzzy variables are used to express decision makers preferences arabsheibani et al 2016 kanani sadat et al 2015 vinodh et al 2016 lin and wu 2004 used triangular fuzzy numbers to introduce fuzzy dematel fig 2 shown in table 1 are linguistic variables and those corresponding triangular fuzzy numbers l ij k m ij k u ij k by integrating fuzzy logic and dematel fuzzy dematel method consists of procedure as follows arabsheibani et al 2016 jassbi et al 2011 lin et al 2018 tadić et al 2014 vinodh et al 2016 step 1 acquiring the fuzzy direct relation matrix experts provide a bundle of pairwise comparison between each two distinct criteria e ij k l ij k m ij k u ij k is a triangular fuzzy number where k denotes the number of corresponding experts in which k 1 n judgment of k th expert about the influence of i th criterion on j th one is e ij k fuzzy direct relation matrix a is calculated using eq 1 where n is the number of the experts hence a can be calculated as it is formulated in eq 2 1 a e 1 e 2 e n n 2 a 0 a 12 a 1 n a 21 0 a 2 n a n 1 a n 2 0 in this matrix triangular fuzzy numbers are a ij l ij m ij u ij besides a ii is equal to 0 0 0 for all i 1 n step 2 calculating the normalized fuzzy direct relation matrix the normalized fuzzy direct relation matrix x is obtained using the matrix a via eqs 3 and 4 3 x 0 x 12 x 1 n x 21 0 x 2 n x n 1 x n 2 0 4 x ij a ij s l ij s m ij s u ij s s max 1 i n j 1 n u ij step 3 acquiring the fuzzy total relation matrix the fuzzy total relation matrix t that contains the direct indirect relationships of the criteria is obtained through the following relationships in eqs 5 and 6 in this equilibrium i is identity matrix 5 t t 11 t 12 t 1 n t 21 t 22 t 2 n t n 1 t n 2 t nn t ij l ij m ij u ij i j 1 2 n 6 l ij x l i x l 1 m ij x m i x m 1 u ij x u i x u 1 in order to comprehend the effects between the criteria it is recommended to convert the fuzzy direct relation values to defuzzified numbers defuzzification of fuzzy numbers in the total relation matrix t offers a better understanding about the relations between the criteria in order to compute defuzzified total relation matrix elements of t must be defuzzified using eq 7 then using the α cut threshold which is defined by experts the minor influences will be filtered out a general schema of α cut total relation matrix t α is shown in eq 8 if t ij α then t ij α 0 otherwise t ij α t ij which t ij is the element of the defuzzified total relation matrix t def 7 t ij def l ij 4 m ij u ij 6 8 t α t 11 α t 1 j α t 1 n α t i 1 α t ij α t in α t n 1 α t nj α t nn α step 4 acquiring the fuzzy values of d and r r i sum up the i th row of the matrix t and expresses the direct indirect influences that criterion i has on other criteria eq 9 also d j which is the sum of the j th column of the matrix t represents the overall influences of all the criteria on the j criterion eq 10 9 r r i n 1 j 1 n t ij 10 d d j 1 n i 1 n t ij step 5 defuzzification of fuzzy values of r d and r d to acquire the importance of the criteria and understand the causal relationship between criteria r d and r d are being defuzzified using eq 11 indicator r i d i shows the intensity of the influence of the i criterion on the remaining criteria indeed r i d i shows the degree of i th criterion s importance in the problem the influence of the criteria in the system will be uncovered with the parameter r i d i if the r i d i value is positive the i th criterion is an effective criterion and falls into the category of causes also if the value r i d i is negative the i th criterion will be under the influence of others and fall into the category of effects measures with a higher r d value have a greater influence on other criteria and have higher priority and as a result criteria that have low r d values are under the effects of other criteria and have a lower priority 11 r d def r d l fuzzy 4 r d m fuzzy r d u fuzzy 6 2 2 analytic network process saaty 1996 presented anp methodology in 1996 which is more comprehensive method than ahp approach the calculations of these two methods are quite different so the corresponding results would not be the same too in the ahp method it is assumed that each criterion is independent of other criteria and there is no correlation between the criteria which defines the decision making as a one way hierarchical structure while there might be some dependencies in reality khosravi et al 2016 papaioannou et al 2015 yeh and huang 2014 to overcome this in the anp method the dependencies between the criteria is managed through a network model and the hierarchical structure restriction is eliminated which can lead to precise results büyüközkan and güleryüz 2016 ghorbanzadeh et al 2018 lee et al 2017 vinodh et al 2016 the anp method to determine the final weight of the criteria includes the following steps arabsheibani et al 2016 chang et al 2012 gölcük and baykasoğlu 2016 step 1 forming a super matrix by using comparison of the criteria the super matrix consists of the pairwise comparison of the criteria the relative importance values of the criteria in a pairwise comparison fall into the numerical scale 1 for the same importance to 9 for the very high importance saaty 1996 the general form of the super matrix is symbolized in the form of eq 12 in which cn refers to the n th criterion and wij points to the effect of j th criterion on the objective in comparison with the i th criterion 12 w c 1 c 2 c n w 11 w 12 w n 1 w 21 w 22 w 2 n w n 1 w n 2 w nn c 1 c 2 c n step 2 acquiring the weighted supermatrix sum of the elements of each row of the α cut total relation matrix which is derived using dematel can be calculated as formulated in eq 13 13 d i j 1 n t ij α hence the normalized α cut total relation matrix which is notated by ts can be calculated using eq 14 14 t s t 11 α d 1 t 1 j α d 1 t 1 n α d 1 t i 1 α d i t ij α d i t in α d i t n 1 α d n t nj α d n t nn α d n t 11 s t 1 j s t 1 n s t i 1 s t ij s t in s t n 1 s t nj s t nn s then the weighted supermatrix ww is obtained by applying eq 15 to the unweighted supermatrix w 15 w w t 11 s w 11 t 1 j s w j 1 t 1 n s w n 1 t i 1 s w 1 i t ij s w ji t in s w ni t n 1 s w 1 n t nj s w jn t nn s w nn step 3 limiting the weighted supermatrix by raising it to a sufficiently large power k as shown in eq 16 the weighted supermatrix ww converges and becomes a long term stable matrix by limiting ww powered to a large enough number finally the rows of wl offer the ultimate weights of the criteria 16 w l l i m k w w k 3 study area the interested area to implement the proposed method is kurdistan province located in western iran with area equal to 29 137 square kilometers and 1 6 million population the province is located in the western mountainous zone of iran with the lowest and highest elevations equal to 690 and 3210 m above mean see level and also with 13 different basins fig 3 in the region the highest and lowest annual rainfall is equal to 800 and 400 mm year respectively the climate of kurdistan is under the influence by the warm and sultry mediterranean climate that cause mass rain in the spring and snow in the winters each year due to heavy rainfall numerous floods occur in the kurdistan province which has been accompanied by financial losses and even many human casualties for example on april 14 2017 a severe flood occurred in the northern part of the kurdistan province which led to the deaths of 5 people in addition to its financial losses therefore providing a map of flood susceptible areas can help managers and decision makers to identify areas at risk of flood and take appropriate prevention and alleviation actions one of the important aspects in the preparation of a flood susceptibility map by using geomorphologic indices is the selection of the suitable criteria papaioannou et al 2015 there is no consensus about the issue that which factors should intervene the preparation of flood susceptibility maps rahmati et al 2016b however the researchers have investigated some of the criteria frequently which implies the vital role of those papaioannou et al 2015 precipitation is an important parameter in the flood process in the current research recorded monthly precipitation from 17 meteorological stations during 1975 up to 2015 is used for our case study the proprietary data was given in response to our official requests for educational purposes most of the data are provided in shapefile format containing both spatial and descriptive information the used basic data sets and layers of the study area in this research are as follows topography maps of scale 1 25000 with contour intervals equal to 10 m national cartographic center of iran land use map of scale 1 50000 provincial government of kurdistan soil type map of scale 1 50000 national cartographic center of iran rainfall statistics provided by synoptic stations iran meteorological organization river map of scale 1 50000 national cartographic center of iran landsat8 satellite images united states geological survey historical map of occurred flood in the northern part of kurdistan province to check the reliability of the method as validation area provincial government of kurdistan in order to evaluate the proposed model the analysis of historical flood events is inevitable in our research a flood inventory map is prepared based on the flood events that occurred during 2015 and 2018 therefore local reports and news are surveyed and flood inventory map is generated via the location mapping of 28 reported flood events moreover 40 points are randomly selected within the validation area and consequently the total number of 68 flooded points are used for evaluation besides 51 points are randomly selected within the non flooded zones tehrany et al 2014c flooded and non flooded points are assigned a value of 1 and 0 respectively 4 identification of flood susceptible areas in this paper in order to identify the flood susceptible areas in multiple catchment scale ghmcdm framework is proposed and evaluated shown in fig 4 is the overall structure of the mcdm model the first step includes the identification and normalization of the criteria after analyzing experts opinions using fuzzy dematel anp offers final weights of each criterion finally the criteria will be integrated in a gis environment based on their weights occurred in the past floods map are considered as validation area data using validation area the generated maps are evaluated all these stages are designed to reduce the subjectivity of the model as much as possible so the framework could be established for a variety of regions 4 1 identification of the criteria making any decision requires employing the measurable and comparable decision criteria according to the experts opinion and with the spatial processing of the collected data the proposed framework deal with a number of 10 effective flood criteria the selected criteria are horizontal overland flow distance c1 vertical overland flow distance c2 topographic wetness index c3 slope c4 flow accumulation c5 curve number c6 digital elevation model c7 topographic position index c8 modified fournier index c9 and vegetation index c10 each criterion is produced in a raster format with spatial resolution of 30 m due to the inhomogeneity of the criteria s essence the generated maps must be normalized the normalization process enhance the objectivity of the approach if the higher value of a layer is associated with higher flood susceptibility the layer would be normalized by eq 17 otherwise eq 18 would be used where x and y are un normalized and normalized layers respectively xmin and xmax are respectively the lowest and highest value of each layer demonstrated in the fig 5 are normalized criteria maps 17 y x x min x max x min 18 y x max x x max x min dem layer is prepared with gis using topographic maps lower the elevation of area in comparison with neighbors more flood susceptibility the area is faced horizontal overland flow distance hofd is the horizontal component of water movement to reach river network also the vertical overland flow distance vofd represents the vertical component between the height of each cell and the calculated height for the river network areas with lower hofd and vofd values have more potential to flood topographic wetness index twi which is a combination of two parameters including the area of upstream basin and slope can state the influence of the topography on flood quantitatively so twi is calculated using eq 19 where as is the area of upstream basin and β is slope angle beven and kirkby 1979 sörensen et al 2006 19 twi ln a s tan β in system for automated geoscientific analyses saga platform the so called saga wetness index is calculated for current paper this indicator is similar to the twi indicator except that it uses the modified area of the basin in such a way that it does not consider the flow as thin layer as a result for cells in a valley floor with a bit difference in elevation with the river a more realistic prediction is made and the value of potential soil moisture is calculated more than the usual twi method s results olaya and conrad 2009 higher the wetness of the area more flood potential for that slope and flow accumulation layers can be produced using typical gis platform areas that located in lower slope or flat and or more accumulated flow region are more susceptible by flood events curve number cn is an experimental indicator in practical hydrology to simulate direct runoff from rainfall this indicator was proposed by the us department of agriculture s soil conservation service scs it is worthwhile to mention that that cn is a function of soil type land use and soil moisture condition spatially distributed map of cn grid is calculated for the study area by combining the soil map and the land use information in hec geohms fleming and doan 2009 the cn value band within the range of 30 up to 100 and regions with larger cn values can generate more runoff versus areas with lower cn values ponce and hawkins 1996 topographic position index tpi shows the height difference of each cell with mean heights of its neighboring cells eq 20 for cells that are higher than their neighbors the amount of tpi is positive and for the cells below the neighbors tpi is negative therefore the relative topographic position of a location may be in one of the categories including valley low slope flat plain average and high slope and ridge weiss 2001 20 tpi z 0 i 1 n z i n spatially distributed layer of tpi is calculated with radius 3 cell size 90 m areas with lower tpi contribute more prone to occurring flood event rainfall intensity as another important factor in occurring flood event is prepared using the modified fournier index mfi eq 21 where p i is the average for i th month and p is the annual average rainfall gabriels 2006 mfi is calculated for all stations and by interpolating over the study area the mfi map is generated 21 mfi i 1 12 p i 2 p normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is a well known indicator to determine an area vegetation coverage regions covered by more sparse vegetation are more vulnerable to flood ndvi is calculated eq 22 where nir is near infrared band and r is the red band of satellite imagery khosravi et al 2016 22 ndvi nir r nir r in order to calculate the ndvi index for the study area landsat 8 satellite images of date june 2016 has been used the band 4 and 5 landsat 8 images are closely related to the red and infrared bands respectively by which the ndvi layer is determined 4 2 experts judgment survey in the current paper eight 8 experts from different fields four hydrology two geology and two gis experts have been selected to identify the factors and their relationships and their impact on the flood events experts presented their views on the severity of the internal dependencies between defined criteria via linguistic variables in order to determine the existence and intensity of relationships between the criteria using the fuzzy dematel method the pairwise comparison tables are converted to their corresponding triangular fuzzy values the average direct relation fuzzy matrix is obtained in accordance with eq 1 afterwards normalized fuzzy direct relation matrix is calculated using eq 4 then using eq 6 the fuzzy total relation is obtained which includes all direct and indirect relationships between the criteria besides to analyze the role of criteria in the system and to examine the impact of each criterion the sum of the rows r and the sum of the column d of the total relation fuzzy matrix are calculated using the relationships 9 10 and 11 next the total relation fuzzy matrix is converted to defuzzified matrix using eq 7 which illustrate the dependencies of the flood criteria via non fuzzy numbers minor dependencies of the criteria are filtered by defining an α cut threshold if the relations value is less than the introduced threshold they would be truncated and neglected on the afterward calculations in the next step in order to calculate anp weights the experts are asked to state their perspectives about the relational importance of each criterion amongst others thereupon the α cut total relation matrix is normalized and weighted super matrix is calculated using eq 14 eq 15 respectively final anp weights of the criteria is derived by self multiplication of weighted super matrix eq 16 the elements of the rows of this stabled matrix demonstrate the final weights of each criterion besides for evaluating the functionality of implemented framework in comparison with traditional approaches flood susceptibility map is produced using ahp methodology and finally the results are compared 4 3 susceptibility map production and classification ghmcdm has been implemented spatially distributed in the current study and the potential map of flood has been produced for each cell with which correspond a real spot on the ground the criteria have been integrated in a gis environment using eq 23 after finalization of their weights for both anp and ahp methods 23 fsi i 1 10 w i c i where fsi is the flood susceptibility index wi is the weight of each criterion and ci is the relevant normalized criterion therefore flood susceptibility indices have been spatially calculated over the study area pixel wise putting the results together in a color coded map the final flood susceptibility map is generated for the kurdistan province in order to facilitate the interpretation of the generated susceptibility map and identification of vulnerable areas it is possible to classify the susceptibility index map based on our experts consultations the final flood susceptibility index map is classified in five distinct susceptibility categories including very high high medium low and very low most of the conducted researches in the literature use simple classification tools provided generally in gis platform in this study in order to investigate the sensitivity of the resulted flood susceptibility map to the classification method the authors implemented five different classification methods including geometrical interval clara fcm natural breaks and k means 4 4 susceptibility map validation an essential stage of flood susceptibility modelling is accuracy validation in order to assess the performance of our model we have used receiver operator characteristic roc arabameri et al 2019 the roc curve represents the graphical relationship of the specificity and sensitivity for different possible threshold values the x axis of the roc curve eq 24 corresponds to false positive rate 1 specificity and the y axis eq 25 corresponds to true positive rate sensitivity while sensitivity value signifies the ratio of flooded points true positive that are correctly predicted specificity value represents the ratio of correctly predicted non flooded points true negative therefore higher value of 1 specificity shows a higher rate of false positives arabameri et al 2019 tehrany et al 2014c 24 x 1 s p e c i f i c i t y 1 tn tn f p 25 y s e n s i t i v i t y tp tp f n where tp true positive and tn true negative are the number of points that are correctly classified as flooded and non flooded respectively fp false positive demonstrates the number of non flooded points that are predicted as flooded and fn false negative the number of flooded points predicted as non flooded the area under the curve of roc auc roc is widely used for model validation and estimation of model performance arabameri et al 2019 falah et al 2019 frattini et al 2010 khosravi et al 2018 the quantitative qualitative relation between auc and prediction rate that lies between 0 and 1 is as follows excellent 0 9 1 very good 0 8 0 9 good 0 7 0 8 average 0 6 0 7 and weak 0 5 0 6 arabameri et al 2019 besides statistical measure of overall accuracy is calculated to assess the comparative efficiency of our model overall accuracy measures the proportion of validation points including flooded and non flooded that are correctly classified eq 26 shafapour tehrany et al 2019 26 overall a c c u r a c y tp t n tp f p t n f n in order to determine optimized threshold value the corresponding overall accuracy is iteratively calculated in which threshold value ranges from 0 to 1 with a step of 0 01 the threshold value which corresponds to the optimized overall accuracy is selected for classifying validation points to flooded and non flooded moreover for further assessment of model efficiency the kappa measure is investigated too khosravi et al 2018 the quantitative qualitative relation between kappa and model performance that falls from 0 to 1 is as follows perfect 0 99 1 excellent 0 85 0 99 good 0 55 0 85 moderate 0 4 0 55 and poor 0 0 4 monserud and leemans 1992 furthermore in order to evaluate the classified maps of flood susceptibility the map of historical flood event extent in the northern parts of the kurdistan province has been employed by overlaying the classified maps with the occurred flood map the rate of the validity of each category for each classification method is achieved 5 result and discussion in the proposed approach 10 criteria including geomorphologic and hydrologic parameters as well as land cover and land use have been investigated all the criteria have been integrated in a gis environment to generate the final flood susceptibility maps relative importance and dependencies of the criteria have been extracted using the pairwise comparison of experts judgments based on the surveyed opinions of a group of experts the procedure of fuzzy dematel and anp have been implemented tables s1 and s2 present the average direct relation fuzzy matrix and normalized fuzzy direct relation matrix respectively the fuzzy total relation which includes all direct indirect relationships between the criteria is presented in table s3 the sum of the rows r and the sum of the columns d of the total relation fuzzy matrix are calculated to analyze the role of criteria in the system and to examine the impact of each criterion the transformation of the fuzzy numbers d r and d r into defuzzified numbers facilitates the interpretation of the internal relations between the criteria table 2 based on the ri di indicator in table 2 twi c3 flow accumulation c5 curve number c6 and vegetation index c10 take influences from others and fall into the category of effects while hofd c1 vofd c2 slope c4 dem c7 tpi c8 and mfi c9 are classified in causes category ri di is an indicator which can prioritize the criteria hence dem c7 have most influence on others while vegetation index c10 is mostly under the influence of others also ri di indicator can be interpreted as the importance of a criterion among and in comparison with others so as illustrated in table 2 vofd c2 twi c3 flow accumulation c5 dem c7 and vegetation index c10 play the very vital roles on the system scenario and among all dem c7 is the most vital one this explains logically the fact that twi slope tpi flow accumulation hofd and vofd are derived from dem layer and consequently the dem have influence on these defuzzified total relation matrix which illustrates the dependencies of the flood criteria via non fuzzy numbers is presented in table s4 in order to filter out minor dependencies experts are asked to express their own opinion about the optimum α threshold by averaging all surveyed opinions the α is considered 0 025 table s5 table s6 presents the experts perspectives about the relational importance of each criterion amongst others the normalized α cut total relation matrix and weighted super matrix is shown in tables s7 and s8 respectively in our calculations limiting a supermatrix powered to 18 the weighted supermatrix ww converge to an idempotent matrix and final weights for each criterion is calculated moreover in order to compare the efficiency of the proposed method weights of the criteria are calculated using the ahp too illustrated in table 3 is the final weights of the investigated criteria in the present study for flood potential based on the table 3 twi c3 flow accumulation c5 and cn c6 are most important criteria respectively in the flood susceptibility modelling hence flood susceptible areas identification depends mainly on these three factors therefore the higher the twi flow accumulation and cn the more susceptible the area on the other hand the weight of slope and mfi is about 0 0292 and 0 0215 respectively which is the lowest weights in comparison of other criteria weights therefore the effect of these two criteria is less in flood potential in it is to note that the weights have been calculated for the case study and they may differ in another cases considering the final weights the flood susceptibility index map is produced fig 6 the performance and efficiency of fuzzy dematel anp and ahp is assessed according to the measures defined in section 4 4 table 4 based on the evaluation of flooded points fuzzy dematel anp shows the higher value of sensitivity 95 59 in comparison with ahp 94 12 this implies that fuzzy dematel anp has more successfully predicted the flooded points furthermore fuzzy dematel anp has a higher specificity 92 16 in prediction of non flooded points the overall accuracy of fuzzy dematel anp is 94 12 which implies that this method is modeled flood susceptibility more accurately than the ahp method 89 92 on the other hand the fact that the kappa measure of fuzzy dematel anp 0 88 excelent is higher than ahp 0 79 good signifies that fuzzy dematel anp approach would result in a more reliable modelling of reality fig 7 depicts that the auc roc value of fuzzy dematel anp 0 938 is higher that one of ahp 0 918 one can conclude from the validation results that fuzzy dematel anp is a more efficient model for detecting flood susceptible areas as it considers the interrelationship between flood criteria and calculation of criteria weights through a network model in order to facilitate the interpretation and identification of flood prone areas the generated susceptibility index map is classified using 6 different approaches the classified flood potential maps of kurdistan are demonstrated in fig 8 the distribution of resulted maps classified in 5 classes presented in table 5 for both fuzzy dematel anp and ahp approaches as demonstrated in fig 8 northwest a small part of in west and southwest and eastern part of the study area are highly affected by flood events considering the details of the fig 5 and table 3 one can infer that the role of the criteria that have more weights are more prominent i e the regions in which these layers have greater index the flood susceptibility classes are high and very high for instance in the eastern part of the province twi flow accumulation and river network are more and slope and vegetation are less besides the vertical distances to the river are less so it can be concluded that the flood potential of this regions is high on the other hand central area of the kurdistan province has less twi river network as well as more altitude and vegetation therefore these regions fall into low flood potential classes by overlaying our classified maps with validation area the rate of the validity of each category for each classification method is achieved table 6 and fig 9 demonstrate these evaluation results for both methods as illustrated in table 6 and fig 9 except for the geometrical interval classification method most parts of the validation area fall within the classes very high and high as presented in the fig 9 in the fuzzy dematel anp method more regions are included in the very high category in comparison with ahp method which is more consistent with the reality so in comparison with the ahp it can be concluded that proposed method has modeled the flood extent more efficiently clara method has the most percentage 85 01 of tendency for very high category also most part of the validation area are categorized as very high and high by fcm and k means methods geometrical interval did not show a very appropriate flood potentiality map the fact that most of the historical flood map is classified as very high in clara classification implies the efficiency of this method for the flood susceptibility mapping classification thus the results of the evaluation approve that the proposed framework for flood susceptibility map preparation is able to predict the vulnerability of each region with minimum amount of the subjectivity available in the procedures 6 conclusion the proposed ghmcdm framework enables decision makers to analyze with the minimum presence of the subjectivity the flood susceptibility in gauged ungauged basin considering data scarcity using fuzzy dematel the proposed framework handles the inherent ambiguity of the experts viewpoints and quantifies the internal dependencies among the criteria based on the fuzzy dematel results dem parameter plays an important role and has great influence on the other criteria fuzzy dematel outputs have been used in the anp procedure to calculate the final weights for estimating the potential of flood event between the weights twi has received the most weight value in mapping susceptibility of flood event the cn and flow accumulation have the next ranks moreover mfi have the lowest effect on the results the resulted map has been classified in five distinct categories to comprehensively describe the intensity of flood susceptibility on the region in question moreover for evaluating the functionality of implemented framework in comparison with traditional approaches flood susceptibility map is produced using ahp methodology and the results have been compared overlaying the generated classified maps and historical flood extent map for the region of interest kurdistan province demonstrate a suitable differentiation of the susceptible area which verifies the reliability of the proposed approach in comparison with ahp approach assessing flood susceptibility is a complicated procedure which is associated with various uncertainties while machine learning methods are able to efficiently handle uncertainty problem they need historical flood spatial distribution maps that make these methods unpractical for ungauged regions on the other hand one drawback of mcdm methods is that these are based on numerus experts point of views with different backgrounds perspectives knowledge interests and often with different goals which is one of the main sources of the model uncertainties hence we tried to manage experts uncertainty in our mcdm framework by using fuzzy logic overall this research illustrates that i combination of spatial information and mcdm developed in our framework enables decision makers for less expensive initial survey of the region they are meant to manage with high reliability ii the proposed framework reduces subjectivity of the model so it can be implemented for any place where hydrology and hydraulic data are limitedly provided while the initial analysis of the flood susceptibility is needed therefore the achievement of this study can assist the managers to identify the flood prone areas in ungauged basins more accurately after the estimation of the high susceptible areas managers can collect more precise and more expensive data about these regions such as rainfall and river debris data using hydrologic and hydraulic models in order to generate highly accurate flood maps which reduce flood damage conflict of interest the authors declared that there is no conflict of
