5985,for effective management of drought risks a process specific indicator needs to be employed rather than depending only on precipitation anomalies in this study we performed an evapotranspiration based et based assessment of agricultural droughts in uganda where drought has usually been assessed with precipitation deficiency the land surface et and evaporative demand were estimated with a state of the art complementary principle across the country under poor et data availability using the et estimates the standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi was quantified to assess agricultural droughts for 1984 2017 the et based drought assessment was compared with conventional precipitation based analyses using the standardized precipitation index spi in respect of severity areal extent and temporal trends results showed that the complementary principle provided acceptable performance in reproducing interpolated latent flux observations spi and sedi were strongly correlated and thus yielded identical temporal variations of mean drought severity and areal extent the trend maps of spi and sedi also tended to agree and indicate that central and northwestern uganda would face increasing drought risks in the future the declining precipitation in uganda has been attributed to rising surface temperatures of the indian ocean and is expected to persist up to the next decade this study suggests that droughts in major croplands could be often accompanied by high heat wave temperatures in uganda due to strong land atmosphere coupling and thus mortality risks in ecosystems could increase together with water stress keywords drought risk complementary principle evapotranspiration deficit land atmosphere coupling 1 introduction drought is a recurrent natural phenomenon that can undermine ecological social and economic sustainability fao 2003 while onsets of deficient precipitation are often non perceptive bayissa et al 2018 they can evolve to a disaster level to which water resources are substantially limited in agricultural sectors and infrastructures posing societal risks and insecurities serdeczny et al 2015 catastrophic impacts of drought have been well documented including for example water and food insecurity piao et al 2010 destruction of ecosystems rojas 2018 malnutrition and infirmities delbiso et al 2017 and economic damages and casualties masih et al 2014 kala 2017 in particular frequent droughts have resulted in substantial losses in african countries over the past 113 years masih et al 2014 and underdeveloped rainfed regions are expected to become more drought prone due to climate change population growth and lasting poverty mulinde et al 2016 serdeczny et al 2015 conway et al 2009 while drought could be categorized into meteorological precipitation deficit agricultural soil moisture deficit hydrological deficits in streamflow terrestrial water storage and groundwater socioeconomic water deficits against societal demands and ecological droughts human and ecosystem responses to water deficits crausbay et al 2017 wilhite 2005 the origin of all types of droughts is deficient precipitation that propagates through hydrologic and ecological systems hence drought has been generally defined as prolonged precipitation deficiency e g ipcc 2007 and tracking precipitation anomalies has been an established approach for monitoring and analysis of all the drought types e g berker et al 2016 kumar et al 2016 lloyd hughes 2014 however argued that a state of drought is a multitude of diverse natural and socioeconomic conditions and therefore could not be identified only by variations of precipitation precipitation deficits lead to non linear consequences in biophysical systems owing to their high complexity and heterogeneity for instance vegetation surfaces do not only respond to precipitation deficits but to varying temperature soil properties e g fertility and salinity and physiological conditions drought related studies hence have become increasingly process specific with helps of technological advancements in e g remote sensing of land surfaces aghakouchak et al 2015 choi et al 2013 particularly in assessing agricultural or vegetative droughts recent studies have focused on evapotranspiration et instead of precipitation anomalies e g anderson et al 2013 yao et al 2010 because et is a process specific indicator of agricultural productivity that reflects water fertility and heat stresses radiation availability and other environmental factors on vegetation steduto et al 2012 however in practice observational difficulties and costs hinder operational monitoring of land surface et posing limited data availability in many locations across the globe dingman 2015 han et al 2014 the low availability of et observations make it difficult to assess et driven droughts e g otkin et al 2018 thereby leading to high dependency on remote sensing data that are usually shorter than meteorological observations e g anderson et al 2013 while land surface models could be employed with atmospheric forcing e g xia et al 2014 this model based approach is often subject to expensive costs for model calibration and validation together with entailed uncertainties at least in part the challenges from low data availability and model uncertainty could be overcome by employing a state of the art complementary relationship cr method for assessing et driven droughts e g kim et al 2019b hobbins et al 2016 mcevoy et al 2016 kim and rhee 2016 the complementary principle first proposed by bouchet 1963 has been criticized due to the lack of definitive derivations of the cr however since the derivation of cr by brutsaert 2015 from physical boundary conditions many studies have confirmed its easy applicability and reliability in predicting land surface et with only routine meteorological datasets e g ma and szilagyi 2019 ma et al 2019 crago and qualls 2018 szilagyi 2018a chun et al 2018 brutsaert et al 2017 ai et al 2017 szilagyi et al 2017 crago et al 2016 the latest cr method szilagyi et al 2017 could show even better performance than land surface models and interpolations of flux observations ma et al 2019 kim et al 2019b the improved cr is of particular importance for data sparse regions such as african countries for which droughts have usually been assessed by precipitation based indices and remote sensing images e g dutra et al 2013 rulinda et al 2012 ntale and gan 2003 it allows reliable estimation of potential and actual et rates with no specific land surface information enabling to assess a variety of droughts from short term flash drought to persisting vegetative drought kim et al 2019b since it is based on the land atmospheric feedback mechanism the cr method even allowed reliable prediction and trend analyses of et on irrigated land surfaces with no modeling assumptions szilagyi and jozsa 2018 szilagyi 2018b despite those advantages applications of the complementary principle are still very limited for drought assessments even in data rich regions with only few exceptions tracking et deficits could shed light on unknown facets of complex drought phenomena in this work therefore we provide a nation wide drought assessment for an african country based on et deficits using the latest cr method and reanalysis climate data the et based drought assessment was compared with a conventional precipitation based p based drought characterization with respect to severity spatial extent and temporal trends here we demonstrated that strong consistency could exist between p based and et based drought identifications and provided practical implications for drought risk management in relation to land atmosphere coupling strength 2 description of study area and data 2 1 study area the study area consists of land surfaces across uganda located in the eastern part of africa fig 1 uganda is a landlocked country surrounded by kenya south sudan congo rwanda and tanzania the ugandan land surfaces lie within 1 29 s 4 12 n latitude and 29 34 35 0 e longitude encompassing 211 941 km2 approximately the surface elevations have a large variation 600 5000 m with a mean of 1200 m above the sea level the land use is made up of agricultural lands forests rangelands mountains and developed urban areas according to the ministry of water and environment of uganda 2013 croplands account for 34 of the land surfaces and 80 of the population is employed for agricultural production thus deficient rainfall and soil moisture would affect human livelihoods in uganda substantially a warm tropical climate prevails in uganda with a typical temperature range of 25 29 c the mean precipitation rate varies within 500 2800 mm a 1 large annual precipitation is found in mountainous southwestern areas and near lake victoria while the northeastern part is usually under semi arid or arid environments diverse factors affect the spatial variation of precipitation such as the inter tropical convergence zone itcz inter tropical anticyclones monsoonal winds and the moist westerlies from congo mulinde et al 2016 especially seasonal migration of the itcz makes two major rainfall seasons in uganda long rainy seasons from march to may and short rainy seasons during september to november the temporal pattern of monthly rainfall is bimodal i e double peaks near the equator but it tends to become unimodal with distance from the equator nsubuga et al 2014 the atmospheric teleconnections could modulate interannual variability of precipitation the el ni√±o southern oscillation enso for instance has been correlated with precipitation in short rainy seasons phillips and mcintyre 2000 2 2 data collection this study used the reanalyzed climate datasets provided by the nasa prediction of worldwide energy resource project power system https power larc nasa gov accessed on oct 15 2018 the meteorological data of the nasa power system given at a 0 5 0 5 resolution were derived by the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra 2 assimilation model from goddard s global modeling and assimilation office stackhouse et al 2018 the solar radiation data of the power system were from satellite observations a recent study of monteiro et al 2018 provides an evaluation that the nasa power data products could be used for agricultural applications at a reasonable confidence level for this study we collected daily solar radiation maximum and minimum temperatures at 2 m relative humidity at 2 m wind speed at 2 m and precipitation data for 1984 2017 34 years the solar radiation temperatures relative humidity and wind speed were used for et based drought analyses while precipitation data were directly applied to p based drought characterization more details about the nasa power archive are found in stackhouse et al 2018 to validate our et estimates we also collected the global fluxnet product upscaled by jung et al 2009 http www bgc jena mpg de bgi index php services overview the monthly latent heat flux data were produced at a 0 5 0 5 scale for 1982 2011 by interpolating point eddy covariance observations across the globe with the model tree ensemble mte the interpolated product hereafter referred to as the mte data was validated against streamflow observations jung et al 2010 the mte data has been often used to validate modeled land surface energy fluxes e g xia et al 2016 cai et al 2014 since they are based on in situ flux observations and greatly independent of theoretical modeling assumptions here we used the mte data as the reference data to evaluate our et estimates the 134 data points in fig 1 have both the meteorological data from the power system and the upscaled mte data 3 methodology 3 1 generalized complementary principle to estimate actual et eta and the evaporative demand at the 134 data points we used the complementary principle that requires meteorological observations only the complementary principle exploits the vertical linkage between unsaturated land surfaces and overlying atmosphere bouchet 1963 when land surface moisture is ample with minimal effects of local advection water vapor transport to the atmosphere is limited by the evaporative demand overlying the wet surface hereafter referred to as etw however if land surface moisture is inadequate to sustain etw the latent heat flux would be limited and the sensible heat flux is amplified in response thereby the evaporative potential would become higher than etw the complementary principle separately defines this adjusted evaporative potential hereafter referred to as etp since a larger deviation of etp from etw indicates less surface water availability the difference between etp and etw could be used as a predictor of eta over unsaturated soils for this study we employed the generalized cr method formulated by szilagyi et al 2017 the latest cr is a polynomial approximation developed with four definitive boundary conditions bcs for dimensionless variables of x etw etp and y eta etp when land surface water is ample i e energy limited eta etw and etp are all equal hence y 1 should be met for x 1 bc1 on the contrary if the surface is completely desiccated eta should be zero i e y 0 transforming all the available radiation to the sensible heat flux and maximizing the evaporative potential ep epmax the x value corresponding to epmax is its minimum xmin etw epmax here another bc is found as y 0 for x xmin bc2 under the full saturation x 1 eta is not controlled by surface water availability but changes with etw thus providing a zero order boundary condition of dy dx 1 bc3 with no land surface moisture x xmin eta should stay at zero irrespective of etw thus dy dx 0 is likely bc4 when rescaling the variable x into 0 1 the simplest polynomial equation satisfying the four bcs is 1 y 2 x 2 x 3 with x defined as 2 x x x m i n 1 x m i n e p m a x e t p e p m a x e t w e t w e t p eq 1 allows users to estimate eta from a set of etp epmax and etw that could be obtained from meteorological observations alone etp mm d 1 could be calculated using the penman 1948 equation 3 e t p Œ¥ t a v g Œ¥ t a v g Œ≥ r n Œ≥ Œ¥ t a v g Œ≥ f u e s t a v g e s t d e w where Œ¥ t hpa c 1 is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve at a temperature t tavg c is the mean air temperature Œ≥ is the psychrometric constant hpa c 1 rn mm d 1 is the net radiation over the land surface expressed in evaporation rates fu mm d 1 hpa 1 is the wind function es t hpa is the saturation vapor pressure at a temperature t and tdew c is the dew point temperature in this work the standard equations in allen et al 1998 were used to calculate the slope of the saturation vapor pressure and the psychrometric constant we adopted the same empirical wind function as found in szilagyi et al 2017 4 f u 0 26 1 0 54 u 2 where u2 m s 1 is the wind speed at 2 m above the ground when ep epmax the land surface should be completely dry and the vapor pressure of the atmosphere should become zero

unsaturated land surface could be higher than what should be observed under full saturation when using the derivation of monteith 1981 tws could be calculated as in szilagyi 2014 9a t w s t w b Œ≥ q n

radiation converted to the unit of energy flux and c is the unit conversion factor from mm d 1 to w m 2 28 94 w d mm 1 m 2 tws was confined within the range of twb tavg in this study in theory tws is lower than tavg due to the cooling effects of latent heat fluxes while it is higher than twb when qn is positive we calculated the net radiation rn using the standard approach of allen et al 1998 with solar radiation maximum and minimum temperatures and relative humidity data the dew point temperature was estimated by converting the relative humidity the daily precipitation and et estimates eta and etw from the power data were aggregated to monthly values for our comparative drought assessments 3 2 drought identification and analyses 3 2 1 standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi the monthly eta and etw from the cr method could become a drought identifier because a comparison between them indicates the consumed water on land surfaces relative to the atmospheric demand e g anderson et al 2013 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 for this study we used the standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi kim and rhee 2016 the et deficit etd was defined as eta minus etw and the calculated etd values at each data point were fitted to the 3 parameter log logistic ll3 distributions following the global assessments by vicente serrano et al 2018 the sedi is simply the z score of the standard normal distribution corresponding to the cumulative probability of etd estimated with the ll3 distribution sedi can provide multi timescale et based drought identification as did hobbins et al 2016 and mcevoy et al 2016 in which the evaporative demand was standardized at various timescales etd could be accumulated as per users interest for example one uses a 1 month timescale for addressing short term water shortage or flash droughts while a 6 12 month timescale could be used to investigate seasonal or annual vegetation responses e g kim and rhee 2016 for this study we chose five timescales of 1 3 6 9 and 12 months for our et based drought identification to consider climatic seasonality the histograms of accumulated etd were fitted to the ll3 distributions separately for january through december more details and discussion about sedi are found in vicente serrano et al 2018 and kim and rhee 2016 3 2 2 standardized precipitation index spi for comparison to sedi we additionally identified droughts using the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 since it is a simple conversion of precipitation anomalies the use of spi is fully p based drought identification spi has been frequently used for quantifying meteorological droughts e g duffy et al 2015 patel et al 2007 however spi also could visualize agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic facets of precipitation deficiency by adjusting its timescale e g gevaert et al 2018 begur√≠a et al 2014 guttman 1998 the structure of spi is not different from sedi except that spi fits the aggregated precipitation to a theoretical probability distribution hence the monthly precipitation series at each data point were aggregated into the five timescales and fitted to the 2 parameter gamma distributions following the assessment of guttman 1999 then the cumulative probabilities of aggregated precipitation in each month were converted to the z scores we applied the same five timescales for sedi and spi to consider the residence time of atmospheric moisture 10 days van der ent and tuinenburg 2017 implying that eta contributes to precipitation processes within a month it should be noted that drought identification by spi is independent of sedi because the cr eta and etw estimates were obtained without accounting for precipitation 3 3 correlation and trend analyses we first evaluated temporal consistency between spi and sedi at the five timescales while spi and sedi are deemed independent of each other in terms of the required data for calculation the two could have temporal consistency precipitation and eta are physical sources and sinks of the atmospheric moisture and could be closely related in such a case one can hypothesize that spi and sedi are able to become surrogate indicators for each other we hence measured the temporal consistency between the two indices at each data point using the pearson correlation coefficient pearson r as did kim and rhee 2016 correlations between spi and sedi were measured for the five timescales separately in addition mean severity and areal extent of droughts were identified over the 34 year period in uganda among the five timescales the 9 month timescale was chosen for assessing vegetation droughts based on prior studies begur√≠a et al 2014 suggests that spi is likely to have high correlations with the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1968 at a 9 to 12 month timescale since pdsi captures variations of soil moisture anomalies dai et al 2004 9 month spi and sedi would indicate agricultural and vegetation droughts kim and rhee 2016 we calculated the mean severity of vegetation droughts simply by averaging 9 month spi and sedi values of the data points within the borders of uganda while the spatial extent was estimated with the percentage of data points with 1 3 or less spi and sedi values within the borders the chosen spi 1 3 is the threshold of severe drought in the u s drought portal http droughtmonitor unl edu aboutusdm aboutthedata droughtclassificatino aspx finally to investigate drought trends for the 34 year period mann kendall mk and sen s slope tests were conducted with the 9 month sedi and spi time series at all the data points the non parametric mk test evaluates significance of linear trends by counting signs between all pairs within a time series the sum of the signs is normalized with their variance and compared with the z score of the standard normal distribution at a chosen significance level 5 was used here the sen s slope is the median value of linear slopes between all the pairs within the series sheffield et al 2012 is a good example that quantified drought risks with non parametric linear trends at a global scale nsubuga et al 2014 and gilbert 1987 could provide more details about the mk test and sen s slope 4 results 4 1 performance of the cr method to determine the priestley taylor coefficient Œ±e for each data point which is the only parameter of the cr method we divided the mte data into two sets for calibration and validation the optimal Œ±e was determined by minimizing the mean bias between eta estimates and the mte data for the period of 1984 1998 then eta for the remaining period 1999 2011 was estimated by using the optimal Œ±e and evaluated against the mte data fig 2 displays the optimal Œ±e values at each data point and spatial interpolations between them the optimal Œ±e tends to become higher with increasing proximity to lake victoria the values near or on lake victoria were in the range of 1 2 1 35 this implies that a desirable Œ±e on wet surfaces is close to the reasonable value of 1 26 for wet surfaces suggested by many prior studies e g lhomme 1997 priestley and taylor 1972 however Œ±e 1 26 was unlikely a good estimate for the land surfaces distant from the lake victoria and the cr might be insufficiently reliable with sudden moisture changes between water bodies and land surfaces the best Œ±e values across the land surfaces ranged mostly between 1 0 and 1 1 providing an indication that use of Œ±e 1 26 might lead to overestimation of eta the average of the optimal Œ±e values across uganda was 1 06 with a standard deviation of 0 081 when calibrating against the interpolated flux observations although they are slightly smaller than the values given in prior applications e g szilagyi 2018a szilagyi et al 2017 the optimal Œ±e values were unlikely out of theoretically acceptable ranges of pt coefficient based on assouline et al 2016 fig 3 shows 1 1 plots between the averages of cr eta estimated with the optimal Œ±e and those of the mte data at the 134 data points as expected the two eta estimates neatly agreed for the calibration period albeit slight overestimations in mid and low eta values in the validation period on the other hand negative biases between the cr eta and the mte data increased in the range of 700 1000 mm a 1 this indicates that the optimal Œ±e for the cr method might gradually rise with time in relatively wet locations nonetheless the average of the p biases between the cr and mte eta estimates was 2 3 with a standard deviation of 6 1 even for the validation period this evaluation led us believe that eta and etw estimated with the optimal Œ±e were acceptable for our drought assessment for the data period of 1984 2017 fig 4 shows spatial distributions of the precipitation etw and eta estimated with the optimal Œ±e and the aridity index ratio of etw to precipitation averaged over the entire data period the mean annual precipitation in the southern regions ranged between 1200 and 1900 mm a 1 increasing toward lake victoria in northern uganda precipitation tends to decrease in an eastward direction and the lowest value was at the border to kenya on the other hand etw was highest in the north central region it decreased toward the borders and the lowest etw was along the shore of lake victoria fig 4b when considering precipitation and etw together fig 4d high aridity prevails in northeastern uganda despite relatively large precipitation the aridity index was also high in southwestern uganda due to large annual evaporative demands as expected the distribution of annual eta fig 4c appears to reflect compounding effects of land surface water availability and evaporative demands eta was greater than 1000 mm a 1 in regions where precipitation and etw are both high eta in northern uganda decreased in an eastward direction analogous to the distribution of annual precipitation i e water limited while it was below 1000 mm a 1 near lake victoria despite large precipitation i e energy limited the spatial distribution of eta in fig 4c was consistent with several studies illustrating that annual eta in uganda ranged between 400 and 1 100 mm a 1 decreasing toward its northeastern edge e g zeng et al 2012 miralles et al 2011 miralles et al 2011 also detected relatively low vegetation at the northeastern edge of uganda reflecting small transpiration and high bare soil evaporation 4 2 consistency between spi and sedi time series fig 5 illustrates the correlation maps between spi and sedi at the five timescales the pearson r values between the two indices were generally higher than 0 6 across uganda rising with longer timescales at 9 month or longer timescales they were even higher than 0 9 in west central and northwestern uganda this may imply that uganda could be a region with strong land atmosphere coupling in which significant portion of land surface eta could reappear as precipitation and controls land surface water availability at the same location conversely it also indicates that latent heat flux to the atmosphere is mostly limited by land surface moisture availability controlled by precipitation mcevoy et al 2016 the temporal consistency between spi and sedi was further confirmed by the variations of drought severity and extent fig 6 the drought severity and areal extent identified by the two indices were of almost identical variations both indices showed increased drought frequency after 1999 that has been highlighted by previous studies masih et al 2014 for instance argued that drought frequency in uganda has risen for the recent two decades funk et al 2014 also raised concerns about food insecurity in uganda due to decreasing spring and summer precipitation the identical variations of spi and sedi emphasize that deficient precipitation in uganda is very strongly correlated with reduced plant transpiration when considering the overall high dependency on rainfed agriculture over the country funk et al 2014 other anthropogenic factors e g irrigation activities would exert minimal influences on the drought time series 4 3 drought trends in spi and sedi time series given the high correlations between spi and sedi similar trend maps are expected from the two indices although the locations of the steepest trends were slightly different between spi and sedi the two trend maps agree in general fig 7 they indicate that humid central and northwestern uganda could become drier whereas semi arid northeast and southwestern parts would get wetter importantly the areas with negative trends account for more than 75 of the country the trend maps provide an implication that agriculture and water sectors in uganda would confront increasing drought risks many croplands that sustain national agricultural production are currently located in the central part of the country with negative trends of spi and sedi heavily populated areas near lake victoria appear to be under drying climates too funk et al 2014 funk et al 2014 illustrated gradually decreasing trends in spring and summer precipitation in uganda providing a consistent indication with our trend analyses while the drought prone regions were the southwestern and northeastern parts under semi arid climates during 1943 1982 mulinde et al 2016 the recent datasets imply that the regions under wet climate could become drought prone in the future as well 5 discussion 5 1 applicability of the cr method in uganda the results lend support to acceptable applicability of the cr method across uganda albeit the slightly disturbed agreement for the validation period fig 3 performance of the cr method has been validated in several recent studies lately for example ma et al 2019 evaluated the non linear cr against in situ flux observations and water balance eta estimates in chinese river basins suggesting that the cr method was of predictive performance even higher than mte reanalyzed flux data and land surface models szilagyi 2018a 2017 also showed that the cr well reproduced the water balance eta across the conterminous u s the recent evaluation of crago and qualls 2018 provides a consistent indication of strong performance of the complementary principle based on the definitive boundary conditions though our cr eta estimates were evaluated against the interpolated flux data the good agreement between them may suggest its acceptable performance for eta prediction in the data limited country although we calibrated the priestley taylor coefficients against the mte data for our drought assessments a standard method for determining Œ±e has not been established yet since the latest cr of szilagyi et al 2017 is a calibration free formulation one could attempt to quantify sedi with a probable value instead of calibration hence we attempted to recalculate sedi after fixing the Œ±e value at 1 13 which is a plausible value from prior studies ma et al 2019 szilagyi et al 2017 it was found that the differences between the original and the recalculated sedi values were negligible and the pearson r values between them were mostly greater than 0 99 at the five timescales except for a few points with pearson r values between 0 94 and 0 95 this indicates that changes in Œ±e would not significantly affect the resultant sedi values because they are unlikely to change the ranks of etd data series in other words the et based drought assessment could be conducted with no calibration of Œ±e nonetheless there are some caveats with the cr method the adopted wind function is a typical relationship between a vapor pressure deficit and the mass transfer et rate since this relationship could vary with the surface resistance a physical wind function could be chosen instead of the empirical one e g brutsaert et al 2017 selection of the wind function could be a further research topic for drought assessment in addition given the globally decreasing wind speed mcvicar et al 2012 that affects the mass transfer et rates a stationary Œ±e value should be cautiously applied to assessing changes in eta or drought for a 30 year or longer period it must also be noted that the complementary principle should be applied at a suitable temporal 1 day and spatial 1 km2 scales szilagyi et al 2017 5 2 consistency between precipitation and etd anomalies in their continental scale drought assessments kim and rhee 2016 related high temporal consistency between spi and sedi to the strength of land atmosphere coupling the hotspots of land atmospheric coupling are likely to locate in transition zones between wet and dry climates koster et al 2006 since it is limited by energy availability in wet regions eta could be weakly correlated with precipitation under dry climate in contrast eta is too small to be linked to rainfall generation the transition zones between wet and dry regions hence could have enough amounts of eta that can reappear on land surfaces as precipitation given its geographical location between semi arid western kenya and the humid climate of congo it is likely that uganda is one of the transition zones this could be evidenced by a recent study on the land atmospheric coupling in africa by careto et al 2018 in which modeled latent and sensible heat fluxes were significantly correlated across uganda lloyd hughes 2014 argued that the state of drought is a multitude of process specific terms emphasizing non existence of the universal definition of drought i e precipitation deficiency however in uganda it is likely that precipitation anomalies directly explain the variation of etd which is a process specific indicator of agricultural productivity hence agricultural and vegetation conditions could be well captured by precipitation anomalies alone conversely if precipitation observations or forecasts are unreliable etd anomalies might become a proxy of precipitation and or soil moisture deficiency e g kim et al 2019a notably a strong land atmospheric coupling may lead to exceptional heatwave temperatures miralles et al 2014 this provides an important implication that precipitation deficiency would not only restrict water availability in uganda but also poses heatwave driven risks together as was mentioned before latent and sensible heat fluxes are significantly correlated in uganda careto et al 2018 and it emphasizes the importance of monitoring rainfall deficits for early warning of extreme heatwaves 5 3 major causes and impacts of declining sedi and spi while they appear positive before 1980 nsubuga et al 2014 precipitation trends in central and western uganda became downward in recent decades the declining precipitation trend is a likely outcome when considering the steep temperature rise illustrated in funk et al 2012 together with the impact of rising greenhouse gas emissions sensible heat fluxes enhanced by declining precipitation may result in the growing temperature importantly the locations with decreasing spi and sedi coincide with major planting regions that sustain agricultural production of the country foretelling nation wide water and food insecurities in the future a special attention needs to be paid to agricultural products sensitive to heat stresses e g coffee because as discussed earlier limited land surface moisture could often be accompanied by high heatwave temperatures if the descending precipitation trends persist heat wave driven mortality risks mcmichael et al 2006 could increase too in several prior studies the nation wide precipitation decrease in uganda has been attributed to global climate change mulinde et al 2016 kilimani 2015 in particular williams and funk 2011 argued that declining precipitation in east africa could be driven by atmospheric responses to the westward extension of the walker circulation over the past 60 years the indian ocean has warmed faster than the central tropical pacific thereby extending the warm pool to the west a corresponding trend to this sea surface temperature change is more frequent rainfall generation over the tropical indian ocean and westward movements of the dry air aloft that frequently stabilize the atmosphere over eastern africa although several model based assessments e g dai 2013 provides a counterintuitive indication of decreasing drought risks in uganda funk et al 2008 and williams and funk 2011 warned that anthropogenic indian ocean warming in late 20th century could already become a probable cause of societally dangerous climatic changes and might persist to the next decade it seems that the warming indian ocean might gradually reduce moisture transport from the indian ocean to uganda at the edge of eastern africa 6 conclusions in this study using the state of the art complementary principle we estimated land surface evapotranspiration in uganda over the recent 34 years the non linear complementary relationship derived from the definitive boundary conditions showed acceptable performance we found that drought occurrence and spatial extent identified by evapotranspiration deficits were almost identical to those indicated by precipitation anomalies below normal precipitation is closely related to deficient land surface evapotranspiration or vice versa implying that uganda is likely to be a region with strong land atmospheric coupling this provides a crucial implication that limited water availability could be often accompanied by high surface temperatures that increase heat stresses and mortality risks in ecosystems an important lesson from this study is that drought time series have negative trends in many locations in uganda including major agricultural areas decreasing precipitation in eastern africa has been attributed to the long term anthropogenic warming of the indian ocean that may last to the next decade therefore it might be urgent to prepare countermeasures to rising drought risks

5985,for effective management of drought risks a process specific indicator needs to be employed rather than depending only on precipitation anomalies in this study we performed an evapotranspiration based et based assessment of agricultural droughts in uganda where drought has usually been assessed with precipitation deficiency the land surface et and evaporative demand were estimated with a state of the art complementary principle across the country under poor et data availability using the et estimates the standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi was quantified to assess agricultural droughts for 1984 2017 the et based drought assessment was compared with conventional precipitation based analyses using the standardized precipitation index spi in respect of severity areal extent and temporal trends results showed that the complementary principle provided acceptable performance in reproducing interpolated latent flux observations spi and sedi were strongly correlated and thus yielded identical temporal variations of mean drought severity and areal extent the trend maps of spi and sedi also tended to agree and indicate that central and northwestern uganda would face increasing drought risks in the future the declining precipitation in uganda has been attributed to rising surface temperatures of the indian ocean and is expected to persist up to the next decade this study suggests that droughts in major croplands could be often accompanied by high heat wave temperatures in uganda due to strong land atmosphere coupling and thus mortality risks in ecosystems could increase together with water stress keywords drought risk complementary principle evapotranspiration deficit land atmosphere coupling 1 introduction drought is a recurrent natural phenomenon that can undermine ecological social and economic sustainability fao 2003 while onsets of deficient precipitation are often non perceptive bayissa et al 2018 they can evolve to a disaster level to which water resources are substantially limited in agricultural sectors and infrastructures posing societal risks and insecurities serdeczny et al 2015 catastrophic impacts of drought have been well documented including for example water and food insecurity piao et al 2010 destruction of ecosystems rojas 2018 malnutrition and infirmities delbiso et al 2017 and economic damages and casualties masih et al 2014 kala 2017 in particular frequent droughts have resulted in substantial losses in african countries over the past 113 years masih et al 2014 and underdeveloped rainfed regions are expected to become more drought prone due to climate change population growth and lasting poverty mulinde et al 2016 serdeczny et al 2015 conway et al 2009 while drought could be categorized into meteorological precipitation deficit agricultural soil moisture deficit hydrological deficits in streamflow terrestrial water storage and groundwater socioeconomic water deficits against societal demands and ecological droughts human and ecosystem responses to water deficits crausbay et al 2017 wilhite 2005 the origin of all types of droughts is deficient precipitation that propagates through hydrologic and ecological systems hence drought has been generally defined as prolonged precipitation deficiency e g ipcc 2007 and tracking precipitation anomalies has been an established approach for monitoring and analysis of all the drought types e g berker et al 2016 kumar et al 2016 lloyd hughes 2014 however argued that a state of drought is a multitude of diverse natural and socioeconomic conditions and therefore could not be identified only by variations of precipitation precipitation deficits lead to non linear consequences in biophysical systems owing to their high complexity and heterogeneity for instance vegetation surfaces do not only respond to precipitation deficits but to varying temperature soil properties e g fertility and salinity and physiological conditions drought related studies hence have become increasingly process specific with helps of technological advancements in e g remote sensing of land surfaces aghakouchak et al 2015 choi et al 2013 particularly in assessing agricultural or vegetative droughts recent studies have focused on evapotranspiration et instead of precipitation anomalies e g anderson et al 2013 yao et al 2010 because et is a process specific indicator of agricultural productivity that reflects water fertility and heat stresses radiation availability and other environmental factors on vegetation steduto et al 2012 however in practice observational difficulties and costs hinder operational monitoring of land surface et posing limited data availability in many locations across the globe dingman 2015 han et al 2014 the low availability of et observations make it difficult to assess et driven droughts e g otkin et al 2018 thereby leading to high dependency on remote sensing data that are usually shorter than meteorological observations e g anderson et al 2013 while land surface models could be employed with atmospheric forcing e g xia et al 2014 this model based approach is often subject to expensive costs for model calibration and validation together with entailed uncertainties at least in part the challenges from low data availability and model uncertainty could be overcome by employing a state of the art complementary relationship cr method for assessing et driven droughts e g kim et al 2019b hobbins et al 2016 mcevoy et al 2016 kim and rhee 2016 the complementary principle first proposed by bouchet 1963 has been criticized due to the lack of definitive derivations of the cr however since the derivation of cr by brutsaert 2015 from physical boundary conditions many studies have confirmed its easy applicability and reliability in predicting land surface et with only routine meteorological datasets e g ma and szilagyi 2019 ma et al 2019 crago and qualls 2018 szilagyi 2018a chun et al 2018 brutsaert et al 2017 ai et al 2017 szilagyi et al 2017 crago et al 2016 the latest cr method szilagyi et al 2017 could show even better performance than land surface models and interpolations of flux observations ma et al 2019 kim et al 2019b the improved cr is of particular importance for data sparse regions such as african countries for which droughts have usually been assessed by precipitation based indices and remote sensing images e g dutra et al 2013 rulinda et al 2012 ntale and gan 2003 it allows reliable estimation of potential and actual et rates with no specific land surface information enabling to assess a variety of droughts from short term flash drought to persisting vegetative drought kim et al 2019b since it is based on the land atmospheric feedback mechanism the cr method even allowed reliable prediction and trend analyses of et on irrigated land surfaces with no modeling assumptions szilagyi and jozsa 2018 szilagyi 2018b despite those advantages applications of the complementary principle are still very limited for drought assessments even in data rich regions with only few exceptions tracking et deficits could shed light on unknown facets of complex drought phenomena in this work therefore we provide a nation wide drought assessment for an african country based on et deficits using the latest cr method and reanalysis climate data the et based drought assessment was compared with a conventional precipitation based p based drought characterization with respect to severity spatial extent and temporal trends here we demonstrated that strong consistency could exist between p based and et based drought identifications and provided practical implications for drought risk management in relation to land atmosphere coupling strength 2 description of study area and data 2 1 study area the study area consists of land surfaces across uganda located in the eastern part of africa fig 1 uganda is a landlocked country surrounded by kenya south sudan congo rwanda and tanzania the ugandan land surfaces lie within 1 29 s 4 12 n latitude and 29 34 35 0 e longitude encompassing 211 941 km2 approximately the surface elevations have a large variation 600 5000 m with a mean of 1200 m above the sea level the land use is made up of agricultural lands forests rangelands mountains and developed urban areas according to the ministry of water and environment of uganda 2013 croplands account for 34 of the land surfaces and 80 of the population is employed for agricultural production thus deficient rainfall and soil moisture would affect human livelihoods in uganda substantially a warm tropical climate prevails in uganda with a typical temperature range of 25 29 c the mean precipitation rate varies within 500 2800 mm a 1 large annual precipitation is found in mountainous southwestern areas and near lake victoria while the northeastern part is usually under semi arid or arid environments diverse factors affect the spatial variation of precipitation such as the inter tropical convergence zone itcz inter tropical anticyclones monsoonal winds and the moist westerlies from congo mulinde et al 2016 especially seasonal migration of the itcz makes two major rainfall seasons in uganda long rainy seasons from march to may and short rainy seasons during september to november the temporal pattern of monthly rainfall is bimodal i e double peaks near the equator but it tends to become unimodal with distance from the equator nsubuga et al 2014 the atmospheric teleconnections could modulate interannual variability of precipitation the el ni√±o southern oscillation enso for instance has been correlated with precipitation in short rainy seasons phillips and mcintyre 2000 2 2 data collection this study used the reanalyzed climate datasets provided by the nasa prediction of worldwide energy resource project power system https power larc nasa gov accessed on oct 15 2018 the meteorological data of the nasa power system given at a 0 5 0 5 resolution were derived by the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra 2 assimilation model from goddard s global modeling and assimilation office stackhouse et al 2018 the solar radiation data of the power system were from satellite observations a recent study of monteiro et al 2018 provides an evaluation that the nasa power data products could be used for agricultural applications at a reasonable confidence level for this study we collected daily solar radiation maximum and minimum temperatures at 2 m relative humidity at 2 m wind speed at 2 m and precipitation data for 1984 2017 34 years the solar radiation temperatures relative humidity and wind speed were used for et based drought analyses while precipitation data were directly applied to p based drought characterization more details about the nasa power archive are found in stackhouse et al 2018 to validate our et estimates we also collected the global fluxnet product upscaled by jung et al 2009 http www bgc jena mpg de bgi index php services overview the monthly latent heat flux data were produced at a 0 5 0 5 scale for 1982 2011 by interpolating point eddy covariance observations across the globe with the model tree ensemble mte the interpolated product hereafter referred to as the mte data was validated against streamflow observations jung et al 2010 the mte data has been often used to validate modeled land surface energy fluxes e g xia et al 2016 cai et al 2014 since they are based on in situ flux observations and greatly independent of theoretical modeling assumptions here we used the mte data as the reference data to evaluate our et estimates the 134 data points in fig 1 have both the meteorological data from the power system and the upscaled mte data 3 methodology 3 1 generalized complementary principle to estimate actual et eta and the evaporative demand at the 134 data points we used the complementary principle that requires meteorological observations only the complementary principle exploits the vertical linkage between unsaturated land surfaces and overlying atmosphere bouchet 1963 when land surface moisture is ample with minimal effects of local advection water vapor transport to the atmosphere is limited by the evaporative demand overlying the wet surface hereafter referred to as etw however if land surface moisture is inadequate to sustain etw the latent heat flux would be limited and the sensible heat flux is amplified in response thereby the evaporative potential would become higher than etw the complementary principle separately defines this adjusted evaporative potential hereafter referred to as etp since a larger deviation of etp from etw indicates less surface water availability the difference between etp and etw could be used as a predictor of eta over unsaturated soils for this study we employed the generalized cr method formulated by szilagyi et al 2017 the latest cr is a polynomial approximation developed with four definitive boundary conditions bcs for dimensionless variables of x etw etp and y eta etp when land surface water is ample i e energy limited eta etw and etp are all equal hence y 1 should be met for x 1 bc1 on the contrary if the surface is completely desiccated eta should be zero i e y 0 transforming all the available radiation to the sensible heat flux and maximizing the evaporative potential ep epmax the x value corresponding to epmax is its minimum xmin etw epmax here another bc is found as y 0 for x xmin bc2 under the full saturation x 1 eta is not controlled by surface water availability but changes with etw thus providing a zero order boundary condition of dy dx 1 bc3 with no land surface moisture x xmin eta should stay at zero irrespective of etw thus dy dx 0 is likely bc4 when rescaling the variable x into 0 1 the simplest polynomial equation satisfying the four bcs is 1 y 2 x 2 x 3 with x defined as 2 x x x m i n 1 x m i n e p m a x e t p e p m a x e t w e t w e t p eq 1 allows users to estimate eta from a set of etp epmax and etw that could be obtained from meteorological observations alone etp mm d 1 could be calculated using the penman 1948 equation 3 e t p Œ¥ t a v g Œ¥ t a v g Œ≥ r n Œ≥ Œ¥ t a v g Œ≥ f u e s t a v g e s t d e w where Œ¥ t hpa c 1 is

expressed in evaporation rates fu mm d 1 hpa 1 is the wind function es t hpa is the saturation vapor pressure at a temperature t and tdew c is the dew point temperature in this work the standard equations in allen et al 1998 were used to calculate the slope of the saturation vapor pressure and the psychrometric constant we adopted the same empirical wind function as found in szilagyi et al 2017 4 f u 0 26 1 0 54 u 2 where u2 m s 1 is the wind speed at 2 m above the ground when ep epmax the land surface should be completely dry and the vapor pressure of the atmosphere should become zero

unsaturated land surface could be higher than what should be observed under full saturation when using the derivation of monteith 1981 tws could be calculated as in szilagyi 2014 9a t w s t w b Œ≥ q n

lower than tavg due to the cooling effects of latent heat fluxes while it is higher than twb when qn is positive we calculated the net radiation rn using the standard approach of allen et al 1998 with solar radiation maximum and minimum temperatures and relative humidity data the dew point temperature was estimated by converting the relative humidity the daily precipitation and et estimates eta and etw from the power data were aggregated to monthly values for our comparative drought assessments 3 2 drought identification and analyses 3 2 1 standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi the monthly eta and etw from the cr method could become a drought identifier because a comparison between them indicates the consumed water on land surfaces relative to the atmospheric demand e g anderson et al 2013 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 for this study we used the standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi kim and rhee 2016 the et deficit etd was defined as eta minus etw and the calculated etd values at each data point were fitted to the 3 parameter log logistic ll3 distributions following the global assessments by vicente serrano et al 2018 the sedi is simply the z score of the standard normal distribution corresponding to the cumulative probability of etd estimated with the ll3 distribution sedi can provide multi timescale et based drought identification as did hobbins et al 2016 and mcevoy et al 2016 in which the evaporative demand was standardized at various timescales etd could be accumulated as per users interest for example one uses a 1 month timescale for addressing short term water shortage or flash droughts while a 6 12 month timescale could be used to investigate seasonal or annual vegetation responses e g kim and rhee 2016 for this study we chose five timescales of 1 3 6 9 and 12 months for our et based drought identification to consider climatic seasonality the histograms of accumulated etd were fitted to the ll3 distributions separately for january through december more details and discussion about sedi are found in vicente serrano et al 2018 and kim and rhee 2016 3 2 2 standardized precipitation index spi for comparison to sedi we additionally identified droughts using the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 since it is a simple conversion of precipitation anomalies the use of spi is fully p based drought identification spi has been frequently used for quantifying meteorological droughts e g duffy et al 2015 patel et al 2007 however spi also could visualize agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic facets of precipitation deficiency by adjusting its timescale e g gevaert et al 2018 begur√≠a et al 2014 guttman 1998 the structure of spi is not different from sedi except that spi fits the aggregated precipitation to a theoretical probability distribution hence the monthly precipitation series at each data point were aggregated into the five timescales and fitted to the 2 parameter gamma distributions following the assessment of guttman 1999 then the cumulative probabilities of aggregated precipitation in each month were converted to the z scores we applied the same five timescales for sedi and spi to consider the residence time of atmospheric moisture 10 days van der ent and tuinenburg 2017 implying that eta contributes to precipitation processes within a month it should be noted that drought identification by spi is independent of sedi because the cr eta and etw estimates were obtained without accounting for precipitation 3 3 correlation and trend analyses we first evaluated temporal consistency between spi and sedi at the five timescales while spi and sedi are deemed independent of each other in terms of the required data for calculation the two could have temporal consistency precipitation and eta are physical sources and sinks of the atmospheric moisture and could be closely related in such a case one can hypothesize that spi and sedi are able to become surrogate indicators for each other we hence measured the temporal consistency between the two indices at each data point using the pearson correlation coefficient pearson r as did kim and rhee 2016 correlations between spi and sedi were measured for the five timescales separately in addition mean severity and areal extent of droughts were identified over the 34 year period in uganda among the five timescales the 9 month timescale was chosen for assessing vegetation droughts based on prior studies begur√≠a et al 2014 suggests that spi is likely to have high correlations with the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1968 at a 9 to 12 month timescale since pdsi captures variations of soil moisture anomalies dai et al 2004 9 month spi and sedi would indicate agricultural and vegetation droughts kim and rhee 2016 we calculated the mean severity of vegetation droughts simply by averaging 9 month spi and sedi values of the data points within the borders of uganda while the spatial extent was estimated with the percentage of data points with 1 3 or less spi and sedi values within the borders the chosen spi 1 3 is the threshold of severe drought in the u s drought portal http droughtmonitor unl edu aboutusdm aboutthedata droughtclassificatino aspx finally to investigate drought trends for the 34 year period mann kendall mk and sen s slope tests were conducted with the 9 month sedi and spi time series at all the data points the non parametric mk test evaluates significance of linear trends by counting signs between all pairs within a time series the sum of the signs is normalized with their variance and compared with the z score of the standard normal distribution at a chosen significance level 5 was used here the sen s slope is the median value of linear slopes between all the pairs within the series sheffield et al 2012 is a good example that quantified drought risks with non parametric linear trends at a global scale nsubuga et al 2014 and gilbert 1987 could provide more details about the mk test and sen s slope 4 results 4 1 performance of the cr method to determine the priestley taylor coefficient Œ±e for each data point which is the only parameter of the cr method we divided the mte data into two sets for calibration and validation the optimal Œ±e was determined by minimizing the mean bias between eta estimates and the mte data for the period of 1984 1998 then eta for the remaining period 1999 2011 was estimated by using the optimal Œ±e and evaluated against the mte data fig 2 displays the optimal Œ±e values at each data point and spatial interpolations between them the optimal Œ±e tends to become higher with increasing proximity to lake victoria the values near or on lake victoria were in the range of 1 2 1 35 this implies that a desirable Œ±e on wet surfaces is close to the reasonable value of 1 26 for wet surfaces suggested by many prior studies e g lhomme 1997 priestley and taylor 1972 however Œ±e 1 26 was unlikely a good estimate for the land surfaces distant from the lake victoria and the cr might be insufficiently reliable with sudden moisture changes between water bodies and land surfaces the best Œ±e values across the land surfaces ranged mostly between 1 0 and 1 1 providing an indication that use of Œ±e 1 26 might lead to overestimation of eta the average of the optimal Œ±e values across uganda was 1 06 with a standard deviation of 0 081 when calibrating against the interpolated flux observations although they are slightly smaller than the values given in prior applications e g szilagyi 2018a szilagyi et al 2017 the optimal Œ±e values were unlikely out of theoretically acceptable ranges of pt coefficient based on assouline et al 2016 fig 3 shows 1 1 plots between the averages of cr eta estimated with the optimal Œ±e and those of the mte data at the 134 data points as expected the two eta estimates neatly agreed for the calibration period albeit slight overestimations in mid and low eta values in the validation period on the other hand negative biases between the cr eta and the mte data increased in the range of 700 1000 mm a 1 this indicates that the optimal Œ±e for the cr method might gradually rise with time in relatively wet locations nonetheless the average of the p biases between the cr and mte eta estimates was 2 3 with a standard deviation of 6 1 even for the validation period this evaluation led us believe that eta and etw estimated with the optimal Œ±e were acceptable for our drought assessment for the data period of 1984 2017 fig 4 shows spatial distributions of the precipitation etw and eta estimated with the optimal Œ±e and the aridity index ratio of etw to precipitation averaged over the entire data period the mean annual precipitation in the southern regions ranged between 1200 and 1900 mm a 1 increasing toward lake victoria in northern uganda precipitation tends to decrease in an eastward direction and the lowest value was at the border to kenya on the other hand etw was highest in the north central region it decreased toward the borders and the lowest etw was along the shore of lake victoria fig 4b when considering precipitation and etw together fig 4d high aridity prevails in northeastern uganda despite relatively large precipitation the aridity index was also high in southwestern uganda due to large annual evaporative demands as expected the distribution of annual eta fig 4c appears to reflect compounding effects of land surface water availability and evaporative demands eta was greater than 1000 mm a 1 in regions where precipitation and etw are both high eta in northern uganda decreased in an eastward direction analogous to the distribution of annual precipitation i e water limited while it was below 1000 mm a 1 near lake victoria despite large precipitation i e energy limited the spatial distribution of eta in fig 4c was consistent with several studies illustrating that annual eta in uganda ranged between 400 and 1 100 mm a 1 decreasing toward its northeastern edge e g zeng et al 2012 miralles et al 2011 miralles et al 2011 also detected relatively low vegetation at the northeastern edge of uganda reflecting small transpiration and high bare soil evaporation 4 2 consistency between spi and sedi time series fig 5 illustrates the correlation maps between spi and sedi at the five timescales the pearson r values between the two indices were generally higher than 0 6 across uganda rising with longer timescales at 9 month or longer timescales they were even higher than 0 9 in west central and northwestern uganda this may imply that uganda could be a region with strong land atmosphere coupling in which significant portion of land surface eta could reappear as precipitation and controls land surface water availability at the same location conversely it also indicates that latent heat flux to the atmosphere is mostly limited by land surface moisture availability controlled by precipitation mcevoy et al 2016 the temporal consistency between spi and sedi was further confirmed by the variations of drought severity and extent fig 6 the drought severity and areal extent identified by the two indices were of almost identical variations both indices showed increased drought frequency after 1999 that has been highlighted by previous studies masih et al 2014 for instance argued that drought frequency in uganda has risen for the recent two decades funk et al 2014 also raised concerns about food insecurity in uganda due to decreasing spring and summer precipitation the identical variations of spi and sedi emphasize that deficient precipitation in uganda is very strongly correlated with reduced plant transpiration when considering the overall high dependency on rainfed agriculture over the country funk et al 2014 other anthropogenic factors e g irrigation activities would exert minimal influences on the drought time series 4 3 drought trends in spi and sedi time series given the high correlations between spi and sedi similar trend maps are expected from the two indices although the locations of the steepest trends were slightly different between spi and sedi the two trend maps agree in general fig 7 they indicate that humid central and northwestern uganda could become drier whereas semi arid northeast and southwestern parts would get wetter importantly the areas with negative trends account for more than 75 of the country the trend maps provide an implication that agriculture and water sectors in uganda would confront increasing drought risks many croplands that sustain national agricultural production are currently located in the central part of the country with negative trends of spi and sedi heavily populated areas near lake victoria appear to be under drying climates too funk et al 2014 funk et al 2014 illustrated gradually decreasing trends in spring and summer precipitation in uganda providing a consistent indication with our trend analyses while the drought prone regions were the southwestern and northeastern parts under semi arid climates during 1943 1982 mulinde et al 2016 the recent datasets imply that the regions under wet climate could become drought prone in the future as well 5 discussion 5 1 applicability of the cr method in uganda the results lend support to acceptable applicability of the cr method across uganda albeit the slightly disturbed agreement for the validation period fig 3 performance of the cr method has been validated in several recent studies lately for example ma et al 2019 evaluated the non linear cr against in situ flux observations and water balance eta estimates in chinese river basins suggesting that the cr method was of predictive performance even higher than mte reanalyzed flux data and land surface models szilagyi 2018a 2017 also showed that the cr well reproduced the water balance eta across the conterminous u s the recent evaluation of crago and qualls 2018 provides a consistent indication of strong performance of the complementary principle based on the definitive boundary conditions though our cr eta estimates were evaluated against the interpolated flux data the good agreement between them may suggest its acceptable performance for eta prediction in the data limited country although we calibrated the priestley taylor coefficients against the mte data for our drought assessments a standard method for determining Œ±e has not been established yet since the latest cr of szilagyi et al 2017 is a calibration free formulation one could attempt to quantify sedi with a probable value instead of calibration hence we attempted to recalculate sedi after fixing the Œ±e value at 1 13 which is a plausible value from prior studies ma et al 2019 szilagyi et al 2017 it was found that the differences between the original and the recalculated sedi values were negligible and the pearson r values between them were mostly greater than 0 99 at the five timescales except for a few points with pearson r values between 0 94 and 0 95 this indicates that changes in Œ±e would not significantly affect the resultant sedi values because they are unlikely to change the ranks of etd data series in other words the et based drought assessment could be conducted with no calibration of Œ±e nonetheless there are some caveats with the cr method the adopted wind function is a typical relationship between a vapor pressure deficit and the mass transfer et rate since this relationship could vary with the surface resistance a physical wind function could be chosen instead of the empirical one e g brutsaert et al 2017 selection of the wind function could be a further research topic for drought assessment in addition given the globally decreasing wind speed mcvicar et al 2012 that affects the mass transfer et rates a stationary Œ±e value should be cautiously applied to assessing changes in eta or drought for a 30 year or longer period it must also be noted that the complementary principle should be applied at a suitable temporal 1 day and spatial 1 km2 scales szilagyi et al 2017 5 2 consistency between precipitation and etd anomalies in their continental scale drought assessments kim and rhee 2016 related high temporal consistency between spi and sedi to the strength of land atmosphere coupling the hotspots of land atmospheric coupling are likely to locate in transition zones between wet and dry climates koster et al 2006 since it is limited by energy availability in wet regions eta could be weakly correlated with precipitation under dry climate in contrast eta is too small to be linked to rainfall generation the transition zones between wet and dry regions hence could have enough amounts of eta that can reappear on land surfaces as precipitation given its geographical location between semi arid western kenya and the humid climate of congo it is likely that uganda is one of the transition zones this could be evidenced by a recent study on the land atmospheric coupling in africa by careto et al 2018 in which modeled latent and sensible heat fluxes were significantly correlated across uganda lloyd hughes 2014 argued that the state of drought is a multitude of process specific terms emphasizing non existence of the universal definition of drought i e precipitation deficiency however in uganda it is likely that precipitation anomalies directly explain the variation of etd which is a process specific indicator of agricultural productivity hence agricultural and vegetation conditions could be well captured by precipitation anomalies alone conversely if precipitation observations or forecasts are unreliable etd anomalies might become a proxy of precipitation and or soil moisture deficiency e g kim et al 2019a notably a strong land atmospheric coupling may lead to exceptional heatwave temperatures miralles et al 2014 this provides an important implication that precipitation deficiency would not only restrict water availability in uganda but also poses heatwave driven risks together as was mentioned before latent and sensible heat fluxes are significantly correlated in uganda careto et al 2018 and it emphasizes the importance of monitoring rainfall deficits for early warning of extreme heatwaves 5 3 major causes and impacts of declining sedi and spi while they appear positive before 1980 nsubuga et al 2014 precipitation trends in central and western uganda became downward in recent decades the declining precipitation trend is a likely outcome when considering the steep temperature rise illustrated in funk et al 2012 together with the impact of rising greenhouse gas emissions sensible heat fluxes enhanced by declining precipitation may result in the growing temperature importantly the locations with decreasing spi and sedi coincide with major planting regions that sustain agricultural production of the country foretelling nation wide water and food insecurities in the future a special attention needs to be paid to agricultural products sensitive to heat stresses e g coffee because as discussed earlier limited land surface moisture could often be accompanied by high heatwave temperatures if the descending precipitation trends persist heat wave driven mortality risks mcmichael et al 2006 could increase too in several prior studies the nation wide precipitation decrease in uganda has been attributed to global climate change mulinde et al 2016 kilimani 2015 in particular williams and funk 2011 argued that declining precipitation in east africa could be driven by atmospheric responses to the westward extension of the walker circulation over the past 60 years the indian ocean has warmed faster than the central tropical pacific thereby extending the warm pool to the west a corresponding trend to this sea surface temperature change is more frequent rainfall generation over the tropical indian ocean and westward movements of the dry air aloft that frequently stabilize the atmosphere over eastern africa although several model based assessments e g dai 2013 provides a counterintuitive indication of decreasing drought risks in uganda funk et al 2008 and williams and funk 2011 warned that anthropogenic indian ocean warming in late 20th century could already become a probable cause of societally dangerous climatic changes and might persist to the next decade it seems that the warming indian ocean might gradually reduce moisture transport from the indian ocean to uganda at the edge of eastern africa 6 conclusions in this study using the state of the art complementary principle we estimated land surface evapotranspiration in uganda over the recent 34 years the non linear complementary relationship derived from the definitive boundary conditions showed acceptable performance we found that drought occurrence and spatial extent identified by evapotranspiration deficits were almost identical to those indicated by precipitation anomalies below normal precipitation is closely related to deficient land surface evapotranspiration or vice versa implying that uganda is likely to be a region with strong land atmospheric coupling this provides a crucial implication that limited water availability could be often accompanied by high surface temperatures that increase heat stresses and mortality risks in ecosystems an important lesson from this study is that drought time series have negative trends in many locations in uganda including major agricultural areas decreasing precipitation in eastern africa has been attributed to the long term anthropogenic warming of the indian ocean that may last to the next decade therefore it might be urgent to prepare countermeasures to rising drought risks

5986,estimation of human induced evapotranspiration et changes e g irrigation is critical for understanding terrestrial water and energy cycle in the anthropocene a few studies have detected human influence on et through comparing natural et from reanalysis models and actual et estimated by the water budget analysis with gravity recovery and climate experiment grace terrestrial water storage data however whether models can reasonably reproduce natural hydrological processes is overlooked here we show that uncertainty in model simulated natural et can determine whether the human induced et change is detectable the naturalized runoff provided by the yellow river conservancy commission is used to calibrate the variable infiltration capacity vic model to obtain a more reliable estimation of natural et the actual et is estimated by either using the grace satellite retrievals with coal mining induced gravity change removed or 192 soil moisture station observations combined with surface and ground water resources bulletin data over the yellow river basin by comparing with natural et from vic simulations human induced annual et changes are 41 23 to 59 31 mm year during 2003 2010 for grace and soil moisture based estimations respectively contributing to 11 16 increase in annual et over the yellow river basin the estimation is comparable to the bulletin data of 47 mm year there is an obvious overestimation in natural et from global land data assimilation system prohibiting the detection of anthropogenic influence this study highlights the importance of reasonably modeling natural hydrological processes as a baseline for detecting anthropogenic influence on the hydrological cycle keywords evapotranspiration human activity hydrological modeling water budget grace vic 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is not only affected by climate change but also human interventions including reservoir regulation irrigation and land use and land cover change lucc with rapid population growth and economic development both the water demand and water consumption are increasing resulting in a hydrological system that is closely intertwined with water management practices haddeland et al 2014 lobell and bonfils 2008 sterling et al 2012 irrigation accounts for most of the water consumption d”ßll and siebert 2002 shiklomanov and rodda 2003 and it changes the hydrological cycle through enhancing et baron et al 1998 gordon et al 2005 ozdogan et al 2010 moreover afforestation also alters the relationship between runoff and precipitation and enhancing et with improved vegetation conditions liang et al 2015 wang et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 human induced et change affects surface temperature and runoff as well as atmospheric circulation and precipitation through altering the water availability and the partitioning of turbulent energy fluxes baron et al 1998 gordon et al 2005 ozdogan et al 2010 tang et al 2007 wey et al 2015 therefore unraveling human influence on et is critical for understanding the changes in hydrological cycle especially over river basins that are heavily managed previous studies have used multiple methods including paired watershed experiments huang et al 2003 van loon et al 2019 physical hydrological modeling tang et al 2009 and time series analysis li et al 2016 to study the human interventions e g lucc irrigation on streamflow and et asokan and destouni 2014 jaramillo and destouni 2015 jaramillo et al 2018 some studies have separated the impacts of water managements on et magnitudes from natural variability through comparing model simulations with or without an irrigation scheme ozdogan et al 2010 sorooshian et al 2012 tang et al 2007 wey et al 2015 and demonstrated significant increase in et due to agricultural practices however human activities are difficult to parameterize in land surface models lsms hanasaki et al 2008a 2008b wada et al 2014 due to insufficient understanding of the physical processes and the lack of water use data et is also difficult to measure directly at regional scale due to sparse in situ observations and strong spatial heterogeneity with the launch of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite that measures the terrestrial water storage change twsc et can be estimated at river basin scale by using the water budget method with observations of precipitation and streamflow rodell et al 2004a sheffield et al 2009 pan et al 2012 the grace gravity fields have provided the observations of twsc which consist of the changes in soil moisture surface water storage and groundwater storage including natural variability and anthropogenic water storage changes scanlon et al 2016 syed et al 2008 wahr et al 2004 to detect the human influence et estimated by lsms representing natural processes was compared with grace derived et castle et al 2016 pan et al 2017 multiple modeled et products from global reanalysis were widely used in regional studies castle et al 2016 lv et al 2017 pan et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 for instance castle et al 2016 compared the grace derived et and the north american land data assimilation system nldas simulated et products natural et in the predevelopment stage and identified human induced et change during growing seasons over the colorado river basin in southwestern usa pan et al 2017 used similar method and compared the grace derived et and the et estimated by the global land data assimilation system version 1 gldas1 and found that human activities contributed to a 12 increase in annual et over the haihe river basin in northern china many studies implied that large uncertainty in grace twsc estimation may hinder the water budget analysis especially over semiarid river basins long et al 2014 lv et al 2017 as well as the detection of the human induced et change although several studies used natural streamflow to calibrate lsms before reservoir construction rangecroft et al 2019 most studies directly used model reanalysis data and neglected the performance of lsms in simulating the natural et due to the lack of observation for model validation a big assumption is that lsms like gldas and era interim dee et al 2011 without human components will reproduce the natural et reasonably so that the human induced et change can be estimated based on the difference between grace derived et and lsm simulated et however whether the uncertainty in lsm simulated natural et affects the detection of human intervention remains unclear in this study we used multisource data analysis to estimate human induced et change over the yellow river basin in northern china where hydrological processes are heavily changed by human activities including water managements and lucc naturalized runoff data are used to verify the performances of global reanalysis data that provide natural et estimations and are used to calibrate the variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 1996 land surface hydrological model for improving natural et estimations actual et is estimated through the water budget method based on observed precipitation and runoff and actual twsc estimations the twsc estimations are from either grace after being corrected by coal mining data or merged 192 in situ soil moisture observations and statistic data of surface and ground water resources from bulletins considering that the grain for green project has improved vegetation conditions especially for the loess plateau the lucc s influence on et is also investigated by performing vic simulations with static or dynamic land cover data 2 study area multisource data model and method 2 1 study area the yellow river is the second longest river in china with a length of 5 464 km originating from qinghai plateau and flowing through the loess plateau and huang huai hai great plain and finally into the bohai sea fig 1 the yellow river basin is located in arid semi arid and semi humid climates with the drainage area of 794 712 km2 and it is the homeland for 107 million people however the water resources are quite limited and the average streamflow of the yellow river basin is 58 billion m3 only accounting for 2 of the total streamflow of china to control flood and alleviate drought over 3000 reservoirs have been built in the yellow river basin with a total storage capacity of 57 4 billion m3 the yellow river basin is one of the most heavily regulated river basins in the world and it is also the main agricultural region in china including several major irrigation districts such as the hetao districts in the upper reaches the surface water accounts for 73 of the total water withdrawal over the yellow river basin which is mainly consumed by irrigation since 1999 the ecological restoration project has been implemented and gradually improved vegetation conditions especially over the middle reaches where large areas are converted from farmland to forest or grassland 2 2 data and method 2 2 1 in situ observations actual et was estimated by a water budget method based on precipitation p and runoff observations r obs and twsc Œ¥s observations yeh et al 1998 rodell et al 2004a at monthly and annual time scales 1 et obs p r obs Œ¥ s accurate precipitation observation is a crucial component in the water budget analysis here the 0 25 degree gridded precipitation observation dataset was interpolated from 324 china meteorological administration cma stations which was used to drive the vic model and to correct precipitation and runoff biases in global reanalysis for runoff there are 11 mainstream gauges shown in fig 1 naturalized and observed runoff datasets were provided by yellow river conservancy commission hekouzhen huayuankou and lijin gauges table 1 are the control stations for the upper and middle reaches and the whole river basin respectively and their observed runoff data were used to calculate actual et naturalized runoff at the target gauge was estimated by adding human water use data from irrigation industrial and civil sectors over the drainage area of the target gauge back to the observed runoff at the target gauge yuan et al 2017 the water use data were reported by the local authority and compiled by the yellow river conservancy commission the naturalized runoff was calculated as follows 2 r nat r obs r irr r res r idu r civ r div where r nat and r obs are the naturalized and observed runoff respectively r irr is the surface water used in irrigation by deducting the flow returned to river which represents the actual water consumption during the irrigation process r res is the regulated runoff through reservoirs with negative values indicating reservoirs release and positive values indicating reservoir filling and r idu and r civ are water consumed in industrial and civil sectors including water loss during transportation and the water consumption in industrial product and domestic sector after removing the discharge of wastewater r div is the interbasin water diversion and the negative and positive values indicate water transfer in or out of the selected drainage area respectively yuan et al 2017 the naturalized runoff can be considered as unaffected by lucc reservoir management etc here we used naturalized runoff to verity lsms performance in simulating natural hydrological processes fig 1 also shows the locations of the 192 soil moisture stations with measurements of the volumetric soil moisture at depths of 10 cm 20 cm 50 cm 70 cm and 100 cm yuan et al 2015 soil moisture changes were combined with annual statistic data including water diversion surface water and groundwater withdrawals obtained from the bulletin of the yellow river http www yellowriver gov cn to calculate the twsc at annual time scale and table 2 lists the annual surface water storage change mainly from reservoir storage change and the groundwater storage change during 2003 2010 according to the bulletins this dataset is referred to as smc in this study according to the bulletins there is hardly any inter basin water transfer for the upper and middle reaches but there is 13 mm year water transfer for the entire yellow river basin with most of them occurring over the downstream areas in addition et datasets of two agricultural stations ansai and changwu from the chinese national ecosystem research network cnern located in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin fig 1 table 1 were used for et comparison 2 2 2 remote sensing data grace was launched in march 2002 and the terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa datasets were released from three research centers including the center for space research csr at the university of texas at austin jet propulsion laboratory jpl at the california institute of technology and the german research center for geoscience gfz using mascon mass concentration and spherical harmonic solutions mascons mas have advantages than traditional method of spherical harmonic solutions sh in reducing uncertainties especially for smaller regions scanlon et al 2016 watkins et al 2015 here we used six sets of twsa from different sources including r05 csr r05 jpl and r06 jpl using mascon solution and r05 csr r05 jpl and r05 gfz using spherical harmonic solution monthly twsc was calculated as the difference between monthly twsat and twsat 1 twsct twsat twsat 1 twsc from grace reflects not only the natural variability but also the anthropogenic impacts e g groundwater exploitation reservoir impoundment inter basin water diversion rodell et al 2018 the coal mining data from china statistical yearbooks provided by national bureau of statics of china tang et al 2013 were used in this study to investigate the impacts of coal mining on grace twsc estimation the net coal mass changes were transformed to equivalent water in thickness the study period is 2003 to 2010 considering the starting year of grace data and the ending year of observed and naturalized runoff besides water managements et is also enhanced due to vegetation greening at regional scales leaf area index lai is a key parameter that determines the partition of canopy intercepted precipitation and the precipitation that reaches the ground surface to investigate the response of et to lucc we replaced the default lai in vic with global land surface satellite lai derived from modis glass modis and conducted two simulations from 2003 to 2010 with or without interannual variations of lai where the lai in the latter experiment was fixed the same as that in 2003 glass modis lai was derived from modis lai through a general regression neural networks approach xiao et al 2016 with a spatial resolution of 0 05 degree spanned from 2001 to 2017 http www geodata cn 2 2 3 global reanalysis data and vic simulation the natural et products as well as natural runoff and precipitation from various global reanalysis products including the era interim dee et al 2011 era interim land balsamo et al 2015 gldas1 gldas2 rodell et al 2004b were also used in this study here et runoff and precipitation datasets from era interim and era interim land are at 12 hourly and daily time step respectively with 0 25 degree spatial resolution gldas1 consists of four lsms i e noah ek 2003 mosaic koster and suarez 1994 1996 variable infiltration capacity liang et al 1994 community land model clm dai et al 2003 and we used 1 degree monthly et runoff and precipitation from above four models the ensemble mean estimates from four gldas1 models were used in this study to keep consistency all gldas1 products were interpolated into 0 25 degree using bilinear interpolation gldas v2 0 monthly products are from noah at 0 25 degree spatial resolution runoff and et data from global reanalysis were corrected by the ratios of cma precipitation mentioned in section 2 2 1 to the precipitation of global reanalysis to reduce the systematical errors we also calibrated vic model against naturalized runoff to simulate the natural hydrological processes vic is a semi distributed grid based land surface hydrological model and it has been widely used in simulating the natural hydrology tang et al 2009 xie et al 2007 the inputs of the vic model include precipitation 10 m wind speed and maximum and minimum surface air temperature as well as soil data and vegetation data the outputs of the vic model include soil moisture at three layers surface runoff baseflow evapotranspiration etc yuan et al 2016 the naturalized runoff datasets at 11 mainstream gauges fig 1 were used to calibrate the soil parameters of the vic model at 0 25 degree resolution with satellite based monthly lai in 2003 by using the same method as yuan et al 2016 the naturalized runoff at 11 hydrological gauges divided by basin averaged cma precipitation was used to calculate the runoff rainfall ratios and the gridded runoff time series were then obtained through multiplying the gridded cma rainfall time series with the runoff rainfall ratios the yellow river is divided into 11 sub basin areas between the target gauge and the adjacent upstream gauge from tangnaihai gauge to lijin gauge fig 1 the gridded naturalized runoff time series were used to calculate the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse with vic simulated runoff the parameters of the vic model were optimized through the shuffled complex evolution algorithm sce duan et al 1994 with the aim of maximizing nse value the automatic calibration was carried out by running the vic model during 2003 2010 thousands of times over each 0 25 degree grid cell within the yellow river basin through calibration of the vic model with naturalized runoff it is expected that it can simulate the natural et and water storage reasonably during 2003 2010 2 2 4 methods for detection and uncertainty estimation here we focused on anthropogenic influences on et including reservoir regulation irrigation and lucc the discrepancy between natural et and observed et is considered as human induced et change 3 Œ¥ et et obs et nat model where Œ¥ e t is considered as human induced et change et obs is the actual et estimate and et nat model is the natural et estimated by lsms as shown in fig 2 the naturalized runoff is used to evaluate the performance of global reanalysis data and the vic simulation and the model with the highest runoff nse was selected to provide natural et estimates et nat model as for the actual et et obs we used cma precipitation which is the same as climate forcing in vic simulation twsc derived from grace and in situ observations and observed runoff to calculate the residual in water budget as actual et estimates et obs fig 2 the uncertainties of actual et estimates through the water budget method come from the errors of precipitation runoff and twsc assuming that the errors of p r obs and Œ¥s are independent and are normally distributed rodell et al 2004a the uncertainty of et can be estimated as 4 Œº et 2 Œº p 2 Œº r o b s 2 Œº Œ¥ s 2 where Œº is the uncertainty here uncertainty in precipitation and runoff was specified as 5 dingman 2001 and the value of 30 was chosen in the smc from soil moisture stations twsc is the difference between twsat and twsat 1 and thus the uncertainty is the error of twsa multiplying 2 which consists of measurement errors wahr et al 2006 leakage errors as residual errors after filtering landerer and swenson 2012 and the standard deviation among multiple twsa datasets Œº twsa Œº meas 2 Œº leak 2 Œº std 2 to simplify the calculation of the retrieval error of grace we selected the gridded leakage error and measurement error associated with the twsa of spherical harmonic solution which are supposed to be larger than those of mascon solution https grace jpl nasa gov data get data the region scaled uncertainties considering the total leakage and measurement errors of twsa were derived from the gridded errors they are 13 19 and 13 mm respectively for the upper reaches middle reaches and the whole basin the errors of the mean monthly annual et estimates were the squared mean errors of each month year according to error propagation annual Œ¥s is calculated based on twsa in december in consecutive two years so the uncertainties of Œ¥s at annual scale are mainly from measurement errors and leakage errors of two twsas which are not accumulated from monthly to annual time scale 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of global reanalysis data precipitation is the most important input for lsms and the accuracy of precipitation determines the simulations of runoff and et liu et al 2016 nearing et al 2016 we compared different sources of precipitation used in lsms with in situ cma observation fig 3 gldas1 and era interim land precipitation datasets agree well with the in situ observation of precipitations r 0 99 and their root mean square error rmse values 4 7 mm are smaller than those of gldas2 and era interim 13 24 mm in terms of seasonal cycle of precipitation gldas1 is closer to in situ precipitation figs 3d f fig 4 shows the basin averaged runoff from global reanalysis vic simulation and naturalized runoff the naturalized runoff was regarded as the reference to verify the performances of reanalysis and the vic model given that they do not have irrigation and reservoir modules before evaluation the runoff from global reanalysis were adjusted by using the ratio of cma precipitation to reanalysis precipitation the nse values between basin averaged naturalized runoff and those from reanalysis or vic simulation were listed in table 3 the vic model s nse values are 0 66 0 69 and 0 72 over the upper reaches middle reaches and the whole basin among the reanalysis runoff datasets corrected by in situ precipitation the nse values for era interim land are 0 6 0 34 and 0 67 for its upper and middle reaches and the yellow river basin which are much better than those for era interim gldas1 and gldas2 where most nse values are negative table 3 the better performance of era interim land compared with era interim for the runoff simulation resulted from the improvements in land surface parameterizations e g soil hydrology snow scheme and adjusted precipitation balsamo et al 2015 which contributes to reducing the overestimation of runoff figs 4d 4f gldas1 2 which were widely used for detecting human induced et change have deficiency in reproducing the natural et over the yellow river basin because they have poor performance in reproducing naturalized runoff therefore we used the results from vic to estimate natural et et vic for the mainstream of the yellow river basin and the upper reaches and the middle reaches 3 2 grace twsc and coal mining impacts fig 5 shows the monthly twsc derived from multiple grace products and there are great divergences at monthly time series among different sources as a part of uncertainty of twsc the ensemble mean of grace products derived from different methods sh and mas and different versions was used in calculating et in water budget equation in order to reduce the uncertainty of twsc the increase in terrestrial water storage is mainly concentrated during summer figs 5d f consistent with seasonal variations of precipitation there is also an obvious increase of terrestrial water storage for march and this may relate to snow melt over the tibet plateau the average seasonal amplitudes of twsc range from 8 to 14 mm for yellow river basin 9 to 12 mm for the upper reaches and 10 to 16 mm for the middle reaches during 2003 2010 given that the yellow river basin is a water limited basin the amplitudes of terrestrial water storage are relatively small ni et al 2014 there are increasing quantities of coal mining causing mass loss affecting grace data tang et al 2013 and we removed the effects of coal mining on grace twsc estimation at annual scale fig 6 shows the net city level mass change of coal mining equivalent to water depth which was calculated the difference between imported and exported amounts of coal mining coal mining areas mainly concentrate in shanxi inner mongolia and shaanxi province and coal mining has significant influence especially over the middle reaches causing mass loss ranging from 0 6 to 2 mm year coal mining had little influence over the upper reaches but caused mean annual mass reduction of 1 2 mm year for the middle reaches and 0 6 mm year for the whole basin these surface mass changes were removed from grace based actual et 3 3 detection of human induced et change fig 7 shows the natural monthly et estimates from vic simulations et vic blue lines and actual et estimates based on grace et obs grace red lines by using the water budget method the pink shades are the uncertainties of grace derived et estimates based on eq 4 for the middle reaches et of two agricultural stations fig 7b was used to verify the et estimations derived from grace due to limited in situ observations although they cannot well represent the spatial variability of et et obs grace correlates well with et ansai and et changwu with correlation coefficients of 0 74 and 0 54 p 0 05 here et vic is regarded as natural et estimation ignoring human interventions including water managements and lucc while et obs grace is actual et estimated by the water budget method with multisource data besides water managements including irrigation would enhance et through increasing crop transpiration and soil moisture evaporation so actual et should always be larger than natural et in this regard over the yellow river basin compared with et vic et obs grace is higher during warm seasons over the upper reaches and the whole basin which are consistent with irrigation period fig 7d irrigation consumes most of the water withdrawals according to the bulletin of yellow river water resources and some major agricultural regions like hetao irrigation district locate inside the basin however there may be underestimation in actual et for the middle reaches due to large uncertainty from grace twsc the discrepancies between monthly natural et and actual et are not quite robust as they are smaller than the uncertainty of et estimations besides annual cycle fig 8 presents the interannual variations of annual et estimations from vic and actual et estimates based on grace and in situ observations over the yellow river basin et estimation derived from grace is 419 31 mm year after being removed coal mining effects whereas the actual annual mean et estimation is 401 23 mm year based on in situ soil moisture and other statistic data table 4 coal mining caused mean annual mass loss ranging from 0 01 to 1 2 mm year for those study regions table 4 and et estimations based on grace which were corrected by coal mining amounts are 346 29 mm year and 450 40 mm year respectively for the upper reaches and middle reaches which are similar to et obs smc which are 343 21 mm year and 451 25 mm year respectively for the yellow river basin grace derived et estimates are higher than et estimates based on in situ observations of Œ¥s there is large quantity of water diversion in the lower reaches where the statistical errors may add to the uncertainty the coal mining effects could increase et estimations derived from grace by less than 1 fig 9 shows the discrepancies between modeled natural et and actual et estimations derived from grace and in situ smc observations based on grace twsc data human induced et changes are 72 29 mm year 26 21 40 mm year 5 and 59 31 mm year 16 over the upper reaches middle reaches and the whole basin the uncertainty of human induced et change for the middle reaches is larger than the change whereas we still get robust results over the upper reaches and the whole basin for the et estimations based on in situ soil moisture observations human induced et changes are 69 21 mm year 25 22 25 mm year 5 and 41 23 mm year 11 according to the bulletin the mean annual water consumption is 41 mm year 32 mm year and 47 mm year over the upper reaches middle reaches and the yellow river basin which is comparable to grace and smc results for the entire yellow river basin but quite different over sub basins for the results by using et gldas1 the human influence is basically undetectable no matter over the entire basin or sub basins table 4 many previous studies argued that the uncertainty in grace twsc estimation might be a major reason for the failure of detecting anthropogenic fingerprint while here we showed that the natural et from lsms should also be used with caution because changes in et due to development cannot be detected when natural et is overestimated e g gldas1 models in this study 3 4 response of et to lucc et is sensible to the change of vegetation condition which affects interception infiltration and related hydrological process zeng et al 2018 grain for green project stimulates reforestation especially over the loess plateau and replanting tree is the main ecological restoration measure to improve vegetation condition liang et al 2015 which could enhance et xu et al 2018 afforestation of the loess plateau could significantly reduce runoff li et al 2016 and enhance et as a result of increased leaf interception and transpiration fig 10 a shows that annual lai increases especially over the middle reaches but the increasing trend is not significant over certain areas during 2003 2010 the average increasing trends of annual lai are 0 003 0 019 and 0 011 m2 m2 year 1 over the upper reaches middle reaches and the entire basin respectively which are significant p 0 05 except for the upper reaches reforestation increases rainfall interception and enhances et with more leaf area and more plant available water zhang et al 2001 fig 10b shows spatial distribution of the trend of annual et from vic with lai variations from 2003 to 2010 there is a general increase in et especially for the middle reaches which matches well with the pattern of lai trend where the increasing trends of annual et are 2 1 4 6 and 2 9 mm year 1 respectively for the upper reaches middle reaches and the whole basin and only the trend of et over the middle reaches is significant p 0 1 bai et al 2019 also found that et increased significantly with a trend of 3 45 mm year 1 over a sub basin located in the loess plateau due to vegetation greening with lai variations mean annual et simulations et vic dymlai are 276 432 and 363 mm year respectively over the upper reaches middle reaches and the yellow river basin which are higher than 274 429 and 360 mm year of et simulations without inter annual lai variations et vic table 4 in fig 11 blue lines are lai induced et changes Œ¥et lucc and green lines are lai values for the upper reaches middle reaches and the whole basin et changes induced by variant vegetation conditions are 2 mm year 3 mm year and 3 mm year for the upper reaches middle reaches and the whole basin which correlate well with lai fig 11 the contributions of lucc to the increase in annual et are all less than 1 the result demonstrates that water management accounts for the majority of anthropogenic et change instead of lucc during 2003 2010 however we only used a single model simulation of lucc s influence on et multi model ensemble simulations are needed to reduce the uncertainty and the simplify of dynamic vegetation parameterization would also increase the uncertainty 4 conclusions this study detected the anthropogenic influence on et based on multisource data analysis during 2003 2010 including et estimations from multiple reanalysis datasets simulation from a well calibrated land surface hydrological model i e vic in situ soil moisture and grace twsc measurements over the yellow river basin naturalized runoff data were used to verify the performances of basin averaged runoff and calibrated vic performed much better than era interim gldas1 and gldas2 reanalysis by using vic simulations to produce natural et and in situ soil moisture and grace twsc measurements to derive actual et the human influence was detected over the yellow river basin especially over the upper reaches nevertheless gldas1 overestimated natural et significantly resulting in an insignificant human impact which suggests that realistically simulating natural et is also critical for detecting human influences considering that the loess plateau is a major coal mining region the surface mass loss of coal transport was used to correct twsc from grace for the middle reaches average mass reduction is 1 2 mm year resulting in less than 1 increase in et actual et estimations are calculated through water budget method considering twsc from grace and in situ soil moisture and statistics from bulletins over the yellow river basin the human induced et change is 59 31 mm year based on grace measurements and the detections are a little larger than annual mean water consumption of 47 mm year reported by yellow river conservancy commission and the discrepancy is only 41 23 mm year based on in situ observations of twsc for the upper reaches and middle reaches the detections of human induced et changes are quite similar based on actual et estimations the human induced et changes range from 69 21 mm year to 72 29 mm year which are both higher than the water consumption of 41 mm year over the upper reaches the middle reaches are less irrigated than upper reaches and the anthropogenic influence on et is less significant which ranges from 21 40 mm year to 22 25 mm year the increases of et due to lucc are less than 1 of natural annual et during 2003 2010 for the yellow river basin so water managements including irrigation have larger contributions to the human induced et change with the increase of 11 16 however due to sparse observation network of et and data availability there is limited in situ observations of et to verify the actual et estimates based on grace another limitation of this study is that the assumption of a good naturalized runoff estimation indicating a good et estimation it is not necessarily valid as soil moisture is also key to et estimation but considering the small magnitude of soil moisture as compared with runoff in the water budget we would expect such limitation would not change the conclusion significantly for this study previous studies used to focus on verifying the simulation of actual hydrological processes under human disturbances by lsms and the performance of natural hydrological processes is ignored however the natural hydrological processes simulated by lsms are also key for quantifying anthropogenic influence on the hydrological cycle our study highlights the significance of reasonably modeling natural hydrological processes when separating

5986,estimation of human induced evapotranspiration et changes e g irrigation is critical for understanding terrestrial water and energy cycle in the anthropocene a few studies have detected human influence on et through comparing natural et from reanalysis models and actual et estimated by the water budget analysis with gravity recovery and climate experiment grace terrestrial water storage data however whether models can reasonably reproduce natural hydrological processes is overlooked here we show that uncertainty in model simulated natural et can determine whether the human induced et change is detectable the naturalized runoff provided by the yellow river conservancy commission is used to calibrate the variable infiltration capacity vic model to obtain a more reliable estimation of natural et the actual et is estimated by either using the grace satellite retrievals with coal mining induced gravity change removed or 192 soil moisture station observations combined with surface and ground water resources bulletin data over the yellow river basin by comparing with natural et from vic simulations human induced annual et changes are 41 23 to 59 31 mm year during 2003 2010 for grace and soil moisture based estimations respectively contributing to 11 16 increase in annual et over the yellow river basin the estimation is comparable to the bulletin data of 47 mm year there is an obvious overestimation in natural et from global land data assimilation system prohibiting the detection of anthropogenic influence this study highlights the importance of reasonably modeling natural hydrological processes as a baseline for detecting anthropogenic influence on the hydrological cycle keywords evapotranspiration human activity hydrological modeling water budget grace vic 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is not only affected by climate change but also human interventions including reservoir regulation irrigation and land use and land cover change lucc with rapid population growth and economic development both the water demand and water consumption are increasing resulting in a hydrological system that is closely intertwined with water management practices haddeland et al 2014 lobell and bonfils 2008 sterling et al 2012 irrigation accounts for most of the water consumption d”ßll and siebert 2002 shiklomanov and rodda 2003 and it changes the hydrological cycle through enhancing et baron et al 1998 gordon et al 2005 ozdogan et al 2010 moreover afforestation also alters the relationship between runoff and precipitation and enhancing et with improved vegetation conditions liang et al 2015 wang et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 human induced et change affects surface temperature and runoff as well as atmospheric circulation and precipitation through altering the water availability and the partitioning of turbulent energy fluxes baron et al 1998 gordon et al 2005 ozdogan et al 2010 tang et al 2007 wey et al 2015 therefore unraveling human influence on et is critical for understanding the changes in hydrological cycle especially over river basins that are heavily managed previous studies have used multiple methods including paired watershed experiments huang et al 2003 van loon et al 2019 physical hydrological modeling tang et al 2009 and time series analysis li et al 2016 to study the human interventions e g lucc irrigation on streamflow and et asokan and destouni 2014 jaramillo and destouni 2015 jaramillo et al 2018 some studies have separated the impacts of water managements on et magnitudes from natural variability through comparing model simulations with or without an irrigation scheme ozdogan et al 2010 sorooshian et al 2012 tang et al 2007 wey et al 2015 and demonstrated significant increase in et due to agricultural practices however human activities are difficult to parameterize in land surface models lsms hanasaki et al 2008a 2008b wada et al 2014 due to insufficient understanding of the physical processes and the lack of water use data et is also difficult to measure directly at regional scale due to sparse in situ observations and strong spatial heterogeneity with the launch of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite that measures the terrestrial water storage change twsc et can be estimated at river basin scale by using the water budget method with observations of precipitation and streamflow rodell et al 2004a sheffield et al 2009 pan et al 2012 the grace gravity fields have provided the observations of twsc which consist of the changes in soil moisture surface water storage and groundwater storage including natural variability and anthropogenic water storage changes scanlon et al 2016 syed et al 2008 wahr et al 2004 to detect the human influence et estimated by lsms representing natural processes was compared with grace derived et castle et al 2016 pan et al 2017 multiple modeled et products from global reanalysis were widely used in regional studies castle et al 2016 lv et al 2017 pan et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 for instance castle et al 2016 compared the grace derived et and the north american land data assimilation system nldas simulated et products natural et in the predevelopment stage and identified human induced et change during growing seasons over the colorado river basin in southwestern usa pan et al 2017 used similar method and compared the grace derived et and the et estimated by the global land data assimilation system version 1 gldas1 and found that human activities contributed to a 12 increase in annual et over the haihe river basin in northern china many studies implied that large uncertainty in grace twsc estimation may hinder the water budget analysis especially over semiarid river basins long et al 2014 lv et al 2017 as well as the detection of the human induced et change although several studies used natural streamflow to calibrate lsms before reservoir construction rangecroft et al 2019 most studies directly used model reanalysis data and neglected the performance of lsms in simulating the natural et due to the lack of observation for model validation a big assumption is that lsms like gldas and era interim dee et al 2011 without human components will reproduce the natural et reasonably so that the human induced et change can be estimated based on the difference between grace derived et and lsm simulated et however whether the uncertainty in lsm simulated natural et affects the detection of human intervention remains unclear in this study we used multisource data analysis to estimate human induced et change over the yellow river basin in northern china where hydrological processes are heavily changed by human activities including water managements and lucc naturalized runoff data are used to verify the performances of global reanalysis data that provide natural et estimations and are used to calibrate the variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 1996 land surface hydrological model for improving natural et estimations actual et is estimated through the water budget method based on observed precipitation and runoff and actual twsc estimations the twsc estimations are from either grace after being corrected by coal mining data or merged 192 in situ soil moisture observations and statistic data of surface and ground water resources from bulletins considering that the grain for green project has improved vegetation conditions especially for the loess plateau the lucc s influence on et is also investigated by performing vic simulations with static or dynamic land cover data 2 study area multisource data model and method 2 1 study area the yellow river is the second longest river in china with a length of 5 464 km originating from qinghai plateau and flowing through the loess plateau and huang huai hai great plain and finally into the bohai sea fig 1 the yellow river basin is located in arid semi arid and semi humid climates with the drainage area of 794 712 km2 and it is the homeland for 107 million people however the water resources are quite limited and the average streamflow of the yellow river basin is 58 billion m3 only accounting for 2 of the total streamflow of china to control flood and alleviate drought over 3000 reservoirs have been built in the yellow river basin with a total storage capacity of 57 4 billion m3 the yellow river basin is one of the most heavily regulated river basins in the world and it is also the main agricultural region in china including several major irrigation districts such as the hetao districts in the upper reaches the surface water accounts for 73 of the total water withdrawal over the yellow river basin which is mainly consumed by irrigation since 1999 the ecological restoration project has been implemented and gradually improved vegetation conditions especially over the middle reaches where large areas are converted from farmland to forest or grassland 2 2 data and method 2 2 1 in situ observations actual et was estimated by a water budget method based on precipitation p and runoff observations r obs and twsc Œ¥s observations yeh et al 1998 rodell et al 2004a at monthly and annual time scales 1 et obs p r obs Œ¥ s accurate precipitation observation is a crucial component in the water budget analysis here the 0 25 degree gridded precipitation observation dataset was interpolated from 324 china meteorological administration cma stations which was used to drive the vic model and to correct precipitation and runoff biases in global reanalysis for runoff there are 11 mainstream gauges shown in fig 1 naturalized and observed runoff datasets were provided by yellow river conservancy commission hekouzhen huayuankou and lijin gauges table 1 are the control stations for the upper and middle reaches and the whole river basin respectively and their observed runoff data were used to calculate actual et naturalized runoff at the target gauge was estimated by adding human water use data from irrigation industrial and civil sectors over the drainage area of the target gauge back to the observed runoff at the target gauge yuan et al 2017 the water use data were reported by the local authority and compiled by the yellow river conservancy commission the naturalized runoff was calculated as follows 2 r nat r obs r irr r res r idu r civ r div where r nat and r obs are the naturalized and observed runoff respectively r irr is the surface water used in irrigation by deducting the flow returned to river which represents the actual water consumption during the irrigation process r res is the regulated runoff through reservoirs with negative values indicating reservoirs release and positive values indicating reservoir filling and r idu and r civ are water consumed in industrial and civil sectors including water loss during transportation and the water consumption in industrial product and domestic sector after removing the discharge of wastewater r div is the interbasin water diversion and the negative and positive values indicate water transfer in or out of the selected drainage area respectively yuan et al 2017 the naturalized runoff can be considered as unaffected by lucc reservoir management etc here we used naturalized runoff to verity lsms performance in simulating natural hydrological processes fig 1 also shows the locations of the 192 soil moisture stations with measurements of the volumetric soil moisture at depths of 10 cm 20 cm 50 cm 70 cm and 100 cm yuan et al 2015 soil moisture changes were combined with annual statistic data including water diversion surface water and groundwater withdrawals obtained from the bulletin of the yellow river http www yellowriver gov cn to calculate the twsc at annual time scale and table 2 lists the annual surface water storage change mainly from reservoir storage change and the groundwater storage change during 2003 2010 according to the bulletins this dataset is referred to as smc in this study according to the bulletins there is hardly any inter basin water transfer for the upper and middle reaches but there is 13 mm year water transfer for the entire yellow river basin with most of them occurring over the downstream areas in addition et datasets of two agricultural stations ansai and changwu from the chinese national ecosystem research network cnern located in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin fig 1 table 1 were used for et comparison 2 2 2 remote sensing data grace was launched in march 2002 and the terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa datasets were released from three research centers including the center for space research csr at the university of texas at austin jet propulsion laboratory jpl at the california institute of technology and the german research center for geoscience gfz using mascon mass concentration and spherical harmonic solutions mascons mas have advantages than traditional method of spherical harmonic solutions sh in reducing uncertainties especially for smaller regions scanlon et al 2016 watkins et al 2015 here we used six sets of twsa from different sources including r05 csr r05 jpl and r06 jpl using mascon solution and r05 csr r05 jpl and r05 gfz using spherical harmonic solution monthly twsc was calculated as the difference between monthly twsat and twsat 1 twsct twsat twsat 1 twsc from grace reflects not only the natural variability but also the anthropogenic impacts e g groundwater exploitation reservoir impoundment inter basin water diversion rodell et al 2018 the coal mining data from china statistical yearbooks provided by national bureau of statics of china tang et al 2013 were used in this study to investigate the impacts of coal mining on grace twsc estimation the net coal mass changes were transformed to equivalent water in thickness the study period is 2003 to 2010 considering the starting year of grace data and the ending year of observed and naturalized runoff besides water managements et is also enhanced due to vegetation greening at regional scales leaf area index lai is a key parameter that determines the partition of canopy intercepted precipitation and the precipitation that reaches the ground surface to investigate the response of et to lucc we replaced the default lai in vic with global land surface satellite lai derived from modis glass modis and conducted two simulations from 2003 to 2010 with or without interannual variations of lai where the lai in the latter experiment was fixed the same as that in 2003 glass modis lai was derived from modis lai through a general regression neural networks approach xiao et al 2016 with a spatial resolution of 0 05 degree spanned from 2001 to 2017 http www geodata cn 2 2 3 global reanalysis data and vic simulation the natural et products as well as natural runoff and precipitation from various global reanalysis products including the era interim dee et al 2011 era interim land balsamo et al 2015 gldas1 gldas2 rodell et al 2004b were also used in this study here et runoff and precipitation datasets from era interim and era interim land are at 12 hourly and daily time step respectively with 0 25 degree spatial resolution gldas1 consists of four lsms i e noah ek 2003 mosaic koster and suarez 1994 1996 variable infiltration capacity liang et al 1994 community land model clm dai et al 2003 and we used 1 degree monthly et runoff and precipitation from above four models the ensemble mean estimates from four gldas1 models were used in this study to keep consistency all gldas1 products were interpolated into 0 25 degree using bilinear interpolation gldas v2 0 monthly products are from noah at 0 25 degree spatial resolution runoff and et data from global reanalysis were corrected by the ratios of cma precipitation mentioned in section 2 2 1 to the precipitation of global reanalysis to reduce the systematical errors we also calibrated vic model against naturalized runoff to simulate the natural hydrological processes vic is a semi distributed grid based land surface hydrological model and it has been widely used in simulating the natural hydrology tang et al 2009 xie et al 2007 the inputs of the vic model include precipitation 10 m wind speed and maximum and minimum surface air temperature as well as soil data and vegetation data the outputs of the vic model include soil moisture at three layers surface runoff baseflow evapotranspiration etc yuan et al 2016 the naturalized runoff datasets at 11 mainstream gauges fig 1 were used to calibrate the soil parameters of the vic model at 0 25 degree resolution with satellite based monthly lai in 2003 by using the same method as yuan et al 2016 the naturalized runoff at 11 hydrological gauges divided by basin averaged cma precipitation was used to calculate the runoff rainfall ratios and the gridded runoff time series were then obtained through multiplying the gridded cma rainfall time series with the runoff rainfall ratios the yellow river is divided into 11 sub basin areas between the target gauge and the adjacent upstream gauge from tangnaihai gauge to lijin gauge fig 1 the gridded naturalized runoff time series were used to calculate the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse with vic simulated runoff the parameters of the vic model were optimized through the shuffled complex evolution algorithm sce duan et al 1994 with the aim of maximizing nse value the automatic calibration was carried out by running the vic model during 2003 2010 thousands of times over each 0 25 degree grid cell within the yellow river basin through calibration of the vic model with naturalized runoff it is expected that it can simulate the natural et and water storage reasonably during 2003 2010 2 2 4 methods for detection and uncertainty estimation here we focused on anthropogenic influences on et including reservoir regulation irrigation and lucc the discrepancy between natural et and observed et is considered as human induced et change 3 Œ¥ et et obs et nat model where Œ¥ e t is considered as human induced et change et obs is the actual et estimate and et nat model is the natural et estimated by lsms as shown in fig 2 the naturalized runoff is used to evaluate the performance of global reanalysis data and the vic simulation and the model with the highest runoff nse was selected to provide natural et estimates et nat model as for the actual et et obs we used cma precipitation which is the same as climate forcing in vic simulation twsc derived from grace and in situ observations and observed runoff to calculate the residual in water budget as actual et estimates et obs fig 2 the uncertainties of actual et estimates through the water budget method come from the errors of precipitation runoff and twsc assuming that the errors of p r obs and Œ¥s are independent and are normally distributed rodell et al 2004a the uncertainty of et can be estimated as 4 Œº et 2 Œº p 2 Œº r o b s 2 Œº Œ¥ s 2 where Œº is the uncertainty here uncertainty in precipitation and runoff was specified as 5 dingman 2001 and the value of 30 was chosen in the smc from soil moisture stations twsc is the difference between twsat and twsat 1 and thus the uncertainty is the error of twsa multiplying 2 which consists of measurement errors wahr et al 2006 leakage errors as residual errors after filtering landerer and swenson 2012 and the standard deviation among multiple twsa datasets Œº twsa Œº meas 2 Œº leak 2 Œº std 2 to simplify the calculation of the retrieval error of grace we selected the gridded leakage error and measurement error associated with the twsa of spherical harmonic solution which are supposed to be larger than those of mascon solution https grace jpl nasa gov data get data the region scaled uncertainties considering the total leakage and measurement errors of twsa were derived from the gridded errors they are 13 19 and 13 mm respectively for the upper reaches middle reaches and the whole basin the errors of the mean monthly annual et estimates were the squared mean errors of each month year according to error propagation annual Œ¥s is calculated based on twsa in december in consecutive two years so the uncertainties of Œ¥s at annual scale are mainly from measurement errors and leakage errors of two twsas which are not accumulated from monthly to annual time scale 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of global reanalysis data precipitation is the most important input for lsms and the accuracy of precipitation determines the simulations of runoff and et liu et al 2016 nearing et al 2016 we compared different sources of precipitation used in lsms with in situ cma observation fig 3 gldas1 and era interim land precipitation datasets agree well with the in situ observation of precipitations r 0 99 and their root mean square error rmse values 4 7 mm are smaller than those of gldas2 and era interim 13 24 mm in terms of seasonal cycle of precipitation gldas1 is closer to in situ precipitation figs 3d f fig 4 shows the basin averaged runoff from global reanalysis vic simulation and naturalized runoff the naturalized runoff was regarded as the reference to verify the performances of reanalysis and the vic model given that they do not have irrigation and reservoir modules before evaluation the runoff from global reanalysis were adjusted by using the ratio of cma precipitation to reanalysis precipitation the nse values between basin averaged naturalized runoff and those from reanalysis or vic simulation were listed in table 3 the vic model s nse values are 0 66 0 69 and 0 72 over the upper reaches middle reaches and the whole basin among the reanalysis runoff datasets corrected by in situ precipitation the nse values for era interim land are 0 6 0 34 and 0 67 for its upper and middle reaches and the yellow river basin which are much better than those for era interim gldas1 and gldas2 where most nse values are negative table 3 the better performance of era interim land compared with era interim for the runoff simulation resulted from the improvements in land surface parameterizations e g soil hydrology snow scheme and adjusted precipitation balsamo et al 2015 which contributes to reducing the overestimation of runoff figs 4d 4f gldas1 2 which were widely used for detecting human induced et change have deficiency in reproducing the natural et over the yellow river basin because they have poor performance in reproducing naturalized runoff therefore we used the results from vic to estimate natural et et vic for the mainstream of the yellow river basin and the upper reaches and the middle reaches 3 2 grace twsc and coal mining impacts fig 5 shows the monthly twsc derived from multiple grace products and there are great divergences at monthly time series among different sources as a part of uncertainty of twsc the ensemble mean of grace products derived from different methods sh and mas and different versions was used in calculating et in water budget equation in order to reduce the uncertainty of twsc the increase in terrestrial water storage is mainly concentrated during summer figs 5d f consistent with seasonal variations of precipitation there is also an obvious increase of terrestrial water storage for march and this may relate to snow melt over the tibet plateau the average seasonal amplitudes of twsc range from 8 to 14 mm for yellow river basin 9 to 12 mm for the upper reaches and 10 to 16 mm for the middle reaches during 2003 2010 given that the yellow river basin is a water limited basin the amplitudes of terrestrial water storage are relatively small ni et al 2014 there are increasing quantities of coal mining causing mass loss affecting grace data tang et al 2013 and we removed the effects of coal mining on grace twsc estimation at annual scale fig 6 shows the net city level mass change of coal mining equivalent to water depth which was calculated the difference between imported and exported amounts of coal mining coal mining areas mainly concentrate in shanxi inner mongolia and shaanxi province and coal mining has significant influence especially over the middle reaches causing mass loss ranging from 0 6 to 2 mm year coal mining had little influence over the upper reaches but caused mean annual mass reduction of 1 2 mm year for the middle reaches and 0 6 mm year for the whole basin these surface mass changes were removed from grace based actual et 3 3 detection of human induced et change fig 7 shows the natural monthly et estimates from vic simulations et vic blue lines and actual et estimates based on grace et obs grace red lines by using the water budget method the pink shades are the uncertainties of grace derived et estimates based on eq 4 for the middle reaches et of two agricultural stations fig 7b was used to verify the et estimations derived from grace due to limited in situ observations although they cannot well represent the spatial variability of et et obs grace correlates well with et ansai and et changwu with correlation coefficients of 0 74 and 0 54 p 0 05 here et vic is regarded as natural et estimation ignoring human interventions including water managements and lucc while et obs grace is actual et estimated by the water budget method with multisource data besides water managements including irrigation would enhance et through increasing crop transpiration and soil moisture evaporation so actual et should always be larger than natural et in this regard over the yellow river basin compared with et vic et obs grace is higher during warm seasons over the upper reaches and the whole basin which are consistent with irrigation period fig 7d irrigation consumes most of the water withdrawals according to the bulletin of yellow river water resources and some major agricultural regions like hetao irrigation district locate inside the basin however there may be underestimation in actual et for the middle reaches due to large uncertainty from grace twsc the discrepancies between monthly natural et and actual et are not quite robust as they are smaller than the uncertainty of et estimations besides annual cycle fig 8 presents the interannual variations of annual et estimations from vic and actual et estimates based on grace and in situ observations over the yellow river basin et estimation derived from grace is 419 31 mm year after being removed coal mining effects whereas the actual annual mean et estimation is 401 23 mm year based on in situ soil moisture and other statistic data table 4 coal mining caused mean annual mass loss ranging from 0 01 to 1 2 mm year for those study regions table 4 and et estimations based on grace which were corrected by coal mining amounts are 346 29 mm year and 450 40 mm year respectively for the upper reaches and middle reaches which are similar to et obs smc which are 343 21 mm year and 451 25 mm year respectively for the yellow river basin grace derived et estimates are higher than et estimates based on in situ observations of Œ¥s there is large quantity of water diversion in the lower reaches where the statistical errors may add to the uncertainty the coal mining effects could increase et estimations derived from grace by less than 1 fig 9 shows the discrepancies between modeled natural et and actual et estimations derived from grace and in situ smc observations based on grace twsc data human induced et changes are 72 29 mm year 26 21 40 mm year 5 and 59 31 mm year 16 over the upper reaches middle reaches and the whole basin the uncertainty of human induced et change for the middle reaches is larger than the change whereas we still get robust results over the upper reaches and the whole basin for the et estimations based on in situ soil moisture observations human induced et changes are 69 21 mm year 25 22 25 mm year 5 and 41 23 mm year 11 according to the bulletin the mean annual water consumption is 41 mm year 32 mm year and 47 mm year over the upper reaches middle reaches and the yellow river basin which is comparable to grace and smc results for the entire yellow river basin but quite different over sub basins for the results by using et gldas1 the human influence is basically undetectable no matter over the entire basin or sub basins table 4 many previous studies argued that the uncertainty in grace twsc estimation might be a major reason for the failure of detecting anthropogenic fingerprint while here we showed that the natural et from lsms should also be used with caution because changes in et due to development cannot be detected when natural et is overestimated e g gldas1 models in this study 3 4 response of et to lucc et is sensible to the change of vegetation condition which affects interception infiltration and related hydrological process zeng et al 2018 grain for green project stimulates reforestation especially over the loess plateau and replanting tree is the main ecological restoration measure to improve vegetation condition liang et al 2015 which could enhance et xu et al 2018 afforestation of the loess plateau could significantly reduce runoff li et al 2016 and enhance et as a result of increased leaf interception and transpiration fig 10 a shows that annual lai increases especially over the middle reaches but the increasing trend is not significant over certain areas during 2003 2010 the average increasing trends of annual lai are 0 003 0 019 and 0 011 m2 m2 year 1 over the upper reaches middle reaches and the entire basin respectively which are significant p 0 05 except for the upper reaches reforestation increases rainfall interception and enhances et with more leaf area and more plant available water zhang et al 2001 fig 10b shows spatial distribution of the trend of annual et from vic with lai variations from 2003 to 2010 there is a general increase in et especially for the middle reaches which matches well with the pattern of lai trend where the increasing trends of annual et are 2 1 4 6 and 2 9 mm year 1 respectively for the upper reaches middle reaches and the whole basin and only the trend of et over the middle reaches is significant p 0 1 bai et al 2019 also found that et increased significantly with a trend of 3 45 mm year 1 over a sub basin located in the loess plateau due to vegetation greening with lai variations mean annual et simulations et vic dymlai are 276 432 and 363 mm year respectively over the upper reaches middle reaches and the yellow river basin which are higher than 274 429 and 360 mm year of et simulations without inter annual lai variations et vic table 4 in fig 11 blue lines are lai induced et changes Œ¥et lucc and green lines are lai values for the upper reaches middle reaches and the whole basin et changes induced by variant vegetation conditions are 2 mm year 3 mm year and 3 mm year for the upper reaches middle reaches and the whole basin which correlate well with lai fig 11 the contributions of lucc to the increase in annual et are all less than 1 the result demonstrates that water management accounts for the majority of anthropogenic et change instead of lucc during 2003 2010 however we only used a single model simulation of lucc s influence on et multi model ensemble simulations are needed to reduce the uncertainty and the simplify of dynamic vegetation parameterization would also increase the uncertainty 4 conclusions this study detected the anthropogenic influence on et based on multisource data analysis during 2003 2010 including et estimations from multiple reanalysis datasets simulation from a well calibrated land surface hydrological model i e vic in situ soil moisture and grace twsc measurements over the yellow river basin naturalized runoff data were used to verify the performances of basin averaged runoff and calibrated vic performed much better than era interim gldas1 and gldas2 reanalysis by using vic simulations to produce natural et and in situ soil moisture and grace twsc measurements to derive actual et the human influence was detected over the yellow river basin especially over the upper reaches nevertheless gldas1 overestimated natural et significantly resulting in an insignificant human impact which suggests that realistically simulating natural et is also critical for detecting human influences considering that the loess plateau is a major coal mining region the surface mass loss of coal transport was used to correct twsc from grace for the middle reaches average mass reduction is 1 2 mm year resulting in less than 1 increase in et actual et estimations are calculated through water budget method considering twsc from grace and in situ soil moisture and statistics from bulletins over the yellow river basin the human induced et change is 59 31 mm year based on grace measurements and the detections are a little larger than annual mean water consumption of 47 mm year reported by yellow river conservancy commission and the discrepancy is only 41 23 mm year based on in situ observations of twsc for the upper reaches and middle reaches the detections of human induced et changes are quite similar based on actual et estimations the human induced et changes range from 69 21 mm year to 72 29 mm year which are both higher than the water consumption of 41 mm year over the upper reaches the middle reaches are less irrigated than upper reaches and the anthropogenic influence on et is less significant which ranges from 21 40 mm year to 22 25 mm year the increases of et due to lucc are less than 1 of natural annual et during 2003 2010 for the yellow river basin so water managements including irrigation have larger contributions to the human induced et change with the increase of 11 16 however due to sparse observation network of et and data availability there is limited in situ observations of et to verify the actual et estimates based on grace another limitation of this study is that the assumption of a good naturalized runoff estimation indicating a good et estimation it is not necessarily valid as soil moisture is also key to et estimation but considering the small magnitude of soil moisture as compared with runoff in the water budget we would expect such limitation would not change the conclusion significantly for this study previous studies used to focus on verifying the simulation of actual hydrological processes under human disturbances by lsms and the performance of natural hydrological processes is ignored however the natural hydrological processes simulated by lsms are also key for quantifying anthropogenic influence on the hydrological cycle our study highlights the significance of reasonably modeling natural hydrological processes when separating anthropogenic influence from natural variability the performances of reanalysis are not satisfying due to the limited observations nearing et al 2016 and global parameterization error over semi arid regions in addition soil moisture dynamic is not well captured by land surface models in the reanalysis over the yellow river basin lou et al 2018 when detecting the anthropogenic influence on hydrological cycle the modeling natural hydrological process should also be highlighted to reduce the uncertainty of the detection we also provided evidence that water managements significantly increased et as compared with lucc which can be captured by grace with more extensive human interventions in the hydrological process it is necessary to accurately describe human activities e g irrigation reservoir impoundment land use change in high resolution land surface models wada et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 irrigation consumes most of water withdrawal but the water use efficiency is

5987,participatory methods to support successful policy decisions regarding the complex and dynamic interactions of social ecological and physical processes involved in flooding must be simple easy to use and cost efficient accordingly a stepwise methodological framework based on causal loop diagrams clds was developed to address the challenge of context sensitive initialization of key stakeholders in the collaborative flood risk management process the methodology consists of five main stages i problem definition ii stakeholder analysis and identification of key groups iii interviews with key stakeholders to construct individual clds iv merging of individual clds to form a holistic qualitative model representing the entire system and v implementation of an order oriented reduction process to simplify the final merged cld thereby increasing understanding of the most important processes and feedbacks the proposed approach for flood risk management was tested in a coastal area of southern italy a region historically affected by flood events given its simplicity the proposed method was seen as a valuable tool to elicit and map mental models especially when working with stakeholders who did not have prior modeling experience i e farmers agricultural companies tourist complexes and infrastructure authorities indeed all stakeholders in the current study were able to understand the process and proposed different flood risk management policies such as land use changes management of damage insurance payouts floodplain activities and improvement of public awareness the proposed methodology overcame multiple barriers in initializing stakeholder engagement including the technical focus of most flood management agencies the additional cost and time requirements for stakeholder involvement as well as institutional structures that impede collaborative management moreover the results point to socio economic aspects of flood risk management that have not been considered in previous modeling studies keywords causal loop diagram flood risk management system dynamics participatory modeling stakeholder engagement decision making 1 introduction floods are the most frequently occurring and costliest natural hazard throughout the world killing more than 25 000 affecting 520 million people and leaving 3 2 million homeless every year simonovic 2009 european countries are no exception between 1990 and 2008the european environment agency estimated that 213 european flood events affected more than 3 million people and caused 1126 fatalities along with at least us 52 billion in losses in the same period salvati et al 2010 reported 2321 flood events in italy that led to approximately 1407 deaths and 2 8 million injuries human activities e g waterway modification catchment deforestation and floodplain development undertaken in natural environments may lead to adverse environmental effects e g blockage of waterways to address the multiple consequences of flooding caused by human environment interactions sustainable stakeholder proposed management policies must be developed with a holistic understanding of the complex social economic environmental context misleading or fragmented decisions regarding structural and non structural interventions can affect flood risk in up or down stream communities in ways that are difficult to predict or even demonstrate following a flood event thaler et al 2015 flood risk is exacerbated by population growth and urban development in vulnerable areas nicholls 2008 and therefore such societal changes must be considered in efforts to improve the sustainability and resilience of risk based flood management practices e g hall et al 2003 hooijer et al 2004 resilience based approaches require an understanding of the complexity and interconnections of a system for example how a disruption to one system component can affect various others over time linkov and trump 2019 many flood risk assessment tools of different levels of complexity are available to quantify albeit with uncertainty current risk and its evolution albano et al 2017a de moel et al 2012 merz et al 2009 penning rowsell et al 2005 risk quantification can also be achieved by estimating flood damages and completing uncertainty assessments in the context of flood risk management studies jongman et al 2012 amadio et al 2016 morales torres et al 2016 albano et al 2017b 2018 while methods used to estimate the loss of life incurred during flooding events have been extensively investigated and reviewed escuder bueno et al 2012 jonkman et al 2016 few studies have examined the development of methods for the integration of stakeholder knowledge into the identification of local flood risk management options maskrey et al 2016 stakeholder participation is important for successful policy decisions e g saadat et al 2011 halbe et al 2014 medema et al 2014 inam et al 2017a 2017b 2017c risk management strategies may fail in the absence of a participatory approach nutt 2002 for example nutt 2002 highlights that a premature commitment to a specific solution and a lack of attention to multiple stakeholder requirements can lead to the increased probability of erroneous decision making moreover flood management policy has a more direct impact on stakeholders than policies in many other environmental fields floods pose a direct threat to property economic activity and human life challies et al 2016 accordingly the engagement of stakeholders in socio economic environmental modeling processes is key to the development of a holistic qualitative model adopting for example a system dynamics modeling approach that is capable of considering all socio economic components and ensuring that all issues and relevant policy opinions have been addressed as shown in inam et al 2015 that used causal loop diagrams cld as a useful way of capturing the views and ideas of stakeholders within a model structure having analyzed the principal causes of decision making process failures and methods of avoiding bad practices nutt 2002 concluded that roughly half of policy decisions failed to achieve meaningful results because the knowledge and interests of key stakeholders were excluded these challenges suggest that a flexible approach is needed to address the right problem at the right scale and scope and present the correct system response winz et al 2009 an effective approach must be simple intuitive able to support the understanding of complex problems and allow for improvements in the decision making process the three main objectives of the present study are to i propose a simple and detailed approach to identify stakeholders and involve them in the decision making process for flood risk management ii use qualitative causal loop diagrams clds to incorporate stakeholder viewpoints and preferred stakeholder policy options through participatory model building and iii explore the application of the proposed approach on the ionian sea coast crossed by the bradano river in the basilicata region of italy existing studies have identified the importance of stakeholder input and explored this in various ways in addition system dynamics sd models have been used to address other flood related problems see section 1 1 however the current study represents the first time that a methodology based on the use of qualitative models of stakeholders mental maps has been applied in flood risk management clds were chosen for the current analysis as they provide a flexible qualitative modeling process and allow for the inclusion of both socio economic and environmental variables supporting the exploration of the dynamic linkages among variables from both domains videira et al 2009 beyond capturing stakeholder viewpoints and their preferred management options clds provide a holistic picture of the complete system by representing the interactions between different variables and aiding in the understanding of feedbacks between different system components holistic models developed by merging individual stakeholder built clds are quite complex inam et al 2015 and might limit the stakeholders role in later modeling stages any barrier to stakeholder engagement during the participatory modeling process can lead to bias in the final model inam et al 2015 the approach presented in the current study overcomes these limitations by proposing a methodology that reduces the complexity of the final merged cld rendering it more comprehensible for all types of stakeholders including those with limited modeling and technical skills this study offers an important contribution to risk management decision making research through demonstrating how stakeholders with limited technical skills financial resources and time can be involved in flood risk management ultimately improving knowledge and the decision making process other practical benefits include but are not limited to introducing alternative ethical perspectives in decision making problem definition and sustainable management solutions broadening the range of potential solutions spreading the responsibilities and risks associated with management actions and encouraging more balanced decision making parson 2000 smith and mcdonough 2001 sinclair et al 2003 1 1 background many proponents and practitioners of participatory approaches e g carmona et al 2013 voinov 2017 have highlighted the benefits of stakeholder involvement in modeling and decision making processes several recent studies have analyzed different aspects of participatory flood risk management for example thaler and levin keitel 2016 conducted a study in england exploring the relationship between national and local stakeholders by using a heuristic analytical framework edelenbos et al 2017 investigated the role and impact of stakeholder initiatives in flood risk management by comparing case studies to find contextual and situational similarities and differences to explain how stakeholder initiatives influence governmental policy such approaches however have not provided a detailed framework with which to identify and subsequently involve stakeholders such a framework is very important to solving the problems under investigation using a participatory approach based on group meetings kotir et al 2017 assessed water resource management and sustainable agricultural development approaches implemented along the volta river in west africa using bayesian networks maskrey et al 2016 similarly implemented a participatory approach to find intervention options for managing flood risk in hebden bridge u k in both cases however the researchers failed to capture in a simple quick and understandable manner stakeholders mutually uninfluenced opinions related to the specific problem instead they employed mediated modeling in which key stakeholders worked together in model building this approach can increase the probability of incurring conflicts of interest by stakeholders that may hinder the success of the application halbe et al 2018 in individual interviews on the other hand there is the risk of eliciting uninformed opinions which must be taken into account in the modeling process moreover the application of bayesian networks in the aforementioned study was inherently acyclic and thus unable to handle the system s feedback structure molina et al 2010 local stakeholder input in environment and development related decisions is supported at international and european levels e g 2007 60 ec article 10 in particular the importance of stakeholder involvement in flood risk management has been emphasized in policy and practice in the eu us and elsewhere wood et al 2012 tingsanchali 2012 begg et al 2018 tingsanchali 2012 explored the effects of integrated urban flood risk management in thailand and suggested that the involvement of stakeholder knowledge from different perspectives enables a coherent understanding of flood risks therefore improving the outcome of decision making processes the paper highlighted that the involvement of local stakeholders allowed for the identification and implementation of more effective and sustainable flood management measures that are supported by the majority of stakeholders begg et al 2018 discussed two practical examples in europe i e the uk and germany of local stakeholder participation in flood defense related decisions wood et al 2012 illustrated the development of an integrated approach to flood preparedness planning that harmonizes stakeholder and agency efforts in the us these studies demonstrate the efforts of the research community and flood risk authorities to improve current levels of stakeholder participation in flood risk management suggesting a trend towards greater openness and inclusion of stakeholders despite an emphasis on local stakeholder participation the actual stakeholder participation and influence is limited in practice either because participation often takes place at the end of the planning process or because the participation processes are mainly based on a preexisting decision making structure mainly based on economic criteria furthermore stakeholder involvement is often limited due to high time and resource costs low potential for stakeholders to significantly influence their role the outcome or the starting point of the decision making process may lead to frustration and conflict as well as increased inequality the development of a model framework for a cost efficient stakeholder involvement in flood risk management policies will address previous approaches lack of institutional support clear and effective guidelines communication information sharing and resources especially regarding large stakeholder participation processes thaler and priest 2014 research shows that stakeholder engagement at a late stage adversely affects their willingness to be involved in the participatory process as they often believe the decision making process has already been completed reed 2008 based on clds videira et al 2009 the present modeling approach is centered around addressing issues that can adversely affect the decision making process including a lack of clarity in the objectives and transparency in the engagement process biased policies that lead to hasty decisions poor relationships between stakeholders and an unequal degree of power or level of stakeholder influence currently several approaches exist to involve stakeholders in participatory modeling wood et al 2012 begg et al 2018 normally stakeholders are brought into the process through group meetings or interviews in predefined forms mayer et al 2017 such engagement may result in biased models due to the presence of group pressure maskrey et al 2016 accordingly for any participatory process to be successful these factors should be well defined from the outset cornell 2006 reed 2008 in practice the participatory modeling process is facilitated through the use of different types of analytical and system tools the most common and frequently used tools include sd bayesian belief networks fuzzy cognitive mapping and agent based modeling voinov 2017 the main advantage of sd modeling approaches is that they offer a powerful method for explicitly incorporating both social and physical processes into dynamic models thereby capturing important feedbacks and connections between two types of system variables socio economic and environmental that may lead to counterintuitive system behavior sterman 2000 halbe and adamowski 2011 the proposed study focuses on sd approaches because they provide room for local and expert knowledge in the analysis of environmental issues sd has a long history as a modeling paradigm with its origins in the work of forrester 1989 who developed the subject to provide an understanding of strategic problems in complex dynamic systems by providing insight into feedback processes sd models provide system users with a better understanding of dynamic system behaviors areas of sd application have always been broad with an emphasis on socio economic applications sd models have been successfully used for water resources planning and management policy analysis sustainable development and natural resource management ahmad and simonovic 2011 chen and wei 2014 hassanzadeh et al 2012 kotir et al 2017 solana guti√©rrez et al 2017 tehrani et al 2011 zare et al 2019 in particular participatory sd modeling has become increasingly popular and effective as it integrates the benefits of sd modeling and stakeholder involvement participatory sd models are initially constructed using qualitative information gathering techniques such as surveys questionnaires group model building exercises or story telling the results of a participatory model building effort include the improved understanding of i cross variable interactions ii study system complexity iii stakeholder dynamics and socio cultural norms iv management limitations and v potential authoritative hierarchies the benefits of performing a participatory sd modeling assessment can be physical environmental social or economic for example pagano et al 2019 proposed a participatory sd modeling approach for flood risk reduction with the additional goal of producing stakeholder friendly livelihood benefits such as nature conservation and improved community well being participatory sd modeling has also been used for industrialized pastoral farming puig et al 2011 integrated coastal zone management mongruel et al 2011 and interdisciplinary water systems management sunsnik et al 2012 although participatory sd modeling is a useful and effective approach for incorporating stakeholder knowledge into the model building process it is still a relatively new modeling technique and thus has some limitations many participatory sd models are characterized by varying degrees of uncertainty involving model assumptions lack of reliable and consistent household panel data lack of spatial information or the absence of a robust evaluation for selected coping and improvement strategies furthermore by making the interconnectedness of a modeled environment more explicit there is a risk of igniting or exacerbating resource or land use conflicts among beneficiaries voinov and bousquet 2010 despite these apparent limitations participatory sd modeling is a valuable tool that allows for improved understanding of a study system increased involvement of local ideals and knowledge and enhanced decision making different sd techniques including clds influence diagrams fuzzy cognitive maps and system archetypes can be used to formulate and represent a dynamic hypothesis elsawah et al 2017 mirchi et al 2012 as simple and commonly used diagramming tools clds are generally employed at the beginning of socio economic environmental modeling exercises to develop a preliminary dynamic hypothesis inam et al 2015 system archetypes are high level conceptualizations that provide insights about common patterns of behavior in systems wolstenholme 2003 these insights can be transferred across various problem situations and domains gohari et al 2013 in contrast influence diagrams represent a decision situation achieved through the generalization of bayesian networks providing a more explicit and rigorous graphical representation of the causal structure than clds as an alternative fuzzy cognitive maps a semi quantitative diagramming tool that represents a belief system about the problem s causal structure allow one to portray the relative strength of inter variable links kok 2009 however influence diagrams have a lot of conventions and rules making them time consuming to master while the output of fuzzy cognitive mapping can be difficult to explain to non modelers van delden et al 2008 furthermore influence diagrams are difficult to examine from different perspectives increasing the risk of force fitting the problem situation system to an archetype gohari et al 2013 according to elsawah et al 2017 this risk is exacerbated if the modeler is inexperienced corben 1994 comparatively clds provide an aggregate view of the problem structure maintaining focus on feedback loops instead of unnecessary details in addition clds are relatively intuitive and easy to explain to non modelers sedlacko et al 2014 2 case study crossing southern italy s basilicata region from the northwest to the southeast and ending in the gulf of taranto in the ionian sea the 170 km bradano river extends over a total surface area of 2960 km2 at an average elevation amsl of 387 m the western and southwestern portions of its basin are mountainous with elevations ranging between 700 and 1250 m while the southern downstream portion addressed in the present study does not exceed 500 m in elevation i e the metaponto plain the river s hydrographic network is ramified with its main tributaries entering from the northeast side of the main river course the bradano river basin has three main sections i a top section upstream from the san giuliano dam ii a middle section downstream from the dam but upstream from route ss 106 and iii a bottom section which is the flattest area of the river flowing into the ionian sea see the left portion of fig 1 during recent flood events the greatest damage to agribusinesses farms and tourist complexes were recorded downstream from the san giuliano dam during the latest flood event the main road ss 106 and railway were closed to traffic for several days three critical issues have been identified by simulating a flood event with a 30 year return period see fig 1 1 in the fluvial reaches upstream from route ss 106 the northeast hydraulic bank is not sufficient to retain a 30 year flood which can then extend for about 2 km to the northeast reaching ground areas located downstream 2 in the fluvial reaches between route ss 106 and the railway embankment water in a 30 year flood event at depths exceeding 1 m would be mainly concentrated in a narrow strip of land upstream from the railway while the rest of the flooded area would be under less than 1 m of water 3 downstream from the railway embankment banks on both sides of the riverbed are insufficient to retain a 30 year flood event moreover underpasses favor the outflow of floodwaters from upstream to downstream of the railway this portion of the ionian coast known as the metaponto plain is subject to critical hydraulic conditions due to a network of drainage channels designed to collect and convey waters into other areas these channels managed by the region s land reclamation consortia provide the only artificial drainage for surface water and or outcrops in the area finally in the downstream section near the sea there are protected areas associated with the archaeological remains of early settlements dating back to the archaic period historically the bradano basin has been affected by flooding events e g recently in october 2010 march 2011 and december 2013 that cover large areas and damage infrastructure productive activities agriculture and tourism and archaeological heritage sites scarpino et al 2018 in the 2011 flood all rivers in the basilicata region the agri sinni basento cavone and bradano flooded requiring the evacuation of 200 families from the city of matera and leading to the destruction of hundreds of hectares of crops the closure of farms and zoo technical enterprises and the death of hundreds of livestock the southeastern portion of the region was the most severely affected the 2013 flood in matera province occurred following a pair of meteorological events which occurred two days apart october 5 and 7 2013 and resulted in total precipitation of 186 mm table 1 this flood which affected the entire coast caused serious and widespread damage and killed four people the bradano river and its tributaries showed extensive flooding with floodwaters overtopping bridges across the riverbed the railway line was interrupted and extensive damage to agriculture and housing infrastructure was recorded the archaeological park near the river s outlet was submerged by water that had overflowed from adjacent drainage channels the hydro meteorological event that occurred during december 2013 between november 30 2013 and december 3 2013 mostly affected the southeastern part of the basilicata region this event was particularly intense due to the rainfall s high intensity the gauge stations in the area registered cumulative rainfall over 150 mm manfreda et al 2015 the rainfall gauge station in metaponto town exceeded 200 mm the flooding of the bradano and basento rivers and the overflow of the reclamation channels caused the interruption of several provincial roads and highway ss 106 moreover the flooding impacted the inhabited centers of policoro and mataponto as well as the archaeological park and agriculture activities manfreda et al 2015 fig 2 shows the flood hydrograph of the december 2013 flood at about 800 m3 s 1 the recorded peak discharge was less than the discharge calculated 1736 53 m3 s 1 for a 30 year return period the discharge expected for a 30 year flood event causes an extension of the flood prone area as shown in fig 1 which demonstrates that the current hydraulic structures along the watercourse are insufficient to contain water flow with a return period of fewer than 30 years table 1 shows the cumulative precipitation values recorded during the three recent flood events these recent flood events along with pressure from local media and farmers regarding the potential role of the dam in flood consequences have led the basilicata watershed authority to adopt a dam management plan specifically the plan aims to increase the lamination effect of the dam without structural changes thereby reserving a specific volume of the dam s reservoir to accommodate the water transiting during a potential flood event allowing for the water s gradual release decreasing the potential peak discharge and hence the potential damages autorit√† di bacino della basilicata 2015 in particular after the watershed authority commissioned single and two dimensional hydraulic modeling sole et al 2013 for the assessment of the effects of hydraulic risk mitigation measures in the final stretch of the bradano and basento rivers 20 mm3 of the dam volume was dedicated to mitigation of potential flood events autorit√† di bacino della basilicata 2015 moreover a structural intervention related to the enlargement of the bridge culvert of the main railways taranto reggio calabria is already underway based only on technical studies led by the basilicata watershed authority autorit√† di bacino della basilicata 2015 although many farmers tourism complex holders and citizens living in the area at risk have pressured decision makers with the help of local media to solve the problem of flooding in the region their involvement in decision making processes has been limited to a few public meetings based on preexisting decisions therefore the current solution may neglect the socio economic aspects of flood risk reduction specific to the study area this suggests that important details and potentially useful information for reducing the flood risk in the area may have been overlooked during the decision making process the identification of this oversight is important as it indicates an insertion point for steps to improve regional flood management in the future 3 methodology following the principles of system thinking and sd forrester 1989 sterman 2000 clds are employed in the present study to construct conceptual models to support flood risk management decision making clds were chosen for their ability to show cause effect relationships between the variables that characterize a dynamic system through a simple graphical structure if simplified clds can easily be understood by non technical users due to their graphical nature making them an ideal modeling tool in a participatory setting kotir et al 2017 depending on the composition of the stakeholder groups and the specific case under analysis various stakeholder engagement tactics can be adopted voinov 2017 in the present study meetings were carried out with single individuals to avoid conflicts between opposing stakeholder groups and to facilite an open and neutral discussion stakeholders tend to have less interest in participating in group meetings than in individual interviews burgin et al 2013 videira et al 2009 since it is often more difficult for individuals to express their views openly in a group setting due to the presence of opposing groups or superiors in their organization for this reason group meetings were omitted in favor of individual interviews problem definition is often considered the most important step in model development because the clear articulation of the problem is essential for defining the purpose of the model its boundaries and time domain at the same time problem definition affects the selection of stakeholders in the modeling process in the current study the problem definition step was carried out by the facilitator through literature reviews discussion with local stakeholders and the study of historical maps after problem definition the selected problem was considered in the context of stakeholder needs and its ability to maintain stakeholder interest throughout the modeling exercise a widely tested framework developed by elias et al 2002 and improved by inam et al 2015 was used whereby once stakeholder analysis was complete the development of individual stakeholder clds was facilitated in a short period of time and with minimal financial resources finally the individual clds were compared and merged into a composite diagram the resulting diagram was discussed in a group stakeholder meeting to create the final group cld using the methodology of bure≈° 2017 the composite cld was reduced and simplified to make the final cld understandable to all stakeholders the overall methodological framework fig 3 used in the present study consists of four main stages stage i problem definition stage ii stakeholder analysis stage iii interviews with stakeholders and construction of the individual cld models followed by model digitization using the vensim software https vensim com stage iv construction of a complex group cld and stage v simplification of the merged cld model the following sections provide a detailed description of each step 3 1 problem definition clear articulation of the problem its boundaries and the timeframe within which it is to be addressed is critical to the success of the modeling process the problem must be defined before proceeding with stakeholder analysis and cld modeling a well prepared and clear definition of the problem aids in stakeholder selection and the definition of clear objectives making it possible to determine the appropriate level and methods of engagement reed 2008 the five main phases of problem definition include i selection of the problem theme and key variables ii selection of the time horizon iii definition of model limits and boundaries iv development of reference models for example a graphic representation of change over time that represent the dynamic behavior of the problem and v identification of relevant stakeholder groups the definition of the problem is an iterative process after stakeholder analysis it can be modified and even completely changed if stakeholders consider it necessary 3 2 stakeholder analysis once the problem has been defined it is necessary to identify the stakeholders who should be involved in the modeling process several methods of carrying out stakeholder analysis exist brugha and varvasovszky 2000 mitchell et al 1997 elias et al 2002 reed et al 2009 and the approach varies according to the type of problem for example lindenberg and crosby 1981 suggested making an inventory of those who could have a role in decision making gauging their importance through their level of influence and their interest in a particular outcome mapping the relationships between these actors and understanding their potential for developing alliances stakeholder analysis is also used to understand the diverse range of potentially conflicting stakeholder interests therefore the process of stakeholder analysis can exacerbate and generate conflict in some cases stakeholders may have hidden agendas or covert interests that may also skew the analysis and expressed concerns over research objectivity since those undertaking the analysis often do so from a particular perspective or with particular outcomes in mind the current study uses the framework proposed by inam et al 2015 to render the resulting structure more complete inclusive and versatile than other approaches the process occurs in four main phases i listing all stakeholders including marginal stakeholders ii categorizing them according to their roles iii prioritizing them according to their attributes and iv final selection based on the developed power and interest grid a preliminary list of stakeholders can be effectively developed using an approach that identifies relevant stakeholders either through a literature survey or based on the individual s local knowledge in the current study interested stakeholders were then asked to identify other relevant stakeholders this process also termed brainstorming may involve seemingly marginal stakeholders brugha and varvasovszky 2000 to find gaps in the first brainstorming step and to look for relevant parties who may have been omitted the list is further categorized according to each stakeholder s role as defined by the european commission 2003 as decision makers users implementers or experts following the methodology of mitchell et al 1997 the interested stakeholder is further classified according to three relational attributes i e power legitimacy and urgency entities with no power legitimacy or urgency concerning the problem are not stakeholders and are perceived as having no salience the stakeholder analysis is finalized by creating a power vs interest grid crosby and bryson 2005 that consists of a map showing the level of interest of each key stakeholder regarding the problem in relation to their power notably during the process stakeholder attributes may evolve in light of modifications to the state of the system or strategic issues in this way the final selection of stakeholders involves representatives in all roles i e decision makers users implementers and experts who are related to at least one of the attributes of power legitimacy urgency or interest 3 3 stakeholder interviews for the construction of individual clds after stakeholder analysis is complete potential stakeholders are contacted for individual interviews that involve the construction of individual clds that express their views regarding the problem to be addressed the cld is a modeling tool developed to represent the complex and dynamic nature of system behavior it responds to the requirements of the sd approach by treating organizations as systems made up of interacting parts instead of examining isolated events and their causes clds are excellent for quickly capturing stakeholder hypotheses regarding the causes of sd eliciting and capturing the mental models of individuals or teams and communicating the feedbacks that a stakeholder believes to be contributing to a problem clds have been successfully used in water resource planning policy analysis sustainable development and natural resource management prodanovic and simonovic 2007 sendzimir et al 2007 clds also feature feedback loops that are important for understanding sd a closed cycle is either defined as a reinforcing or balancing feedback loop a positive feedback loop generates reinforcing behavior that contributes to exponential growth in a system while a negative feedback loop generates balancing behavior that acts as an equilibrator in a system the process of cld development is based on a methodology that provides a useful start up framework for the group model building approach and addresses important questions about the principal setup of a group model building exercise vennix 1996 the steps of the framework are described below 1 a stakeholder e g a local farmer is presented with the purpose of the mental model exercise and through a simple example instructed in the method of drawing a cld colored sticky notes and large sheets of plain paper are provided to the stakeholder to allow them to create their mental model 2 the stakeholder inserts the problem variable at the center of the sheet 3 the stakeholder is then asked to add what they consider to be the causes of the problem first the direct or first order causes followed by the indirect or second order causes and last any higher order causes on the left side of the problem variable using sticky notes the causes are joined through causal links and the polarity and directionality of arrows are added 4 next the direct and indirect consequences of the problem or the first second and higher order consequences are added to the right of the problem variable likewise causal links with polarities are defined among the consequences 5 finally the causes and consequences are joined through feedback loops the following types of questions are asked during the interview to help each stakeholder develop their cld 1 how has the problem developed over time 2 what are the main direct and indirect causes of the problem s development including link polarities 3 what are the consequences of the problem 4 what are the main feedback processes 5 what kinds of short term policies do you think could be adopted to solve this problem 6 what kinds of long term policies could be adopted to solve this problem 7 what are the main obstacles to the success of these policies depending on stakeholder availability one of three interview options is adopted when time is limited e g 15 min the interview is recorded and subsequently translated into a cld by the facilitator the cld created by the facilitator is sent to the stakeholder so they may verify whether the diagram represents their point of view when the interviewee s availability is slightly longer e g 30 min a preliminary diagram prepared by the facilitator is presented to the interviewer and they are asked to correct the diagram and add missing links if a stakeholder has sufficient time e g greater than one hour the modeling exercise is started from scratch and the stakeholder carries out each step through the construction of the clds stakeholders express their views regarding the problem its causes its consequences the feedback loops involved and the strategies and policies that could be applied to address the problem all policy options are included in the diagram as policy variables important loops are numbered and labeled based on their reinforcing or balancing behavior furthermore for quick reference the loops are named according to the process they represent after the completion of the stakeholder interview phase the facilitator translates all cld models into digital computer models using the sd modeling software vensim dss https vensim com 3 4 construction of an overall group cld after carrying out all stakeholder interviews and developing the individual clds the facilitator s construct a preliminary diagram by analyzing comparing and merging all individual clds the composite diagram is then discussed in a stakeholder group meeting to create a final group cld shared by all the stakeholders the merged model aims to represent the different points of view and mental models maps of all stakeholders with respect to the problem its causes its consequences the involved feedback loops and the possible strategies and policies that could be employed to address the problem this makes it possible to highlight the perspectives of different stakeholders and develop a representative mental map of the system considering both complementary and controversial elements the resulting combined cld model includes the divergent perspectives of all key stakeholders those that were interested in participating and can be used to describe the qualitative behavior of the system through different reinforcing and balancing loops this type of qualitative analysis cannot be used to infer quantitative behavior but serves other purposes including detection of the critical problem identification of knowledge gaps for further research enhancement of stakeholder understanding detection of conflicts of interest and facilitation of decisions related to long term policies merging the individual models of several stakeholders can enhance the details of the model so that sub models on various aspects of the problem can be identified the proposed study uses the approach of inam et al 2015 for generating a comprehensive model that includes the diverging perspectives of stakeholders addressing conflict and controversies that arise during the merging process of individual clds it is essential however to avoid a complex mental model as complexity makes the model less intuitive and reduces stakeholders ability to engage and identify the assumptions underpinning the model s causal links complexity is an issue in the sd realm as it restricts the ability of stakeholders with limited modeling skills to understand complex holistic systems the current study seeks to develop a flood risk management process that is accessible to a wide variety of stakeholders through the establishment of a tool to simplify the representation of complex systems and make them understandable this was achieved through the cld simplification approach suggested by bure≈° 2017 and explained in the following section 3 5 simplification of the overall group cld as mentioned above the combination of the individual clds can produce an unwieldy final group cld model sedlacko et al 2014 leading to incorrect inferences mirchi et al 2012 moreover if the analyzed environmental problem involves different administrative regions in addition to different types of stakeholders further conflicts may arise due to stakeholders with differing viewpoints proposing completely different mitigation actions for the various regions involved according to bure≈° 2017 by building a simplified cld model the complexity of the final cld is reduced and as seen in the present work these limitations can be overcome a small model is often sufficient to explain problem dynamics and build intuition regarding appropriate responses ghaffarzadegan et al 2011 therefore it is necessary to improve the readability of visual system representations the methodology presented here is based on the initial construction of the cld using duplicate variables as the input to other variables bure≈° 2017 in fact single crossing links which create intersections that add considerably to the complexity of the diagram have been avoided in order to improve overall diagram readability the method is built around three main activities endogenization encapsulation and order oriented reduction i the endogenization step involves an initial simplification of the model through the deletion of exogenous system variables to make the diagram fully endogenous ii the encapsulation step entails the selection and elimination of all variables that have a single input and a single output subsequently based on the principle used to define the feedback loop polarity sterman 2000 a new polarity for the connection between variables is established these steps are repeated until the model no longer includes individual input and output variables iii the order oriented reduction step consists of marking and deleting all single input double output variables along with double input single output variables to increase the readability of the diagram these simplification actions can be carried out individually or consecutively in general endogenization is preferable to encapsulation and encapsulation is preferable to order oriented reduction once the reduced cld is obtained the facilitator visits stakeholders to verify that the merged diagram still represents their point of view after the simplification and elimination of variables 4 results the bradano river case study presented here investigates the level of stakeholder engagement in evaluating the causes consequences and policies for flood management through a participatory modeling approach from the onset of the study s preliminary interview phase individual cld development with each stakeholder stakeholders confirmed that flooding of the bradano was a critical problem for the region see section 4 3 without requiring that the interested groups have any technical experience the cld methodology was found to be effective in terms of both cost and time after an introductory 20 to 30 minute session nearly all stakeholders were able to apply the method and build a cld from beginning to end the practical application of the methodology is discussed in the following section 4 1 stage 1 problem definition due to the significant damages caused by recent flood events flood risk in the area under investigation is receiving close attention from stakeholders and the media the particularly intense meteorological phenomena that affected basilicata between the period of 2010 to 2013 contributed to hydrogeological issues such as the flooding of rivers and streams as well as landslides this resulted in serious damage to infrastructure and public and private buildings in such cases timely and informed decision making becomes increasingly important an innovative modeling tool able to simulate socio economic and environmental interactions through feedbacks to propose sustainable management solutions can be applied to enhance decision making abilities the qualitative modeling approach proposed in the current study addresses the communication gap between the authorities and stakeholders and provides a management solution for flooding along the bradano river as defined through the engagement of interested stakeholders 4 2 stage 2 stakeholder analysis stakeholder analysis is the process of categorizing and filtering stakeholders based on their roles attributes and interests in the first step a preliminary list of stakeholders was created by the facilitator through a brainstorming process the preliminary list comprised all stakeholders including those considered to be marginal a literature review and expert opinion showed that the basilicata watershed authority and san giuliano dam management authority were important stakeholders in the bradano flood analysis the dam plays a crucial role in the management of water resources and some stakeholders believe it was the main cause of flooding in 2011 the watershed authority establishes the perimeter of flood prone areas for all the rivers in the basilicata region and oversees hydraulic risk management documentation and projects the organization for damage assistance for residents was contacted as it has been involved in helping residents affected by past events the road authority was also considered since such infrastructure reduces the outflow capacity of the riverbed during flood events the early warning authority was considered due to its role in post event flood emergency management and since it collects data regarding precipitation farmers who suffered flood damages in past years were also important stakeholders other stakeholders included the regional agricultural department local authorities e g municipality and tourism authorities in the next step stakeholders were categorized as experts decision makers implementers or users using the framework developed by the european commission 2003 such categorization helps in the assessment of missing links in the initial stakeholder identification the stakeholder categories and their roles are summarized in fig 4 after stakeholder identification and categorization stakeholders were contacted the preliminary list was shared and identified stakeholders were asked for suggestions about potential missing stakeholders most contacted stakeholders were satisfied with the list but suggested adding the water cycle authority as they thought that it might help provide further information about public areas close to the river stakeholders were then categorized based on their attributes this step helps to track changes in stakeholder dynamics over time a stakeholder s changing role can be measured by the loss or gain of one or more attributes for this purpose the complete methodology developed by mitchell et al 1997 which classifies stakeholders based on three relational attributes power legitimacy and urgency was used fig 5 definitive stakeholders were classified as those who possessed all three attributes these stakeholders were considered to be the most important stakeholders to include in the qualitative modeling exercise in the current study the definitive stakeholders were the early warning organization the regional agricultural department the basilicata watershed authority the san giuliano dam management authority and the infrastructure management authority in addition the power vs interest grid approach developed by crosby and bryson 2005 was completed to prioritize stakeholders fig 6 reveals that the basilicata watershed authority the regional agricultural department and the san giuliano dam management authority have high power and high interest levels hence they were considered the most important stakeholders with regards to flood management in the study area finally based on stakeholder analysis and stakeholder recommendations the basilicata watershed authority the san giuliano dam management authority local farmers the organization in charge of damage assistance for residents and the infrastructure management authority were included in the individual cld modeling process 4 3 stage 3 stakeholder interviews and individual cld preparation during the process of developing individual clds the authors of this paper facilitated the interview process which involved meeting with individual stakeholders over a period of eight weeks in general the stakeholders showed confidence in the modeling exercise and were satisfied with the representation of their mental maps through the clds individual cld modeling begins with the selection of a problem variable when stakeholders were initially asked to point out the main problem in the study area based on the damage inflicted by past events the majority pointed to the flooding of the bradano river the next step involves adding direct and indirect causes of flooding in the study area different stakeholders expressed different perspectives but generally they identified water depth exceeding safe limits as the main contributor to flooding some stakeholders believed that inadequate maintenance of the riverbed and levees was one of the primary causes of the floods in their opinion these structures created obstacles effectively reducing the river channel s hydraulic section so that the outflow capacity of the river was insufficient to contain the rising water some stakeholders pointed to the management of the san giuliano dam emphasizing the need to improve dam management and highlighting the fundamental role the dam has had in past flood events however this view contrasted with that of stakeholders who viewed the dam management as satisfactory in terms of irrigation and flood water management other stakeholders believed that the railway and route ss 106 which cross the river see fig 1 contributed to a reduction of the river s hydraulic section by presenting obstacles to river outflow thus causing water depth to exceed safe limits another cause highlighted by stakeholders was the maintenance of the drainage channels that interfere with the basento river which is located near the study area the next stage in the cld building process was the stakeholder led identification of significant direct and indirect consequences of the bradano river floods major consequences included various economic environmental social and agricultural damages for example loss of life reduction of production damage to economic activities farms and zoo technical enterprises infrastructure tourism complexes and the interruption of activities caused by the closure of roads and the railway one of the main strengths of sd modeling is that the model s flexibility allows for the inclusion of all causes and consequences the developed model structure was then analyzed for feedback relationships between the causes and consequences fig 7 provides a simple example representing two different policies suggested by two different stakeholders the figure also describes the basic steps used by these stakeholders to develop their clds in the first feedback loop riverbed maintenance the bradano flood is marked as the problem variable maintenance of the riverbed and presence of aggregates and gravel are marked as direct and indirect causes while damage to productive activities and city planning modification were added as direct and indirect consequences finally city planning modification was linked with the presence of aggregates and gravel through a feedback loop which connects the consequence with the cause and indicates the dynamics of the system policy a control of riverbed maintenance is represented by a balancing loop which indicates that this policy if implemented will balance out the current impacts of the presence of aggregates and gravel in the future see fig 7 in the second feedback loop protection plan flood events increase economic losses which in turn cause a reduction in recreational activities reduction in recreational activities forces the government to adopt some protection plans these plans cause a reduction in floodplain activities and thereby reduce flooding policy b in fig 7 named protection plan will have a reinforcing effect meaning that this policy if implemented would contribute to a reduction in bradano river flooding each stakeholder prepared their cld independently during the entire process the facilitator helped solely with procedural issues and remained neutral to ensure the development of unbiased qualitative mental models once stakeholder views in the form of causes consequences and feedback loops were expressed in the cld stakeholders were asked by the facilitator what kind of policies do you think would be effective in the mitigation of the flood problem in the study area all stakeholders agreed that better management of the riverbed could help reduce the amount of flood damage which they further indicated as a cost effective management solution almost all stakeholders agreed that proper cleaning of the drainage channels was necessary to avoid the accumulation of vegetation which often prevents the normal flow of water causing an increase in flood intensity these kinds of management options were identified as short term policies some stakeholders believed that the role of the dam was insignificant in past flooding events while others pointed to poor dam management and suggested that past events were triggered by the opening of the spillway as this situation required further analysis through quantitative modeling exercises both options were included in the merged model diagram some stakeholders believed that damage could be avoided by changing the type of crop cultivated in the riverbank areas furthermore depending on the type of crops cultivated farmers could benefit from this policy since the water could also help in the production or maturation of some products this was considered to be a long term policy some local authorities proposed the construction of a levee on the left side of the river with a storage area to collect drainage water from any overflow of the territory s drainage channels given their poor maintenance 4 4 cld merging in the current research individual stakeholder clds were merged the final combined cld represents a holistic view of the complete system the merging process was initiated with the most comprehensive model i e the model with the maximum numbers of variables the process continued with the incorporation of additional variables until each of the stakeholder viewpoints were represented all controversies and conflicting ideas were indicated in the merged diagram for future discussions when all stakeholders were present stakeholders were asked to attend one follow up group meeting to finalize the merged cld wide ranging discussions regarding the group s opinions on the details of the merged cld and any controversies were encouraged during this meeting this process also allowed stakeholders to share their ideas the preliminary merged diagram i e the overall cld fig 8 generated by moderators and then simplified as described in section 4 6 was in a later stage presented to stakeholders to elicit their opinions regarding the overall model 4 5 merged cld sub processes and management options the complete merged model consists of seven loops fig 8 covering details and qualitative dynamics of different sub processes such as agricultural activity economic damage dam maintenance and infrastructure maintenance several processes policies and both local and global feedback loops were identified loop 1 the floodplain activity loop indicated in green in fig 8 shows the balancing effect of the bradano floods on residential structures close to the river an increase in flooding leads to an increase in residential damage which in turn leads to a reduction in structural value thereby reducing floodplain activities the presence of activities in flooded areas makes the soil impermeable and in case of an event leads to a greater expansion of the floodplain conversely flooding implies a greater water residence time within the watershed and possible water contamination leading to a reduction in agricultural activities within the study area this in turn leads to better maintenance of the levees by reducing the constant presence of farmers on adjacent land which inevitably has a negative impact on their maintenance loop 2 maintenance of the levees loop indicated in orange fig 8 agricultural activities also have a negative effect on maintenance of the drainage channels located close to the river as farmers keep these areas clean for cultivation but in doing so move large amounts of vegetation into the channels causing a narrowing of the river section which reduces the outflow capacity of the riverbed loop 3 maintenance of the drainage channels loop indicated in orange fig 8 in terms of economic damage stakeholders highlighted the need to review flood compensation and insurance policies and to apply new laws to avoid the reoccurrence of disagreements that took place after past flood events stakeholders also identified that new laws should allow the removal of environmental constraints from business and public properties so that authorities can carry out routine maintenance of the riverbed thereby reducing the manning s roughness coefficient and consequently the water depth in the river loop 4 economic damage loop indicated in black fig 8 tourism attraction modeled by loop 5 exhibited a balancing effect as the bradano floods initially cause a decrease in the attractiveness of riverside tourism which leads to changes in urban planning to facilitate the protection of cultural heritage and tourism facilities loop 5 tourism attraction loop indicated in blue fig 8 the balancing nature of the loop indicates that tourism will decrease for only a short duration and that after a change in urban planning to protect the region s cultural heritage the tourism in the study area will recover some stakeholders thought that greater awareness could lead to better information about hydraulic risk greater awareness of flood risk can be leveraged to pressure government agencies to improve the maintenance of infrastructure and to avoid constructing roads and railways that act as obstacles to river flow these improvements would lead to an increase in the dimension of the hydraulic section which in turn would cause a reduction in water depth loop 6 awareness loop indicated in magenta fig 8 information from the media has a positive impact on dam management which leads to a reduction of the discharge in case of a flood wave and contributes to reduced water depth the dam maintenance loop addresses the reservations of some stakeholders who were convinced that the dam was the main cause of the 2011 flood event they believed that heavy rainfall led to the opening of the dam s bottom spillway flooding a large area and causing damage to agricultural activities residential structures tourism complexes and infrastructures loop 7 management of the dam loop indicated in fuchsia fig 8 4 6 simplification of the merged diagram the merged final diagram presented in fig 8 was complex and difficult for stakeholders to understand stakeholders failed to identify important feedback loops and faced difficulty in capturing the underlying themes of the fundamental version of the working model therefore the complex merged diagram was simplified using the cld simplification approach recommended by bure≈° 2017 the main purpose of this simplification was to facilitate stakeholder understanding of the system however the authors acknowledge that the simplified cld might fail to represent correct system boundaries and behavior due to the elimination of some important processes and variables hence in a companion study the final merged model fig 8 will be used as a base model for developing a quantitative sd simulation model fig 9 shows a simplified graphic representation of the diagram the symbol on the arrow is associated with a positive link while the symbol represents a negative link the connection between dam maintenance and water depth is marked with an exclamation point which means that the stakeholders have conflicting opinions regarding the effects of dam maintenance on water depth important activities were identified as floodplain activities and agricultural activities these activities negatively affect levees and drainage channel maintenance within the basin resulting in increased flood risk other important loops are the awareness and dam maintenance loops as the dominancy of the awareness loop increases dam maintenance increases and vice versa the simple cld also highlights effects of flooding on tourism and economic growth in the area the simplification process was carried out through three main activities namely endogenization encapsulation and order oriented reduction as suggested by bure≈° 2017 finally the simplified diagram fig 9 was introduced to all eight stakeholders who found that it was an appropriate and acceptable representation of the system it is evident that the reduced diagram fig 9 is simpler than the pre reduction cld fig 8 the number of loops and the main themes are the same in both figures but it was possible for all the stakeholders in particular non experts to understand the simplified diagram fig 9 and to focus on the real issues addressed in the case study furthermore the reduced number of variables helped to avoid misunderstandings and misinterpretations in the reduced cld water depth remains the primary causative factor in flooding however other significant variables are highlighted such as the maintenance of the riverbed the presence of floodplain agricultural activities and city planning modifications 5 discussion the purpose of the current study was to demonstrate the usefulness of applying clds to involve key stakeholders in the initial stages of socio economic environmental model development facilitate stakeholder discussion and develop an integrated perspective on complex issues in flood risk management the methodology proposed in the study can help bridge the communication gap between policymakers and local stakeholders other benefits include but are not limited to increasing social awareness about a problem of interest improving understanding of socio economic and environmental interactions building knowledge of a complex holistic system using a simple approach and improving the role of stakeholders in decision making regarding the specific case study analyzed stakeholders highlighted the importance of the additional inputs provided by the present study to management policies for flood risk mitigation in the study area recent and planned mitigation actions i e the san giuliano dam lamination plan and an extension of the railway bridge tunnel respectively were implemented as a result of media pressure or based only on technical judgment with limited involvement of local stakeholders this situation highlights the importance of participatory modeling to incorporate the knowledge of key stakeholders for a holistic view of the complex system this study is first of its kind for flood risk management in the bradano river overall stakeholders appreciated the flexibility of the cld method and found it to be useful cost effective and simple to understand they further agreed that the final merged diagram represented a holistic view of dynamic system processes and therefore can be used to increase awareness and understanding of the interactions between different system components furthermore they appreciated the transparency of the process the approach was easily understood by non modeling professionals and provided them with support during the dialogue processes stakeholders were able to consider different management policies and the results revealed socio economic and territorial aspects of the issue that had not been considered by other studies in particular farmers believed the final cld will help increase collaboration with decision makers turning decision makers attention to their opinions also the farmers stated that the final cld has increased their comprehension of the interactions between causes and consequences of the systems moreover the water basin authority believes that the proposed approach could support them in their compliance with the eu flood directive that requires public participation in the preparation of a flood management plan e g 2007 60 ec art 10 a few others were skeptical from the beginning that clds could effectively affect decision makers but they remained impressed by the clear framework developed using clds with minimal effort on their part this demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed approach which successfully fostered policy coordination between stakeholders from different sectors groups levels and interests the model was developed with broad boundaries and included diverse socio economic and physical variables for example components that were included in the current model such as land use changes damage compensation floodplain activities and stakeholder awareness had not been previously investigated in this region the present study addresses the need for a modeling tool that facilitates understanding of the dynamics of flood risk management from both environmental and socio economic perspectives indeed this paper covers the first phase of a long term study in which the authors are involved the scoping phase i e qualitative modeling using clds is described in the current paper while in subsequent papers model quantification testing and institutionalization will be discussed in particular the present paper examines the development of a qualitative sd modeling approach for stakeholder engagement in flood risk management in another planned study the group built cld fig 8 discussed in this manuscript will be used as a base model for developing a quantitative sd simulation model to simulate the socio economic aspects and technical measures of flood risk management in an integrated way finally the linking dynamic coupling of more detailed physically based models and group built sd models will be an important future research focus for flood risk management in the bradano river along with other locations the results of the case study indicate that clds are an effective and simple method to initialize stakeholder engagement the method was helpful in the development of qualitative models aimed at addressing complex issues such as flood risk management qualitative models enable stakeholders to share their opinions and learn from each other to develop a more in depth and holistic understanding of the system under investigation 6 conclusion this study is the first of its kind aimed at creating an integrated analysis of the issue of flood risk management with the active participation of stakeholders through cld modeling the results of the case study indicate that the proposed cld method was helpful in the development of qualitative mental models aimed at addressing complex issues such as flood risk management stakeholders were easily engaged due to the simplicity and limited costs in terms of time of the interview process they each created individual clds without any previous experience with sd modeling and in a few cases with limited technical skills related to the topic the individual interview format created an open environment for stakeholders to share their opinions moreover all stakeholders were able to understand the simplified version of the merged group cld the participating stakeholders were satisfied with the modeling process and the simplified group cld model many were surprised by the transparency of the process and enthusiastic about how well they were able to depict aspects of a complex system in a clear simple and understandable way in particular the overall group cld model highlighted problems in the study area that had not been considered in previous studies the cld exercise allowed key stakeholders from different organizations and groups to learn from each other and develop a more in depth and holistic understanding of the system under investigation leading to increased social awareness group learning and consensus building the knowledge of the problem obtained through the participatory modeling approach went beyond the information that was gathered from the literature review and pre existing hydraulic studies the proposed methodological framework was applied to initialize stakeholder engagement in flood risk management in the bradano river delta in italy however the modular structure and the universal nature of the employed methods make the proposed scheme scalable supporting its application in other territorial contexts the above mentioned characteristics of the proposed approach also permit its extension to rainfall induced shallow landslides i e the most common natural hazards in some areas of the world peruccacci et al 2017 manenti et al 2019 through a correct and clear definition of the problem key variables and time horizon water related risks are complex and dynamic issues the methodology proposed here can be used to construct a holistic representation of the risk system by analyzing the behavior and the connection between different socio economic variables and integrating stakeholder perspectives in future research the clds constructed by stakeholders will be quantified in a sd modeling environment and coupled with a physically based model to evaluate the consequences of the stakeholders proposed policies by considering stakeholder perspectives as well as social environmental economic and physical aspects of the problem effective flood risk management decision making in the region is supported

5987,participatory methods to support successful policy decisions regarding the complex and dynamic interactions of social ecological and physical processes involved in flooding must be simple easy to use and cost efficient accordingly a stepwise methodological framework based on causal loop diagrams clds was developed to address the challenge of context sensitive initialization of key stakeholders in the collaborative flood risk management process the methodology consists of five main stages i problem definition ii stakeholder analysis and identification of key groups iii interviews with key stakeholders to construct individual clds iv merging of individual clds to form a holistic qualitative model representing the entire system and v implementation of an order oriented reduction process to simplify the final merged cld thereby increasing understanding of the most important processes and feedbacks the proposed approach for flood risk management was tested in a coastal area of southern italy a region historically affected by flood events given its simplicity the proposed method was seen as a valuable tool to elicit and map mental models especially when working with stakeholders who did not have prior modeling experience i e farmers agricultural companies tourist complexes and infrastructure authorities indeed all stakeholders in the current study were able to understand the process and proposed different flood risk management policies such as land use changes management of damage insurance payouts floodplain activities and improvement of public awareness the proposed methodology overcame multiple barriers in initializing stakeholder engagement including the technical focus of most flood management agencies the additional cost and time requirements for stakeholder involvement as well as institutional structures that impede collaborative management moreover the results point to socio economic aspects of flood risk management that have not been considered in previous modeling studies keywords causal loop diagram flood risk management system dynamics participatory modeling stakeholder engagement decision making 1 introduction floods are the most frequently occurring and costliest natural hazard throughout the world killing more than 25 000 affecting 520 million people and leaving 3 2 million homeless every year simonovic 2009 european countries are no exception between 1990 and 2008the european environment agency estimated that 213 european flood events affected more than 3 million people and caused 1126 fatalities along with at least us 52 billion in losses in the same period salvati et al 2010 reported 2321 flood events in italy that led to approximately 1407 deaths and 2 8 million injuries human activities e g waterway modification catchment deforestation and floodplain development undertaken in natural environments may lead to adverse environmental effects e g blockage of waterways to address the multiple consequences of flooding caused by human environment interactions sustainable stakeholder proposed management policies must be developed with a holistic understanding of the complex social economic environmental context misleading or fragmented decisions regarding structural and non structural interventions can affect flood risk in up or down stream communities in ways that are difficult to predict or even demonstrate following a flood event thaler et al 2015 flood risk is exacerbated by population growth and urban development in vulnerable areas nicholls 2008 and therefore such societal changes must be considered in efforts to improve the sustainability and resilience of risk based flood management practices e g hall et al 2003 hooijer et al 2004 resilience based approaches require an understanding of the complexity and interconnections of a system for example how a disruption to one system component can affect various others over time linkov and trump 2019 many flood risk assessment tools of different levels of complexity are available to quantify albeit with uncertainty current risk and its evolution albano et al 2017a de moel et al 2012 merz et al 2009 penning rowsell et al 2005 risk quantification can also be achieved by estimating flood damages and completing uncertainty assessments in the context of flood risk management studies jongman et al 2012 amadio et al 2016 morales torres et al 2016 albano et al 2017b 2018 while methods used to estimate the loss of life incurred during flooding events have been extensively investigated and reviewed escuder bueno et al 2012 jonkman et al 2016 few studies have examined the development of methods for the integration of stakeholder knowledge into the identification of local flood risk management options maskrey et al 2016 stakeholder participation is important for successful policy decisions e g saadat et al 2011 halbe et al 2014 medema et al 2014 inam et al 2017a 2017b 2017c risk management strategies may fail in the absence of a participatory approach nutt 2002 for example nutt 2002 highlights that a premature commitment to a specific solution and a lack of attention to multiple stakeholder requirements can lead to the increased probability of erroneous decision making moreover flood management policy has a more direct impact on stakeholders than policies in many other environmental fields floods pose a direct threat to property economic activity and human life challies et al 2016 accordingly the engagement of stakeholders in socio economic environmental modeling processes is key to the development of a holistic qualitative model adopting for example a system dynamics modeling approach that is capable of considering all socio economic components and ensuring that all issues and relevant policy opinions have been addressed as shown in inam et al 2015 that used causal loop diagrams cld as a useful way of capturing the views and ideas of stakeholders within a model structure having analyzed the principal causes of decision making process failures and methods of avoiding bad practices nutt 2002 concluded that roughly half of policy decisions failed to achieve meaningful results because the knowledge and interests of key stakeholders were excluded these challenges suggest that a flexible approach is needed to address the right problem at the right scale and scope and present the correct system response winz et al 2009 an effective approach must be simple intuitive able to support the understanding of complex problems and allow for improvements in the decision making process the three main objectives of the present study are to i propose a simple and detailed approach to identify stakeholders and involve them in the decision making process for flood risk management ii use qualitative causal loop diagrams clds to incorporate stakeholder viewpoints and preferred stakeholder policy options through participatory model building and iii explore the application of the proposed approach on the ionian sea coast crossed by the bradano river in the basilicata region of italy existing studies have identified the importance of stakeholder input and explored this in various ways in addition system dynamics sd models have been used to address other flood related problems see section 1 1 however the current study represents the first time that a methodology based on the use of qualitative models of stakeholders mental maps has been applied in flood risk management clds were chosen for the current analysis as they provide a flexible qualitative modeling process and allow for the inclusion of both socio economic and environmental variables supporting the exploration of the dynamic linkages among variables from both domains videira et al 2009 beyond capturing stakeholder viewpoints and their preferred management options clds provide a holistic picture of the complete system by representing the interactions between different variables and aiding in the understanding of feedbacks between different system components holistic models developed by merging individual stakeholder built clds are quite complex inam et al 2015 and might limit the stakeholders role in later modeling stages any barrier to stakeholder engagement during the participatory modeling process can lead to bias in the final model inam et al 2015 the approach presented in the current study overcomes these limitations by proposing a methodology that reduces the complexity of the final merged cld rendering it more comprehensible for all types of stakeholders including those with limited modeling and technical skills this study offers an important contribution to risk management decision making research through demonstrating how stakeholders with limited technical skills financial resources and time can be involved in flood risk management ultimately improving knowledge and the decision making process other practical benefits include but are not limited to introducing alternative ethical perspectives in decision making problem definition and sustainable management solutions broadening the range of potential solutions spreading the responsibilities and risks associated with management actions and encouraging more balanced decision making parson 2000 smith and mcdonough 2001 sinclair et al 2003 1 1 background many proponents and practitioners of participatory approaches e g carmona et al 2013 voinov 2017 have highlighted the benefits of stakeholder involvement in modeling and decision making processes several recent studies have analyzed different aspects of participatory flood risk management for example thaler and levin keitel 2016 conducted a study in england exploring the relationship between national and local stakeholders by using a heuristic analytical framework edelenbos et al 2017 investigated the role and impact of stakeholder initiatives in flood risk management by comparing case studies to find contextual and situational similarities and differences to explain how stakeholder initiatives influence governmental policy such approaches however have not provided a detailed framework with which to identify and subsequently involve stakeholders such a framework is very important to solving the problems under investigation using a participatory approach based on group meetings kotir et al 2017 assessed water resource management and sustainable agricultural development approaches implemented along the volta river in west africa using bayesian networks maskrey et al 2016 similarly implemented a participatory approach to find intervention options for managing flood risk in hebden bridge u k in both cases however the researchers failed to capture in a simple quick and understandable manner stakeholders mutually uninfluenced opinions related to the specific problem instead they employed mediated modeling in which key stakeholders worked together in model building this approach can increase the probability of incurring conflicts of interest by stakeholders that may hinder the success of the application halbe et al 2018 in individual interviews on the other hand there is the risk of eliciting uninformed opinions which must be taken into account in the modeling process moreover the application of bayesian networks in the aforementioned study was inherently acyclic and thus unable to handle the system s feedback structure molina et al 2010 local stakeholder input in environment and development related decisions is supported at international and european levels e g 2007 60 ec article 10 in particular the importance of stakeholder involvement in flood risk management has been emphasized in policy and practice in the eu us and elsewhere wood et al 2012 tingsanchali 2012 begg et al 2018 tingsanchali 2012 explored the effects of integrated urban flood risk management in thailand and suggested that the involvement of stakeholder knowledge from different perspectives enables a coherent understanding of flood risks therefore improving the outcome of decision making processes the paper highlighted that the involvement of local stakeholders allowed for the identification and implementation of more effective and sustainable flood management measures that are supported by the majority of stakeholders begg et al 2018 discussed two practical examples in europe i e the uk and germany of local stakeholder participation in flood defense related decisions wood et al 2012 illustrated the development of an integrated approach to flood preparedness planning that harmonizes stakeholder and agency efforts in the us these studies demonstrate the efforts of the research community and flood risk authorities to improve current levels of stakeholder participation in flood risk management suggesting a trend towards greater openness and inclusion of stakeholders despite an emphasis on local stakeholder participation the actual stakeholder participation and influence is limited in practice either because participation often takes place at the end of the planning process or because the participation processes are mainly based on a preexisting decision making structure mainly based on economic criteria furthermore stakeholder involvement is often limited due to high time and resource costs low potential for stakeholders to significantly influence their role the outcome or the starting point of the decision making process may lead to frustration and conflict as well as increased inequality the development of a model framework for a cost efficient stakeholder involvement in flood risk management policies will address previous approaches lack of institutional support clear and effective guidelines communication information sharing and resources especially regarding large stakeholder participation processes thaler and priest 2014 research shows that stakeholder engagement at a late stage adversely affects their willingness to be involved in the participatory process as they often believe the decision making process has already been completed reed 2008 based on clds videira et al 2009 the present modeling approach is centered around addressing issues that can adversely affect the decision making process including a lack of clarity in the objectives and transparency in the engagement process biased policies that lead to hasty decisions poor relationships between stakeholders and an unequal degree of power or level of stakeholder influence currently several approaches exist to involve stakeholders in participatory modeling wood et al 2012 begg et al 2018 normally stakeholders are brought into the process through group meetings or interviews in predefined forms mayer et al 2017 such engagement may result in biased models due to the presence of group pressure maskrey et al 2016 accordingly for any participatory process to be successful these factors should be well defined from the outset cornell 2006 reed 2008 in practice the participatory modeling process is facilitated through the use of different types of analytical and system tools the most common and frequently used tools include sd bayesian belief networks fuzzy cognitive mapping and agent based modeling voinov 2017 the main advantage of sd modeling approaches is that they offer a powerful method for explicitly incorporating both social and physical processes into dynamic models thereby capturing important feedbacks and connections between two types of system variables socio economic and environmental that may lead to counterintuitive system behavior sterman 2000 halbe and adamowski 2011 the proposed study focuses on sd approaches because they provide room for local and expert knowledge in the analysis of environmental issues sd has a long history as a modeling paradigm with its origins in the work of forrester 1989 who developed the subject to provide an understanding of strategic problems in complex dynamic systems by providing insight into feedback processes sd models provide system users with a better understanding of dynamic system behaviors areas of sd application have always been broad with an emphasis on socio economic applications sd models have been successfully used for water resources planning and management policy analysis sustainable development and natural resource management ahmad and simonovic 2011 chen and wei 2014 hassanzadeh et al 2012 kotir et al 2017 solana guti√©rrez et al 2017 tehrani et al 2011 zare et al 2019 in particular participatory sd modeling has become increasingly popular and effective as it integrates the benefits of sd modeling and stakeholder involvement participatory sd models are initially constructed using qualitative information gathering techniques such as surveys questionnaires group model building exercises or story telling the results of a participatory model building effort include the improved understanding of i cross variable interactions ii study system complexity iii stakeholder dynamics and socio cultural norms iv management limitations and v potential authoritative hierarchies the benefits of performing a participatory sd modeling assessment can be physical environmental social or economic for example pagano et al 2019 proposed a participatory sd modeling approach for flood risk reduction with the additional goal of producing stakeholder friendly livelihood benefits such as nature conservation and improved community well being participatory sd modeling has also been used for industrialized pastoral farming puig et al 2011 integrated coastal zone management mongruel et al 2011 and interdisciplinary water systems management sunsnik et al 2012 although participatory sd modeling is a useful and effective approach for incorporating stakeholder knowledge into the model building process it is still a relatively new modeling technique and thus has some limitations many participatory sd models are characterized by varying degrees of uncertainty involving model assumptions lack of reliable and consistent household panel data lack of spatial information or the absence of a robust evaluation for selected coping and improvement strategies furthermore by making the interconnectedness of a modeled environment more explicit there is a risk of igniting or exacerbating resource or land use conflicts among beneficiaries voinov and bousquet 2010 despite these apparent limitations participatory sd modeling is a valuable tool that allows for improved understanding of a study system increased involvement of local ideals and knowledge and enhanced decision making different sd techniques including clds influence diagrams fuzzy cognitive maps and system archetypes can be used to formulate and represent a dynamic hypothesis elsawah et al 2017 mirchi et al 2012 as simple and commonly used diagramming tools clds are generally employed at the beginning of socio economic environmental modeling exercises to develop a preliminary dynamic hypothesis inam et al 2015 system archetypes are high level conceptualizations that provide insights about common patterns of behavior in systems wolstenholme 2003 these insights can be transferred across various problem situations and domains gohari et al 2013 in contrast influence diagrams represent a decision situation achieved through the generalization of bayesian networks providing a more explicit and rigorous graphical representation of the causal structure than clds as an alternative fuzzy cognitive maps a semi quantitative diagramming tool that represents a belief system about the problem s causal structure allow one to portray the relative strength of inter variable links kok 2009 however influence diagrams have a lot of conventions and rules making them time consuming to master while the output of fuzzy cognitive mapping can be difficult to explain to non modelers van delden et al 2008 furthermore influence diagrams are difficult to examine from different perspectives increasing the risk of force fitting the problem situation system to an archetype gohari et al 2013 according to elsawah et al 2017 this risk is exacerbated if the modeler is inexperienced corben 1994 comparatively clds provide an aggregate view of the problem structure maintaining focus on feedback loops instead of unnecessary details in addition clds are relatively intuitive and easy to explain to non modelers sedlacko et al 2014 2 case study crossing southern italy s basilicata region from the northwest to the southeast and ending in the gulf of taranto in the ionian sea the 170 km bradano river extends over a total surface area of 2960 km2 at an average elevation amsl of 387 m the western and southwestern portions of its basin are mountainous with elevations ranging between 700 and 1250 m while the southern downstream portion addressed in the present study does not exceed 500 m in elevation i e the metaponto plain the river s hydrographic network is ramified with its main tributaries entering from the northeast side of the main river course the bradano river basin has three main sections i a top section upstream from the san giuliano dam ii a middle section downstream from the dam but upstream from route ss 106 and iii a bottom section which is the flattest area of the river flowing into the ionian sea see the left portion of fig 1 during recent flood events the greatest damage to agribusinesses farms and tourist complexes were recorded downstream from the san giuliano dam during the latest flood event the main road ss 106 and railway were closed to traffic for several days three critical issues have been identified by simulating a flood event with a 30 year return period see fig 1 1 in the fluvial reaches upstream from route ss 106 the northeast hydraulic bank is not sufficient to retain a 30 year flood which can then extend for about 2 km to the northeast reaching ground areas located downstream 2 in the fluvial reaches between route ss 106 and the railway embankment water in a 30 year flood event at depths exceeding 1 m would be mainly concentrated in a narrow strip of land upstream from the railway while the rest of the flooded area would be under less than 1 m of water 3 downstream from the railway embankment banks on both sides of the riverbed are insufficient to retain a 30 year flood event moreover underpasses favor the outflow of floodwaters from upstream to downstream of the railway this portion of the ionian coast known as the metaponto plain is subject to critical hydraulic conditions due to a network of drainage channels designed to collect and convey waters into other areas these channels managed by the region s land reclamation consortia provide the only artificial drainage for surface water and or outcrops in the area finally in the downstream section near the sea there are protected areas associated with the archaeological remains of early settlements dating back to the archaic period historically the bradano basin has been affected by flooding events e g recently in october 2010 march 2011 and december 2013 that cover large areas and damage infrastructure productive activities agriculture and tourism and archaeological heritage sites scarpino et al 2018 in the 2011 flood all rivers in the basilicata region the agri sinni basento cavone and bradano flooded requiring the evacuation of 200 families from the city of matera and leading to the destruction of hundreds of hectares of crops the closure of farms and zoo technical enterprises and the death of hundreds of livestock the southeastern portion of the region was the most severely affected the 2013 flood in matera province occurred following a pair of meteorological events which occurred two days apart october 5 and 7 2013 and resulted in total precipitation of 186 mm table 1 this flood which affected the entire coast caused serious and widespread damage and killed four people the bradano river and its tributaries showed extensive flooding with floodwaters overtopping bridges across the riverbed the railway line was interrupted and extensive damage to agriculture and housing infrastructure was recorded the archaeological park near the river s outlet was submerged by water that had overflowed from adjacent drainage channels the hydro meteorological event that occurred during december 2013 between november 30 2013 and december 3 2013 mostly affected the southeastern part of the basilicata region this event was particularly intense due to the rainfall s high intensity the gauge stations in the area registered cumulative rainfall over 150 mm manfreda et al 2015 the rainfall gauge station in metaponto town exceeded 200 mm the flooding of the bradano and basento rivers and the overflow of the reclamation channels caused the interruption of several provincial roads and highway ss 106 moreover the flooding impacted the inhabited centers of policoro and mataponto as well as the archaeological park and agriculture activities manfreda et al 2015 fig 2 shows the flood hydrograph of the december 2013 flood at about 800 m3 s 1 the recorded peak discharge was less than the discharge calculated 1736 53 m3 s 1 for a 30 year return period the discharge expected for a 30 year flood event causes an extension of the flood prone area as shown in fig 1 which demonstrates that the current hydraulic structures along the watercourse are insufficient to contain water flow with a return period of fewer than 30 years table 1 shows the cumulative precipitation values recorded during the three recent flood events these recent flood events along with pressure from local media and farmers regarding the potential role of the dam in flood consequences have led the basilicata watershed authority to adopt a dam management plan specifically the plan aims to increase the lamination effect of the dam without structural changes thereby reserving a specific volume of the dam s reservoir to accommodate the water transiting during a potential flood event allowing for the water s gradual release decreasing the potential peak discharge and hence the potential damages autorit√† di bacino della basilicata 2015 in particular after the watershed authority commissioned single and two dimensional hydraulic modeling sole et al 2013 for the assessment of the effects of hydraulic risk mitigation measures in the final stretch of the bradano and basento rivers 20 mm3 of the dam volume was dedicated to mitigation of potential flood events autorit√† di bacino della basilicata 2015 moreover a structural intervention related to the enlargement of the bridge culvert of the main railways taranto reggio calabria is already underway based only on technical studies led by the basilicata watershed authority autorit√† di bacino della basilicata 2015 although many farmers tourism complex holders and citizens living in the area at risk have pressured decision makers with the help of local media to solve the problem of flooding in the region their involvement in decision making processes has been limited to a few public meetings based on preexisting decisions therefore the current solution may neglect the socio economic aspects of flood risk reduction specific to the study area this suggests that important details and potentially useful information for reducing the flood risk in the area may have been overlooked during the decision making process the identification of this oversight is important as it indicates an insertion point for steps to improve regional flood management in the future 3 methodology following the principles of system thinking and sd forrester 1989 sterman 2000 clds are employed in the present study to construct conceptual models to support flood risk management decision making clds were chosen for their ability to show cause effect relationships between the variables that characterize a dynamic system through a simple graphical structure if simplified clds can easily be understood by non technical users due to their graphical nature making them an ideal modeling tool in a participatory setting kotir et al 2017 depending on the composition of the stakeholder groups and the specific case under analysis various stakeholder engagement tactics can be adopted voinov 2017 in the present study meetings were carried out with single individuals to avoid conflicts between opposing stakeholder groups and to facilite an open and neutral discussion stakeholders tend to have less interest in participating in group meetings than in individual interviews burgin et al 2013 videira et al 2009 since it is often more difficult for individuals to express their views openly in a group setting due to the presence of opposing groups or superiors in their organization for this reason group meetings were omitted in favor of individual interviews problem definition is often considered the most important step in model development because the clear articulation of the problem is essential for defining the purpose of the model its boundaries and time domain at the same time problem definition affects the selection of stakeholders in the modeling process in the current study the problem definition step was carried out by the facilitator through literature reviews discussion with local stakeholders and the study of historical maps after problem definition the selected problem was considered in the context of stakeholder needs and its ability to maintain stakeholder interest throughout the modeling exercise a widely tested framework developed by elias et al 2002 and improved by inam et al 2015 was used whereby once stakeholder analysis was complete the development of individual stakeholder clds was facilitated in a short period of time and with minimal financial resources finally the individual clds were compared and merged into a composite diagram the resulting diagram was discussed in a group stakeholder meeting to create the final group cld using the methodology of bure≈° 2017 the composite cld was reduced and simplified to make the final cld understandable to all stakeholders the overall methodological framework fig 3 used in the present study consists of four main stages stage i problem definition stage ii stakeholder analysis stage iii interviews with stakeholders and construction of the individual cld models followed by model digitization using the vensim software https vensim com stage iv construction of a complex group cld and stage v simplification of the merged cld model the following sections provide a detailed description of each step 3 1 problem definition clear articulation of the problem its boundaries and the timeframe within which it is to be addressed is critical to the success of the modeling process the problem must be defined before proceeding with stakeholder analysis and cld modeling a well prepared and clear definition of the problem aids in stakeholder selection and the definition of clear objectives making it possible to determine the appropriate level and methods of engagement reed 2008 the five main phases of problem definition include i selection of the problem theme and key variables ii selection of the time horizon iii definition of model limits and boundaries iv development of reference models for example a graphic representation of change over time that represent the dynamic behavior of the problem and v identification of relevant stakeholder groups the definition of the problem is an iterative process after stakeholder analysis it can be modified and even completely changed if stakeholders consider it necessary 3 2 stakeholder analysis once the problem has been defined it is necessary to identify the stakeholders who should be involved in the modeling process several methods of carrying out stakeholder analysis exist brugha and varvasovszky 2000 mitchell et al 1997 elias et al 2002 reed et al 2009 and the approach varies according to the type of problem for example lindenberg and crosby 1981 suggested making an inventory of those who could have a role in decision making gauging their importance through their level of influence and their interest in a particular outcome mapping the relationships between these actors and understanding their potential for developing alliances stakeholder analysis is also used to understand the diverse range of potentially conflicting stakeholder interests therefore the process of stakeholder analysis can exacerbate and generate conflict in some cases stakeholders may have hidden agendas or covert interests that may also skew the analysis and expressed concerns over research objectivity since those undertaking the analysis often do so from a particular perspective or with particular outcomes in mind the current study uses the framework proposed by inam et al 2015 to render the resulting structure more complete inclusive and versatile than other approaches the process occurs in four main phases i listing all stakeholders including marginal stakeholders ii categorizing them according to their roles iii prioritizing them according to their attributes and iv final selection based on the developed power and interest grid a preliminary list of stakeholders can be effectively developed using an approach that identifies relevant stakeholders either through a literature survey or based on the individual s local knowledge in the current study interested stakeholders were then asked to identify other relevant stakeholders this process also termed brainstorming may involve seemingly marginal stakeholders brugha and varvasovszky 2000 to find gaps in the first brainstorming step and to look for relevant parties who may have been omitted the list is further categorized according to each stakeholder s role as defined by the european commission 2003 as decision makers users implementers or experts following the methodology of mitchell et al 1997 the interested stakeholder is further classified according to three relational attributes i e power legitimacy and urgency entities with no power legitimacy or urgency concerning the problem are not stakeholders and are perceived as having no salience the stakeholder analysis is finalized by creating a power vs interest grid crosby and bryson 2005 that consists of a map showing the level of interest of each key stakeholder regarding the problem in relation to their power notably during the process stakeholder attributes may evolve in light of modifications to the state of the system or strategic issues in this way the final selection of stakeholders involves representatives in all roles i e decision makers users implementers and experts who are related to at least one of the attributes of power legitimacy urgency or interest 3 3 stakeholder interviews for the construction of individual clds after stakeholder analysis is complete potential stakeholders are contacted for individual interviews that involve the construction of individual clds that express their views regarding the problem to be addressed the cld is a modeling tool developed to represent the complex and dynamic nature of system behavior it responds to the requirements of the sd approach by treating organizations as systems made up of interacting parts instead of examining isolated events and their causes clds are excellent for quickly capturing stakeholder hypotheses regarding the causes of sd eliciting and capturing the mental models of individuals or teams and communicating the feedbacks that a stakeholder believes to be contributing to a problem clds have been successfully used in water resource planning policy analysis sustainable development and natural resource management prodanovic and simonovic 2007 sendzimir et al 2007 clds also feature feedback loops that are important for understanding sd a closed cycle is either defined as a reinforcing or balancing feedback loop a positive feedback loop generates reinforcing behavior that contributes to exponential growth in a system while a negative feedback loop generates balancing behavior that acts as an equilibrator in a system the process of cld development is based on a methodology that provides a useful start up framework for the group model building approach and addresses important questions about the principal setup of a group model building exercise vennix 1996 the steps of the framework are described below 1 a stakeholder e g a local farmer is presented with the purpose of the mental model exercise and through a simple example instructed in the method of drawing a cld colored sticky notes and large sheets of plain paper are provided to the stakeholder to allow them to create their mental model 2 the stakeholder inserts the problem variable at the center of the sheet 3 the stakeholder is then asked to add what they consider to be the causes of the problem first the direct or first order causes followed by the indirect or second order causes and last any higher order causes on the left side of the problem variable using sticky notes the causes are joined through causal links and the polarity and directionality of arrows are added 4 next the direct and indirect consequences of the problem or the first second and higher order consequences are added to the right of the problem variable likewise causal links with polarities are defined among the consequences 5 finally the causes and consequences are joined through feedback loops the following types of questions are asked during the interview to help each stakeholder develop their cld 1 how has the problem developed over time 2 what are the main direct and indirect causes of the problem s development including link polarities 3 what are the consequences of the problem 4 what are the main feedback processes 5 what kinds of short term policies do you think could be adopted to solve this problem 6 what kinds of long term policies could be adopted to solve this problem 7 what are the main obstacles to the success of these policies depending on stakeholder availability one of three interview options is adopted when time is limited e g 15 min the interview is recorded and subsequently translated into a cld by the facilitator the cld created by the facilitator is sent to the stakeholder so they may verify whether the diagram represents their point of view when the interviewee s availability is slightly longer e g 30 min a preliminary diagram prepared by the facilitator is presented to the interviewer and they are asked to correct the diagram and add missing links if a stakeholder has sufficient time e g greater than one hour the modeling exercise is started from scratch and the stakeholder carries out each step through the construction of the clds stakeholders express their views regarding the problem its causes its consequences the feedback loops involved and the strategies and policies that could be applied to address the problem all policy options are included in the diagram as policy variables important loops are numbered and labeled based on their reinforcing or balancing behavior furthermore for quick reference the loops are named according to the process they represent after the completion of the stakeholder interview phase the facilitator translates all cld models into digital computer models using the sd modeling software vensim dss https vensim com 3 4 construction of an overall group cld after carrying out all stakeholder interviews and developing the individual clds the facilitator s construct a preliminary diagram by analyzing comparing and merging all individual clds the composite diagram is then discussed in a stakeholder group meeting to create a final group cld shared by all the stakeholders the merged model aims to represent the different points of view and mental models maps of all stakeholders with respect to the problem its causes its consequences the involved feedback loops and the possible strategies and policies that could be employed to address the problem this makes it possible to highlight the perspectives of different stakeholders and develop a representative mental map of the system considering both complementary and controversial elements the resulting combined cld model includes the divergent perspectives of all key stakeholders those that were interested in participating and can be used to describe the qualitative behavior of the system through different reinforcing and balancing loops this type of qualitative analysis cannot be used to infer quantitative behavior but serves other purposes including detection of the critical problem identification of knowledge gaps for further research enhancement of stakeholder understanding detection of conflicts of interest and facilitation of decisions related to long term policies merging the individual models of several stakeholders can enhance the details of the model so that sub models on various aspects of the problem can be identified the proposed study uses the approach of inam et al 2015 for generating a comprehensive model that includes the diverging perspectives of stakeholders addressing conflict and controversies that arise during the merging process of individual clds it is essential however to avoid a complex mental model as complexity makes the model less intuitive and reduces stakeholders ability to engage and identify the assumptions underpinning the model s causal links complexity is an issue in the sd realm as it restricts the ability of stakeholders with limited modeling skills to understand complex holistic systems the current study seeks to develop a flood risk management process that is accessible to a wide variety of stakeholders through the establishment of a tool to simplify the representation of complex systems and make them understandable this was achieved through the cld simplification approach suggested by bure≈° 2017 and explained in the following section 3 5 simplification of the overall group cld as mentioned above the combination of the individual clds can produce an unwieldy final group cld model sedlacko et al 2014 leading to incorrect inferences mirchi et al 2012 moreover if the analyzed environmental problem involves different administrative regions in addition to different types of stakeholders further conflicts may arise due to stakeholders with differing viewpoints proposing completely different mitigation actions for the various regions involved according to bure≈° 2017 by building a simplified cld model the complexity of the final cld is reduced and as seen in the present work these limitations can be overcome a small model is often sufficient to explain problem dynamics and build intuition regarding appropriate responses ghaffarzadegan et al 2011 therefore it is necessary to improve the readability of visual system representations the methodology presented here is based on the initial construction of the cld using duplicate variables as the input to other variables bure≈° 2017 in fact single crossing links which create intersections that add considerably to the complexity of the diagram have been avoided in order to improve overall diagram readability the method is built around three main activities endogenization encapsulation and order oriented reduction i the endogenization step involves an initial simplification of the model through the deletion of exogenous system variables to make the diagram fully endogenous ii the encapsulation step entails the selection and elimination of all variables that have a single input and a single output subsequently based on the principle used to define the feedback loop polarity sterman 2000 a new polarity for the connection between variables is established these steps are repeated until the model no longer includes individual input and output variables iii the order oriented reduction step consists of marking and deleting all single input double output variables along with double input single output variables to increase the readability of the diagram these simplification actions can be carried out individually or consecutively in general endogenization is preferable to encapsulation and encapsulation is preferable to order oriented reduction once the reduced cld is obtained the facilitator visits stakeholders to verify that the merged diagram still represents their point of view after the simplification and elimination of variables 4 results the bradano river case study presented here investigates the level of stakeholder engagement in evaluating the causes consequences and policies for flood management through a participatory modeling approach from the onset of the study s preliminary interview phase individual cld development with each stakeholder stakeholders confirmed that flooding of the bradano was a critical problem for the region see section 4 3 without requiring that the interested groups have any technical experience the cld methodology was found to be effective in terms of both cost and time after an introductory 20 to 30 minute session nearly all stakeholders were able to apply the method and build a cld from beginning to end the practical application of the methodology is discussed in the following section 4 1 stage 1 problem definition due to the significant damages caused by recent flood events flood risk in the area under investigation is receiving close attention from stakeholders and the media the particularly intense meteorological phenomena that affected basilicata between the period of 2010 to 2013 contributed to hydrogeological issues such as the flooding of rivers and streams as well as landslides this resulted in serious damage to infrastructure and public and private buildings in such cases timely and informed decision making becomes increasingly important an innovative modeling tool able to simulate socio economic and environmental interactions through feedbacks to propose sustainable management solutions can be applied to enhance decision making abilities the qualitative modeling approach proposed in the current study addresses the communication gap between the authorities and stakeholders and provides a management solution for flooding along the bradano river as defined through the engagement of interested stakeholders 4 2 stage 2 stakeholder analysis stakeholder analysis is the process of categorizing and filtering stakeholders based on their roles attributes and interests in the first step a preliminary list of stakeholders was created by the facilitator through a brainstorming process the preliminary list comprised all stakeholders including those considered to be marginal a literature review and expert opinion showed that the basilicata watershed authority and san giuliano dam management authority were important stakeholders in the bradano flood analysis the dam plays a crucial role in the management of water resources and some stakeholders believe it was the main cause of flooding in 2011 the watershed authority establishes the perimeter of flood prone areas for all the rivers in the basilicata region and oversees hydraulic risk management documentation and projects the organization for damage assistance for residents was contacted as it has been involved in helping residents affected by past events the road authority was also considered since such infrastructure reduces the outflow capacity of the riverbed during flood events the early warning authority was considered due to its role in post event flood emergency management and since it collects data regarding precipitation farmers who suffered flood damages in past years were also important stakeholders other stakeholders included the regional agricultural department local authorities e g municipality and tourism authorities in the next step stakeholders were categorized as experts decision makers implementers or users using the framework developed by the european commission 2003 such categorization helps in the assessment of missing links in the initial stakeholder identification the stakeholder categories and their roles are summarized in fig 4 after stakeholder identification and categorization stakeholders were contacted the preliminary list was shared and identified stakeholders were asked for suggestions about potential missing stakeholders most contacted stakeholders were satisfied with the list but suggested adding the water cycle authority as they thought that it might help provide further information about public areas close to the river stakeholders were then categorized based on their attributes this step helps to track changes in stakeholder dynamics over time a stakeholder s changing role can be measured by the loss or gain of one or more attributes for this purpose the complete methodology developed by mitchell et al 1997 which classifies stakeholders based on three relational attributes power legitimacy and urgency was used fig 5 definitive stakeholders were classified as those who possessed all three attributes these stakeholders were considered to be the most important stakeholders to include in the qualitative modeling exercise in the current study the definitive stakeholders were the early warning organization the regional agricultural department the basilicata watershed authority the san giuliano dam management authority and the infrastructure management authority in addition the power vs interest grid approach developed by crosby and bryson 2005 was completed to prioritize stakeholders fig 6 reveals that the basilicata watershed authority the regional agricultural department and the san giuliano dam management authority have high power and high interest levels hence they were considered the most important stakeholders with regards to flood management in the study area finally based on stakeholder analysis and stakeholder recommendations the basilicata watershed authority the san giuliano dam management authority local farmers the organization in charge of damage assistance for residents and the infrastructure management authority were included in the individual cld modeling process 4 3 stage 3 stakeholder interviews and individual cld preparation during the process of developing individual clds the authors of this paper facilitated the interview process which involved meeting with individual stakeholders over a period of eight weeks in general the stakeholders showed confidence in the modeling exercise and were satisfied with the representation of their mental maps through the clds individual cld modeling begins with the selection of a problem variable when stakeholders were initially asked to point out the main problem in the study area based on the damage inflicted by past events the majority pointed to the flooding of the bradano river the next step involves adding direct and indirect causes of flooding in the study area different stakeholders expressed different perspectives but generally they identified water depth exceeding safe limits as the main contributor to flooding some stakeholders believed that inadequate maintenance of the riverbed and levees was one of the primary causes of the floods in their opinion these structures created obstacles effectively reducing the river channel s hydraulic section so that the outflow capacity of the river was insufficient to contain the rising water some stakeholders pointed to the management of the san giuliano dam emphasizing the need to improve dam management and highlighting the fundamental role the dam has had in past flood events however this view contrasted with that of stakeholders who viewed the dam management as satisfactory in terms of irrigation and flood water management other stakeholders believed that the railway and route ss 106 which cross the river see fig 1 contributed to a reduction of the river s hydraulic section by presenting obstacles to river outflow thus causing water depth to exceed safe limits another cause highlighted by stakeholders was the maintenance of the drainage channels that interfere with the basento river which is located near the study area the next stage in the cld building process was the stakeholder led identification of significant direct and indirect consequences of the bradano river floods major consequences included various economic environmental social and agricultural damages for example loss of life reduction of production damage to economic activities farms and zoo technical enterprises infrastructure tourism complexes and the interruption of activities caused by the closure of roads and the railway one of the main strengths of sd modeling is that the model s flexibility allows for the inclusion of all causes and consequences the developed model structure was then analyzed for feedback relationships between the causes and consequences fig 7 provides a simple example representing two different policies suggested by two different stakeholders the figure also describes the basic steps used by these stakeholders to develop their clds in the first feedback loop riverbed maintenance the bradano flood is marked as the problem variable maintenance of the riverbed and presence of aggregates and gravel are marked as direct and indirect causes while damage to productive activities and city planning modification were added as direct and indirect consequences finally city planning modification was linked with the presence of aggregates and gravel through a feedback loop which connects the consequence with the cause and indicates the dynamics of the system policy a control of riverbed maintenance is represented by a balancing loop which indicates that this policy if implemented will balance out the current impacts of the presence of aggregates and gravel in the future see fig 7 in the second feedback loop protection plan flood events increase economic losses which in turn cause a reduction in recreational activities reduction in recreational activities forces the government to adopt some protection plans these plans cause a reduction in floodplain activities and thereby reduce flooding policy b in fig 7 named protection plan will have a reinforcing effect meaning that this policy if implemented would contribute to a reduction in bradano river flooding each stakeholder prepared their cld independently during the entire process the facilitator helped solely with procedural issues and remained neutral to ensure the development of unbiased qualitative mental models once stakeholder views in the form of causes consequences and feedback loops were expressed in the cld stakeholders were asked by the facilitator what kind of policies do you think would be effective in the mitigation of the flood problem in the study area all stakeholders agreed that better management of the riverbed could help reduce the amount of flood damage which they further indicated as a cost effective management solution almost all stakeholders agreed that proper cleaning of the drainage channels was necessary to avoid the accumulation of vegetation which often prevents the normal flow of water causing an increase in flood intensity these kinds of management options were identified as short term policies some stakeholders believed that the role of the dam was insignificant in past flooding events while others pointed to poor dam management and suggested that past events were triggered by the opening of the spillway as this situation required further analysis through quantitative modeling exercises both options were included in the merged model diagram some stakeholders believed that damage could be avoided by changing the type of crop cultivated in the riverbank areas furthermore depending on the type of crops cultivated farmers could benefit from this policy since the water could also help in the production or maturation of some products this was considered to be a long term policy some local authorities proposed the construction of a levee on the left side of the river with a storage area to collect drainage water from any overflow of the territory s drainage channels given their poor maintenance 4 4 cld merging in the current research individual stakeholder clds were merged the final combined cld represents a holistic view of the complete system the merging process was initiated with the most comprehensive model i e the model with the maximum numbers of variables the process continued with the incorporation of additional variables until each of the stakeholder viewpoints were represented all controversies and conflicting ideas were indicated in the merged diagram for future discussions when all stakeholders were present stakeholders were asked to attend one follow up group meeting to finalize the merged cld wide ranging discussions regarding the group s opinions on the details of the merged cld and any controversies were encouraged during this meeting this process also allowed stakeholders to share their ideas the preliminary merged diagram i e the overall cld fig 8 generated by moderators and then simplified as described in section 4 6 was in a later stage presented to stakeholders to elicit their opinions regarding the overall model 4 5 merged cld sub processes and management options the complete merged model consists of seven loops fig 8 covering details and qualitative dynamics of different sub processes such as agricultural activity economic damage dam maintenance and infrastructure maintenance several processes policies and both local and global feedback loops were identified loop 1 the floodplain activity loop indicated in green in fig 8 shows the balancing effect of the bradano floods on residential structures close to the river an increase in flooding leads to an increase in residential damage which in turn leads to a reduction in structural value thereby reducing floodplain activities the presence of activities in flooded areas makes the soil impermeable and in case of an event leads to a greater expansion of the floodplain conversely flooding implies a greater water residence time within the watershed and possible water contamination leading to a reduction in agricultural activities within the study area this in turn leads to better maintenance of the levees by reducing the constant presence of farmers on adjacent land which inevitably has a negative impact on their maintenance loop 2 maintenance of the levees loop indicated in orange fig 8 agricultural activities also have a negative effect on maintenance of the drainage channels located close to the river as farmers keep these areas clean for cultivation but in doing so move large amounts of vegetation into the channels causing a narrowing of the river section which reduces the outflow capacity of the riverbed loop 3 maintenance of the drainage channels loop indicated in orange fig 8 in terms of economic damage stakeholders highlighted the need to review flood compensation and insurance policies and to apply new laws to avoid the reoccurrence of disagreements that took place after past flood events stakeholders also identified that new laws should allow the removal of environmental constraints from business and public properties so that authorities can carry out routine maintenance of the riverbed thereby reducing the manning s roughness coefficient and consequently the water depth in the river loop 4 economic damage loop indicated in black fig 8 tourism attraction modeled by loop 5 exhibited a balancing effect as the bradano floods initially cause a decrease in the attractiveness of riverside tourism which leads to changes in urban planning to facilitate the protection of cultural heritage and tourism facilities loop 5 tourism attraction loop indicated in blue fig 8 the balancing nature of the loop indicates that tourism will decrease for only a short duration and that after a change in urban planning to protect the region s cultural heritage the tourism in the study area will recover some stakeholders thought that greater awareness could lead to better information about hydraulic risk greater awareness of flood risk can be leveraged to pressure government agencies to improve the maintenance of infrastructure and to avoid constructing roads and railways that act as obstacles to river flow these improvements would lead to an increase in the dimension of the hydraulic section which in turn would cause a reduction in water depth loop 6 awareness loop indicated in magenta fig 8 information from the media has a positive impact on dam management which leads to a reduction of the discharge in case of a flood wave and contributes to reduced water depth the dam maintenance loop addresses the reservations of some stakeholders who were convinced that the dam was the main cause of the 2011 flood event they believed that heavy rainfall led to the opening of the dam s bottom spillway flooding a large area and causing damage to agricultural activities residential structures tourism complexes and infrastructures loop 7 management of the dam loop indicated in fuchsia fig 8 4 6 simplification of the merged diagram the merged final diagram presented in fig 8 was complex and difficult for stakeholders to understand stakeholders failed to identify important feedback loops and faced difficulty in capturing the underlying themes of the fundamental version of the working model therefore the complex merged diagram was simplified using the cld simplification approach recommended by bure≈° 2017 the main purpose of this simplification was to facilitate stakeholder understanding of the system however the authors acknowledge that the simplified cld might fail to represent correct system boundaries and behavior due to the elimination of some important processes and variables hence in a companion study the final merged model fig 8 will be used as a base model for developing a quantitative sd simulation model fig 9 shows a simplified graphic representation of the diagram the symbol on the arrow is associated with a positive link while the symbol represents a negative link the connection between dam maintenance and water depth is marked with an exclamation point which means that the stakeholders have conflicting opinions regarding the effects of dam maintenance on water depth important activities were identified as floodplain activities and agricultural activities these activities negatively affect levees and drainage channel maintenance within the basin resulting in increased flood risk other important loops are the awareness and dam maintenance loops as the dominancy of the awareness loop increases dam maintenance increases and vice versa the simple cld also highlights effects of flooding on tourism and economic growth in the area the simplification process was carried out through three main activities namely endogenization encapsulation and order oriented reduction as suggested by bure≈° 2017 finally the simplified diagram fig 9 was introduced to all eight stakeholders who found that it was an appropriate and acceptable representation of the system it is evident that the reduced diagram fig 9 is simpler than the pre reduction cld fig 8 the number of loops and the main themes are the same in both figures but it was possible for all the stakeholders in particular non experts to understand the simplified diagram fig 9 and to focus on the real issues addressed in the case study furthermore the reduced number of variables helped to avoid misunderstandings and misinterpretations in the reduced cld water depth remains the primary causative factor in flooding however other significant variables are highlighted such as the maintenance of the riverbed the presence of floodplain agricultural activities and city planning modifications 5 discussion the purpose of the current study was to demonstrate the usefulness of applying clds to involve key stakeholders in the initial stages of socio economic environmental model development facilitate stakeholder discussion and develop an integrated perspective on complex issues in flood risk management the methodology proposed in the study can help bridge the communication gap between policymakers and local stakeholders other benefits include but are not limited to increasing social awareness about a problem of interest improving understanding of socio economic and environmental interactions building knowledge of a complex holistic system using a simple approach and improving the role of stakeholders in decision making regarding the specific case study analyzed stakeholders highlighted the importance of the additional inputs provided by the present study to management policies for flood risk mitigation in the study area recent and planned mitigation actions i e the san giuliano dam lamination plan and an extension of the railway bridge tunnel respectively were implemented as a result of media pressure or based only on technical judgment with limited involvement of local stakeholders this situation highlights the importance of participatory modeling to incorporate the knowledge of key stakeholders for a holistic view of the complex system this study is first of its kind for flood risk management in the bradano river overall stakeholders appreciated the flexibility of the cld method and found it to be useful cost effective and simple to understand they further agreed that the final merged diagram represented a holistic view of dynamic system processes and therefore can be used to increase awareness and understanding of the interactions between different system components furthermore they appreciated the transparency of the process the approach was easily understood by non modeling professionals and provided them with support during the dialogue processes stakeholders were able to consider different management policies and the results revealed socio economic and territorial aspects of the issue that had not been considered by other studies in particular farmers believed the final cld will help increase collaboration with decision makers turning decision makers attention to their opinions also the farmers stated that the final cld has increased their comprehension of the interactions between causes and consequences of the systems moreover the water basin authority believes that the proposed approach could support them in their compliance with the eu flood directive that requires public participation in the preparation of a flood management plan e g 2007 60 ec art 10 a few others were skeptical from the beginning that clds could effectively affect decision makers but they remained impressed by the clear framework developed using clds with minimal effort on their part this demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed approach which successfully fostered policy coordination between stakeholders from different sectors groups levels and interests the model was developed with broad boundaries and included diverse socio economic and physical variables for example components that were included in the current model such as land use changes damage compensation floodplain activities and stakeholder awareness had not been previously investigated in this region the present study addresses the need for a modeling tool that facilitates understanding of the dynamics of flood risk management from both environmental and socio economic perspectives indeed this paper covers the first phase of a long term study in which the authors are involved the scoping phase i e qualitative modeling using clds is described in the current paper while in subsequent papers model quantification testing and institutionalization will be discussed in particular the present paper examines the development of a qualitative sd modeling approach for stakeholder engagement in flood risk management in another planned study the group built cld fig 8 discussed in this manuscript will be used as a base model for developing a quantitative sd simulation model to simulate the socio economic aspects and technical measures of flood risk management in an integrated way finally the linking dynamic coupling of more detailed physically based models and group built sd models will be an important future research focus for flood risk management in the bradano river along with other locations the results of the case study indicate that clds are an effective and simple method to initialize stakeholder engagement the method was helpful in the development of qualitative models aimed at addressing complex issues such as flood risk management qualitative models enable stakeholders to share their opinions and learn from each other to develop a more in depth and holistic understanding of the system under investigation 6 conclusion this study is the first of its kind aimed at creating an integrated analysis of the issue of flood risk management with the active participation of stakeholders through cld modeling the results of the case study indicate that the proposed cld method was helpful in the development of qualitative mental models aimed at addressing complex issues such as flood risk management stakeholders were easily engaged due to the simplicity and limited costs in terms of time of the interview process they each created individual clds without any previous experience with sd modeling and in a few cases with limited technical skills related to the topic the individual interview format created an open environment for stakeholders to share their opinions moreover all stakeholders were able to understand the simplified version of the merged group cld the participating stakeholders were satisfied with the modeling process and the simplified group cld model many were surprised by the transparency of the process and enthusiastic about how well they were able to depict aspects of a complex system in a clear simple and understandable way in particular the overall group cld model highlighted problems in the study area that had not been considered in previous studies the cld exercise allowed key stakeholders from different organizations and groups to learn from each other and develop a more in depth and holistic understanding of the system under investigation leading to increased social awareness group learning and consensus building the knowledge of the problem obtained through the participatory modeling approach went beyond the information that was gathered from the literature review and pre existing hydraulic studies the proposed methodological framework was applied to initialize stakeholder engagement in flood risk management in the bradano river delta in italy however the modular structure and the universal nature of the employed methods make the proposed scheme scalable supporting its application in other territorial contexts the above mentioned characteristics of the proposed approach also permit its extension to rainfall induced shallow landslides i e the most common natural hazards in some areas of the world peruccacci et al 2017 manenti et al 2019 through a correct and clear definition of the problem key variables and time horizon water related risks are complex and dynamic issues the methodology proposed here can be used to construct a holistic representation of the risk system by analyzing the behavior and the connection between different socio economic variables and integrating stakeholder perspectives in future research the clds constructed by stakeholders will be quantified in a sd modeling environment and coupled with a physically based model to evaluate the consequences of the stakeholders proposed policies by considering stakeholder perspectives as well as social environmental economic and physical aspects of the problem effective flood risk management decision making in the region is supported

5988,the most of the available drought indices do not incorporate the environmental changes in the present scenario of climate change in an attempt to encompass the climate variability in the computation of meteorological drought a non stationary gamma distribution with climate indices in its location parameter as a covariate is proposed the performance of the non stationary drought is evaluated based on the statistical performance as compared to the stationary drought focusing on two himalayan states in india the meteorological drought events are described and assessed based on the stationary and non stationary drought index moreover the bivariate analysis of different drought properties is carried out and compared with the univariate analysis the management indices such as reliability resilience and vulnerability are also computed based on the developed drought index the results in the study indicate that in most of the cases the non stationary drought index is capable of capturing the drought characteristics over the study areas the variability in the probability density of different drought properties is observed under 12 month drought scale in most of the cases during bivariate analysis a compare difference is noticed between secondary and primary return periods moreover higher reliability and resilience is noticed during 12 month scale drought period the newly developed drought index and the copula based analysis of drought properties provide a new concept for robust and effective management practices in the changing environment keywords climate indices copula meteorological drought himalayan states non stationary drought 1 introduction drought characterises the deficit of available water as compared to the average natural water availability normal level is one of the most complex prevailing natural hazards wang et al 2015b and recurring extreme climate event dai 2011 due to spatio temporal variability in the characteristics drought brings immense social environmental and economical consequences all over the globe soƒæ√°kov√° et al 2014 wilhite et al 2007 the growing pressure on water and other natural resources increase the vulnerability to drought which imparts more uncertainty to the research community for timely assessment and comprehensive evaluation of the adverse drought impacts wilhite et al 2007 as discussed by soƒæ√°kov√° et al 2014 the complexity of drought characterisation and evaluation increases due to the difficulty in formulating the proper definition of drought its erratic spatio temporal variability and impact incomplete understating of anthropogenic influences in triggering the drought characteristics in general the drought onset is initiated from the meteorological situations which includes the climatic conditions and variability the meteorological drought further leads to the hydrological drought which further impacts the agricultural productivity causing agricultural drought subsequently the socio economic drought differs markedly as it is closely related to the precipitation hao and aghakouchak 2013 as a consequence of climate variability and anthropogenic perturbations different studies show that drought hazards are likely to become more frequent and widespread in coming decades li et al 2013a b villarini et al 2011 wang et al 2015a india has a large geographical area having most of the parts blanket with agriculture according to murthy sesha sai 2010 68 agricultural land is vulnerable to drought conditions and 50 area of the vulnerable agricultural land is exposed to more frequent severe drought condition which in turn is going to affect country s economy extensively the long term 1901 2004 analysis of drought variability indicates the increasing trend in drought frequency and severity over india mallya et al 2015 in a recent study by mishra et al 2016 stated that a drought event during 2014 15 with a return period of 542 years caused severe scarcity of water and about 330 million people were affected in this sense it is indispensable to understand the drought from multi perspectives as it has direct consequences on socio economic aspects especially in india zhang et al 2017 although there is no precise definition of the drought the simplest way to monitor the drought conditions is through different drought indices li et al 2015 based on the applicability different drought indices were developed in past few decades the indices include but are not limited to standardised precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 standardised runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 standardised hydrological index shi sharma and panu 2010 due to computational simplicity and capability of evaluating the drought severity at different time scales spi as a probabilistic based index is considered as one of the robust indices russo et al 2013 wen et al 2011 moreover spi index is barely affected by the seasonal and topographical variations hayes et al 1999 therefore in the present investigation spi index is used the computation of spi primarily requires the long term precipitation series which is then fitted to gamma distribution under stationary assumption the stationary assumption suggests that the parameters of the gamma distribution won t change with respect to the time however with the increasing pace of climate variability the stationary behaviour in the computation of drought index is questionable moreover for the longer time series more than 30 years stationary gamma distribution is not able to model the drought as the influence of climate signals in longer time series is likely to be significant russo et al 2013 therefore inclusion of non stationary behaviour into the analysis is of paramount importance to formulate suitable adaptation and mitigation strategies the non stationarity can be introduced by encompassing the large scale climate oscillations in the computation of spi trenberth et al 2014 advocated that the large scale oscillation such as el ni√±o southern oscillation enso has significant impact on episodic droughts around the world hence it is necessary to identify the linkage between large scale climate variability and precipitation patterns and many studies have been accomplished to examine the same for example hu and feng 2001 kim et al 2006 cai et al 2010 he and guan 2013 meza 2013 among others in indian context ajayamohan and rao 2008 examined the association among the indian ocean dipole iod and extreme precipitation events and found that extreme precipitation is strongly modulated by iod agilan and umamahesh 2018 in a recent study while modelling the extreme precipitation event suggested that soi is the best enso index to model the extreme precipitation intensity for monsoon as well as non monsoon seasons not only the identification but also the analysis of the different drought properties is crucial for sustainable drought management practices as climatological and hydrological variables are interdependent multivariate analysis is widely adopted to understand their dependence structure sadegh et al 2017 drought as a complex and multivariate phenomenon drought characteristics such as duration severity and peak need to be modelled using the multivariate technique one of the most commonly used multivariate analysis method is known as copula which models the interdependency structure of two or more random variables in hydrological studies copula has been used extensively and a few examples include between peak flow and volume favre et al 2004 precipitation and soil moisture aghakouchak 2015 precipitation and groundwater level reddy and ganguli 2012 vegetation drought and extreme events jha et al 2019 among extreme precipitation indices goswami et al 2018 drought severity and duration lee et al 2013 hence in the present study we have preferred multivariate analysis to univariate analysis and the approach is detailed in the methodology section expecting to provide a new prospective of drought identification and analysis of drought properties the present study proposes and applies a non stationary drought index encompassing the large scale climate oscillations to monitor the drought events robustly the non stationary analysis is carried out using the generalized additive model in location scale and shape gamlss package developed by rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 the drought properties such as duration severity and peak are analysed using multivariate technique called copula which will enable the water resources planner to incorporate effective drought management practices salvi ghosh 2016 analysed the future extreme dry and wet conditions incorporating the time as a linear variant in the gamma distribution over india however the impact of large scale oscillations on drought events was not analysed in their study to the best of the authors knowledge the present study is one of the first studies in india to model the non stationary drought incorporating large scale climate oscillations and evaluate the different drought properties based on the non stationary drought using bivariate approach the analysis is carried out using the high resolution 0 25ox0 25 long term 1901 2004 precipitation data the details of the study area and the data used are presented in section 2 the brief discussion about the opted methodologies is explained in section 3 the results and discussion of the investigation are illustrated in section 4 finally the significant outcomes from the study are presented in section 5 2 study area and data used in the present study two different himalayan states are considered viz sikkim and uttarakhand according to the national mission on himalayan studies nmhs indian himalayan region ihr covers 7 states namely jammu kashmir himachal pradesh uttarakhand arunachal pradesh sikkim manipur and tripura in the present study we have chosen two states based on their geographical locations i e sikkim from northeast region and uttarakhand from the northern part the sikkim is situated in eastern himalayan region with a geographical area about 7096 km2 fig 1 b the capital of the sikkim i e gangtok is a place of tourist attraction and the tiny state is divided into four districts i e east west north and south district most of the population about 70 depend on agriculture and forest products which are highly sensitive to the climate change for their livelihood azhoni and goyal 2018 rice and maize are the main crops and are grown over 20 of the geographical area more than 98 of water is used for the irrigation purpose the precipitation trend analysis suggests a changing trend over eastern himalayas i e north sikkim singh and goyal 2016 and this trend will become more erratic in foreseen future the increasing crop water stress variability in precipitation and increasing in temperature could have significant impact on social cultural and economical aspects which in turn could lead to migration and instabilities biemans et al 2013 goodess 2013 similarly uttarakhand stretches over an area about 53 483 km2 and the geographical coordinates varies from 28o42 n to 31o28 n and 77o35 e to 81o05 e fig 1c the water resources of the state are diverted to fulfil agricultural demand which is 75 of the total demand the scanty rainfall during the winter causes losses in the major rabi crop moreover the variability in the monsoon precipitation is very much localised in time and space with intense precipitation over small duration of time agriculture provides the livelihood to these two himalayan states and the precipitation pattern varies significantly over the states because of their geographical location and variation in the altitude therefore it is necessary to evaluate the precipitation variability which could further lead to the meteorological drought moreover a recent study by guhathakurta et al 2017 showed an increasing trend in the area under drought conditions over sikkim and uttarakhand understanding the social cultural and economical aspects of the himalayan states the present study analyses the long term drought events using the high resolution gridded 0 25 longitude x 0 25 latitude precipitation dataset during 1901 2004 the precipitation dataset is prepared by india meteorological department imd and the details can be obtained from pai et al 2014 as discussed the non stationary modelling of the drought index is carried out using the large scale climate oscillations namely enso indices and iod three enso indices viz sea surface temperature sst southern oscillation index soi

duration of 1901 2004 3 methodology initially all the datasets are collected as discussed in section 2 the areal average of the gridded precipitation is computed for sikkim and uttarakhand and the areal average precipitation is considered as representative precipitation 1901 2004 over the study areas the daily precipitation data is converted to the monthly data and cumulative precipitation for different time periods are computed in the present study 3 6 9 and 12 month time scales are used further some of the past studies incorporated the lag to evaluate the linear association between large scale climate indices and precipitation agilan and umamahesh 2018 hence the large scale atmospheric monthly datasets are arranged according to different lag the lag value varies from 0 to 12 next the correlation test is carried out between the precipitation series of different time scales and the arranged large scale oscillations data in general kendall and spearman correlation tests are adopted to evaluate the teleconnection among the hydrological variables and climate patterns mccormick et al 2009 niu et al 2014 in the present study kendall correlation test is performed at a significance level of 0 05 to evaluate the best lag and best large scale climate oscillations for the precipitation dataset at different time scales the details of the kendall correlation test can be obtained from kendall 1955 the obtained suitable large scale climate oscillations for the appropriate lag will be known as covariate from this point onwards in the paper subsequently the precipitation series at different time scales along with suitable covariates are considered for non stationary analysis using gamlss 3 1 non stationary settings in gamlss the non stationary analysis is performed using r package gamlss https cran r project org web packages gamlss index html this package is widely used as it enables to model the time series with non stationary framework flexibly villarini et al 2010 being a semi parametric regression type model gamlss not only allows to model at location parameter or mean but also other parameters of the distribution of response variable by linear and or nonlinear functions of explanatory variables and or random effects for the brevity a short discussion about the gamlss theory is presented here for the comprehensive details about gamlss readers are advised to consult rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 in gamlss analysis the datasets or the response variables y i f o r i 1 2 n are assumed to be independent and fitted with a distribution function f y y i Œ∏ i where Œ∏ i Œ∏ 1 i Œ∏ 2 i Œ∏ 3 i Œ∏ 4 i denotes different statistical parameters the parameters of the distribution can be location scale shape and kurtosis parameters therefore a monotonic link function g k k represents the parameters of the distribution to the design matrix of the selected covariate in the present study the selected covariates for different time scales of precipitation are varied linearly to the parameters of the distribution from the computation of spi mckee et al 1993 it is noted that the cumulative precipitation series is initially fitted to the gamma distribution therefore the present study incorporates the linear variation of the covariates which ensures the non stationarity condition in the location parameter of the gamma distribution eq 1 a two parameter gamma distribution with location ¬µ and scale œÉ parameters is expressed in eq 2 the comparison between the stationary and non stationary model is carried out based on the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 the optimal model will provide minimum aic value 1 x t gamma Œº t œÉ Œº t c 0 c 1 i 1 t c 2 i 2 t c n i n t where c0 c1 cn are constants for the linear variability and i1 i2 in represent the covariates at time t 2 f x Œº œÉ 1 œÉ 2 Œº 1 œÉ 2 x 1 œÉ 2 1 e x œÉ 2 Œº Œ≥ 1 œÉ 2 x 0 Œº 0 œÉ 0 the parameters of the parametric models are computed based on the maximum likelihood method in the present study to maximize the likelihood an algorithm named after rigby and stasinopoulos rs i e rs algorithm is used as it does not require initial value of the parameters to ensure the convergence and this method is faster for large data sets since the non stationary drought spi index is computed similar to the normal spi the negative values represent the dry and positive values represent as wet condition it should be noted that the classification of non stationary drought index is same as the spi classification mckee et al 1993 it is worth mentioning that in the present study authors have considered 0 8 as a threshold below which all the events are considered as drought the primary motive to consider 0 8 as a threshold is that according to drought severity classification spi index below 0 8 start triggering the damage to the crops and pasture and the details can be obtained from http droughtmonitor unl edu aboutusdm droughtclassification aspx and svoboda et al 2002 therefore all the drought properties are evaluated based on the threshold the classification of the drought is presented in table 1 3 2 identification of different drought properties there are several number of drought identification methods viz the percentile method discrete markov process run analysis etc however the study by bonacci 1993 suggests that the analytical analysis of drought identification using different truncation levels i e threshold level and different methods do not vary significantly moreover the run analysis yevjevich 1967 is most commonly used in the engineering practice and analysis of drought in addition several studies have been used run analysis for the computation of drought properties ganguli and reddy 2012 mishra et al 2009 hence the present study is also used the run analysis for the identification of different drought properties according to the definition of the run theory it is a segment of a drought time series i e drought index where the values are below or above a particular truncation or threshold value based on the truncation level and the definition of the drought properties it can be named as positive or negative run the following three most important drought properties are used in the present analysis severity duration and peak it should be noted that the drought duration is considered as the intervals months where the drought index is below the threshold value the duration is evaluated from the starting of a drought event to the termination of that particular drought event and the minimum length of drought is one month similarly the severity is computed as a cumulative of drought index under the particular drought duration therefore the duration and severity are strongly correlated and also supported by chang and stenson 1990 the computation of severity is presented in eq 3 the peak is defined as the minimum value of the spi for a particular drought duration 3 severit y i t 1 t sp i i t i 1 2 n 1 n 3 3 multivariate analysis of drought properties since the properties of the drought events are interdependent univariate analysis of drought property cannot provide comprehensive analysis of drought therefore the present investigation incorporates bivariate analysis instead of traditional univariate analysis to assess the dependent structure among the drought properties i e duration severity and peak to tackle the proposed analysis of constructing bivariate distribution copula is used moreover the bivariate frequency analysis is carried out after constructing the bivariate distribution sklar 1959 proposed copulas to establish the association between the univariate distribution functions and multivariate distribution functions in particular copulas enable to construct the multivariate distribution based on the univariate distribution the main advantage to construct the copulas is that it can segregate the effect of dependency from the effect of the univariate distribution in general the multivariate distributions are constructed to study the association among the random correlated variable based on the marginal distribution as stated by shiau et al 2007 that copula has several other advantages such as copula can be used to simplify the n variate distributions and marginal distribution parameters are not considered to evaluate the dependence among the random variables although the theory of copula was proposed during late 1950 s it gained recognition in the field of hydro climatology during early 2000 de michele and salvadori 2003 favre et al 2004 for explanation let x and y are two dependent random variables with marginal cumulative distribution function cdf fx x and fy y respectively then f x y x y c f x x f y y 4 where c is defined as copula and f x y x y is denoted as cdf of bivariate distribution with marginal cdf as fx x and fy y it should be noted that c is unique if cdf of the two random variables are continuous the joint probability density function can be obtained eq 5 with the assumption that the marginal density functions of random variables are continuous 5 f x y x y c f x x f y y f x x f y y where f x x f y y represent the probability density function of random variables x and y respectively c denotes the density function of c and is expressed in eq 6 6 c u v 2 c u v u v where u and v are the cdf values of x and y i e fx x and fy y hence the values of u and v varies between 0 and 1 it is worth mentioning that in the present study authors have considered severity duration and peak as correlated random variables and the dependency among different pairs such as severity and duration severity and peak duration and peak are analysed using different copulas the marginal distributions of the drought properties are obtained by considering more than a dozen distributions and the best fitted distribution is selected based on the minimum aic value in case of hydro climatological studies various copula families are used and most of the studies are limited to frank gaussian gumbel clayton and t copula the parameters of different copulas imitate the dependence among the correlated random variables for a detailed mathematical descriptions about different copula families refer to sadegh et al 2017 the present study uses gaussian and frank copula as these two copulas are capable of capturing the entire range of dependence among the variables maity et al 2013 however the gaussian and frank copula belong to the family of elliptical and archimedean respectively the structure and parameters of the selected copulas are expressed concisely and the readers are advised to refer nelsen 2007 and sadegh et al 2017 for details 7 gaussian copula c g u v

standard procedure to evaluate the return period of different hydrological extreme events using the probability distribution the return period of an event is generally defined as average interarrival time between two successive events with a certain magnitude or greater haan 1977 generally frequency analysis incorporates only one hydrological variable in the present study partial duration series of drought is considered in which the series of drought events is obtained based on the truncation level hence the return period of drought severity and duration can be obtained as follows shiau et al 2007 9 t s Œæ 1 f s s 10 t d Œæ 1 f d d 11 t p Œæ 1 f p p where fs s fd d fp p are the marginal cdf of severity drought and peak respectively and Œæ is expressed as n n n spi time series in years and n is number of drought events ganguli and reddy 2013 however due to the interdependence structure among the drought properties the univariate frequency analysis cannot provide comprehensive analysis of return period in this sense bivariate return period can be used to model the drought frequency the bivariate drought frequency analysis is evaluated based on two criteria such as i both severity and duration exceeding a specific value s s a n d d d ii either severity or duration exceeding a specific value s s o r d d shiau 2003 moreover these two conditions are also considered for other sets of drought properties i e severity and peak duration and peak therefore the mathematical expression to compute the return period in both the cases and or are presented in eqs 12 and 13 t ds Œæ p d d s

r d d respectively moreover the similar mathematical expressions can be used to evaluate the return period for other sets of drought properties 4 results 4 1 non stationary based spi drought index for sikkim and uttarakhand the monthly areal average precipitation data are computed and cumulative precipitation series for 3 6 9 and 12 month time scales are prepared for both the states subsequently the large scale climate oscillations are arranged based on different lag i e starting from lag 0 to 12 for different time scales non stationary model is constructed using the gamlss package as described in section 3 1 according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the variability in the climate has observed since 1950 s in this sense the total length of the precipitation series is divided into two parts viz 1901 1950 and 1951 2004 in the present study only the ¬µ parameter of the gamma distribution is linearly varied with different lags of four different climate oscillations the parameter of the gamma distribution is estimated based on the maximum likelihood estimation mle coles et al 2003 stated that parameter estimation using mle provides the flexibility to incorporate different forms of non stationarity it should be noted that the stationary model is also constructed to evaluate the performance among the stationary and non stationary model in case of stationary model the parameters of the gamma distribution are constant in order to evaluate the performance aic criteria is used which also enables to avoid model overfitting and measures the relative quality of the model for the given parameter in general it is considered that lesser the aic value better the model however burnham and anderson 2004 stated that if the difference in aic value among two models is more than equal to 2 then there exists substantial evidence of being different in particular the evaluation of the better model is performed based on two criteria i the model should have less aic value than the other model and ii the difference in aic value between two models must be greater than equal to 2 the significant lag of large scale atmospheric oscillations is evaluated based on the kendall correlation test at a significance level of 0 05 the analysis is carried out for all the time scales and the obtained outcomes are presented in table 2 from the table 2 it can be noted that for sikkim sst and iod have significant influence at various lags in most of the time scales however in case of uttarakhand almost all the climate oscillations have significant impact at different time scales for instance the 12 month cumulative precipitation at sikkim is significantly related with soi at 12 month lag i e previous year similarly sst and mei exhibit concurrent association i e no lag with the 12 month cumulative precipitation therefore the climate oscillations with appropriate lag are selected as covariates to the non stationary model as discussed the comparative analysis among the stationary and non stationary model is carried out according to the aic criterion and the results are presented in table 3 it can be observed from table 3 that 3 and 6 month cumulative precipitation at sikkim is better modelled by the stationary approach based on the selection criteria adopted in the present study however in uttarakhand non stationary approach provides better performance than the stationary approach under all time scales moreover it can be noted that the difference among the stationary and non stationary model is becoming more significant from 3 month scale to the 12 month scale 4 2 comparison of drought characteristics based on the drought classification as presented in table 1 and the opted truncation level the occurrence frequency of drought is computed by the stationary and non stationary approaches the results are compared for both the approaches under different drought classifications based on the threshold level the comparison is carried out for moderate d1 severe d2 extreme d3 and exceptional d4 drought classifications from stationary and non stationary based analysis of the drought index it is observed that non stationary drought index is more suitable for all the time scales in uttarakhand based on the statistical measure hence drought classifications under different time scales for uttarakhand are selected as example to further explain the comparison results among stationary and non stationary approach the comparative analysis of drought classification during 3 and 6 month are presented in fig 2 a d and 9 and 12 month are shown under fig 2 e h from fig 2 a d it can be noted that there is lower percentage of occurrence for d1 events based on the non stationary drought index for all the time periods under 3 and 6 month time scales however higher frequency of occurrence is noticed in d3 events under 3 and 6 month time scale during 1901 1950 and 1951 2004 respectively according to fig 2 e h it is observed that percentage of occurrence of 12 month scale droughts during 1901 1950 fig 2 g and 1951 2004 fig 2 h are significantly varied under stationary and non stationary assumptions for instance under non stationary condition the percentage of occurrence of d1 and d2 has increased significantly as compared to the stationary approach and there is lower percentage of occurrence for d3 and d4 events based on the non stationary approach fig 2 h similarly from the comparative analysis of the drought classifications over sikkim it is noticed that percentage of d1 has increased during 1901 1950 for 12 month scale and decreased for 9 month scale for the same duration no significant changes in d1 d2 d3 and d4 are noticed during 1951 2004 for 9 month scale under both stationary and non stationary approaches irrespective of the approaches frequency of occurrence of exceptional drought has increased significantly during 1951 2004 as compared to the 1901 1950 under 12 month time scale over sikkim 4 3 comparison of drought properties the drought properties like severity duration and peak are estimated by using the stationary and non stationary approaches the definitions of the drought properties are presented in section 3 2 for the comparison purpose the probability density function of the drought properties is computed the 3 and 6 month time scales drought events over sikkim as found suitable under stationary approach are not considered in the analysis however all the time scales over uttarakhand are taken into consideration it should be noted that the term time scale suggests to the scale of drought events and time period refers to the duration i e 1901 1950 and 1951 2004 for the brevity and the comparison purpose the variation in the severity under stationary and non stationary conditions for uttarakhand is presented in fig 3 the graphical representation of other drought properties for both sikkim and uttarakhand are presented in supplementary figure file from fig 3 it can be noted that the significant change in the probability density function is noticed in case of 12 month scale during both the time periods however it is observed that there are no remarkable variations in the density function for other time scales in case of duration the significant variations are observed for 12 month scale both time periods and 6 month scale 1901 1950 figure s1 severity in sikkim is significantly deviated under the non stationary approach as compared to the stationary for 12 month scale drought events during 1901 1950 figure s3 the analysis of density plot figure s4 for duration over sikkim reveals the changeability in the probability density for 9 month 1951 2004 and 12 month 1901 1950 time scales however no significant changes in case of peak are noticed for sikkim and uttarakhand under all time scales and time periods figure s2 and s5 these results indicate that large scale phenomena with significant correlation with the precipitation pattern are likely to affect the drought properties mostly for the larger time scale drought events the developed non stationary drought is thus capable of capturing the non stationary precipitation record and can be a feasible alternative under climate change scenario 4 4 bivariate analysis of drought properties in most of the drought analysis studies exponential and gamma distributions are generally used as the marginal distributions of duration and severity respectively lee et al 2013 she xia 2018 shiau 2006 however in the present study authors have analysed different types of distributions and the best fit is selected based the aic value to find out the best fit many studies have been used different statistical tests like chi squared test ks test etc however due to the advantages as discussed in section 4 1 aic criteria is chosen in the present study it should be noted that if the difference between aic values is not more than two then in that case we have chosen the least aic value the parameters of the different distributions are estimated using the maximum likelihood method the types of distributions and the aic values obtained for each drought property are presented in the supplementary information table s1 to s6 the marginal distributions of drought properties are computed for all the time scales and different durations i e 1901 to 1950 and 1951 to 2004 after finding the best fit marginal distribution best fit copula function out of gaussian and frank copula is decided by analysing the maximum likelihood function the above mentioned copulas are tested and the best copula and copula parameters for all the cases are evaluated based on aic and bayesian information criterion bic which estimate the relative performance of different models cong and brady 2012 lasmar and berthoumieu 2014 the best fit copula and parameters are used to compute the joint return period of the drought properties such as duration severity and peak the selected copula and the parameter for different drought properties are presented in the supplementary information table s7 and s8 in the present study we have analysed the variability in the return period based on the univariate and bivariate analysis the univariate analysis is carried out using the marginal distribution and the bivariate analysis is accomplished using copula the univariate return levels for different return periods for sikkim and uttarakhand are presented under table 4 and 5 respectively it can be noted from the figures that the significant change in the return levels under different return periods are for duration and severity is noticed during the 12 month time scale drought events moreover the change in the return levels in sikkim is much more significant than uttarakhand the drought properties like severity and duration under 12 month time scale are substantially increased during 1951 2004 as compared to the 1901 1950 the bivariate analysis of different combinations of drought properties such as duration severity severity peak and peak duration are carried out using the copula and the obtained copula parameter the analysis is performed to find out the change in the return period using the and and or criteria and presented in supplementary table s9 to s12 for instance we are evaluating the secondary return period joint return period under and and or cases and comparing with the primary return period based on the univariate analysis in most of the cases a comparable difference is noticed between secondary and primary return periods moreover it is also observed that in or case considering the primary return period can cause the underestimation of the risk and in case of and criteria considering the primary return period can result in overestimation of the risk in this sense the bivariate analysis can be useful for designing and manging the water resources systems during drought events 4 5 reliability resilience vulnerability analysis using non stationary drought events hashimoto et al 1982 developed reliability resilience vulnerable rrv concept to improve the ability to understand the number of failures duration of the failure event and severity of failures in the context of water resources management in general rrv is used to evaluate the performance of the water resources system in the present study using the principle of rrv concept we have evaluated the rrv using meteorological drought the drought events below the threshold limit are considered as failure or unsatisfactory state the evaluation of rrv will help in drought management practices over the study areas incorporating the threshold to delineate the success and failure states these measures describe the ability of the system to remain in the satisfactory state i e reliability recovery capacity of the system from unsatisfactory state i e resilience and the severity of the unsatisfactory state vulnerability therefore rrv of the hydro climatological time series enable to characterise the variables with respect to the lower extreme events the reliability Œ± is expressed as the probability of the system to remain in satisfactory state i e above the threshold level eq 13 13 Œ± p d t s lim n 1 n t 1 n z t z t 1 i f d t s 0 i f d t f where s and f are belonging to satisfactory and unsatisfactory states respectively resilience Œ≥ is expressed as ratio between the probability of the transition from unsatisfactory state to the satisfactory and probability of unsatisfactory state in case of long run the transition from satisfactory to unsatisfactory and unsatisfactory to satisfactory state will remain same hashimoto et al 1982 the resilience Œ≥ can be expressed as 14 Œ≥ œÅ 1 Œ± 15 œÅ lim n 1 n t 1 n w t w t 1 i f d t s d t 1 f o r d t f d t 1 s 0 i f otherwise vulnerability v is measured in terms of mean deficit caused during the unsatisfactory state the deficit for the unsatisfactory state is computed as the absolute difference from the truncation level 16 v 1 m j f d j where dj is no of observations belongs to unsatisfactory state and m is the no of times the unsatisfactory state occurs the readers are advised to follow maity 2018 maity et al 2013 used rrv concept in developing drought management index over different regions over india using soil moisture data they reported that a minimum possible length is required to estimate a reasonably stable index they computed the drought management index varying the length of period between 2 and 10 years and reported that index is stabilized beyond the data length of 5 years in this sense in the present study we have computed the rrv at a scale of 5 years however we have not calculated the drought management index the outcomes from rrv computation is presented in supplementary information table s13 to s15 from the analysis of rrv it is observed that reliability over sikkim considering all the time scales of drought events varies between 0 667 and 1 during 1901 1950 and 0 433 to 1 during 1951 2004 similarly reliability over uttarakhand varies between 0 633 and 1 during 1901 1950 and 0 383 to 1 during 1951 2004 it is also observed that 100 percent reliability i e 1 is observed during the 12 month time scale for both sikkim and uttarakhand it should be noted that the reliability with value 1 is reported in some events but not all the events in 12 month time scale the vulnerability varies between 0 and 0 943 during 1901 1950 and during 1951 2004 the range of vulnerability fluctuates between 0 and 1 441 over sikkim likewise vulnerability varies between 0 and 1 103 during 1901 1950 and 0 to 0 811 during 1951 2004 it should be noted that vulnerability approaches to zero during 12 month time scale for both sikkim and uttarakhand ingrisch bahn 2018 categorised different equations used in different studies to quantify resilience and reported that convergences to 0 or to 1 implies full recovery from disturbances depending upon the computation and resilience has also been denoted by either 0 or 1 and can even tend towards infinity isbell et al 2015 analysed the resilience of the ecosystem productivity to climate extremes such as drought and the formulation of resilience was such that full recovery tends to infinity in the present study formulation eq 14 of the resilience suggests full recovery from the drought event approaches to infinity it can be noted from eq 14 that irrespective of the œÅ value when reliability approaches to 1 then resilience tends towards infinity in this sense full recovery from a drought event is denoted by infinity and is noticed when reliability is one and vulnerability is zero therefore full recovery is recorded during 12 month time scale for both the study areas 5 discussion and conclusions in this paper the proposed non stationary drought index incorporates large scale climate indices as covariates in the location parameter of gamma distribution the non stationary employs large scale climate indices with lag time of several months and exhibits fairly good result as compared to the stationary drought index moreover statistically the non stationary drought index shows better performance than stationary index the time varying property of non stationary drought is represented by describing its location parameter as a function of large scale climate indices such as sst soi mei and iod which have significant impact on precipitation due to the time varying property of the non stationary drought it can encompass the evolution of the precipitation pattern and its distribution over the changing environmental condition the drought magnitude in the future condition depends on the present temporal variation of large scale climatic variables and therefore the lag structure of climate indices and precipitation can provide valuable information about drought management li et al 2015 the approach of incorporating climate indices as covariates has been extensively used in flood risk management practices and seldom used in drought risk management the variability in the precipitation is usually considered as the leading factor of meteorological drought occurrence zargar et al 2011 and variability in precipitation purely depends on the on the large scale climate anomalies mishra singh 2010 however the hydrological drought is closely associated with the climate anomalies as well as human interventions zhang et al 2012 therefore meteorological drought encompassing large scale climate indices has sufficient capability to capture the drought events as a consequence of meteorological variability salvi ghosh 2016 stated that the stationary drought index has the inability to capture the frequencies of extremes over different reference periods however the non stationary index is less sensitive to the reference periods as it includes the time variant climatic variabilities in the computation and able to generate realistic frequencies of drought events in the increasing pace of climate change the other meteorological variables such as humidity temperature evaporation etc have significant impact on the drought characteristics n√∫√±ez et al 2014 zarch et al 2015 for instance keeping the precipitation amount constant increase in temperature an evaporation might intensify the severity of the drought the interaction of ocean and land surface feedback mishra and singh 2010 wu and kinter 2009 and atmosphere controls the atmospheric variables and the resulted variability can be explicated by the large scale atmospheric circulations ouyang et al 2014 in addition several studies have been reported the connection between the large scale atmospheric variables and precipitation over india for instance ashok et al 2001 stated that iod and enso have complementarily influenced the monsoon rainfall in india azad rajeevan 2016 advocated that the relationship between indian monsoon rainfall and enso have inverse relationship therefore the non stationary drought index incorporating the large scale atmospheric indices is cable of overcoming the limitation of stationary drought index under the climate change the joint probability of drought characteristics are needed to understand model predict and assess the risk as the hydrological variables are interconnected sadegh et al 2017 the copula being an effective tool is often used to evaluate the joint return period under different situations the univariate analysis can result in underestimation or overestimation of the return period which will lead to improper management practices the rrv concept is generally adopted to understand the number of failures duration of the failure event and severity of failures in the context of water resources management however the application is limited in case of drought management analysis in the present study we have used the rrv analysis to evaluate the reliability resilience and vulnerability during different drought scale and different time periods for both sikkim and uttarakhand the most important conclusions in the present study are as follows the non stationary modeling of the drought index outperforms the stationary case in most of the cases in case of sikkim sst and iod have significant influence at various lags in most of the time scales however in case of uttarakhand almost all the climate oscillations have significant impact at different time scales it is also observed that 3 and 6 month cumulative precipitation at sikkim is better modelled by the stationary approach and for uttarakhand non stationary approach provides better performance than the stationary approach under all time scales the percentage of occurrence of 12 month scale droughts during 1901 1950 and 1951 2004 are significantly varied under stationary and non stationary assumptions in uttarakhand in non stationary condition the percentage of occurrence of d1 and d2 has increased significantly as compared to the stationary approach and there is lower percentage of occurrence for d3 and d4 events based on the non stationary approach similarly from the comparative analysis of the drought classifications over sikkim it is noticed that percentage of d1 has increased during 1901 1950 for 12 month scale and decreased for 9 month scale for the same duration no significant changes in d1 d2 d3 and d4 are noticed during 1951 2004 for 9 month scale under both stationary and non stationary approaches the variations in the probability density of different drought properties reveal the significant variations during the higher time scale i e 12 month scale drought events in most of the cases for sikkim and uttarakhand from the univariate analysis of the drought properties such as severity and duration the significant change is observed under different return periods during the 12 month time scale drought events moreover the change in the return levels in sikkim is much more significant than uttarakhand the drought properties like severity and duration under 12 month time scale are substantially increased during 1951 2004 as compared to the 1901 1950 from the bivariate analysis of the return periods of different combination of drought properties a comparable difference is noticed between secondary and primary return periods in most of the cases the rrv analysis reveals that the higher value of reliability and resilience and lower value of vulnerability is observed under 12 month scale drought events the present study presents the non stationary based copula analysis of drought characteristics incorporating the large scale climate indices over two himalayan states in india the outcomes from the present study will enable the policy makers stakeholders of the two states to formulate better guidelines in the context of drought management and using the outputs from the bivariate analysis can be useful for designing and manging the water resources systems during drought events the large scale climatic descriptors are varied linearly only in the location parameter and the exclusion of the regional climatic descriptors such as local temperature anomaly regional precipitable water etc are the limitations of the present analysis moreover in the present study we have not evaluated the uncertainty in the bivariate drought analysis and hence inclusion of uncertainty analysis human induced changeability and regional climatic variabilities in the computation of the non stationary drought index will provide guidelines to pursue the research in future for a robust feasible solution to the hydrological drought index declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

5988,the most of the available drought indices do not incorporate the environmental changes in the present scenario of climate change in an attempt to encompass the climate variability in the computation of meteorological drought a non stationary gamma distribution with climate indices in its location parameter as a covariate is proposed the performance of the non stationary drought is evaluated based on the statistical performance as compared to the stationary drought focusing on two himalayan states in india the meteorological drought events are described and assessed based on the stationary and non stationary drought index moreover the bivariate analysis of different drought properties is carried out and compared with the univariate analysis the management indices such as reliability resilience and vulnerability are also computed based on the developed drought index the results in the study indicate that in most of the cases the non stationary drought index is capable of capturing the drought characteristics over the study areas the variability in the probability density of different drought properties is observed under 12 month drought scale in most of the cases during bivariate analysis a compare difference is noticed between secondary and primary return periods moreover higher reliability and resilience is noticed during 12 month scale drought period the newly developed drought index and the copula based analysis of drought properties provide a new concept for robust and effective management practices in the changing environment keywords climate indices copula meteorological drought himalayan states non stationary drought 1 introduction drought characterises the deficit of available water as compared to the average natural water availability normal level is one of the most complex prevailing natural hazards wang et al 2015b and recurring extreme climate event dai 2011 due to spatio temporal variability in the characteristics drought brings immense social environmental and economical consequences all over the globe soƒæ√°kov√° et al 2014 wilhite et al 2007 the growing pressure on water and other natural resources increase the vulnerability to drought which imparts more uncertainty to the research community for timely assessment and comprehensive evaluation of the adverse drought impacts wilhite et al 2007 as discussed by soƒæ√°kov√° et al 2014 the complexity of drought characterisation and evaluation increases due to the difficulty in formulating the proper definition of drought its erratic spatio temporal variability and impact incomplete understating of anthropogenic influences in triggering the drought characteristics in general the drought onset is initiated from the meteorological situations which includes the climatic conditions and variability the meteorological drought further leads to the hydrological drought which further impacts the agricultural productivity causing agricultural drought subsequently the socio economic drought differs markedly as it is closely related to the precipitation hao and aghakouchak 2013 as a consequence of climate variability and anthropogenic perturbations different studies show that drought hazards are likely to become more frequent and widespread in coming decades li et al 2013a b villarini et al 2011 wang et al 2015a india has a large geographical area having most of the parts blanket with agriculture according to murthy sesha sai 2010 68 agricultural land is vulnerable to drought conditions and 50 area of the vulnerable agricultural land is exposed to more frequent severe drought condition which in turn is going to affect country s economy extensively the long term 1901 2004 analysis of drought variability indicates the increasing trend in drought frequency and severity over india mallya et al 2015 in a recent study by mishra et al 2016 stated that a drought event during 2014 15 with a return period of 542 years caused severe scarcity of water and about 330 million people were affected in this sense it is indispensable to understand the drought from multi perspectives as it has direct consequences on socio economic aspects especially in india zhang et al 2017 although there is no precise definition of the drought the simplest way to monitor the drought conditions is through different drought indices li et al 2015 based on the applicability different drought indices were developed in past few decades the indices include but are not limited to standardised precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 standardised runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 standardised hydrological index shi sharma and panu 2010 due to computational simplicity and capability of evaluating the drought severity at different time scales spi as a probabilistic based index is considered as one of the robust indices russo et al 2013 wen et al 2011 moreover spi index is barely affected by the seasonal and topographical variations hayes et al 1999 therefore in the present investigation spi index is used the computation of spi primarily requires the long term precipitation series which is then fitted to gamma distribution under stationary assumption the stationary assumption suggests that the parameters of the gamma distribution won t change with respect to the time however with the increasing pace of climate variability the stationary behaviour in the computation of drought index is questionable moreover for the longer time series more than 30 years stationary gamma distribution is not able to model the drought as the influence of climate signals in longer time series is likely to be significant russo et al 2013 therefore inclusion of non stationary behaviour into the analysis is of paramount importance to formulate suitable adaptation and mitigation strategies the non stationarity can be introduced by encompassing the large scale climate oscillations in the computation of spi trenberth et al 2014 advocated that the large scale oscillation such as el ni√±o southern oscillation enso has significant impact on episodic droughts around the world hence it is necessary to identify the linkage between large scale climate variability and precipitation patterns and many studies have been accomplished to examine the same for example hu and feng 2001 kim et al 2006 cai et al 2010 he and guan 2013 meza 2013 among others in indian context ajayamohan and rao 2008 examined the association among the indian ocean dipole iod and extreme precipitation events and found that extreme precipitation is strongly modulated by iod agilan and umamahesh 2018 in a recent study while modelling the extreme precipitation event suggested that soi is the best enso index to model the extreme precipitation intensity for monsoon as well as non monsoon seasons not only the identification but also the analysis of the different drought properties is crucial for sustainable drought management practices as climatological and hydrological variables are interdependent multivariate analysis is widely adopted to understand their dependence structure sadegh et al 2017 drought as a complex and multivariate phenomenon drought characteristics such as duration severity and peak need to be modelled using the multivariate technique one of the most commonly used multivariate analysis method is known as copula which models the interdependency structure of two or more random variables in hydrological studies copula has been used extensively and a few examples include between peak flow and volume favre et al 2004 precipitation and soil moisture aghakouchak 2015 precipitation and groundwater level reddy and ganguli 2012 vegetation drought and extreme events jha et al 2019 among extreme precipitation indices goswami et al 2018 drought severity and duration lee et al 2013 hence in the present study we have preferred multivariate analysis to univariate analysis and the approach is detailed in the methodology section expecting to provide a new prospective of drought identification and analysis of drought properties the present study proposes and applies a non stationary drought index encompassing the large scale climate oscillations to monitor the drought events robustly the non stationary analysis is carried out using the generalized additive model in location scale and shape gamlss package developed by rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 the drought properties such as duration severity and peak are analysed using multivariate technique called copula which will enable the water resources planner to incorporate effective drought management practices salvi ghosh 2016 analysed the future extreme dry and wet conditions incorporating the time as a linear variant in the gamma distribution over india however the impact of large scale oscillations on drought events was not analysed in their study to the best of the authors knowledge the present study is one of the first studies in india to model the non stationary drought incorporating large scale climate oscillations and evaluate the different drought properties based on the non stationary drought using bivariate approach the analysis is carried out using the high resolution 0 25ox0 25 long term 1901 2004 precipitation data the details of the study area and the data used are presented in section 2 the brief discussion about the opted methodologies is explained in section 3 the results and discussion of the investigation are illustrated in section 4 finally the significant outcomes from the study are presented in section 5 2 study area and data used in the present study two different himalayan states are considered viz sikkim and uttarakhand according to the national mission on himalayan studies nmhs indian himalayan region ihr covers 7 states namely jammu kashmir himachal pradesh uttarakhand arunachal pradesh sikkim manipur and tripura in the present study we have chosen two states based on their geographical locations i e sikkim from northeast region and uttarakhand from the northern part the sikkim is situated in eastern himalayan region with a geographical area about 7096 km2 fig 1 b the capital of the sikkim i e gangtok is a place of tourist attraction and the tiny state is divided into four districts i e east west north and south district most of the population about 70 depend on agriculture and forest products which are highly sensitive to the climate change for their livelihood azhoni and goyal 2018 rice and maize are the main crops and are grown over 20 of the geographical area more than 98 of water is used for the irrigation purpose the precipitation trend analysis suggests a changing trend over eastern himalayas i e north sikkim singh and goyal 2016 and this trend will become more erratic in foreseen future the increasing crop water stress variability in precipitation and increasing in temperature could have significant impact on social cultural and economical aspects which in turn could lead to migration and instabilities biemans et al 2013 goodess 2013 similarly uttarakhand stretches over an area about 53 483 km2 and the geographical coordinates varies from 28o42 n to 31o28 n and 77o35 e to 81o05 e fig 1c the water resources of the state are diverted to fulfil agricultural demand which is 75 of the total demand the scanty rainfall during the winter causes losses in the major rabi crop moreover the variability in the monsoon precipitation is very much localised in time and space with intense precipitation over small duration of time agriculture provides the livelihood to these two himalayan states and the precipitation pattern varies significantly over the states because of their geographical location and variation in the altitude therefore it is necessary to evaluate the precipitation variability which could further lead to the meteorological drought moreover a recent study by guhathakurta et al 2017 showed an increasing trend in the area under drought conditions over sikkim and uttarakhand understanding the social cultural and economical aspects of the himalayan states the present study analyses the long term drought events using the high resolution gridded 0 25 longitude x 0 25 latitude precipitation dataset during 1901 2004 the precipitation dataset is prepared by india meteorological department imd and the details can be obtained from pai et al 2014 as discussed the non stationary modelling of the drought index is carried out using the large scale climate oscillations namely enso indices and iod three enso indices viz sea surface temperature sst southern oscillation index soi

duration of 1901 2004 3 methodology initially all the datasets are collected as discussed in section 2 the areal average of the gridded precipitation is computed for sikkim and uttarakhand and the areal average precipitation is considered as representative precipitation 1901 2004 over the study areas the daily precipitation data is converted to the monthly data and cumulative precipitation for different time periods are computed in the present study 3 6 9 and 12 month time scales are used further some of the past studies incorporated the lag to evaluate the linear association between large scale climate indices and precipitation agilan and umamahesh 2018 hence the large scale atmospheric monthly datasets are arranged according to different lag the lag value varies from 0 to 12 next the correlation test is carried out between the precipitation series of different time scales and the arranged large scale oscillations data in general kendall and spearman correlation tests are adopted to evaluate the teleconnection among the hydrological variables and climate patterns mccormick et al 2009 niu et al 2014 in the present study kendall correlation test is performed at a significance level of 0 05 to evaluate the best lag and best large scale climate oscillations for the precipitation dataset at different time scales the details of the kendall correlation test can be obtained from kendall 1955 the obtained suitable large scale climate oscillations for the appropriate lag will be known as covariate from this point onwards in the paper subsequently the precipitation series at different time scales along with suitable covariates are considered for non stationary analysis using gamlss 3 1 non stationary settings in gamlss the non stationary analysis is performed using r package gamlss https cran r project org web packages gamlss index html this package is widely used as it enables to model the time series with non stationary framework flexibly villarini et al 2010 being a semi parametric regression type model gamlss not only allows to model at location parameter or mean but also other parameters of the distribution of response variable by linear and or nonlinear functions of explanatory variables and or random effects for the brevity a short discussion about the gamlss theory is presented here for the comprehensive details about gamlss readers are advised to consult rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 in gamlss analysis the datasets or the response variables y i f o r i 1 2 n are assumed to be independent and fitted with a distribution function f y y i Œ∏ i where Œ∏ i Œ∏ 1 i Œ∏ 2 i Œ∏ 3 i Œ∏ 4 i denotes different statistical parameters the parameters of the distribution can be location scale shape and kurtosis parameters therefore a monotonic link function g k k represents the parameters of the distribution to the design matrix of the selected covariate in the present study the selected covariates for different time scales of precipitation are varied linearly to the parameters of the distribution from the computation of spi mckee et al 1993 it is noted that the cumulative precipitation series is initially fitted to the gamma distribution therefore the present study incorporates the linear variation of the covariates which ensures the non stationarity condition in the location parameter of the gamma distribution eq 1 a two parameter gamma distribution with location ¬µ and scale œÉ parameters is expressed in eq 2 the comparison between the stationary and non stationary model is carried out based on the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 the optimal model will provide minimum aic value 1 x t gamma Œº t œÉ Œº t c 0 c 1 i 1 t c 2 i 2 t c n i n t where c0 c1 cn are constants for

based on the maximum likelihood method in the present study to maximize the likelihood an algorithm named after rigby and stasinopoulos rs i e rs algorithm is used as it does not require initial value of the parameters to ensure the convergence and this method is faster for large data sets since the non stationary drought spi index is computed similar to the normal spi the negative values represent the dry and positive values represent as wet condition it should be noted that the classification of non stationary drought index is same as the spi classification mckee et al 1993 it is worth mentioning that in the present study authors have considered 0 8 as a threshold below which all the events are considered as drought the primary motive to consider 0 8 as a threshold is that according to drought severity classification spi index below 0 8 start triggering the damage to the crops and pasture and the details can be obtained from http droughtmonitor unl edu aboutusdm droughtclassification aspx and svoboda et al 2002 therefore all the drought properties are evaluated based on the threshold the classification of the drought is presented in table 1 3 2 identification of different drought properties there are several number of drought identification methods viz the percentile method discrete markov process run analysis etc however the study by bonacci 1993 suggests that the analytical analysis of drought identification using different truncation levels i e threshold level and different methods do not vary significantly moreover the run analysis yevjevich 1967 is most commonly used in the engineering practice and analysis of drought in addition several studies have been used run analysis for the computation of drought properties ganguli and reddy 2012 mishra et al 2009 hence the present study is also used the run analysis for the identification of different drought properties according to the definition of the run theory it is a segment of a drought time series i e drought index where the values are below or above a particular truncation or threshold value based on the truncation level and the definition of the drought properties it can be named as positive or negative run the following three most important drought properties are used in the present analysis severity duration and peak it should be noted that the drought duration is considered as the intervals months where the drought index is below the threshold value the duration is evaluated from the starting of a drought event to the termination of that particular drought event and the minimum length of drought is one month similarly the severity is computed as a cumulative of drought index under the particular drought duration therefore the duration and severity are strongly correlated and also supported by chang and stenson 1990 the computation of severity is presented in eq 3 the peak is defined as the minimum value of the spi for a particular drought duration 3 severit y i t 1 t sp i i t i 1 2 n 1 n 3 3 multivariate analysis of drought properties since the properties of the drought events are interdependent univariate analysis of drought property cannot provide comprehensive analysis of drought therefore the present investigation incorporates bivariate analysis instead of traditional univariate analysis to assess the dependent structure among the drought properties i e duration severity and peak to tackle the proposed analysis of constructing bivariate distribution copula is used moreover the bivariate frequency analysis is carried out after constructing the bivariate distribution sklar 1959 proposed copulas to establish the association between the univariate distribution functions and multivariate distribution functions in particular copulas enable to construct the multivariate distribution based on the univariate distribution the main advantage to construct the copulas is that it can segregate the effect of dependency from the effect of the univariate distribution in general the multivariate distributions are constructed to study the association among the random correlated variable based on the marginal distribution as stated by shiau et al 2007 that copula has several other advantages such as copula can be used to simplify the n variate distributions and marginal distribution parameters are not considered to evaluate the dependence among the random variables although the theory of copula was proposed during late 1950 s it gained recognition in the field of hydro climatology during early 2000 de michele and salvadori 2003 favre et al 2004 for explanation let x and y are two dependent random variables with marginal cumulative distribution function cdf fx x and fy y respectively then f x y x y c f x x f y y 4 where c is defined as copula and f x y x y is denoted as cdf of bivariate distribution with marginal cdf as fx x and fy y it should be noted that c is unique if cdf of the two random variables are continuous the joint probability density function can be obtained eq 5 with the assumption that the marginal density functions of random variables are continuous 5 f x y x y c f x x f y y f x x f y y where f x x f y y represent the probability density function of random variables x and y respectively c denotes the density function of c and is expressed in eq 6 6 c u v 2 c u v u v where u and v are the cdf values of x and y i e fx x and fy y hence the values of u and v varies between 0 and 1 it is worth mentioning that in the present study authors have considered severity duration and peak as correlated random variables and the dependency among different pairs such as severity and duration severity and peak duration and peak are analysed using different copulas the marginal distributions of the drought properties are obtained by considering more than a dozen distributions and the best fitted distribution is selected based on the minimum aic value in case of hydro climatological studies various copula families are used and most of the studies are limited to frank gaussian gumbel clayton and t copula the parameters of different copulas imitate the dependence among the correlated random variables for a detailed mathematical descriptions about different copula families refer to sadegh et al 2017 the present study uses gaussian and frank copula as these two copulas are capable of capturing the entire range of dependence among the variables maity et al 2013 however the gaussian and frank copula belong to the family of elliptical and archimedean respectively the structure and parameters of the selected copulas are expressed concisely and the readers are advised to refer nelsen 2007 and sadegh et al 2017 for details 7 gaussian copula c g u v

standard procedure to evaluate the return period of different hydrological extreme events using the probability distribution the return period of an event is generally defined as average interarrival time between two successive events with a certain magnitude or greater haan 1977 generally frequency analysis incorporates only one hydrological variable in the present study partial duration series of drought is considered in which the series of drought events is obtained based on the truncation level hence the return period of drought severity and duration can be obtained as follows shiau et al 2007 9 t s Œæ 1 f s s 10 t d Œæ 1 f d d 11 t p Œæ 1 f p p where fs s fd d fp p are the marginal cdf of severity drought and peak respectively and Œæ is expressed as n n n spi time series in years and n is number of drought events ganguli and reddy 2013 however due to the interdependence structure among the drought properties the univariate frequency analysis cannot provide comprehensive analysis of return period in this sense bivariate return period can be used to model the drought frequency the bivariate drought frequency analysis is evaluated based on two criteria such as i both severity and duration exceeding a specific value s s a n d d d ii either severity or duration exceeding a specific value s s o r d d shiau 2003 moreover these two conditions are also considered for other sets of drought properties i e severity and peak duration and peak therefore the mathematical expression to compute the return period in both the cases and or are presented in eqs 12 and 13 t ds Œæ p d d s

r d d respectively moreover the similar mathematical expressions can be used to evaluate the return period for other sets of drought properties 4 results 4 1 non stationary based spi drought index for sikkim and uttarakhand the monthly areal average precipitation data are computed and cumulative precipitation series for 3 6 9 and 12 month time scales are prepared for both the states subsequently the large scale climate oscillations are arranged based on different lag i e starting from lag 0 to 12 for different time scales non stationary model is constructed using the gamlss package as described in section 3 1 according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the variability in the climate has observed since 1950 s in this sense the total length of the precipitation series is divided into two parts viz 1901 1950 and 1951 2004 in the present study only the ¬µ parameter of the gamma distribution is linearly varied with different lags of four different climate oscillations the parameter of the gamma distribution is estimated based on the maximum likelihood estimation mle coles et al 2003 stated that parameter estimation using mle provides the flexibility to incorporate different forms of non stationarity it should be noted that the stationary model is also constructed to evaluate the performance among the stationary and non stationary model in case of stationary model the parameters of the gamma distribution are constant in order to evaluate the performance aic criteria is used which also enables to avoid model overfitting and measures the relative quality of the model for the given parameter in general it is considered that lesser the aic value better the model however burnham and anderson 2004 stated that if the difference in aic value among two models is more than equal to 2 then there exists substantial evidence of being different in particular the evaluation of the better model is performed based on two criteria i the model should have less aic value than the other model and ii the difference in aic value between two models must be greater than equal to 2 the significant lag of large scale atmospheric oscillations is evaluated based on the kendall correlation test at a significance level of 0 05 the analysis is carried out for all the time scales and the obtained outcomes are presented in table 2 from the table 2 it can be noted that for sikkim sst and iod have significant influence at various lags in most of the time scales however in case of uttarakhand almost all the climate oscillations have significant impact at different time scales for instance the 12 month cumulative precipitation at sikkim is significantly related with soi at 12 month lag i e previous year similarly sst and mei exhibit concurrent association i e no lag with the 12 month cumulative precipitation therefore the climate oscillations with appropriate lag are selected as covariates to the non stationary model as discussed the comparative analysis among the stationary and non stationary model is carried out according to the aic criterion and the results are presented in table 3 it can be observed from table 3 that 3 and 6 month cumulative precipitation at sikkim is better modelled by the stationary approach based on the selection criteria adopted in the present study however in uttarakhand non stationary approach provides better performance than the stationary approach under all time scales moreover it can be noted that the difference among the stationary and non stationary model is becoming more significant from 3 month scale to the 12 month scale 4 2 comparison of drought characteristics based on the drought classification as presented in table 1 and the opted truncation level the occurrence frequency of drought is computed by the stationary and non stationary approaches the results are compared for both the approaches under different drought classifications based on the threshold level the comparison is carried out for moderate d1 severe d2 extreme d3 and exceptional d4 drought classifications from stationary and non stationary based analysis of the drought index it is observed that non stationary drought index is more suitable for all the time scales in uttarakhand based on the statistical measure hence drought classifications under different time scales for uttarakhand are selected as example to further explain the comparison results among stationary and non stationary approach the comparative analysis of drought classification during 3 and 6 month are presented in fig 2 a d and 9 and 12 month are shown under fig 2 e h from fig 2 a d it can be noted that there is lower percentage of occurrence for d1 events based on the non stationary drought index for all the time periods under 3 and 6 month time scales however higher frequency of occurrence is noticed in d3 events under 3 and 6 month time scale during 1901 1950 and 1951 2004 respectively according to fig 2 e h it is observed that percentage of occurrence of 12 month scale droughts during 1901 1950 fig 2 g and 1951 2004 fig 2 h are significantly varied under stationary and non stationary assumptions for instance under non stationary condition the percentage of occurrence of d1 and d2 has increased significantly as compared to the stationary approach and there is lower percentage of occurrence for d3 and d4 events based on the non stationary approach fig 2 h similarly from the comparative analysis of the drought classifications over sikkim it is noticed that percentage of d1 has increased during 1901 1950 for 12 month scale and decreased for 9 month scale for the same duration no significant changes in d1 d2 d3 and d4 are noticed during 1951 2004 for 9 month scale under both stationary and non stationary approaches irrespective of the approaches frequency of occurrence of exceptional drought has increased significantly during 1951 2004 as compared to the 1901 1950 under 12 month time scale over sikkim 4 3 comparison of drought properties the drought properties like severity duration and peak are estimated by using the stationary and non stationary approaches the definitions of the drought properties are presented in section 3 2 for the comparison purpose the probability density function of the drought properties is computed the 3 and 6 month time scales drought events over sikkim as found suitable under stationary approach are not considered in the analysis however all the time scales over uttarakhand are taken into consideration it should be noted that the term time scale suggests to the scale of drought events and time period refers to the duration i e 1901 1950 and 1951 2004 for the brevity and the comparison purpose the variation in the severity under stationary and non stationary conditions for uttarakhand is presented in fig 3 the graphical representation of other drought properties for both sikkim and uttarakhand are presented in supplementary figure file from fig 3 it can be noted that the significant change in the probability density function is noticed in case of 12 month scale during both the time periods however it is observed that there are no remarkable variations in the density function for other time scales in case of duration the significant variations are observed for 12 month scale both time periods and 6 month scale 1901 1950 figure s1 severity in sikkim is significantly deviated under the non stationary approach as compared to the stationary for 12 month scale drought events during 1901 1950 figure s3 the analysis of density plot figure s4 for duration over sikkim reveals the changeability in the probability density for 9 month 1951 2004 and 12 month 1901 1950 time scales however no significant changes in case of peak are noticed for sikkim and uttarakhand under all time scales and time periods figure s2 and s5 these results indicate that large scale phenomena with significant correlation with the precipitation pattern are likely to affect the drought properties mostly for the larger time scale drought events the developed non stationary drought is thus capable of capturing the non stationary precipitation record and can be a feasible alternative under climate change scenario 4 4 bivariate analysis of drought properties in most of the drought analysis studies exponential and gamma distributions are generally used as the marginal distributions of duration and severity respectively lee et al 2013 she xia 2018 shiau 2006 however in the present study authors have analysed different types of distributions and the best fit is selected based the aic value to find out the best fit many studies have been used different statistical tests like chi squared test ks test etc however due to the advantages as discussed in section 4 1 aic criteria is chosen in the present study it should be noted that if the difference between aic values is not more than two then in that case we have chosen the least aic value the parameters of the different distributions are estimated using the maximum likelihood method the types of distributions and the aic values obtained for each drought property are presented in the supplementary information table s1 to s6 the marginal distributions of drought properties are computed for all the time scales and different durations i e 1901 to 1950 and 1951 to 2004 after finding the best fit marginal distribution best fit copula function out of gaussian and frank copula is decided by analysing the maximum likelihood function the above mentioned copulas are tested and the best copula and copula parameters for all the cases are evaluated based on aic and bayesian information criterion bic which estimate the relative performance of different models cong and brady 2012 lasmar and berthoumieu 2014 the best fit copula and parameters are used to compute the joint return period of the drought properties such as duration severity and peak the selected copula and the parameter for different drought properties are presented in the supplementary information table s7 and s8 in the present study we have analysed the variability in the return period based on the univariate and bivariate analysis the univariate analysis is carried out using the marginal distribution and the bivariate analysis is accomplished using copula the univariate return levels for different return periods for sikkim and uttarakhand are presented under table 4 and 5 respectively it can be noted from the figures that the significant change in the return levels under different return periods are for duration and severity is noticed during the 12 month time scale drought events moreover the change in the return levels in sikkim is much more significant than uttarakhand the drought properties like severity and duration under 12 month time scale are substantially increased during 1951 2004 as compared to the 1901 1950 the bivariate analysis of different combinations of drought properties such as duration severity severity peak and peak duration are carried out using the copula and the obtained copula parameter the analysis is performed to find out the change in the return period using the and and or criteria and presented in supplementary table s9 to s12 for instance we are evaluating the secondary return period joint return period under and and or cases and comparing with the primary return period based on the univariate analysis in most of the cases a comparable difference is noticed between secondary and primary return periods moreover it is also observed that in or case considering the primary return period can cause the underestimation of the risk and in case of and criteria considering the primary return period can result in overestimation of the risk in this sense the bivariate analysis can be useful for designing and manging the water resources systems during drought events 4 5 reliability resilience vulnerability analysis using non stationary drought events hashimoto et al 1982 developed reliability resilience vulnerable rrv concept to improve the ability to understand the number of failures duration of the failure event and severity of failures in the context of water resources management in general rrv is used to evaluate the performance of the water resources system in the present study using the principle of rrv concept we have evaluated the rrv using meteorological drought the drought events below the threshold limit are considered as failure or unsatisfactory state the evaluation of rrv will help in drought management practices over the study areas incorporating the threshold to delineate the success and failure states these measures describe the ability of the system to remain in the satisfactory state i e reliability recovery capacity of the system from unsatisfactory state i e resilience and the severity of the unsatisfactory state vulnerability therefore rrv of the hydro climatological time series enable to characterise the variables with respect to the lower extreme events the reliability Œ± is expressed as the probability of the system to remain in satisfactory state i e above the threshold level eq 13 13 Œ± p d t s lim n 1 n t 1 n z t z t 1 i f d t s 0 i f d t f where s and f are belonging to satisfactory and unsatisfactory states respectively resilience Œ≥ is expressed as ratio between the probability of the transition from unsatisfactory state to the satisfactory and probability of unsatisfactory state in case of long run the transition from satisfactory to unsatisfactory and unsatisfactory to satisfactory state will remain same hashimoto et al 1982 the resilience Œ≥ can be expressed as 14 Œ≥ œÅ 1 Œ± 15 œÅ lim n 1 n t 1 n w t w t 1 i f d t s d t 1 f o r d t f d t 1 s 0 i f otherwise vulnerability v is measured in terms of mean deficit caused during the unsatisfactory state the deficit for the unsatisfactory state is computed as the absolute difference from the truncation level 16 v 1 m j f d j where dj is no of observations belongs to unsatisfactory state and m is the no of times the unsatisfactory state occurs the readers are advised to follow maity 2018 maity et al 2013 used rrv concept in developing drought management index over different regions over india using soil moisture data they reported that a minimum possible length is required to estimate a reasonably stable index they computed the drought management index varying the length of period between 2 and 10 years and reported that index is stabilized beyond the data length of 5 years in this sense in the present study we have computed the rrv at a scale of 5 years however we have not calculated the drought management index the outcomes from rrv computation is presented in supplementary information table s13 to s15 from the analysis of rrv it is observed that reliability over sikkim considering all the time scales of drought events varies between 0 667 and 1 during 1901 1950 and 0 433 to 1 during 1951 2004 similarly reliability over uttarakhand varies between 0 633 and 1 during 1901 1950 and 0 383 to 1 during 1951 2004 it is also observed that 100 percent reliability i e 1 is observed during the 12 month time scale for both sikkim and uttarakhand it should be noted that the reliability with value 1 is reported in some events but not all the events in 12 month time scale the vulnerability varies between 0 and 0 943 during 1901 1950 and during 1951 2004 the range of vulnerability fluctuates between 0 and 1 441 over sikkim likewise vulnerability varies between 0 and 1 103 during 1901 1950 and 0 to 0 811 during 1951 2004 it should be noted that vulnerability approaches to zero during 12 month time scale for both sikkim and uttarakhand ingrisch bahn 2018 categorised different equations used in different studies to quantify resilience and reported that convergences to 0 or to 1 implies full recovery from disturbances depending upon the computation and resilience has also been denoted by either 0 or 1 and can even tend towards infinity isbell et al 2015 analysed the resilience of the ecosystem productivity to climate extremes such as drought and the formulation of resilience was such that full recovery tends to infinity in the present study formulation eq 14 of the resilience suggests full recovery from the drought event approaches to infinity it can be noted from eq 14 that irrespective of the œÅ value when reliability approaches to 1 then resilience tends towards infinity in this sense full recovery from a drought event is denoted by infinity and is noticed when reliability is one and vulnerability is zero therefore full recovery is recorded during 12 month time scale for both the study areas 5 discussion and conclusions in this paper the proposed non stationary drought index incorporates large scale climate indices as covariates in the location parameter of gamma distribution the non stationary employs large scale climate indices with lag time of several months and exhibits fairly good result as compared to the stationary drought index moreover statistically the non stationary drought index shows better performance than stationary index the time varying property of non stationary drought is represented by describing its location parameter as a function of large scale climate indices such as sst soi mei and iod which have significant impact on precipitation due to the time varying property of the non stationary drought it can encompass the evolution of the precipitation pattern and its distribution over the changing environmental condition the drought magnitude in the future condition depends on the present temporal variation of large scale climatic variables and therefore the lag structure of climate indices and precipitation can provide valuable information about drought management li et al 2015 the approach of incorporating climate indices as covariates has been extensively used in flood risk management practices and seldom used in drought risk management the variability in the precipitation is usually considered as the leading factor of meteorological drought occurrence zargar et al 2011 and variability in precipitation purely depends on the on the large scale climate anomalies mishra singh 2010 however the hydrological drought is closely associated with the climate anomalies as well as human interventions zhang et al 2012 therefore meteorological drought encompassing large scale climate indices has sufficient capability to capture the drought events as a consequence of meteorological variability salvi ghosh 2016 stated that the stationary drought index has the inability to capture the frequencies of extremes over different reference periods however the non stationary index is less sensitive to the reference periods as it includes the time variant climatic variabilities in the computation and able to generate realistic frequencies of drought events in the increasing pace of climate change the other meteorological variables such as humidity temperature evaporation etc have significant impact on the drought characteristics n√∫√±ez et al 2014 zarch et al 2015 for instance keeping the precipitation amount constant increase in temperature an evaporation might intensify the severity of the drought the interaction of ocean and land surface feedback mishra and singh 2010 wu and kinter 2009 and atmosphere controls the atmospheric variables and the resulted variability can be explicated by the large scale atmospheric circulations ouyang et al 2014 in addition several studies have been reported the connection between the large scale atmospheric variables and precipitation over india for instance ashok et al 2001 stated that iod and enso have complementarily influenced the monsoon rainfall in india azad rajeevan 2016 advocated that the relationship between indian monsoon rainfall and enso have inverse relationship therefore the non stationary drought index incorporating the large scale atmospheric indices is cable of overcoming the limitation of stationary drought index under the climate change the joint probability of drought characteristics are needed to understand model predict and assess the risk as the hydrological variables are interconnected sadegh et al 2017 the copula being an effective tool is often used to evaluate the joint return period under different situations the univariate analysis can result in underestimation or overestimation of the return period which will lead to improper management practices the rrv concept is generally adopted to understand the number of failures duration of the failure event and severity of failures in the context of water resources management however the application is limited in case of drought management analysis in the present study we have used the rrv analysis to evaluate the reliability resilience and vulnerability during different drought scale and different time periods for both sikkim and uttarakhand the most important conclusions in the present study are as follows the non stationary modeling of the drought index outperforms the stationary case in most of the cases in case of sikkim sst and iod have significant influence at various lags in most of the time scales however in case of uttarakhand almost all the climate oscillations have significant impact at different time scales it is also observed that 3 and 6 month cumulative precipitation at sikkim is better modelled by the stationary approach and for uttarakhand non stationary approach provides better performance than the stationary approach under all time scales the percentage of occurrence of 12 month scale droughts during 1901 1950 and 1951 2004 are significantly varied under stationary and non stationary assumptions in uttarakhand in non stationary condition the percentage of occurrence of d1 and d2 has increased significantly as compared to the stationary approach and there is lower percentage of occurrence for d3 and d4 events based on the non stationary approach similarly from the comparative analysis of the drought classifications over sikkim it is noticed that percentage of d1 has increased during 1901 1950 for 12 month scale and decreased for 9 month scale for the same duration no significant changes in d1 d2 d3 and d4 are noticed during 1951 2004 for 9 month scale under both stationary and non stationary approaches the variations in the probability density of different drought properties reveal the significant variations during the higher time scale i e 12 month scale drought events in most of the cases for sikkim and uttarakhand from the univariate analysis of the drought properties such as severity and duration the significant change is observed under different return periods during the 12 month time scale drought events moreover the change in the return levels in sikkim is much more significant than uttarakhand the drought properties like severity and duration under 12 month time scale are substantially increased during 1951 2004 as compared to the 1901 1950 from the bivariate analysis of the return periods of different combination of drought properties a comparable difference is noticed between secondary and primary return periods in most of the cases the rrv analysis reveals that the higher value of reliability and resilience and lower value of vulnerability is observed under 12 month scale drought events the present study presents the non stationary based copula analysis of drought characteristics incorporating the large scale climate indices over two himalayan states in india the outcomes from the present study will enable the policy makers stakeholders of the two states to formulate better guidelines in the context of drought management and using the outputs from the bivariate analysis can be useful for designing and manging the water resources systems during drought events the large scale climatic descriptors are varied linearly only in the location parameter and the exclusion of the regional climatic descriptors such as local temperature anomaly regional precipitable water etc are the limitations of the present analysis moreover in the present study we have not evaluated the uncertainty in the bivariate drought analysis and hence inclusion of uncertainty analysis human induced changeability and regional climatic variabilities in the computation of the non stationary drought index will provide guidelines to pursue the research in future for a robust feasible solution to the hydrological drought index declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

5989,challenge remains to find the optimal carryover storage to balance the immediate and carryover utilities for long term hydropower reservoir operation due to low forecast accuracy limited foresight and complex hydrologic hydraulic and electric connections between cascade hydropower reservoirs thus this paper proposes a long term optimal operation model to dynamically control the optimal carryover storages for cascade hydropower reservoirs first the carryover utility of cascade hydropower stations is expressed as a function of the carryover potential energy rather than the carryover storage thus decreasing the function parameters and using the limited prior knowledge then the utility function of the carryover potential energy ufcpe is fitted by a quadratic function based on a successive iteration method based on which a two stage optimal operation model tsoom is developed to guide the long term optimal operation of cascade hydropower stations the case study with five cascade hydropower stations in the yalong river basin shows that 1 ufcpe can be well fitted by a quadratic function and it increases linearly in the dry season but monotonically at a decreasing rate in the flood season resulting from a large quantity of surplus water and 2 the performance of ufcpe based tsoom is much superior to those of conventional rules and conventional optimization methods and quite close to that of dynamic programming successive approximation in guiding the long term cascade hydropower reservoirs operation keywords hydropower optimal operation cascade

process the long term availability of water resources and potential energy should be considered in short term reservoir operation in general the water consumption target and boundary conditions of the short term operation are offered by the long term operation thus it is important to develop optimal operation models that can balance short and long term reservoir operations liu et al 2008 the key to making a trade off between immediate and future benefits is to optimize the carryover storage for reservoir zhao et al 2015 jiang et al 2019a however definite carryover storage can only be obtained at some special time points for example the water level of an annual regulating reservoir should reach the normal water level at the end of the flood season and fall below the flood limited water level at the beginning of the flood season in most cases there is a lack of prior knowledge about the boundary conditions for optimal reservoir operation especially for cascade reservoirs the most widely used method to avoid subjective determination of carryover storage is to build optimal layered coupling operation models in which outputs storage or release from one model are used as the boundary conditions of the next echelon model sreekanth and mohapatra 2012 used a chance constrained optimization model to derive the optimum long term annual end storages which was then incorporated as constraints storage lower bounds within the short term model chen et al 2014 proposed the control strategies and information feedback mechanisms among multi layer models and developed an optimal five layered coupling operation model for the three gorges and gezhouba cascade hydropower stations in the yangtze river basin china xu et al 2015 developed a multi objective optimization model for cascade hydropower system to identify short term operation strategies that could ensure long term energy production simultaneously bo et al 2017 developed a nesting model that incorporated both long and short term operating decisions and optimized the scale of photovoltaic plant to integrate with longyangxia hydropower station however the accuracy of long term runoff forecasts would be much lower than that of short term due to their longer forecast horizon lu et al 2016 regonda et al 2013 zhao et al 2012 zhao and zhao 2014 making it difficult for these multi layer operation models to obtain the optimal long term decision and consequently resulting in inappropriate boundary conditions for the short term reservoir operation zhao and zhao 2014 another approach to minimize the impact of the estimation errors of carryover storage on the operational decision is to extend the operating horizon as carryover storage has a negligible effect on the decision horizon at a sufficiently long operating horizon for example wang 2010 proposed a stochastic control approach to determine the optimal weekly operation strategy of multiple hydropower reservoirs they assumed that the long term optimal storage trajectory was an annual cycle process and the real time optimal storage trajectory would converge to the optimal annually cycling storage trajectory at the end of the real time horizon however it is difficult to determine how long the operating horizon should be extended meanwhile the longer the operating horizon is the more the runoff forecasts with larger uncertainties will be used there is a need to balance the impact of errors in runoff forecasts with those in estimating carryover storage significant challenges remain to find the optimal carryover storage to balance the immediate and carryover utilities for long term hydropower reservoir operation due to low forecast accuracy limited foresight and complex hydrologic hydraulic and electric connections between cascade reservoirs chao et al 2015 jiang et al 2019b despite the complexities the decision making process of reservoir operation can be simply viewed as a two stage model that involves the release of stored water in the current operating horizon and the retaining of water for future use zhao et al 2011a b based on the bellman optimality principle dynamic programming dp can be used to convert a multi period model into a recursive two stage model where the optimal decision results from a trade off between immediate and future carryover utilities during the last decades dp and its improved algorithms such as incremental dp hall et al 1969 dynamic programming successive approximation dpsa larson and korsak 1970 discrete differential dynamic programming heidari et al 1971 and folded dynamic programming kumar and baliarsingh 2003 have been widely used in reservoir operation zhao et al 2011a b proposed a concave approximation to the hydropower generation function and a successive improved dynamic programming algorithm for hydropower reservoir operation based on the two stage formulation in recent years stochastic dynamic programming sdp which considers the inflow uncertainty has been gradually developed wei et al 2014 developed a two stage bayesian sdp model to guide the real time operation of cascaded hydropower systems lei et al 2018 developed an sdp based hydropower optimal operation model where the utility function of the carryover storage ufcs at the end of the year was fitted with a linear regression model a potential problem of dp that can limit its use in multi reservoir systems is the curse of dimensionality the ufcs for a single hydropower reservoir depends on both reservoir storage and release which is difficult to obtain for cascade reservoirs pan et al 2012 tan et al 2019 have obtained the ufcss at the end of each month for a single hydropower station and incorporated it into three stochastic optimal operation models to guide the long term operation in this study we will extend the method to cascade hydropower reservoirs the main contributions of this work are as follows 1 in order to avoid the curse of dimensionality the carryover utility of cascade hydropower reservoirs is expressed as a function of the carryover potential energy which is obtained by a successive iteration method and 2 a two stage optimal operation model tsoom is proposed for dynamical control of the optimal carryover storages of cascade hydropower stations the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the methodology a case study is shown in section 3 and conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 formulation of hydropower optimal operation a generalized objective function for deterministic hydropower optimal operation at period t can be expressed as 1 max i 1 n f t s i t u i t q i t f t 1 s t 1 where n is the number of hydropower stations s i t is the storage of the ith reservoir at the beginning of period t s i t 1 is the storage at the end of period t or at the beginning of period t 1 which represents the carryover storage from periods preceding t to subsequent periods s t 1 s 1 t 1 s 2 t 1 s n t 1 is a n dimensional vector representing the carryover storage of n reservoirs at the end of period t u i t is the decision variable of the ith reservoir i e the release or output during period t or the storage at the end of period t in this study s i t 1 is chosen as the decision variable u i t s i t 1 q i t is the inflow from external sources for the ith reservoir at period t f t is the immediate utility at period t and f t 1 is the ufcs at the end of period t i e the value function of water saved for periods beyond t it is important but difficult to obtain the ufcs for cascade hydropower reservoirs on the one hand there is no prior knowledge about which function is proper to fit the ufcs the outflows from upstream reservoirs can be reused by downstream reservoirs and thus the carryover utility of cascade hydropower reservoirs can be affected by the combinations of carryover storage the complex hydraulic connections between cascade hydropower reservoirs make it more difficult to obtain the explicit expression of ufcs one the other hand as the number of reservoirs increases the number of ufcs parameters grows exponentially given these considerations the concept of utility function of the carryover potential energy ufcpe is proposed in this study where the potential energy of the carryover storages is first calculated and then the carryover utility is expressed as a function of the carryover potential energy for reservoir i assuming that the carryover storage at period t is s i t 1 the carryover potential energy œï i t 1 can be defined as pan et al 2011 2 œï i t 1 s i t 1 min s i t 1 j d i Œ∑ j h j t 1 s j t 1 d s i t 1 where s i t 1 min is the lower limit of the storage of reservoir i at the end of period t d i is the superscript set of reservoir i and its downstream reservoirs with direct hydraulic connection to it Œ∑ j is the generating efficiency of reservoir j h j t 1 s j t 1 is the available net head of reservoir j which is a function of the current carryover storage s j t 1 for n reservoirs in a cascade hydropower system the carryover potential energy at period t œï t 1 can be calculated by eq 3 3 œï t 1 i 1 n œï i t 1 i 1 n s i t 1 min s i t 1 j d i Œ∑ j h j s j t 1 d s i t 1 the carryover utility is defined as a function of the carryover potential energy 4 h t 1 œï t 1 f t 1 s t 1 where h t 1 is the ufcpe at the end of period t once the long term ufcpe h t 1 for cascade hydropower reservoirs is obtained the long term operation decision making can be easily determined by combining eq 3 and eq 5 5 max i 1 n f t s i t s i t 1 q i t h t 1 œï t 1 a layered coupling operation model can also be developed so that the results from long term monthly or seasonal studies can be used as inputs for short term operation over an hourly or daily time period in this study we focus on the long term optimal operation model for cascade reservoirs 2 2 ufcpe obtained by a successive iteration method the carryover utility for each combination of carryover storage can be obtained by backward recursive calculation of dp in order to avoid the problem of curse of dimensionality in conventional dp a successive iteration method is proposed in this study which uses few discrete nodes to obtain input output samples of ufcpe and then uses a proper function to describe the mapping relationship between them by successive iteration with a given convergence criterion this study divides a year into t periods for a river basin with n reservoirs and there are n reservoirs with regulating performance the main steps of the successive iteration method are as follows see fig 1 1 for stage t t disperse the end storage of the reservoirs with regulating performance into m points there are m n combinations of carryover storage s t 1 k k 1 2 m n 2 calculate the carryover potential energy for the k th combination œï t 1 k k 1 2 m n using eq 3 3 if t 0 go to step 4 otherwise t t 1 and return to step 1 4 develop the recursive equation of dp 6 b t s t max e q t i 1 n f t s i t s i t 1 q i t h t 1 œï t 1 where q t q 1 t q 2 t q n t is a n dimensional vector representing the stochastic inflows of the n reservoirs at period t e q t is an expectation operator related to the stochastic vector q t b t is the maximum expected carryover utility from period t to the end of the operation horizon t which is a function of s t 5 initialize the carryover utility of the last period to zero h t 1 œï t 1 k 0 k 1 2 m n 6 initialize t t 7 calculate the carryover utility b t k s t k using eq 7 given that the combination of the carryover storage of period t 1 is s t k traverse all combinations of carryover storage and obtain the sample set of the carryover utility b t k s t k k 1 2 m n 7 b t k s t k max e q t i 1 n f t s i t k s i t 1 k q i t h t 1 œï t 1 k 8 fit ufcpe h t using œï t k as inputs and b t k s t k k 1 2 m n as outputs 8 b t k s t k h t œï t k k 1 2 m n 9 if t 0 go to step 10 otherwise t t 1 and return to step 7 10 calculate the minimal carryover utility b min at the beginning of period 1 using eq 9 9 b min min k b 1 k s 1 k k 1 2 m n 11 update the carryover utility samples of the last period using eq 10 10 b t 1 k s t 1 k b 1 k s 1 k b min k 1 2 m n 12 fit ufcpe of period t h t 1 using œï t 1 k as inputs and b t 1 k s t 1 k k 1 2 m n as outputs 11 b t 1 k s t 1 k h t 1 œï t 1 k k 1 2 m n 13 if the convergence criterion is met save and output the ufcpe of each period otherwise return to step 6 as the backward recursive calculation the carryover utility will accumulate accordingly for dp it is the difference between carryover utilities in different combinations of carryover storage rather than the values themselves that can have an effect on the operating results therefore the steps 10 and 11 are used to avoid too large carryover utilities in the iteration one key to obtaining a high precision ufcpe is to choose a proper function approximator we have previously studied the ufcs for a single hydropower station tan et al 2019 and the results show that 1 the carryover utility increases with the carryover storage and 2 the ufcs changes gradually from an approximate concave function to a nearly linear function with the shift from the flood season to the dry season these findings can provide some prior knowledge for choosing the function approximator for ufcpe a multi reservoir system can be regarded as a virtual reservoir the potential energy can indicate the amount of hydropower generated in the future for cascade hydropower stations just as the carryover storage can reflect the future hydropower generation for a single hydropower station assuming that ufcpe can be well fitted by a quadratic function 12 h t 1 œï t 1 a t 1 œï t 1 2 b t 1 œï t 1 c t 1 t 0 1 2 t where a t 1 b t 1 and c t 1 are three coefficients of ufcpe at period t for example if a year is divided into 12 months when t 0 h 1 œï 1 means the ufcpe at the beginning of january when t 1 h 2 œï 2 means the ufcpe at the end of january or at the beginning of february and when t 12 h 13 œï 13 means the ufcpe at the end of december if the ufcpe of cascade reservoirs has similar properties as the ufcs of a single reservoir the value of a t 1 in the flood season will be small and thus there will be a nearly linear relationship while the value of b t 1 in the dry season will increase and the approximate concave characteristics can be described it should be noted that the ufcs i e f t 1 for cascade hydropower stations can also be obtained by the successive iteration method to guide the long term hydropower operation see eq 1 however it is difficult to determine the function form of f t 1 due to limited prior knowledge and complex hydraulic connections between cascade reservoirs some intelligent black box models such as artificial neural network ann can be chosen as the function approximator unfortunately as there are more parameters in f t 1 than in h t 1 more input output pairs are needed to fit the function and models like ann also require large input and output samples making it time consuming and difficult to achieve global convergence bradtke 1993 another key to obtaining a high performance ufcpe is to define a proper convergence criterion in this study the following criterion is used see eq 13 13 max t a t Œæ 1 a t Œæ b t Œæ 1 b t Œæ c t Œæ 1 c t Œæ Œµ t 1 2 t 1 where Œµ is a small positive number Œ∂ is the number of iterations a t Œæ b t Œæ c t Œæ are the function coefficients of h t obtained from Œ∂ th iterations eq 13 means that all parameters should converge after several iterations 2 3 long term hydropower optimal operation model after obtaining the ufcpe the multi period sequential decision making problem for cascade hydropower stations shown in eq 1 can be converted into a two stage decision making problem the tsoom for cascade hydropower reservoirs can be defined as 14 s t 1 arg max i 1 n f t s i t s i t 1 q i t h t 1 œï t 1 eq 14 means that the goal is to find the optimal combination of carryover storage for cascade reservoirs s t 1 to make the sum of the immediate utility and carryover utility maximal s t 1 can strike a good balance between short and long term benefits the following constraints should be included in the model 1 water balance constraint 15 s i t 1 s i t q i t j œà i r j t r i t Œ¥ t 16 r i t q i t a i t where r i t is the release of reservoir i at period t Œ¥ t is the time interval q i t and a i t are the generation and surplus discharges of reservoir i at period t 2 reservoir storage constraint 17 s i t min s i t s i t max where s i t max is the upper limit of the storage of reservoir i at the beginning of period t 3 flow constraint 18 r i t min r i t r i t max q i min q i t q i max where r i t min and r i t max are the lower and upper limits of the total release of reservoir i at period t q i min and q i max are the lower and upper limits of the generation discharge of reservoir i 4 power generating constraint 19 n i t n

reservoir i 3 case study 3 1 study area and data the yalong river originated from the balyanlkalla mountain on the qinghai tibet plateau is the largest tributary of the jinsha river it is rich in rainfall and hydro energy resources five hydropower reservoirs including jinping i jp i jinping ii jp ii guandi gd ertan et and tongzilin tzl reservoirs in the lower reaches of the yalong river are selected in this case study fig 2 and their main characteristic parameters are listed in table 1 jp i is an annual regulation reservoir et is a seasonal regulation reservoir and others are daily regulation reservoirs as the backbone power source of the west to east power transmission project the jp i jp ii and gd hydropower stations are combined as a group of power sources with a total installed capacity of 10 8 million kw which is of great significance for further implementing the national strategy of western development and effectively alleviating the tense situation of power consumption in the east china power grid of china et is the first power station built on the yalong river and the backbone power source of sichuan chongqing power grid its hydropower generation accounts for about 1 3 of sichuan power grid and 1 4 of sichuan chongqing power grid it plays an important role in guaranteeing the power supply of the sichuan chongqing power grid these five reservoirs are constructed mainly for hydropower generation with a total installed capacity of 14 7 million kw and the average annual hydropower generation of 72 1 billion kw h meanwhile in order to ensure the safety of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in the flood season et and jp i reservoirs are required to reserve 9 and 16 billion flood control capacity in june and july and accordingly the water level should be kept below 1859 m and 1192 m respectively at present conventional rules cr and conventional optimization methods com are used to guide the long term hydropower operation fig 3 a b show the cr of jp i and et reservoirs respectively their water levels are divided into several zones corresponding to different outputs the steps of cr in guiding the long term hydropower operation are as follows step 1 identify the current operating period t step 2 determine the hydropower outputs of jp i and et according to the water level at the beginning of period t for example the hydropower outputs of jp i and et are 2080 mw and 3300 mw at a water level of 1170 m and 1185 m in july respectively step 3 fix the hydropower outputs of jp i and et and determine the combination of carryover storage s t 1 by the water balance equation step 4 repeat steps 1 3 until the end of the operating horizon given the low accuracy of long term inflow forecast and limited forecast horizon com always uses the fixed storage trajectories to guide the hydropower operation based on an assumed inflow process its steps in guiding the long term hydropower operation are as follows step 1 in order to ensure the safety of the power supply system the inflow over the whole year is conservatively estimated with an excess probability p p 70 75 q p 1 q p 2 q p t step 2 input q p 1 q p 2 q p t into the deterministic optimal operation model and obtain the optimal carryover storage trajectories s 2 s 3 s t 1 step 3 identify the current operating period t step 4 fix the combination of carryover storage to be s t 1 and make other decisions such as hydropower output and release using the water balance equation step 5 repeat steps 3 4 until the end of the operating horizon there are some shortcomings for the use of cr and com in guiding the long term hydropower operation for example each reservoir releases according to its cr predetermined in the design stage without considering the joint operation of cascade reservoirs and the same fixed storage trajectories are used in com in both dry and wet seasons which is not conducive to improving the utilization efficiency of water energy therefore there is still room to improve the total hydropower generation the monthly inflow data over a 53 year period from 1960 to 2012 were collected and divided into the training 1960 1999 and testing 2000 2012 dataset the former of which was used to obtain the ufcpe while the latter of which was used to validate the performance of the ufcpe based tsoom in guiding the long term operation of hydropower stations the monthly inflow is un even distributed fig 4 it is high in the flood season from may to october but low in the dry season from november to april the interval inflow between two reservoirs is calculated by the water balance method and the interval inflow between jp i and jp ii reservoirs is negligible due to the small area between them 3 2 results and discussion in this section the ufcpe is obtained and the performance of ufcpe based tsoom in guiding the long term hydropower operation is evaluated and compared with that of cr com and dpsa 3 2 1 results of ufcpe the monthly inflow data for the period 1960 1999 are used to obtain the ufcpe by the successive iteration method described in section 2 2 the end storage of jp i and et reservoirs is dispersed into 4 points thus obtain 16 combinations of carryover storage the parameters of ufcpe for 12 months keep unchanged after 3 iterations the fitting performance at the end of the t period is evaluated using the root mean squared error rms e t mean absolute relative error mar e t and mean absolute error ma e t see eqs 22 24 22 rms e t 1 m n k 1 m n b t 1 k s t 1 k h t 1 œï t 1 k 2 23 mar e t 1 m n k 1 m n b t 1 k s t 1 k h t 1 œï t 1 k b t 1 k s t 1 k 100 24 ma e t 1 m n k 1 m n b t 1 k s t 1 k h t 1 œï t 1 k where b t 1 k s t 1 k and h t 1 œï t 1 k are the carryover utilities obtained from eq 7 and calculated by ufcpe of the last iteration m n and k have the same meanings as mentioned in section 2 2 the closer the rms e t m a r e t and m a e t values are to 0 the better the performance of the fitting table 2 shows that using a quadratic function as a function approximator results in a satisfactory fitting performance for comparison ann is also used to fit the ufcpe table 3 shows its fitting performance it is obvious that the values of rms e t m a r e t and m a e t are much higher than these of using a quadratic function as a function approximator it is also found that with the increase of the discrete number of end storage the fitting performance can be improved however the computation time will increase with an exponential rate which conflicts with our initial purpose of avoiding the curse of dimensionality and the trial and error process to determine the number of hidden nodes makes it more time consuming therefore this study based on the conclusion we obtained from the single hydropower operation choosing a quadratic function to fit the ufcpe is not only simple but with high efficiency compared with other large dada based black box models fig 5 shows ufcpe obtained by the successive iteration method the ufcpe increases with the carryover potential energy thus indicating that the higher the carryover potential energy the more the hydropower generation in the carryover stage however it is also noted that as the carryover potential energy increases the ufcpe increases linearly in the dry season but monotonically at a decreasing rate in the flood season fig 6 shows changes in the parameters a t and b t of ufcpe with the operating period the absolute values of the second order coefficient a t are higher in the flood season than in the dry season while the opposite is observed for those of the first order coefficient b t therefore the ufcpe shows obvious linear characteristics in the dry season but non linear characteristics in the flood season which is consistent with what we have found for ufcs of a single hydropower station and results from possible surplus water in the flood season the inflow is high in the flood season while the installed capacity and power discharge capacity are limited higher carryover potential energy for cascade reservoirs or higher carryover storage for a single reservoir will result in more spillage in the carryover stage and consequently reduce the value of unit water volume it should be noted that although carryover potential energy and carryover utility have the same physical unit they have totally different meanings the former ignores the potential surplus water in the carryover stage thus future hydropower benefit is overestimated while the later implicitly considers inflow uncertainty and possible surplus water in the carryover stage which can obtain a better balance between immediate and future benefits 3 2 2 results of long term hydropower operation tsoom and dpsa are also used to guide the long term hydropower operation of cascade reservoirs for a river basin with n reservoirs and there are n reservoirs with regulating performance the main steps of tsoom and dpsa are as follows 1 tsoom step 1 identify the current operating period t step 2 use tsoom eq 14 to find the optimal combination of carryover storage s t 1 for cascade reservoirs step 3 fix the combination of carryover storage to be s t 1 and make other decisions such as hydropower output and release using the water balance equation step 4 repeat steps 1 3 until the end of the operating horizon 2 dpsa inflow is assumed to be perfectly forecasted and the operating decision is made by dpsa step 1 given the initial storage trajectories of the n reservoirs with regulating performance over the whole operating horizon for reservoirs with no regulating performance the storage is kept unchanged during the operation step 2 initialize i 1 Œ∂ 1 and c 0 0 and let Œµ be a fully small positive step 3 find the i th reservoir which has the regulating performance use dp to find the updated optimal storage trajectory of reservoir i while keeping the storage trajectories of other reservoirs unchanged step 4 if i n let i i 1 and return to step 3 otherwise go to step 5 step 5 simulate the operation of cascade reservoirs with the given storage trajectories and calculate the multi annual average hydropower generation c Œæ step 6 if c Œæ c Œæ 1 Œµ stop otherwise let i 1 and return to step 3 the average annual hydropower generation for cascade hydropower stations using the four methods in the training 1960 1999 and testing 2000 2012 periods are shown in fig 7 taking the testing period for an example the average annual hydropower generation of tsoom is 767 47 10 8 k w h with an increase of 65 06 10 8 k w h 9 26 and 20 60 10 8 k w h 2 75 compared to those of cr and com and a slight decrease of 9 46 10 8 k w h 1 22 compared to that of dpsa respectively it should be noted that the inflows used in dpsa have a much longer forecast horizon than that of the other three methods and the monthly inflow data for the period 1960 2012 are input once and for all and then the operating results over the whole operation horizon are obtained however in real time operation as the forecast horizon is limited and the forecast accuracy decreases with increasing forecast horizon it is difficult to obtain such long perfect inflow information tsoom and cr use the one period ahead inflows and determine the carryover storage of cascade reservoirs period by period while com uses the fixed carryover storage process determined with the 75 excess probability inflows as inputs dpsa assumes a perfect situation where there are no forecast errors and the forecast horizon is infinite therefore its cascade hydropower generation should be the highest and is used as a reference to measure the performance of other models the closer the cascade hydropower generation of cr com and tssoom to that of dpsa the better the performance it is obvious that ufcpe based tsoom is much superior to those of cr and com and quite close to that of dpsa in guiding the long term cascade hydropower reservoirs operation fig 8 shows the carryover storage processes of jp i and et reservoirs in the testing period obtained by different methods the performance of dpsa is the best see fig 7 as it uses perfect inflow information over the whole operating horizon to obtain a good joint operation performance the storage of jp i and et reservoirs should be decreased since the beginning of february and april respectively and increased since the beginning of june it is obvious that the performance of tsoom is closest to that of dpsa with quite similar times and speeds for the release and impounding of reservoir storage while the carryover storage of jp i and et guided by cr begins to decrease in december and february respectively which is with a big difference with that of dpsa and indicates that there is a need to optimize the cr meanwhile it can be found that there is little room for optimization in the dry seasons to keep a high water head to generate hydropower in the current period and retain more water for future use the water level of jp i from october to january and the water level of et from october to march should be as high as possible in this study a quadratic function is used to fit ufcpe due to its simple structure and ease of understanding the results show that the storage of tsoom is generally lower than that of dpsa in the flood season implying the need to further study the optimal function form of ufcpe 4 conclusions it remains challenging to achieve long term optimal joint operation for cascade reservoirs due to high forecast uncertainties and complex hydraulic connections between these cascade reservoirs this paper proposes a long term optimal operation method for cascade reservoirs based on the utility function of the carryover potential energy ufcpe the carryover utility for hydropower operation of cascade reservoirs is defined as a function of the carryover potential energy rather than the carryover storage which requires fewer function parameters and prior knowledge the ufcpe is fitted by a quadratic function based on the successive iteration method and then incorporated into a two stage optimal operation model tsoom to guide the long term optimal operation the case study with five cascade hydropower stations in the yalong river basin shows that ufcpe can be well fitted by a quadratic function than other large dada based black box models and the higher the carryover potential energy is the higher the carryover utilities will be the ufcpe increases almost linearly in the dry season but monotonously at a decreasing rate in the flood season in which there is a large quantity of surplus water the performance of ufcpe based tsoom in guiding the long term optimal operation of cascade hydropower stations is superior to those of conventional rules cr and optimization methods com and quite close to that of dynamic programming successive approximation dpsa in both training and testing periods its average annual hydropower generation in the testing period is increased by 65 06 10 8 k w h 9 26 and 20 60 10 8 k w h 2 75 compared to those of cr and com and decreased slightly by 9 46 10 8 k w h 1 22 compared to that of dpsa respectively in this study a quadratic function is used to fit the ufcpe due to its simple structure and ease of understanding the most appropriate function form of ufcpe needs more research and the parameters of the ufcpe can be further optimized by combining some advanced optimization algorithms declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

5989,challenge remains to find the optimal carryover storage to balance the immediate and carryover utilities for long term hydropower reservoir operation due to low forecast accuracy limited foresight and complex hydrologic hydraulic and electric connections between cascade hydropower reservoirs thus this paper proposes a long term optimal operation model to dynamically control the optimal carryover storages for cascade hydropower reservoirs first the carryover utility of cascade hydropower stations is expressed as a function of the carryover potential energy rather than the carryover storage thus decreasing the function parameters and using the limited prior knowledge then the utility function of the carryover potential energy ufcpe is fitted by a quadratic function based on a successive iteration method based on which a two stage optimal operation model tsoom is developed to guide the long term optimal operation of cascade hydropower stations the case study with five cascade hydropower stations in the yalong river basin shows that 1 ufcpe can be well fitted by a quadratic function and it increases linearly in the dry season but monotonically at a decreasing rate in the flood season resulting from a large quantity of surplus water and 2 the performance of ufcpe based tsoom is much superior to those of conventional rules and conventional optimization

mean absolute error kw h 1 introduction reservoir operation can be classified into short term daily hourly and long term monthly annual operation as it is essentially a sequential decision making process the long term availability of water resources and potential energy should be considered in short term reservoir operation in general the water consumption target and boundary conditions of the short term operation are offered by the long term operation thus it is important to develop optimal operation models that can balance short and long term reservoir operations liu et al 2008 the key to making a trade off between immediate and future benefits is to optimize the carryover storage for reservoir zhao et al 2015 jiang et al 2019a however definite carryover storage can only be obtained at some special time points for example the water level of an annual regulating reservoir should reach the normal water level at the end of the flood season and fall below the flood limited water level at the beginning of the flood season in most cases there is a lack of prior knowledge about the boundary conditions for optimal reservoir operation especially for cascade reservoirs the most widely used method to avoid subjective determination of carryover storage is to build optimal layered coupling operation models in which outputs storage or release from one model are used as the boundary conditions of the next echelon model sreekanth and mohapatra 2012 used a chance constrained optimization model to derive the optimum long term annual end storages which was then incorporated as constraints storage lower bounds within the short term model chen et al 2014 proposed the control strategies and information feedback mechanisms among multi layer models and developed an optimal five layered coupling operation model for the three gorges and gezhouba cascade hydropower stations in the yangtze river basin china xu et al 2015 developed a multi objective optimization model for cascade hydropower system to identify short term operation strategies that could ensure long term energy production simultaneously bo et al 2017 developed a nesting model that incorporated both long and short term operating decisions and optimized the scale of photovoltaic plant to integrate with longyangxia hydropower station however the accuracy of long term runoff forecasts would be much lower than that of short term due to their longer forecast horizon lu et al 2016 regonda et al 2013 zhao et al 2012 zhao and zhao 2014 making it difficult for these multi layer operation models to obtain the optimal long term decision and consequently resulting in inappropriate boundary conditions for the short term reservoir operation zhao and zhao 2014 another approach to minimize the impact of the estimation errors of carryover storage on the operational decision is to extend the operating horizon as carryover storage has a negligible effect on the decision horizon at a sufficiently long operating horizon for example wang 2010 proposed a stochastic control approach to determine the optimal weekly operation strategy of multiple hydropower reservoirs they assumed that the long term optimal storage trajectory was an annual cycle process and the real time optimal storage trajectory would converge to the optimal annually cycling storage trajectory at the end of the real time horizon however it is difficult to determine how long the operating horizon should be extended meanwhile the longer the operating horizon is the more the runoff forecasts with larger uncertainties will be used there is a need to balance the impact of errors in runoff forecasts with those in estimating carryover storage significant challenges remain to find the optimal carryover storage to balance the immediate and carryover utilities for long term hydropower reservoir operation due to low forecast accuracy limited foresight and complex hydrologic hydraulic and electric connections between cascade reservoirs chao et al 2015 jiang et al 2019b despite the complexities the decision making process of reservoir operation can be simply viewed as a two stage model that involves the release of stored water in the current operating horizon and the retaining of water for future use zhao et al 2011a b based on the bellman optimality principle dynamic programming dp can be used to convert a multi period model into a recursive two stage model where the optimal decision results from a trade off between immediate and future carryover utilities during the last decades dp and its improved algorithms such as incremental dp hall et al 1969 dynamic programming successive approximation dpsa larson and korsak 1970 discrete differential dynamic programming heidari et al 1971 and folded dynamic programming kumar and baliarsingh 2003 have been widely used in reservoir operation zhao et al 2011a b proposed a concave approximation to the hydropower generation function and a successive improved dynamic programming algorithm for hydropower reservoir operation based on the two stage formulation in recent years stochastic dynamic programming sdp which considers the inflow uncertainty has been gradually developed wei et al 2014 developed a two stage bayesian sdp model to guide the real time operation of cascaded hydropower systems lei et al 2018 developed an sdp based hydropower optimal operation model where the utility function of the carryover storage ufcs at the end of the year was fitted with a linear regression model a potential problem of dp that can limit its use in multi reservoir systems is the curse of dimensionality the ufcs for a single hydropower reservoir depends on both reservoir storage and release which is difficult to obtain for cascade reservoirs pan et al 2012 tan et al 2019 have obtained the ufcss at the end of each month for a single hydropower station and incorporated it into three stochastic optimal operation models to guide the long term operation in this study we will extend the method to cascade hydropower reservoirs the main contributions of this work are as follows 1 in order to avoid the curse of dimensionality the carryover utility of cascade hydropower reservoirs is expressed as a function of the carryover potential energy which is obtained by a successive iteration method and 2 a two stage optimal operation model tsoom is proposed for dynamical control of the optimal carryover storages of cascade hydropower stations the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the methodology a case study is shown in section 3 and conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 formulation of hydropower optimal operation a generalized objective function for deterministic hydropower optimal operation at period t can be expressed as 1 max i 1 n f t s i t u i t q i t f t 1 s t 1 where n is the number of hydropower stations s i t is the storage of the ith reservoir at the beginning of period t s i t 1 is the storage at the end of period t or at the beginning of period t 1 which represents the carryover storage from periods preceding t to subsequent periods s t 1 s 1 t 1 s 2 t 1 s n t 1 is a n dimensional vector representing the carryover storage of n reservoirs at the end of period t u i t is the decision variable of the ith reservoir i e the release or output during period t or the storage at the end of period t in this study s i t 1 is chosen as the decision variable u i t s i t 1 q i t is the inflow from external sources for the ith reservoir at period t f t is the immediate utility at period t and f t 1 is the ufcs at the end of period t i e the value function of water saved for periods beyond t it is important but difficult to obtain the ufcs for cascade hydropower reservoirs on the one hand there is no prior knowledge about which function is proper to fit the ufcs the outflows from upstream reservoirs can be reused by downstream reservoirs and thus the carryover utility of cascade hydropower reservoirs can be affected by the combinations of carryover storage the complex hydraulic connections between cascade hydropower reservoirs make it more difficult to obtain the explicit expression of ufcs one the other hand as the number of reservoirs increases the number of ufcs parameters grows exponentially given these considerations the concept of utility function of the carryover potential energy ufcpe is proposed in this study where the potential energy of the carryover storages is first calculated and then the carryover utility is expressed as a function of the carryover potential energy for reservoir i assuming that the carryover storage at period t is s i t 1 the carryover potential energy œï i t 1 can be defined as pan et al 2011 2 œï i t 1 s i t 1 min s i t 1 j d i Œ∑ j h j t 1 s j t 1 d s i t 1 where s i t 1 min is the lower limit of the storage of reservoir i at the end of period t d i is the superscript set of reservoir i and its downstream reservoirs with direct hydraulic connection to it Œ∑ j is the generating efficiency of reservoir j h j t 1 s j t 1 is the available net head of reservoir j which is a function of the current carryover storage s j t 1 for n reservoirs in a cascade hydropower system the carryover potential energy at period t œï t 1 can be calculated by eq 3 3 œï t 1 i 1 n œï i t 1 i 1 n s i t 1 min s i t 1 j d i Œ∑ j h j s j t 1 d s i t 1 the carryover utility is defined as a function of the carryover potential energy 4 h t 1 œï t 1 f t 1 s t 1 where h t 1 is the ufcpe at the end of period t once the long term ufcpe h t 1 for cascade hydropower reservoirs is obtained the long term operation decision making can be easily determined by combining eq 3 and eq 5 5 max i 1 n f t s i t s i t 1 q i t h t 1 œï t 1 a layered coupling operation model can also be developed so that the results from long term monthly or seasonal studies can be used as inputs for short term operation over an hourly or daily time period in this study we focus on the long term optimal operation model for cascade reservoirs 2 2 ufcpe obtained by a successive iteration method the carryover utility for each combination of carryover storage can be obtained by backward recursive calculation of dp in order to avoid the problem of curse of dimensionality in conventional dp a successive iteration method is proposed in this study which uses few discrete nodes to obtain input output samples of ufcpe and then uses a proper function to describe the mapping relationship between them by successive iteration with a given convergence criterion this study divides a year into t periods for a river basin with n reservoirs and there are n reservoirs with regulating performance the main steps of the successive iteration method are as follows see fig 1 1 for stage t t disperse the end storage of the reservoirs with regulating performance into m points there are m n combinations of carryover storage s t 1 k k 1 2 m n 2 calculate the carryover potential energy for the k th combination œï t 1 k k 1 2 m n using eq 3 3 if t 0 go to step 4 otherwise t t 1 and return to step 1 4 develop the recursive equation of dp 6 b t s t max e q t i 1 n f t s i t s i t 1 q i t h t 1 œï t 1 where q t q 1 t q 2 t q n t is a n dimensional vector representing the stochastic inflows of the n reservoirs at period t e q t is an expectation operator related to the stochastic vector q t b t is the maximum expected carryover utility from period t to the end of the operation horizon t which is a function of s t 5 initialize the carryover utility of the last period to zero h t 1 œï t 1 k 0 k 1 2 m n 6 initialize t t 7 calculate the carryover utility b t k s t k using eq 7 given that the combination of the carryover storage of period t 1 is s t k traverse all combinations of carryover storage and obtain the sample set of the carryover utility b t k s t k k 1 2 m n 7 b t k s t k max e q t i 1 n f t s i t k s i t 1 k q i t h t 1 œï t 1 k 8 fit ufcpe h t using œï t k as inputs and b t k s t k k 1 2 m n as outputs 8 b t k s t k h t œï t k k 1 2 m n 9 if t 0 go to step 10 otherwise t t 1 and return to step 7 10 calculate the minimal carryover utility b min at the beginning of period 1 using eq 9 9 b min min k b 1 k s 1 k k 1 2 m n 11 update the carryover utility samples of the last period using eq 10 10 b t 1 k s t 1 k b 1 k s 1 k b min k 1 2 m n 12 fit ufcpe of period t h t 1 using œï t 1 k as inputs and b t 1 k s t 1 k k 1 2 m n as outputs 11 b t 1 k s t 1 k h t 1 œï t 1 k k 1 2 m n 13 if the convergence criterion is met save and output the ufcpe of each period otherwise return to step 6 as the backward recursive calculation the carryover utility will accumulate accordingly for dp it is the difference between carryover utilities in different combinations of carryover storage rather than the values themselves that can have an effect on the operating results therefore the steps 10 and 11 are used to avoid too large carryover utilities in the iteration one key to obtaining a high precision ufcpe is to choose a proper function approximator we have previously studied the ufcs for a single hydropower station tan et al 2019 and the results show that 1 the carryover utility increases with the carryover storage and 2 the ufcs changes gradually from an approximate concave function to a nearly linear function with the shift from the flood season to the dry season these findings can provide some prior knowledge for choosing the function approximator for ufcpe a multi reservoir system can be regarded as a virtual reservoir the potential energy can indicate the amount of hydropower generated in the future for cascade hydropower stations just as the carryover storage can reflect the future hydropower generation for a single hydropower station assuming that ufcpe can be well fitted by a quadratic function 12 h t 1 œï t 1 a t 1 œï t 1 2 b t 1 œï t 1 c t 1 t 0 1 2 t where a t 1 b t 1 and c t 1 are three coefficients of ufcpe at period t for example if a year is divided into 12 months when t 0 h 1 œï 1 means the ufcpe at the beginning of january when t 1 h 2 œï 2 means the ufcpe at the end of january or at the beginning of february and when t 12 h 13 œï 13 means the ufcpe at the end of december if the ufcpe of cascade reservoirs has similar properties as the ufcs of a single reservoir the value of a t 1 in the flood season will be small and thus there will be a nearly linear relationship while the value of b t 1 in the dry season will increase and the approximate concave characteristics can be described it should be noted that the ufcs i e f t 1 for cascade hydropower stations can also be obtained by the successive iteration method to guide the long term hydropower operation see eq 1 however it is difficult to determine the function form of f t 1 due to limited prior knowledge and complex hydraulic connections between cascade reservoirs some intelligent black box models such as artificial neural network ann can be chosen as the function approximator unfortunately as there are more parameters in f t 1 than in h t 1 more input output pairs are needed to fit the function and models like ann also require large input and output samples making it time consuming and difficult to achieve global convergence bradtke 1993 another key to obtaining a high performance ufcpe is to define a proper convergence criterion in this study the following criterion is used see eq 13 13 max t a t Œæ 1 a t Œæ b t Œæ 1 b t Œæ c t Œæ 1 c t Œæ Œµ t 1 2 t 1 where Œµ is a small positive number Œ∂ is the number of iterations a t Œæ b t Œæ c t Œæ are the function coefficients of h t obtained from Œ∂ th iterations eq 13 means that all parameters should converge after several iterations 2 3 long term hydropower optimal operation model after obtaining the ufcpe the multi period sequential decision making problem for cascade hydropower stations shown in eq 1 can be converted into a two stage decision making problem the tsoom for cascade hydropower reservoirs can be defined as 14 s t 1 arg max i 1 n f t s i t s i t 1 q i t h t 1 œï t 1 eq 14 means that the goal is to find the optimal combination of carryover storage for cascade reservoirs s t 1 to make the sum of the immediate utility and carryover utility maximal s t 1 can strike a good balance between short and long term benefits the following constraints should be included in the model 1 water balance constraint 15 s i t 1 s i t q i t j œà i r j t r i t Œ¥ t 16 r i t q i t a i t where r i t is the release of reservoir i at period t Œ¥ t is the time interval q i t and a i t are the generation and surplus discharges of reservoir i at period t 2 reservoir storage constraint 17 s i t min s i t s i t max where s i t max is the upper limit of the storage of reservoir i at the beginning of period t 3 flow constraint 18 r i t min r i t r i t max q i min q i t q i max where r i t min and r i t max are the lower and upper limits of the total release of reservoir i at period t q i min and q i max are the lower and upper limits of the generation discharge of reservoir i 4 power generating constraint 19 n i t n

reservoir i 3 case study 3 1 study area and data the yalong river originated from the balyanlkalla mountain on the qinghai tibet plateau is the largest tributary of the jinsha river it is rich in rainfall and hydro energy resources five hydropower reservoirs including jinping i jp i jinping ii jp ii guandi gd ertan et and tongzilin tzl reservoirs in the lower reaches of the yalong river are selected in this case study fig 2 and their main characteristic parameters are listed in table 1 jp i is an annual regulation reservoir et is a seasonal regulation reservoir and others are daily regulation reservoirs as the backbone power source of the west to east power transmission project the jp i jp ii and gd hydropower stations are combined as a group of power sources with a total installed capacity of 10 8 million kw which is of great significance for further implementing the national strategy of western development and effectively alleviating the tense situation of power consumption in the east china power grid of china et is the first power station built on the yalong river and the backbone power source of sichuan chongqing power grid its hydropower generation accounts for about 1 3 of sichuan power grid and 1 4 of sichuan chongqing power grid it plays an important role in guaranteeing the power supply of the sichuan chongqing power grid these five reservoirs are constructed mainly for hydropower generation with a total installed capacity of 14 7 million kw and the average annual hydropower generation of 72 1 billion kw h meanwhile in order to ensure the safety of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in the flood season et and jp i reservoirs are required to reserve 9 and 16 billion flood control capacity in june and july and accordingly the water level should be kept below 1859 m and 1192 m respectively at present conventional rules cr and conventional optimization methods com are used to guide the long term hydropower operation fig 3 a b show the cr of jp i and et reservoirs respectively their water levels are divided into several zones corresponding to different outputs the steps of cr in guiding the long term hydropower operation are as follows step 1 identify the current operating period t step 2 determine the hydropower outputs of jp i and et according to the water level at the beginning of period t for example the hydropower outputs of jp i and et are 2080 mw and 3300 mw at a water level of 1170 m and 1185 m in july respectively step 3 fix the hydropower outputs of jp i and et and determine the combination of carryover storage s t 1 by the water balance equation step 4 repeat steps 1 3 until the end of the operating horizon given the low accuracy of long term inflow forecast and limited forecast horizon com always uses the fixed storage trajectories to guide the hydropower operation based on an assumed inflow process its steps in guiding the long term hydropower operation are as follows step 1 in order to ensure the safety of the power supply system the inflow over the whole year is conservatively estimated with an excess probability p p 70 75 q p 1 q p 2 q p t step 2 input q p 1 q p 2 q p t into the deterministic optimal operation model and obtain the optimal carryover storage trajectories s 2 s 3 s t 1 step 3 identify the current operating period t step 4 fix the combination of carryover storage to be s t 1 and make other decisions such as hydropower output and release using the water balance equation step 5 repeat steps 3 4 until the end of the operating horizon there are some shortcomings for the use of cr and com in guiding the long term hydropower operation for example each reservoir releases according to its cr predetermined in the design stage without considering the joint operation of cascade reservoirs and the same fixed storage trajectories are used in com in both dry and wet seasons which is not conducive to improving the utilization efficiency of water energy therefore there is still room to improve the total hydropower generation the monthly inflow data over a 53 year period from 1960 to 2012 were collected and divided into the training 1960 1999 and testing 2000 2012 dataset the former of which was used to obtain the ufcpe while the latter of which was used to validate the performance of the ufcpe based tsoom in guiding the long term operation of hydropower stations the monthly inflow is un even distributed fig 4 it is high in the flood season from may to october but low in the dry season from november to april the interval inflow between two reservoirs is calculated by the water balance method and the interval inflow between jp i and jp ii reservoirs is negligible due to the small area between them 3 2 results and discussion in this section the ufcpe is obtained and the performance of ufcpe based tsoom in guiding the long term hydropower operation is evaluated and compared with that of cr com and dpsa 3 2 1 results of ufcpe the monthly inflow data for the period 1960 1999 are used to obtain the ufcpe by the successive iteration method described in section 2 2 the end storage of jp i and et reservoirs is dispersed into 4 points thus obtain 16 combinations of carryover storage the parameters of ufcpe for 12 months keep unchanged after 3 iterations the fitting performance at the end of the t period is evaluated using the root mean squared error rms e t mean absolute relative error mar e t and mean absolute error ma e t see eqs 22 24 22 rms e t 1 m n k 1 m n b t 1 k s t 1 k h t 1 œï t 1 k 2 23 mar e t 1 m n k 1 m n b t 1 k s t 1 k h t 1 œï t 1 k b t 1 k s t 1 k 100 24 ma e t 1 m n k 1 m n b t 1 k s t 1 k h t 1 œï t 1 k where b t 1 k s t 1 k and h t 1 œï t 1 k are the carryover utilities obtained from eq 7 and calculated by ufcpe of the last iteration m n and k have the same meanings as mentioned in section 2 2 the closer the rms e t m a r e t and m a e t values are to 0 the better the performance of the fitting table 2 shows that using a quadratic function as a function approximator results in a satisfactory fitting performance for comparison ann is also used to fit the ufcpe table 3 shows its fitting performance it is obvious that the values of rms e t m a r e t and m a e t are much higher than these of using a quadratic function as a function approximator it is also found that with the increase of the discrete number of end storage the fitting performance can be improved however the computation time will increase with an exponential rate which conflicts with our initial purpose of avoiding the curse of dimensionality and the trial and error process to determine the number of hidden nodes makes it more time consuming therefore this study based on the conclusion we obtained from the single hydropower operation choosing a quadratic function to fit the ufcpe is not only simple but with high efficiency compared with other large dada based black box models fig 5 shows ufcpe obtained by the successive iteration method the ufcpe increases with the carryover potential energy thus indicating that the higher the carryover potential energy the more the hydropower generation in the carryover stage however it is also noted that as the carryover potential energy increases the ufcpe increases linearly in the dry season but monotonically at a decreasing rate in the flood season fig 6 shows changes in the parameters a t and b t of ufcpe with the operating period the absolute values of the second order coefficient a t are higher in the flood season than in the dry season while the opposite is observed for those of the first order coefficient b t therefore the ufcpe shows obvious linear characteristics in the dry season but non linear characteristics in the flood season which is consistent with what we have found for ufcs of a single hydropower station and results from possible surplus water in the flood season the inflow is high in the flood season while the installed capacity and power discharge capacity are limited higher carryover potential energy for cascade reservoirs or higher carryover storage for a single reservoir will result in more spillage in the carryover stage and consequently reduce the value of unit water volume it should be noted that although carryover potential energy and carryover utility have the same physical unit they have totally different meanings the former ignores the potential surplus water in the carryover stage thus future hydropower benefit is overestimated while the later implicitly considers inflow uncertainty and possible surplus water in the carryover stage which can obtain a better balance between immediate and future benefits 3 2 2 results of long term hydropower operation tsoom and dpsa are also used to guide the long term hydropower operation of cascade reservoirs for a river basin with n reservoirs and there are n reservoirs with regulating performance the main steps of tsoom and dpsa are as follows 1 tsoom step 1 identify the current operating period t step 2 use tsoom eq 14 to find the optimal combination of carryover storage s t 1 for cascade reservoirs step 3 fix the combination of carryover storage to be s t 1 and make other decisions such as hydropower output and release using the water balance equation step 4 repeat steps 1 3 until the end of the operating horizon 2 dpsa inflow is assumed to be perfectly forecasted and the operating decision is made by dpsa step 1 given the initial storage trajectories of the n reservoirs with regulating performance over the whole operating horizon for reservoirs with no regulating performance the storage is kept unchanged during the operation step 2 initialize i 1 Œ∂ 1 and c 0 0 and let Œµ be a fully small positive step 3 find the i th reservoir which has the regulating performance use dp to find the updated optimal storage trajectory of reservoir i while keeping the storage trajectories of other reservoirs unchanged step 4 if i n let i i 1 and return to step 3 otherwise go to step 5 step 5 simulate the operation of cascade reservoirs with the given storage trajectories and calculate the multi annual average hydropower generation c Œæ step 6 if c Œæ c Œæ 1 Œµ stop otherwise let i 1 and return to step 3 the average annual hydropower generation for cascade hydropower stations using the four methods in the training 1960 1999 and testing 2000 2012 periods are shown in fig 7 taking the testing period for an example the average annual hydropower generation of tsoom is 767 47 10 8 k w h with an increase of 65 06 10 8 k w h 9 26 and 20 60 10 8 k w h 2 75 compared to those of cr and com and a slight decrease of 9 46 10 8 k w h 1 22 compared to that of dpsa respectively it should be noted that the inflows used in dpsa have a much longer forecast horizon than that of the other three methods and the monthly inflow data for the period 1960 2012 are input once and for all and then the operating results over the whole operation horizon are obtained however in real time operation as the forecast horizon is limited and the forecast accuracy decreases with increasing forecast horizon it is difficult to obtain such long perfect inflow information tsoom and cr use the one period ahead inflows and determine the carryover storage of cascade reservoirs period by period while com uses the fixed carryover storage process determined with the 75 excess probability inflows as inputs dpsa assumes a perfect situation where there are no forecast errors and the forecast horizon is infinite therefore its cascade hydropower generation should be the highest and is used as a reference to measure the performance of other models the closer the cascade hydropower generation of cr com and tssoom to that of dpsa the better the performance it is obvious that ufcpe based tsoom is much superior to those of cr and com and quite close to that of dpsa in guiding the long term cascade hydropower reservoirs operation fig 8 shows the carryover storage processes of jp i and et reservoirs in the testing period obtained by different methods the performance of dpsa is the best see fig 7 as it uses perfect inflow information over the whole operating horizon to obtain a good joint operation performance the storage of jp i and et reservoirs should be decreased since the beginning of february and april respectively and increased since the beginning of june it is obvious that the performance of tsoom is closest to that of dpsa with quite similar times and speeds for the release and impounding of reservoir storage while the carryover storage of jp i and et guided by cr begins to decrease in december and february respectively which is with a big difference with that of dpsa and indicates that there is a need to optimize the cr meanwhile it can be found that there is little room for optimization in the dry seasons to keep a high water head to generate hydropower in the current period and retain more water for future use the water level of jp i from october to january and the water level of et from october to march should be as high as possible in this study a quadratic function is used to fit ufcpe due to its simple structure and ease of understanding the results show that the storage of tsoom is generally lower than that of dpsa in the flood season implying the need to further study the optimal function form of ufcpe 4 conclusions it remains challenging to achieve long term optimal joint operation for cascade reservoirs due to high forecast uncertainties and complex hydraulic connections between these cascade reservoirs this paper proposes a long term optimal operation method for cascade reservoirs based on the utility function of the carryover potential energy ufcpe the carryover utility for hydropower operation of cascade reservoirs is defined as a function of the carryover potential energy rather than the carryover storage which requires fewer function parameters and prior knowledge the ufcpe is fitted by a quadratic function based on the successive iteration method and then incorporated into a two stage optimal operation model tsoom to guide the long term optimal operation the case study with five cascade hydropower stations in the yalong river basin shows that ufcpe can be well fitted by a quadratic function than other large dada based black box models and the higher the carryover potential energy is the higher the carryover utilities will be the ufcpe increases almost linearly in the dry season but monotonously at a decreasing rate in the flood season in which there is a large quantity of surplus water the performance of ufcpe based tsoom in guiding the long term optimal operation of cascade hydropower stations is superior to those of conventional rules cr and optimization methods com and quite close to that of dynamic programming successive approximation dpsa in both training and testing periods its average annual hydropower generation in the testing period is increased by 65 06 10 8 k w h 9 26 and 20 60 10 8 k w h 2 75 compared to those of cr and com and decreased slightly by 9 46 10 8 k w h 1 22 compared to that of dpsa respectively in this study a quadratic function is used to fit the ufcpe due to its simple structure and ease of understanding the most appropriate function form of ufcpe needs more research and the parameters of the ufcpe can be further optimized by combining some advanced optimization algorithms declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they
