9850,in seasonal frozen soil areas much meltwater is formed during the thawing period which easily causes snowmelt floods and waterlogging disasters the meltwater simultaneously replenishes groundwater and produces surface runoff to provide water for crop roots however there are insufficient researches on the infiltration process of meltwater under day thaw and night freezing conditions meltwater infiltration process and estimation could provide an important reference for spring irrigation meltwater disaster early warning systems and soil pollution research in this study the law of mass conservation was adopted for meltwater infiltration estimation under 15 and 30 cm snow covers according to the hypothetical curve trend characteristics of meltwater infiltration rate it is proposed to adopt boltzmann distribution function and determine the curve parameters through experimental results and the average daily maximum infiltration rate of frozen soil is 0 0622 cm hour during the thawing period the soil moisture content changes periodically and the period lasts approximately 10 h we also put forward the concept of the maximum meltwater storage volume ϝ of farmland meltwater which provides a new analysis structure for meltwater runoff research during the thawing periods when the snow cover thickness in the early stage of thawing period exceeds z the amount of meltwater infiltration does not greatly change and the maximum infiltration volume is between 3 15 and 5 25 cm the average daily meltwater infiltration amounts to 0 15 cm graphical abstract ga1 keywords meltwater infiltration thawing period infiltration rate curve maximum meltwater storage volumex 1 introduction there exists a large amount of snow in seasonal frozen soil areas which has an important value in the study of global climate change yasunari et al 1991 during the thawing period the amount of meltwater caused by snow melting is an important water resource for agriculture in cold regions some of the meltwater infiltrates groundwater to increase the soil moisture storage and the rest produces surface runoff which is an important reason for spring snowmelt floods and land waterlogging in addition melted water also increases the annual runoff harder et al 2019 flerchinger et al 2005 jeelani et al 2012 in certain areas the infiltration of meltwater occurs slowly and surface runoff is generated after the shallow thawing soil becomes saturated thus forming snowmelt floods which last for a long time even until the frozen soil has completely thawed yang et al 2019 in seasonal frozen soil areas infiltration is an important part of the meltwater destination which provides the water needed by crops bedient and huber 1988 therefore the study of meltwater infiltration in seasonal frozen soil areas provides an important reference to guide spring irrigation waterlogging disasters forecasting and snowmelt flood warnings and the amount of meltwater infiltration is an important reference parameter the infiltration of meltwater into frozen soil is a complicated process because it involves coupled heat and mass flow with phase changes and the comprehensive influence of complex conditions flerchinger et al 2005 gray et al 2001 zheng et al 2001 in seasonal frozen soil areas snow melting is completed approximately two months earlier than frozen soil thawing fu et al 2015 it has been found that frozen soil is accompanied by the whole process of meltwater infiltration the infiltration capacities of various frozen soils are different iwata et al 2018 proposed that frozen soil hinders meltwater infiltration produces a large amount of runoff and affects the soil water balance and soil anion movement he et al 2015 reported that the infiltration of meltwater in spring is mainly affected by two aspects one aspect is the porosity of the first 10 cm of soil during the frozen soil period and the second is the soil moisture content of the first 30 cm of soil in the early stage of soil freezing there are pores of different diameters in frozen soil the freezing of water in large pores increases the tortuosity of the water seepage path which seriously hinders the flow of liquid water in pores moreover the water in large pores freezes earlier than that in small pores but thaws later than that in small pores resulting in a notable decrease in the frozen soil permeability ireson et al 2012 lundberg et al 2015 helén 1988 according to demand et al 2019 the relationship between a high porosity and frozen depth plays an important role in controlling the permeability of seasonal frozen soil demand et al 2019 in winter farmland soil contains a large number of ice crystals which are very hard and exhibit a very low infiltration capacity and are considered to be almost impermeable flerchinger et al 2005 zuzel and pikul 1987 stoeckeler and weitzman 1960 also found that grassland permafrost also reveals a very low infiltration capacity however studies have demonstrated that even if soil is frozen if the soil is not fully saturated it still exhibits a certain infiltration capacity flerchinger et al 2005 he et al 2015 there are many pores in forest soil and its permeability is higher than that of frozen grassland soil stoeckeler and weitzman 1960 during the thawing period frozen soil is constantly subject to thawing and meltwater carries heat downward to raise the soil temperature above 0 c a soil matric potential difference occurs between the unfrozen layer along the thawing front and the frozen layer below the thawing front which leads to the continuous infiltration of meltwater mackay et al 1983 lee and molnau 1982 studied the infiltration characteristics of frozen soil by using a rainfall simulator and observed that the stable infiltration rate of frozen soil is negatively correlated with the soil water content to a large extent lee and molnau 1982 but the influence of the rainfall temperature and impact of frozen soil on infiltration was ignored kane and stein 1983 also concluded that there exists a negative correlation between the infiltration rate and soil water content through a study on the infiltration and water redistribution characteristics of frozen silty loam patterson and smith 1985 a high moisture content leads to a decrease in soil porosity and an increase in the tortuosity of the water infiltration path after freezing which is an important reason for the negative correlation between the infiltration rate and soil moisture content however it is difficult to simulate the infiltration of meltwater under real farmland conditions the water during the thawing period mainly originates from the melting of snow it is challenging to observe and simulate the covering effect of unfused snow and the temperature of meltwater research on the infiltration of meltwater in frozen soil needs to be further conducted zuzel and pikul 1987 considered that the infiltration characteristics of soil are related to the soil type and the freezing process does not alter the infiltration characteristics of soil under different tillage measures soil with a high clay content exhibits poor drainage and unique shrinkage and expansion characteristics nikiforoff et al 1933 1939 which may be an important reason for spring snowmelt floods sun 2019 verified the applicability of the kostiakov horton infiltration models and philip equation and general empirical infiltration model in their study area and determined the main factors influencing infiltration established a meltwater infiltration law in a seasonal frozen soil area by using the multiple linear regression method and found that the general empirical model attained a good simulation effect in the middle and late stages of snow melting sun 2019 in the above study the mechanism of meltwater infiltration was analysed regardless of the soil type or the soil moisture content before freezing the different soil pore conditions essentially affected meltwater infiltration according to surface infiltration conditions gray et al 2001 divided the frozen soil into three categories a restricted frozen soil water entry is impeded by surface conditions b limited frozen soil capillary flow predominates and water entry is primarily influenced by soil physical properties and c unlimited frozen soil gravity flow predominates and most of the meltwater infiltrates during the thawing period in seasonal frozen soil areas and the repeated freezing and thawing of soil during the day and at night the infiltration process of meltwater is very complex and a large amount of water persists on the surface for a long time in summary there are still huge challenges in determining the meltwater infiltration parameters in seasonally frozen soil regions for example meltwater infiltration rate and meltwater infiltration volume estimation these parameters are of great significance to the study of soil pollution and soil water and salt transport related studies point out that snowfall is easier to absorb pollutants such as heavy metals sulfides etc and meltwater infiltration is the direct cause of such pollutants entering the soil wang et al 2020 murray and buttle 2005 used a meltwater tray 0 425 0 275 m at the snowpack base at each pit sampled daily water inputs to the soil surface this method overestimates the waterinputs to the soil surface because the long term accumulation of water during the thawing period will cause evaporate and the meltwater tray cannot measure this loss zhao and gray 1997 used a parametric expression for estimating infiltration into a frozen silty clay loam a quasi steady state flow model was developed using the results of a physically based numerical simulation of the process this parameter expression is quite different from the natural infiltration conditions of meltwater and the comparative tests are not stringent and rigorous rawls and brakensiek 1985 most of studies focus on the structural properties of frozen soil or infiltration characteristics of different types of frozen soil that are mostly indoor experiments or outdoor single meltwater infiltration experiments which cannot accurately reflect the meltwater infiltration process under natural conditions and there are obvious errors in the estimation of infiltration amount of meltwater insufficient reports on estimating the amount of meltwater infiltration based on regional soil freeze thaw characteristics and clarified the quantitative relationship between snow depth and meltwater runoff this paper seeks to establish methods for determining meltwater infiltration parameters including meltwater infiltration volume under 15 and 30 cm snow thickness in the early stage of thawing period the range of the maximum value of farmland meltwater infiltration and the range of snow thickness in the early stage of thawing period corresponding to the maximum meltwater storage volume ϝ of farmland meltwater based on the determination of the above parameters we seek to explore the changes in the infiltration rate of meltwater under day thaw and night freezing conditions and at the same time tried to explore the quantitative relationship between snow depth in the early stage of thaw period and farmland meltwater runoff this study provides a reference for snowmelt flood early warnings the effective use of soil and snowmelt water resources and the provision of a better soil and water environment for the growth of both spring ploughing and sowing crops 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experiment was performed in the comprehensive laboratory base of the northeast agricultural university in harbin heilongjiang province china the experimental area is geographically located between 126 43 e and 45 44 n and the average altitude is 139 m it belongs to the temperate continental monsoon climate with four seasons including long winter and summer seasons and a short seasonal transition period the location of the experimental site is shown in fig 1 the area is mainly a plain area with a large temperature difference between day and night the annual average snowfall is 23 6 mm but the fluctuation range of the annual snowfall is very large the maximum snow depth is greater than 60 cm the annual average evaporation is 1326 mm and the water table is 6 8 m due to its high latitude and cold climate in winter the planting method is mostly spring planting followed by autumn harvest with one crop per year the soil begins to steadily freeze from the middle to late november and gradually stars melting in late april of the following year the maximum freezing depth is approximately 180 cm the complete melting of the snow in spring much earlier than the complete melting of the soil the soil in the study area is fertile which is a typical soil in the songnen plain the 0 30 cm soil layer consists of black loam fu et al 2018 with 14 27 35 89 and 49 84 of clay silt and sand contents respectively 2 2 soil properties at the beginning of the experiment the soil data at depths from 0 30 cm were determined as follows the soil dry bulk density was measured by the ring knife method the natural soil moisture content was evaluated by the drying method the soil particles were observed and the soil texture was identified with a winner801 laser particle size analyser jinan micro nano particles instrument co ltd china and the porosity was determined with a daiki 1130 soil three phase analyser zequan science and technology shanghai china the saturated water content is the gravimetric water content and three replicate samples are taken at 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm respectively the physical properties of the 0 30 cm soil are listed in table 1 2 3 experimental scheme the experimental period is from october 11 2019 to may 31 2020 three 2 2 m levelling test farmlands are set up in the farmland to reduce the interference of the surrounding meltwater on the test area an isolation ditch with a depth of 30 cm is excavated surrounding each test farmland first the isolation ditch is to effectively avoid water exchange between the experimental farmland and the external soil second the isolation ditch is far away from the sensor which effectively ensures that the surrounding area of the sensor is close to the infiltration of natural meltwater third the melting speed of snow is faster than that of frozen soil and the melting soil remains supersaturated for a long time in the natural state the horizontal seepage of melting water will occur in the farmland surface fault and low lying river channels the isolation ditch simulates the above phenomenon of farmland so the horizontal seepage of meltwater can be regarded as an important part of runoff loss as shown in fig 1 before soil freezing occurred october 11 2019 a soil temperature and humidity sensor et100 beijing oriental ecology beijing china was embedded at the geometric centre of the test farmland to automatically monitor the liquid soil moisture content the volumetric moisture content and soil temperature as shown in fig 1 this sensor can monitor the temperature and humidity of 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 cm soil and collect data every hour the sensor parameters are shown in table 2 2 4 research methods 2 4 1 calculation of total water content in soil layer the calculation method of the total water content m cm from 0 hi cm in the unfrozen soil is as follows 1 m 0 h i h ⅆ h where h is a function of the soil moisture content and soil depth 2 4 2 estimation of meltwater infiltration the soil moisture change was plotted from the moment of freezing to the completion of meltwater infiltration as shown in fig 2 in the case of the occurrence of a snow cover the total water content of the 0 to h1 cm soil layer is m 1 when the soil starts to freeze during the freezing process water migration occurs and the migration amount is m3 moreover the frozen soil inhibits water evaporation during freezing dai et al 2010 and water evaporation is therefore ignored in addition the total water content of the 0 to h1 cm soil layer is m 2 m 1 m3 in the meltwater infiltration stage the total amount of meltwater infiltration reaches m2 according to related research frozen soil contains many ice crystals it is hard and dense and it exhibits almost no permeability flerchinger et al 2005 iwata et al 2011 zuzel and pikul 1987 in situ sampling of the frozen soil during the soil freezing period revealed that the frozen soil layer contained a large number of ice crystals which filled the soil pores and the soil was indeed dense and hard as shown in fig 3 therefore the frozen soil layer in this study was regarded as a water barrier the total water content of the 0 to h1 cm soil layer at the end of meltwater infiltration is m3 m1 m3 m2 without a snow cover when the soil starts to freeze the total water content of the 0 to h1 cm soil layer is ma during the freezing process water migrates and the migration amount is mc while water evaporation is also ignored in addition the total water content of the 0 to h1 cm soil layer reaches mb ma mc in the meltwater infiltration stage since no snow cover occurs the soil melting depth is larger than that under a snow cover this study believes that frozen soil has water retention capacity so the water exchange between frozen soil and the atmosphere is ignored at the same time the water exchange between the atmosphere and the melted soil covered by snow and meltwater during the melting period is ignored this research hypothesizes the melted soil without snow cover reaches a water balance with the atmosphere which is m1 m2 based on the above assumptions there is no water loss in the soil without snow cover during the melting period the total water content of the 0 to h1 cm soil layer at the end of infiltration is mc ma mc before the thawing period the different snow thickness was not set so the water migration of each experimental field was the same during the thawing period the water migration of frozen soil will not penetrate the frozen soil layer and the calculated depth of the total liquid water content of the soil does not exceed the thawing depth therefore this study believes that the amount of water migration between the soil with snow covered melting layer and the soil without snow covered melting layer is close i e mc m3 therefore the meltwater infiltration volume m2 is calculated as 2 m 2 m 3 m 1 m 3 3 m c m c m a 4 m 2 m 3 m 1 m c m a 2 4 3 infiltration rate curve of meltwater according to previous studies daily periodic changes occur in the ambient temperature light irradiation level and meltwater flow during the thawing period in seasonal frozen soil areas when the daytime temperature is higher than 0 c snow melts the average duration of meltwater production per day is approximately 5 5 h li et al 2020 based on the abovementioned law we assume that meltwater infiltration rate curve in early middle and later stage of infiltration as shown in fig 4 in the figure t a t b and t c are duration when the meltwater infiltration rate starts to increase to its maximum and a is the early stage b and c are the middle and late infiltration stage over time the environmental temperature increases and the time required for the meltwater infiltration rate to increase from the initial value to its maximum decreases therefore t a t b t c and t a t b and t c are the remaining times of the day during this period the meltwater infiltration rate decreases from its maximum to 0 throughout the melting time the period with high ambient temperature in one day is relatively short li et al 2020 and t a t b and t c account for most of the day t 1 t 2 and t 3 are the times when the meltwater has obviously infiltrated the frozen soil in this study area contains a large amount of ice as shown in fig 3 the thawing front will quickly reach saturation with the replenishment of meltwater roy et al 2020 so the essence of meltwater infiltration is the process of thawing and saturation of the frozen soil thawing front the melting of snow and the thawing of frozen soil are notably correlated environmental conditions and meltwater transfers heat downward to raise the soil temperature to above 0 c thus leading to the continuous infiltration of meltwater mackay 1983 therefore in this study it is assumed that the obvious meltwater infiltration time is close to the meltwater generation time over time the obvious meltwater infiltration time increases and t 1 t 2 t 3 the physical properties of soil in a certain area are similar and in this study the maximum infiltration rate φmax does not greatly change with the thawing depth so it remains unchanged by default meltwater infiltration consists of the processes of thawing and saturation of the frozen soil thawing front we assume that this process lasts from the beginning to the end of meltwater infiltration and the soil above the thawing front is saturated the daily environmental changes during the thawing period are similar and the daily production duration of meltwater is close li et al 2020 based on the above assumption that the daily meltwater infiltration curve during the thawing period remains the same this curve reflects the average state of daily meltwater infiltration throughout the thawing period the variant boltzmann distribution function curve is selected as the curve function of the daily infiltration rate as follows the original boltzmann distribution function is as follows young et al 2011 5 f υ m 2 π kt 3 4 π υ 2 e m υ 2 2 kt taking into account the non negativity of m 2 π kt 3 and get all the analytical solutions do the following transformation 6 m k t 1 a 2 υ t e b the variant function is 7 t 1 2 π a 2 3 4 π t 2 b t 2 2 a 2 where t is the infiltration rate t is the infiltration time a and b are parameters the determination of a and b is based on two limiting conditions first the obvious meltwater infiltration time t i is approximately 5 5 h controlling the width of the curve second under the above assumption the daily infiltration volume is a fixed value of 0 24 t dt which is the average daily infiltration volume i m 2 d in this study where d is the number of days of meltwater infiltration controlling the height of the curve matlab was adopted to adjust the curve parameters 3 results and analysis 3 1 maximum and minimum temperature changes during the test period the maximum and minimum air temperatures from january 1 2020 to may 31 2020 are shown in fig 5 since january 1 the ambient temperature has been fluctuating and rising on february 20 the maximum environment temperature approached 0 c and remained around 0 c while after march 12 the maximum temperature exceeded 0 c on march 20 the lowest ambient temperature reached 0 c and this lasted until april 24 after which the ambient temperature was no longer below 0 c 3 2 soil moisture content and temperature change 3 2 1 c30 c15 c0 soil moisture content and temperature the changes in the c30 c15 c0 soil liquid water content and soil temperature from october 11 2019 to may 31 2020 are shown in fig 6 fig 7 fig 8 respectively in the c30 the surface soil moisture content was greatly reduced after november 24 2019 and the temperature was close to 0 c this time was denoted as the soil freezing time k30 on march 7 the soil moisture content at 10 cm began to rise and the soil moisture content at 20 30 40 and 50 cm subsequently increase reaching the maximum value and then stabilizing at a high moisture content the maximum soil water content during the thawing period is an important indication of soil thawing on march 18 the moisture content of the surface soil obviously increased and reached a maximum over approximately 5 days during the t1 period from approximately 3 22 4 8 the surface soil maintained a high moisture content over approximately 16 days on april 8 e30 the water content of the surface layer began to rapidly decrease as shown in fig 3 a this lasted approximately 21 days from the rapid increase in the moisture content to the notable decrease in the moisture content of the surface soil this time period was defined as the c30 infiltration time t1 during the thawing period on april 8 the soil moisture content at 50 cm did not reach the maximum value the soil temperature from 50 to 90 cm was lower than 2 c and the soil moisture content at 50 cm was close to the maximum value the moisture content did not reaching the maximum value indicating that the melting process had not been completed moreover the soil melting depth was approximately 50 cm as shown in fig 3 a c d after april 11 the soil temperature of each layer was higher than 2 c and the moisture content reached the maximum value indicating that the soil was completely thawed when the surface soil moisture content rapidly increase the soil temperature from 0 to 40 cm started to increase from 0 c while the soil temperature from 50 to 70 cm was the lowest indicating that the freezing front occurred between 50 and 70 cm during the whole freeze thaw period the soil moisture content from 60 to 90 cm changes little throughout the soil freeze period the moisture content decreased slightly and the decline range amounted to approximately 5 10 the soil moisture content after the soil had thawed was almost the same as that before the soil was frozen as shown in fig 6 b d in the c15 the time k15 when the soil begins to freeze is the same as that for c30 during soil freezing the change in the soil moisture content from 10 to 50 cm is basically the same as that for c30 but a difference occurs in the change in soil moisture content to that for c30 during the thawing period on march 8 the shallow soil moisture content begins to rise and the shallow soil moisture content rapidly increases on march 17 reaching its highest value on march 24 during the t2 period from approximately 3 24 3 31 the surface soil maintains a high moisture content over approximately 7 days after which the moisture content rapidly decreases indicating the end of meltwater infiltration this lasts approximately 14 days from the rapid increase in moisture content to the notable decrease in moisture content of the surface soil this period of time is defined as the c15 infiltration time t2 during the thawing period at e15 the soil temperature from 40 to 60 cm is lower than 1 c and the soil moisture content at 40 cm and 50 cm has increased but has not reached the maximum value indicating that the soil has not yet completely melted the soil temperature from 10 cm to 30 cm is higher than 2 c and the soil moisture content has reached its maximum value moreover the soil is thawing obviously the soil thawing depth occurs at approximately 40 cm as shown in fig 7 a c d on april 12 the soil temperature of each layer is higher than 2 c and the soil moisture content of each layer has reached the maximum indicating that the soil has thawed the soil moisture content of the 60 90 cm soil layer does not change much during the entire freezing and thawing process and the soil moisture content of the 80 90 cm soil layer remains basically unchanged the soil moisture content drops uniformly over the soil freezing period but the decline is small and the maximum reduction is less than 5 similar to c30 when the moisture content of the surface soil rapidly increases the soil temperature from 0 to 40 cm increases from 0 c and the soil temperature from 50 to 70 cm is the lowest indicating that the freezing front occurs between 50 and 70 cm in the c0 the time when the soil starts to freeze is the same as that for c30 and c15 the change in water content during the freezing process of the 10 50 cm soil layer is similar to that for c15 and c30 during the thawing period the moisture content of the surface soil begins to increase on march 16 and rapidly rises starting on march 20 indicating that the surface soil is rapidly thawing the maximum value of surface soil moisture content is occurred on approximately march 25 which is close to the moment when the soil begins to freeze and remains unchanged thereafter on march 31 the moisture content of each layer has reached the maximum value and remains at this maximum indicating that the soil has thawed during the thawing period the soil moisture content from 60 to 90 cm changes very little which is similar to c30 and c15 after the soil has thawed the moisture content of each layer is almost equal to that before freezing 3 2 2 the difference in meltwater infiltration parameters of c30 c15 c0 the soil temperature changes of c30 c15 and c0 are similar and the difference in soil moisture content changes is mainly reflected in the thawing period the change of surface water content is the key to judging the infiltration of meltwater among them the start time ki of meltwater infiltration the end time ei of meltwater infiltration duration ti of surface soil saturation the duration ti of meltwater infiltration and depth di of soil thawing at the end time of meltwater infiltration are important meltwater infiltration characteristic parameters draw the above parameters into table 3 in summary the water content and temperature changes at k0 k15 and k30 when the soil starts to freeze are similar during the thawing period the time when the soil surface moisture content begins to greatly increase occurs earlier than that for c30 and the surface moisture content reaches its maximum value almost simultaneously this may occur because snow exhibits a certain water storage capacity and the thicker the snow cover is the later runoff will be formed the difference in snow cover thickness will lead to varying times for the surface soil to reach a higher moisture content which also indicates that different snow cover thicknesses affect the meltwater infiltration time in addition snow cover delays soil thawing and the delay time is less affected by the snow cover thickness based on the experimental results the dynamic diagram of the thawing process of the frozen soil during the thawing period is shown in fig 9 throughout the whole thawing period the soil moisture content under c30 and c15 gradually increased from the surface layer reached the maximum value sequence and maintained a high moisture content indicating that the thawed soil of each layer was saturated during thawing under the action of meltwater infiltration and the soil above the thawing front was saturated when the surface water content changed from saturated to unsaturated the infiltration process of meltwater was complete the temperature decreased at night and the soil and meltwater refroze during the entire infiltration process the freezing layer was obviously saturated and obvious water accumulation occurred as shown in fig 9 therefore the essence of meltwater infiltration is the process of thawing and saturation of the frozen soil thawing front this process starts from infiltration initiation until the surface soil has been becomes unsaturated in the case of the same soil physical properties and similar daily environmental conditions the daily meltwater infiltration curve can be assumed to remain constant and the daily infiltration volume is a fixed value 3 3 calculation of the meltwater infiltration volume 3 3 1 c30 meltwater infiltration calculation it can be seen from table 3 that the end of the c30 meltwater infiltration period occurs at e30 on april 9 and the depth d30 of soil thawing is approximately 50 cm the function θ 2 30 z of the 0 50 cm soil moisture content with the depth at e30 is established via fitting and the function θ 1 30 z of the 0 50 cm soil moisture content with the depth is established at k30 as shown in fig 10 a significance testing of the fitted functions reveals that the results are extremely significant in the same way establish equations θ 1 0 z and θ 2 0 z at the same time as k30 and e30 for c0 as shown in fig 10 b eq 1 is applied to calculate the total water content of the 0 50 cm soil layer for c30 at two moments e30 and k30 namely m 3 and m 1 respectively the difference between the two values is 2 14 cm this difference includes the water loss caused by water migration during soil freezing and thawing the difference between m c and m a in the c0 0 50 cm soil total water content at e30 and k30 is 0 93 cm therefore the c30 meltwater infiltration volume is 3 07 cm 2 14 0 93 based on eq 4 the average daily infiltration volume a30 is 0 15 cm in the same way calculate the meltwater infiltration volume of c15 and the calculation process is shown in fig 11 the calculation results based on formulas 2 3 and 4 are shown in table 4 3 3 2 periodic changes in the shallow soil moisture on march 14 the soil moisture content rapidly increased as shown in figs 6 7 and 8 to reveal the most direct effect of meltwater on the soil moisture content the change in surface soil moisture content during the rapid increase period from march 19 to march 25 for c0 c15 and c30 is plotted as shown in fig 12 the c30 and c15 surface soil moisture content changes exhibit an obvious periodic phenomenon whereby they first increase and then decrease while the surface soil moisture content without a snow cover does not reveal this phenomenon instead demonstrating a uniform increase indicating that meltwater dominates the soil moisture content change compared to the moisture content of the surface soil without a snow cover the periodicity of the moisture content of the surface soil under the 30 cm and 15 cm snow covers is caused by the daily change in the temperature and irradiation therefore the periodic changes in the surface water content reflect the periodicity of snowmelt the increase in surface soil moisture content from the beginning to the inflection point over a cycle reflects the infiltration and refreezing of meltwater this cycle lasts approximately about 10 h as shown in fig 12 similar phenomena have also been reported in previous studies li et al 2020 3 3 3 determination of the infiltration curve parameters based on the limiting conditions in 2 4 2 the trend of the melt water infiltration curve was assumed and the curve resembled the boltzmann function the curve function is determined by two limiting conditions limiting condition 1 the curve satisfies the integral value of the 0 15 cm average daily infiltration volume which determines the height of the curve condition 2 the daily main infiltration duration should approach the average daily duration of meltwater production of 5 5 h this condition determines the width of the curve based on the above two limiting conditions the infiltration curve can be determined the parameter result are a 2 6617 and b 34 5427 and the daily infiltration curve was obtained as shown in fig 13 this curve satisfies the above two limiting conditions and the infiltration trend meets the assumptions through this curve it is concluded that the maximum daily meltwater infiltration rate is 0 06227 cm hour and it takes about two hours for the infiltration rate to increase from the beginning to the maximum 4 discussion 4 1 the rationality of eqs 1 4 and limitation lundberg et al 2016 pointed out that for agricultural farmlands where the soil has been packed by heavy machinery focused infiltration after soil thawing seems to be rule rather than the exception during snowmelt this indicates that the infiltration of meltwater mainly occurs in the melted soil layer the freezing and thawing of soil lead to a peak in the soil moisture content along the soil freezing front dinulescu and eckert 1980 the soil freezing front gradually moves from the surface towards deep layers with soil freezing front konrad and morgenstern 1981 causing the shallow soil moisture content ice and water to first increase after which the moisture condenses in the soil pores ireson et al 2012 lundberg et al 2015 soil freezing is also an important means of water storage but frozen water creates closed pores resulting in the frozen soil inhibiting water evaporation dai et al 2010 in the early stage of melting due to the low temperature combined with the snow cover and meltwater infiltration the soil moisture loss is minimal without a snow cover the thawing front continues to move downwards the ice crystals in the shallow soil melt into liquid water which is transferred to the surroundings so that the soil gradually returns to the pre freezing water state and an equilibrium is reached through atmospheric water exchange fig 5a b during the thawing period the melting of snow occurs much earlier than the thawing of frozen soil fu et al 2015 the frozen front gradually moves from the surface towards 40 70 cm depth due to the bidirectional thawing phenomenon of frozen soil the liquid water above and below the frozen front moves towards the frozen front and moisture accumulation occurs brouchkov 2000 however since the frozen soil exhibits a certain water resistance ireson et al 2012 lundberg et al 2015 h engelmark 1988 the upper water layer rarely penetrates the freezing front therefore the reasonable conditions for the method for estimating the amount of meltwater infiltration in this study are first frozen soil has a certain degree of water resistance second frozen soil has a protective effect on internal moisture third meltwater infiltration ends earlier than the soil is completely melted and meltwater infiltration mainly occurs in the melted soil layer fourth the water migration in the process of soil freezing and thawing mainly occurs between the unfrozen soil layer and the thawing frozen front 4 2 infiltration rate curve in previous studies sun 2019 applied the double loop infiltration method to conduct infiltration experiments to verify the applicability of the kostiakov and horton infiltration models philip equation and general empirical infiltration model in our study area and concluded that the general empirical model attained a good simulation effect in regard to the middle and late snowmelt stages it can be concluded that the stable soil infiltration rate during the thawing period was 0 06 cm min roy et al 2020 performed infiltration experiments on frozen soils with different initial moisture contents over 60 min and determined the average infiltration rate of the frozen soils with the three different initial moisture contents at 0 66 0 38 and 0 59 cm min in the above experiments the infiltration water and infiltration environment are very different from the infiltration of natural farmland meltwater water with higher heat may destroy the structure of frozen soil unlike the experimental soil mentioned above farmland soil is compacted mechanically to a certain extent the above experimental results may be far greater than the actual situation in this study the average daily maximum infiltration rate is 0 06227 cm hour which is much smaller than other experiments it reflects the restriction of farmland frozen soil on the infiltration of melt water in the natural state which is closer to the reality the daily infiltration rate curve is determined by two factors first the total amount of daily meltwater infiltration second the period of meltwater infiltration is close to the period of meltwater generation the first limiting factor is mathematically established the total daily meltwater infiltration is the integral of the infiltration rate over time the second limiting factor is established for the following reasons lundberg et al 2016 pointed out that the meltwater in the farmland focused infiltration after the soil melts in nature the melting water generation period is the soil thawing period which is determined by meteorological factors mainly air temperature and radiation intensity 4 3 the relationship between the snow cover thickness and infiltration time the thickness and density of the snow cover affect the final melting time little fu et al 2015 wan 2016 therefore the final melting durations for c15 and c30 are similar but based on figs 6 8 the length of time during which the surface soil maintains a high moisture content is not the same t1 is much longer than t2 and the snow completely melts during these two periods the thickness of the snow cover affects the time for the soil to dewater and become waterlogged during the thawing period due to the frozen layer of the soil in the farmland the meltwater infiltration capacity is low based on the law of mass conservation there must be a maximum meltwater storage volume ϝ of farmland meltwater when the total amount of meltwater is greater than ϝ the greater part will cause runoff loss when the total amount of meltwater is less than ϝ the meltwater is all hoarded in the farmland to infiltrate and evaporate it shows that when the snow depth in the early stage of thawing period reaches a certain value z the accumulation of meltwater in the farmland reaches ϝ when the snow depth in the early stage of thawing period exceeds z the total amount of meltwater exceeds ϝ and the excess part is lost in the form of runoff therefore it is inferred that in the same farmland when the snow depth in the early stage of thawing period exceeds a certain value z and the total amount of meltwater exceeds ϝ the amount of meltwater infiltration no longer changes when the snow depth is less than z and the total amount of meltwater is less than ϝ of the farmland the total amount of meltwater is hoarded in the farmland to infiltrate and evaporate and the infiltration duration of different snow depth must be different according to experimental observations under 30 cm and 15 cm snow cover no significant runoff loss was found indicating that neither of them reached the maximum meltwater storage ϝ in the farmland at the same time the calculation results of the meltwater infiltration amount found that the average daily infiltration amount of different snow cover thicknesses was close indicating that the snow cover thickness had less affect the meltwater infiltration rate and different snow cover thicknesses produced different meltwater accumulations which directly affected the meltwater infiltration duration therefore when the snow depth is less than z and the total meltwater is less than ϝ it is assumed that there is a functional relationship between the snow depth and the infiltration duration the function trend line of the thickness of snow cover and the meltwater infiltration duration is shown in fig 14 this trend line is determined by the following 5 conditions 1 the snow depth of 15 and 30 cm are all less than z 2 there is the maximum meltwater storage ϝ in the farmland when the snow depth exceeds z the meltwater infiltration duration will not increase after reaching d 3 during the thawing period as time progresses the higher the ambient temperature the stronger the radiation and the faster the evaporation of water therefore the time of meltwater infiltration and the thickness of snow are not linear with the increase of snow depth the increase rate of meltwater infiltration time decreases the slope of the function curve should decrease continuously and when it reaches a certain snow depth the infiltration time will no longer change 4 the trend line passes through three known points 0 0 15 14 30 21 5 the maximum snow thickness observed in this study area is more than 60 cm this study believes that the snow thickness corresponding to the maximum meltwater storage ϝ in the farmland is less than 60 cm it can be concluded that when the farmland reaches the maximum meltwater storage the corresponding snow thickness is between 30 and 60 cm the maximum duration of meltwater infiltration is between 21 and 35 days the ratio of the 15 cm snow cover to the infiltration amount is 67 61 and the ratio of 30 cm snow cover to infiltration amount is 49 8 the thicker the snow the more meltwater the longer the infiltration time of meltwater and the closer to the late thawing stage the stronger the air temperature and light the more water evaporation and the lower the infiltration proportion the experimental results also support this this indicates that the larger the snow cover thickness is the lower infiltration proportion is 5 conclusion the results of this study are as follows 1 when the farmland reaches the maximum meltwater storage the corresponding snow thickness z is between 30 and 60 cm the maximum duration d of meltwater infiltration is between 21 and 35 days 2 the average daily meltwater infiltration is approximately 0 15 cm and the maximum infiltration volume is between 3 15 and 5 25 cm 3 the average daily maximum infiltration rate of the thawing period frozen soil is approximately 0 06 cm hour 4 in the farmland during the thawing period in the seasonal frozen soil areas the larger the snow cover thickness the smaller the meltwater infiltration proportion is meltwater infiltration in seasonal frozen soil areas is a complex hydrological phenomenon that is accompanied by repeated freezing and thawing cycles it is difficult to obtain a meltwater infiltration curve using traditional infiltration models a meltwater infiltration curve is proposed based on actual measurements and theoretical analysis and the proposed curve is defined according to the experimental results while an infiltration volume curve closely reflecting the real situation is obtained for the first time in this study the precise observation of the change process of frozen soil and meltwater during the thawing period requires continuous improvement which is also an important direction for future research

9850,in seasonal frozen soil areas much meltwater is formed during the thawing period which easily causes snowmelt floods and waterlogging disasters the meltwater simultaneously replenishes groundwater and produces surface runoff to provide water for crop roots however there are insufficient researches on the infiltration process of meltwater under day thaw and night freezing conditions meltwater infiltration process and estimation could provide an important reference for spring irrigation meltwater disaster early warning systems and soil pollution research in this study the law of mass conservation was adopted for meltwater infiltration estimation under 15 and 30 cm snow covers according to the hypothetical curve trend characteristics of meltwater infiltration rate it is proposed to adopt boltzmann distribution function and determine the curve parameters through experimental results and the average daily maximum infiltration rate of frozen soil is 0 0622 cm hour during the thawing period the soil moisture content changes periodically and the period lasts approximately 10 h we also put forward the concept of the maximum meltwater storage volume ϝ of farmland meltwater which provides a new analysis structure for meltwater runoff research during the thawing periods when the snow cover thickness in the early stage of thawing period exceeds z the amount of meltwater infiltration does not greatly change and the maximum infiltration volume is between 3 15 and 5 25 cm the average daily meltwater infiltration amounts to 0 15 cm graphical abstract ga1 keywords meltwater infiltration thawing period infiltration rate curve maximum meltwater storage volumex 1 introduction there exists a large amount of snow in seasonal frozen soil areas which has an important value in the study of global climate change yasunari et al 1991 during the thawing period the amount of meltwater caused by snow melting is an important water resource for agriculture in cold regions some of the meltwater infiltrates groundwater to increase the soil moisture storage and the rest produces surface runoff which is an important reason for spring snowmelt floods and land waterlogging in addition melted water also increases the annual runoff harder et al 2019 flerchinger et al 2005 jeelani et al 2012 in certain areas the infiltration of meltwater occurs slowly and surface runoff is generated after the shallow thawing soil becomes saturated thus forming snowmelt floods which last for a long time even until the frozen soil has completely thawed yang et al 2019 in seasonal frozen soil areas infiltration is an important part of the meltwater destination which provides the water needed by crops bedient and huber 1988 therefore the study of meltwater infiltration in seasonal frozen soil areas provides an important reference to guide spring irrigation waterlogging disasters forecasting and snowmelt flood warnings and the amount of meltwater infiltration is an important reference parameter the infiltration of meltwater into frozen soil is a complicated process because it involves coupled heat and mass flow with phase changes and the comprehensive influence of complex conditions flerchinger et al 2005 gray et al 2001 zheng et al 2001 in seasonal frozen soil areas snow melting is completed approximately two months earlier than frozen soil thawing fu et al 2015 it has been found that frozen soil is accompanied by the whole process of meltwater infiltration the infiltration capacities of various frozen soils are different iwata et al 2018 proposed that frozen soil hinders meltwater infiltration produces a large amount of runoff and affects the soil water balance and soil anion movement he et al 2015 reported that the infiltration of meltwater in spring is mainly affected by two aspects one aspect is the porosity of the first 10 cm of soil during the frozen soil period and the second is the soil moisture content of the first 30 cm of soil in the early stage of soil freezing there are pores of different diameters in frozen soil the freezing of water in large pores increases the tortuosity of the water seepage path which seriously hinders the flow of liquid water in pores moreover the water in large pores freezes earlier than that in small pores but thaws later than that in small pores resulting in a notable decrease in the frozen soil permeability ireson et al 2012 lundberg et al 2015 helén 1988 according to demand et al 2019 the relationship between a high porosity and frozen depth plays an important role in controlling the permeability of seasonal frozen soil demand et al 2019 in winter farmland soil contains a large number of ice crystals which are very hard and exhibit a very low infiltration capacity and are considered to be almost impermeable flerchinger et al 2005 zuzel and pikul 1987 stoeckeler and weitzman 1960 also found that grassland permafrost also reveals a very low infiltration capacity however studies have demonstrated that even if soil is frozen if the soil is not fully saturated it still exhibits a certain infiltration capacity flerchinger et al 2005 he et al 2015 there are many pores in forest soil and its permeability is higher than that of frozen grassland soil stoeckeler and weitzman 1960 during the thawing period frozen soil is constantly subject to thawing and meltwater carries heat downward to raise the soil temperature above 0 c a soil matric potential difference occurs between the unfrozen layer along the thawing front and the frozen layer below the thawing front which leads to the continuous infiltration of meltwater mackay et al 1983 lee and molnau 1982 studied the infiltration characteristics of frozen soil by using a rainfall simulator and observed that the stable infiltration rate of frozen soil is negatively correlated with the soil water content to a large extent lee and molnau 1982 but the influence of the rainfall temperature and impact of frozen soil on infiltration was ignored kane and stein 1983 also concluded that there exists a negative correlation between the infiltration rate and soil water content through a study on the infiltration and water redistribution characteristics of frozen silty loam patterson and smith 1985 a high moisture content leads to a decrease in soil porosity and an increase in the tortuosity of the water infiltration path after freezing which is an important reason for the negative correlation between the infiltration rate and soil moisture content however it is difficult to simulate the infiltration of meltwater under real farmland conditions the water during the thawing period mainly originates from the melting of snow it is challenging to observe and simulate the covering effect of unfused snow and the temperature of meltwater research on the infiltration of meltwater in frozen soil needs to be further conducted zuzel and pikul 1987 considered that the infiltration characteristics of soil are related to the soil type and the freezing process does not alter the infiltration characteristics of soil under different tillage measures soil with a high clay content exhibits poor drainage and unique shrinkage and expansion characteristics nikiforoff et al 1933 1939 which may be an important reason for spring snowmelt floods sun 2019 verified the applicability of the kostiakov horton infiltration models and philip equation and general empirical infiltration model in their study area and determined the main factors influencing infiltration established a meltwater infiltration law in a seasonal frozen soil area by using the multiple linear regression method and found that the general empirical model attained a good simulation effect in the middle and late stages of snow melting sun 2019 in the above study the mechanism of meltwater infiltration was analysed regardless of the soil type or the soil moisture content before freezing the different soil pore conditions essentially affected meltwater infiltration according to surface infiltration conditions gray et al 2001 divided the frozen soil into three categories a restricted frozen soil water entry is impeded by surface conditions b limited frozen soil capillary flow predominates and water entry is primarily influenced by soil physical properties and c unlimited frozen soil gravity flow predominates and most of the meltwater infiltrates during the thawing period in seasonal frozen soil areas and the repeated freezing and thawing of soil during the day and at night the infiltration process of meltwater is very complex and a large amount of water persists on the surface for a long time in summary there are still huge challenges in determining the meltwater infiltration parameters in seasonally frozen soil regions for example meltwater infiltration rate and meltwater infiltration volume estimation these parameters are of great significance to the study of soil pollution and soil water and salt transport related studies point out that snowfall is easier to absorb pollutants such as heavy metals sulfides etc and meltwater infiltration is the direct cause of such pollutants entering the soil wang et al 2020 murray and buttle 2005 used a meltwater tray 0 425 0 275 m at the snowpack base at each pit sampled daily water inputs to the soil surface this method overestimates the waterinputs to the soil surface because the long term accumulation of water during the thawing period will cause evaporate and the meltwater tray cannot measure this loss zhao and gray 1997 used a parametric expression for estimating infiltration into a frozen silty clay loam a quasi steady state flow model was developed using the results of a physically based numerical simulation of the process this parameter expression is quite different from the natural infiltration conditions of meltwater and the comparative tests are not stringent and rigorous rawls and brakensiek 1985 most of studies focus on the structural properties of frozen soil or infiltration characteristics of different types of frozen soil that are mostly indoor experiments or outdoor single meltwater infiltration experiments which cannot accurately reflect the meltwater infiltration process under natural conditions and there are obvious errors in the estimation of infiltration amount of meltwater insufficient reports on estimating the amount of meltwater infiltration based on regional soil freeze thaw characteristics and clarified the quantitative relationship between snow depth and meltwater runoff this paper seeks to establish methods for determining meltwater infiltration parameters including meltwater infiltration volume under 15 and 30 cm snow thickness in the early stage of thawing period the range of the maximum value of farmland meltwater infiltration and the range of snow thickness in the early stage of thawing period corresponding to the maximum meltwater storage volume ϝ of farmland meltwater based on the determination of the above parameters we seek to explore the changes in the infiltration rate of meltwater under day thaw and night freezing conditions and at the same time tried to explore the quantitative relationship between snow depth in the early stage of thaw period and farmland meltwater runoff this study provides a reference for snowmelt flood early warnings the effective use of soil and snowmelt water resources and the provision of a better soil and water environment for the growth of both spring ploughing and sowing crops 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experiment was performed in the comprehensive laboratory base of the northeast agricultural university in harbin heilongjiang province china the experimental area is geographically located between 126 43 e and 45 44 n and the average altitude is 139 m it belongs to the temperate continental monsoon climate with four seasons including long winter and summer seasons and a short seasonal transition period the location of the experimental site is shown in fig 1 the area is mainly a plain area with a large temperature difference between day and night the annual average snowfall is 23 6 mm but the fluctuation range of the annual snowfall is very large the maximum snow depth is greater than 60 cm the annual average evaporation is 1326 mm and the water table is 6 8 m due to its high latitude and cold climate in winter the planting method is mostly spring planting followed by autumn harvest with one crop per year the soil begins to steadily freeze from the middle to late november and gradually stars melting in late april of the following year the maximum freezing depth is approximately 180 cm the complete melting of the snow in spring much earlier than the complete melting of the soil the soil in the study area is fertile which is a typical soil in the songnen plain the 0 30 cm soil layer consists of black loam fu et al 2018 with 14 27 35 89 and 49 84 of clay silt and sand contents respectively 2 2 soil properties at the beginning of the experiment the soil data at depths from 0 30 cm were determined as follows the soil dry bulk density was measured by the ring knife method the natural soil moisture content was evaluated by the drying method the soil particles were observed and the soil texture was identified with a winner801 laser particle size analyser jinan micro nano particles instrument co ltd china and the porosity was determined with a daiki 1130 soil three phase analyser zequan science and technology shanghai china the saturated water content is the gravimetric water content and three replicate samples are taken at 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm respectively the physical properties of the 0 30 cm soil are listed in table 1 2 3 experimental scheme the experimental period is from october 11 2019 to may 31 2020 three 2 2 m levelling test farmlands are set up in the farmland to reduce the interference of the surrounding meltwater on the test area an isolation ditch with a depth of 30 cm is excavated surrounding each test farmland first the isolation ditch is to effectively avoid water exchange between the experimental farmland and the external soil second the isolation ditch is far away from the sensor which effectively ensures that the surrounding area of the sensor is close to the infiltration of natural meltwater third the melting speed of snow is faster than that of frozen soil and the melting soil remains supersaturated for a long time in the natural state the horizontal seepage of melting water will occur in the farmland surface fault and low lying river channels the isolation ditch simulates the above phenomenon of farmland so the horizontal seepage of meltwater can be regarded as an important part of runoff loss as shown in fig 1 before soil freezing occurred october 11 2019 a soil temperature and humidity sensor et100 beijing oriental ecology beijing china was embedded at the geometric centre of the test farmland to automatically monitor the liquid soil moisture content the volumetric moisture content and soil temperature as shown in fig 1 this sensor can monitor the temperature and humidity of 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 cm soil and collect data every hour the sensor parameters are shown in table 2 2 4 research methods 2 4 1 calculation of total water content in soil layer the calculation method of the total water content m cm from 0 hi cm in the unfrozen soil is as follows 1 m 0 h i h ⅆ h where h is a function of the soil moisture content and soil depth 2 4 2 estimation of meltwater infiltration the soil moisture change was plotted from the moment of freezing to the completion of meltwater infiltration as shown in fig 2 in the case of the occurrence of a snow cover the total water content of the 0 to h1 cm soil layer is m 1 when the soil starts to freeze during the freezing process water migration occurs and the migration amount is m3 moreover the frozen soil inhibits water evaporation during freezing dai et al 2010 and water evaporation is therefore ignored in addition the total water content of the 0 to h1 cm soil layer is m 2 m 1 m3 in the meltwater infiltration stage the total amount of meltwater infiltration reaches m2 according to related research frozen soil contains many ice crystals it is hard and dense and it exhibits almost no permeability flerchinger et al 2005 iwata et al 2011 zuzel and pikul 1987 in situ sampling of the frozen soil during the soil freezing period revealed that the frozen soil layer contained a large number of ice crystals which filled the soil pores and the soil was indeed dense and hard as shown in fig 3 therefore the frozen soil layer in this study was regarded as a water barrier the total water content of the 0 to h1 cm soil layer at the end of meltwater infiltration is m3 m1 m3 m2 without a snow cover when the soil starts to freeze the total water content of the 0 to h1 cm soil layer is ma during the freezing process water migrates and the migration amount is mc while water evaporation is also ignored in addition the total water content of the 0 to h1 cm soil layer reaches mb ma mc in the meltwater infiltration stage since no snow cover occurs the soil melting depth is larger than that under a snow cover this study believes that frozen soil has water retention capacity so the water exchange between frozen soil and the atmosphere is ignored at the same time the water exchange between the atmosphere and the melted soil covered by snow and meltwater during the melting period is ignored this research hypothesizes the melted soil without snow cover reaches a water balance with the atmosphere which is m1 m2 based on the above assumptions there is no water loss in the soil without snow cover during the melting period the total water content of the 0 to h1 cm soil layer at the end of infiltration is mc ma mc before the thawing period the different snow thickness was not set so the water migration of each experimental field was the same during the thawing period the water migration of frozen soil will not penetrate the frozen soil layer and the calculated depth of the total liquid water content of the soil does not exceed the thawing depth therefore this study believes that the amount of water migration between the soil with snow covered melting layer and the soil without snow covered melting layer is close i e mc m3 therefore the meltwater infiltration volume m2 is calculated as 2 m 2 m 3 m 1 m 3 3 m c m c m a 4 m 2 m 3 m 1 m c m a 2 4 3 infiltration rate curve of meltwater according to previous studies daily periodic changes occur in the ambient temperature light irradiation level and meltwater flow during the thawing period in seasonal frozen soil areas when the daytime temperature is higher than 0 c snow melts the average duration of meltwater production per day is approximately 5 5 h li et al 2020 based on the abovementioned law we assume that meltwater infiltration rate curve in early middle and later stage of infiltration as shown in fig 4 in the figure t a t b and t c are duration when the meltwater infiltration rate starts to increase to its maximum and a is the early stage b and c are the middle and late infiltration stage over time the environmental temperature increases and the time required for the meltwater infiltration rate to increase from the initial value to its maximum decreases therefore t a t b t c and t a t b and t c are the remaining times of the day during this period the meltwater infiltration rate decreases from its maximum to 0 throughout the melting time the period with high ambient temperature in one day is relatively short li et al 2020 and t a t b and t c account for most of the day t 1 t 2 and t 3 are the times when the meltwater has obviously infiltrated the frozen soil in this study area contains a large amount of ice as shown in fig 3 the thawing front will quickly reach saturation with the replenishment of meltwater roy et al 2020 so the essence of meltwater infiltration is the process of thawing and saturation of the frozen soil thawing front the melting of snow and the thawing of frozen soil are notably correlated environmental conditions and meltwater transfers heat downward to raise the soil temperature to above 0 c thus leading to the continuous infiltration of meltwater mackay 1983 therefore in this study it is assumed that the obvious meltwater infiltration time is close to the meltwater generation time over time the obvious meltwater infiltration time increases and t 1 t 2 t 3 the physical properties of soil in a certain area are similar and in this study the maximum infiltration rate φmax does not greatly change with the thawing depth so it remains unchanged by default meltwater infiltration consists of the processes of thawing and saturation of the frozen soil thawing front we assume that this process lasts from the beginning to the end of meltwater infiltration and the soil above the thawing front is saturated the daily environmental changes during the thawing period are similar and the daily production duration of meltwater is close li et al 2020 based on the above assumption that the daily meltwater infiltration curve during the thawing period remains the same this curve reflects the average state of daily meltwater infiltration throughout the thawing period the variant boltzmann distribution function curve is selected as the curve function of the daily infiltration rate as follows the original boltzmann distribution function is as follows young et al 2011 5 f υ m 2 π kt 3 4 π υ 2 e m υ 2 2 kt taking into account the non negativity of m 2 π kt 3 and get all the analytical solutions do the following transformation 6 m k t 1 a 2 υ t e b the variant function is 7 t 1 2 π a 2 3 4 π t 2 b t 2 2 a 2 where t is the infiltration rate t is the infiltration time a and b are parameters the determination of a and b is based on two limiting conditions first the obvious meltwater infiltration time t i is approximately 5 5 h controlling the width of the curve second under the above assumption the daily infiltration volume is a fixed value of 0 24 t dt which is the average daily infiltration volume i m 2 d in this study where d is the number of days of meltwater infiltration controlling the height of the curve matlab was adopted to adjust the curve parameters 3 results and analysis 3 1 maximum and minimum temperature changes during the test period the maximum and minimum air temperatures from january 1 2020 to may 31 2020 are shown in fig 5 since january 1 the ambient temperature has been fluctuating and rising on february 20 the maximum environment temperature approached 0 c and remained around 0 c while after march 12 the maximum temperature exceeded 0 c on march 20 the lowest ambient temperature reached 0 c and this lasted until april 24 after which the ambient temperature was no longer below 0 c 3 2 soil moisture content and temperature change 3 2 1 c30 c15 c0 soil moisture content and temperature the changes in the c30 c15 c0 soil liquid water content and soil temperature from october 11 2019 to may 31 2020 are shown in fig 6 fig 7 fig 8 respectively in the c30 the surface soil moisture content was greatly reduced after november 24 2019 and the temperature was close to 0 c this time was denoted as the soil freezing time k30 on march 7 the soil moisture content at 10 cm began to rise and the soil moisture content at 20 30 40 and 50 cm subsequently increase reaching the maximum value and then stabilizing at a high moisture content the maximum soil water content during the thawing period is an important indication of soil thawing on march 18 the moisture content of the surface soil obviously increased and reached a maximum over approximately 5 days during the t1 period from approximately 3 22 4 8 the surface soil maintained a high moisture content over approximately 16 days on april 8 e30 the water content of the surface layer began to rapidly decrease as shown in fig 3 a this lasted approximately 21 days from the rapid increase in the moisture content to the notable decrease in the moisture content of the surface soil this time period was defined as the c30 infiltration time t1 during the thawing period on april 8 the soil moisture content at 50 cm did not reach the maximum value the soil temperature from 50 to 90 cm was lower than 2 c and the soil moisture content at 50 cm was close to the maximum value the moisture content did not reaching the maximum value indicating that the melting process had not been completed moreover the soil melting depth was approximately 50 cm as shown in fig 3 a c d after april 11 the soil temperature of each layer was higher than 2 c and the moisture content reached the maximum value indicating that the soil was completely thawed when the surface soil moisture content rapidly increase the soil temperature from 0 to 40 cm started to increase from 0 c while the soil temperature from 50 to 70 cm was the lowest indicating that the freezing front occurred between 50 and 70 cm during the whole freeze thaw period the soil moisture content from 60 to 90 cm changes little throughout the soil freeze period the moisture content decreased slightly and the decline range amounted to approximately 5 10 the soil moisture content after the soil had thawed was almost the same as that before the soil was frozen as shown in fig 6 b d in the c15 the time k15 when the soil begins to freeze is the same as that for c30 during soil freezing the change in the soil moisture content from 10 to 50 cm is basically the same as that for c30 but a difference occurs in the change in soil moisture content to that for c30 during the thawing period on march 8 the shallow soil moisture content begins to rise and the shallow soil moisture content rapidly increases on march 17 reaching its highest value on march 24 during the t2 period from approximately 3 24 3 31 the surface soil maintains a high moisture content over approximately 7 days after which the moisture content rapidly decreases indicating the end of meltwater infiltration this lasts approximately 14 days from the rapid increase in moisture content to the notable decrease in moisture content of the surface soil this period of time is defined as the c15 infiltration time t2 during the thawing period at e15 the soil temperature from 40 to 60 cm is lower than 1 c and the soil moisture content at 40 cm and 50 cm has increased but has not reached the maximum value indicating that the soil has not yet completely melted the soil temperature from 10 cm to 30 cm is higher than 2 c and the soil moisture content has reached its maximum value moreover the soil is thawing obviously the soil thawing depth occurs at approximately 40 cm as shown in fig 7 a c d on april 12 the soil temperature of each layer is higher than 2 c and the soil moisture content of each layer has reached the maximum indicating that the soil has thawed the soil moisture content of the 60 90 cm soil layer does not change much during the entire freezing and thawing process and the soil moisture content of the 80 90 cm soil layer remains basically unchanged the soil moisture content drops uniformly over the soil freezing period but the decline is small and the maximum reduction is less than 5 similar to c30 when the moisture content of the surface soil rapidly increases the soil temperature from 0 to 40 cm increases from 0 c and the soil temperature from 50 to 70 cm is the lowest indicating that the freezing front occurs between 50 and 70 cm in the c0 the time when the soil starts to freeze is the same as that for c30 and c15 the change in water content during the freezing process of the 10 50 cm soil layer is similar to that for c15 and c30 during the thawing period the moisture content of the surface soil begins to increase on march 16 and rapidly rises starting on march 20 indicating that the surface soil is rapidly thawing the maximum value of surface soil moisture content is occurred on approximately march 25 which is close to the moment when the soil begins to freeze and remains unchanged thereafter on march 31 the moisture content of each layer has reached the maximum value and remains at this maximum indicating that the soil has thawed during the thawing period the soil moisture content from 60 to 90 cm changes very little which is similar to c30 and c15 after the soil has thawed the moisture content of each layer is almost equal to that before freezing 3 2 2 the difference in meltwater infiltration parameters of c30 c15 c0 the soil temperature changes of c30 c15 and c0 are similar and the difference in soil moisture content changes is mainly reflected in the thawing period the change of surface water content is the key to judging the infiltration of meltwater among them the start time ki of meltwater infiltration the end time ei of meltwater infiltration duration ti of surface soil saturation the duration ti of meltwater infiltration and depth di of soil thawing at the end time of meltwater infiltration are important meltwater infiltration characteristic parameters draw the above parameters into table 3 in summary the water content and temperature changes at k0 k15 and k30 when the soil starts to freeze are similar during the thawing period the time when the soil surface moisture content begins to greatly increase occurs earlier than that for c30 and the surface moisture content reaches its maximum value almost simultaneously this may occur because snow exhibits a certain water storage capacity and the thicker the snow cover is the later runoff will be formed the difference in snow cover thickness will lead to varying times for the surface soil to reach a higher moisture content which also indicates that different snow cover thicknesses affect the meltwater infiltration time in addition snow cover delays soil thawing and the delay time is less affected by the snow cover thickness based on the experimental results the dynamic diagram of the thawing process of the frozen soil during the thawing period is shown in fig 9 throughout the whole thawing period the soil moisture content under c30 and c15 gradually increased from the surface layer reached the maximum value sequence and maintained a high moisture content indicating that the thawed soil of each layer was saturated during thawing under the action of meltwater infiltration and the soil above the thawing front was saturated when the surface water content changed from saturated to unsaturated the infiltration process of meltwater was complete the temperature decreased at night and the soil and meltwater refroze during the entire infiltration process the freezing layer was obviously saturated and obvious water accumulation occurred as shown in fig 9 therefore the essence of meltwater infiltration is the process of thawing and saturation of the frozen soil thawing front this process starts from infiltration initiation until the surface soil has been becomes unsaturated in the case of the same soil physical properties and similar daily environmental conditions the daily meltwater infiltration curve can be assumed to remain constant and the daily infiltration volume is a fixed value 3 3 calculation of the meltwater infiltration volume 3 3 1 c30 meltwater infiltration calculation it can be seen from table 3 that the end of the c30 meltwater infiltration period occurs at e30 on april 9 and the depth d30 of soil thawing is approximately 50 cm the function θ 2 30 z of the 0 50 cm soil moisture content with the depth at e30 is established via fitting and the function θ 1 30 z of the 0 50 cm soil moisture content with the depth is established at k30 as shown in fig 10 a significance testing of the fitted functions reveals that the results are extremely significant in the same way establish equations θ 1 0 z and θ 2 0 z at the same time as k30 and e30 for c0 as shown in fig 10 b eq 1 is applied to calculate the total water content of the 0 50 cm soil layer for c30 at two moments e30 and k30 namely m 3 and m 1 respectively the difference between the two values is 2 14 cm this difference includes the water loss caused by water migration during soil freezing and thawing the difference between m c and m a in the c0 0 50 cm soil total water content at e30 and k30 is 0 93 cm therefore the c30 meltwater infiltration volume is 3 07 cm 2 14 0 93 based on eq 4 the average daily infiltration volume a30 is 0 15 cm in the same way calculate the meltwater infiltration volume of c15 and the calculation process is shown in fig 11 the calculation results based on formulas 2 3 and 4 are shown in table 4 3 3 2 periodic changes in the shallow soil moisture on march 14 the soil moisture content rapidly increased as shown in figs 6 7 and 8 to reveal the most direct effect of meltwater on the soil moisture content the change in surface soil moisture content during the rapid increase period from march 19 to march 25 for c0 c15 and c30 is plotted as shown in fig 12 the c30 and c15 surface soil moisture content changes exhibit an obvious periodic phenomenon whereby they first increase and then decrease while the surface soil moisture content without a snow cover does not reveal this phenomenon instead demonstrating a uniform increase indicating that meltwater dominates the soil moisture content change compared to the moisture content of the surface soil without a snow cover the periodicity of the moisture content of the surface soil under the 30 cm and 15 cm snow covers is caused by the daily change in the temperature and irradiation therefore the periodic changes in the surface water content reflect the periodicity of snowmelt the increase in surface soil moisture content from the beginning to the inflection point over a cycle reflects the infiltration and refreezing of meltwater this cycle lasts approximately about 10 h as shown in fig 12 similar phenomena have also been reported in previous studies li et al 2020 3 3 3 determination of the infiltration curve parameters based on the limiting conditions in 2 4 2 the trend of the melt water infiltration curve was assumed and the curve resembled the boltzmann function the curve function is determined by two limiting conditions limiting condition 1 the curve satisfies the integral value of the 0 15 cm average daily infiltration volume which determines the height of the curve condition 2 the daily main infiltration duration should approach the average daily duration of meltwater production of 5 5 h this condition determines the width of the curve based on the above two limiting conditions the infiltration curve can be determined the parameter result are a 2 6617 and b 34 5427 and the daily infiltration curve was obtained as shown in fig 13 this curve satisfies the above two limiting conditions and the infiltration trend meets the assumptions through this curve it is concluded that the maximum daily meltwater infiltration rate is 0 06227 cm hour and it takes about two hours for the infiltration rate to increase from the beginning to the maximum 4 discussion 4 1 the rationality of eqs 1 4 and limitation lundberg et al 2016 pointed out that for agricultural farmlands where the soil has been packed by heavy machinery focused infiltration after soil thawing seems to be rule rather than the exception during snowmelt this indicates that the infiltration of meltwater mainly occurs in the melted soil layer the freezing and thawing of soil lead to a peak in the soil moisture content along the soil freezing front dinulescu and eckert 1980 the soil freezing front gradually moves from the surface towards deep layers with soil freezing front konrad and morgenstern 1981 causing the shallow soil moisture content ice and water to first increase after which the moisture condenses in the soil pores ireson et al 2012 lundberg et al 2015 soil freezing is also an important means of water storage but frozen water creates closed pores resulting in the frozen soil inhibiting water evaporation dai et al 2010 in the early stage of melting due to the low temperature combined with the snow cover and meltwater infiltration the soil moisture loss is minimal without a snow cover the thawing front continues to move downwards the ice crystals in the shallow soil melt into liquid water which is transferred to the surroundings so that the soil gradually returns to the pre freezing water state and an equilibrium is reached through atmospheric water exchange fig 5a b during the thawing period the melting of snow occurs much earlier than the thawing of frozen soil fu et al 2015 the frozen front gradually moves from the surface towards 40 70 cm depth due to the bidirectional thawing phenomenon of frozen soil the liquid water above and below the frozen front moves towards the frozen front and moisture accumulation occurs brouchkov 2000 however since the frozen soil exhibits a certain water resistance ireson et al 2012 lundberg et al 2015 h engelmark 1988 the upper water layer rarely penetrates the freezing front therefore the reasonable conditions for the method for estimating the amount of meltwater infiltration in this study are first frozen soil has a certain degree of water resistance second frozen soil has a protective effect on internal moisture third meltwater infiltration ends earlier than the soil is completely melted and meltwater infiltration mainly occurs in the melted soil layer fourth the water migration in the process of soil freezing and thawing mainly occurs between the unfrozen soil layer and the thawing frozen front 4 2 infiltration rate curve in previous studies sun 2019 applied the double loop infiltration method to conduct infiltration experiments to verify the applicability of the kostiakov and horton infiltration models philip equation and general empirical infiltration model in our study area and concluded that the general empirical model attained a good simulation effect in regard to the middle and late snowmelt stages it can be concluded that the stable soil infiltration rate during the thawing period was 0 06 cm min roy et al 2020 performed infiltration experiments on frozen soils with different initial moisture contents over 60 min and determined the average infiltration rate of the frozen soils with the three different initial moisture contents at 0 66 0 38 and 0 59 cm min in the above experiments the infiltration water and infiltration environment are very different from the infiltration of natural farmland meltwater water with higher heat may destroy the structure of frozen soil unlike the experimental soil mentioned above farmland soil is compacted mechanically to a certain extent the above experimental results may be far greater than the actual situation in this study the average daily maximum infiltration rate is 0 06227 cm hour which is much smaller than other experiments it reflects the restriction of farmland frozen soil on the infiltration of melt water in the natural state which is closer to the reality the daily infiltration rate curve is determined by two factors first the total amount of daily meltwater infiltration second the period of meltwater infiltration is close to the period of meltwater generation the first limiting factor is mathematically established the total daily meltwater infiltration is the integral of the infiltration rate over time the second limiting factor is established for the following reasons lundberg et al 2016 pointed out that the meltwater in the farmland focused infiltration after the soil melts in nature the melting water generation period is the soil thawing period which is determined by meteorological factors mainly air temperature and radiation intensity 4 3 the relationship between the snow cover thickness and infiltration time the thickness and density of the snow cover affect the final melting time little fu et al 2015 wan 2016 therefore the final melting durations for c15 and c30 are similar but based on figs 6 8 the length of time during which the surface soil maintains a high moisture content is not the same t1 is much longer than t2 and the snow completely melts during these two periods the thickness of the snow cover affects the time for the soil to dewater and become waterlogged during the thawing period due to the frozen layer of the soil in the farmland the meltwater infiltration capacity is low based on the law of mass conservation there must be a maximum meltwater storage volume ϝ of farmland meltwater when the total amount of meltwater is greater than ϝ the greater part will cause runoff loss when the total amount of meltwater is less than ϝ the meltwater is all hoarded in the farmland to infiltrate and evaporate it shows that when the snow depth in the early stage of thawing period reaches a certain value z the accumulation of meltwater in the farmland reaches ϝ when the snow depth in the early stage of thawing period exceeds z the total amount of meltwater exceeds ϝ and the excess part is lost in the form of runoff therefore it is inferred that in the same farmland when the snow depth in the early stage of thawing period exceeds a certain value z and the total amount of meltwater exceeds ϝ the amount of meltwater infiltration no longer changes when the snow depth is less than z and the total amount of meltwater is less than ϝ of the farmland the total amount of meltwater is hoarded in the farmland to infiltrate and evaporate and the infiltration duration of different snow depth must be different according to experimental observations under 30 cm and 15 cm snow cover no significant runoff loss was found indicating that neither of them reached the maximum meltwater storage ϝ in the farmland at the same time the calculation results of the meltwater infiltration amount found that the average daily infiltration amount of different snow cover thicknesses was close indicating that the snow cover thickness had less affect the meltwater infiltration rate and different snow cover thicknesses produced different meltwater accumulations which directly affected the meltwater infiltration duration therefore when the snow depth is less than z and the total meltwater is less than ϝ it is assumed that there is a functional relationship between the snow depth and the infiltration duration the function trend line of the thickness of snow cover and the meltwater infiltration duration is shown in fig 14 this trend line is determined by the following 5 conditions 1 the snow depth of 15 and 30 cm are all less than z 2 there is the maximum meltwater storage ϝ in the farmland when the snow depth exceeds z the meltwater infiltration duration will not increase after reaching d 3 during the thawing period as time progresses the higher the ambient temperature the stronger the radiation and the faster the evaporation of water therefore the time of meltwater infiltration and the thickness of snow are not linear with the increase of snow depth the increase rate of meltwater infiltration time decreases the slope of the function curve should decrease continuously and when it reaches a certain snow depth the infiltration time will no longer change 4 the trend line passes through three known points 0 0 15 14 30 21 5 the maximum snow thickness observed in this study area is more than 60 cm this study believes that the snow thickness corresponding to the maximum meltwater storage ϝ in the farmland is less than 60 cm it can be concluded that when the farmland reaches the maximum meltwater storage the corresponding snow thickness is between 30 and 60 cm the maximum duration of meltwater infiltration is between 21 and 35 days the ratio of the 15 cm snow cover to the infiltration amount is 67 61 and the ratio of 30 cm snow cover to infiltration amount is 49 8 the thicker the snow the more meltwater the longer the infiltration time of meltwater and the closer to the late thawing stage the stronger the air temperature and light the more water evaporation and the lower the infiltration proportion the experimental results also support this this indicates that the larger the snow cover thickness is the lower infiltration proportion is 5 conclusion the results of this study are as follows 1 when the farmland reaches the maximum meltwater storage the corresponding snow thickness z is between 30 and 60 cm the maximum duration d of meltwater infiltration is between 21 and 35 days 2 the average daily meltwater infiltration is approximately 0 15 cm and the maximum infiltration volume is between 3 15 and 5 25 cm 3 the average daily maximum infiltration rate of the thawing period frozen soil is approximately 0 06 cm hour 4 in the farmland during the thawing period in the seasonal frozen soil areas the larger the snow cover thickness the smaller the meltwater infiltration proportion is meltwater infiltration in seasonal frozen soil areas is a complex hydrological phenomenon that is accompanied by repeated freezing and thawing cycles it is difficult to obtain a meltwater infiltration curve using traditional infiltration models a meltwater infiltration curve is proposed based on actual measurements and theoretical analysis and the proposed curve is defined according to the experimental results while an infiltration volume curve closely reflecting the real situation is obtained for the first time in this study the precise observation of the change process of frozen soil and meltwater during the thawing period requires continuous improvement which is also an important direction for future research

9851,estimating water balance is the foundation of improving water productivity wp and managing crop production efficiently in fields with significant spatial variability of soil properties agricultural system models are useful tools to simulate crop yield wp and water balance however they are rarely focused on geostatistical characteristics on the spatial scale if agricultural system models are used spatially it is important to consider whether the geostatistical characteristics of the simulations are similar to those based on measured data in this study two process based models the widely used agricultural production systems simulator apsim and the newly developed soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator whcns were used to simulate crop yield water balance and wp in a 54 ha field with spatially variable soil properties performance of the simulations was good for both models however the simulation accuracy of whcns was higher than for apsim geostatistical characteristics of measured maize yield and final soil water storage swsf were different from the simulated data the fitted semivariogram models of simulated yield and swsf had a higher semivariogram range and lower random variation than that of measured data the fitted semivariogram models and geostatistical characteristics of simulated water balance also varied between the two models although the agricultural system models simulated the spatial distribution of variables efficiently their spatial structure was changed in comparison with the spatial structure of measured data this would affect the interpolation precision of spatial distribution maps more work is required on the robustness and prediction accuracy of both models for their implementation in a spatial way keywords water balance

making rötter et al 2012 ahmed et al 2016 agricultural system models are useful tools for simulation of agricultural systems especially when measurements are time or labor consuming or not feasible for example greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen transformations were simulated and evaluated by using dndc and apsim models vogeler et al 2013 simulations of etc by using dssat ran et al 2020 and

water and nitrogen leaching with good accuracy agricultural system models are often used to simulate primarily homogeneous conditions however spatial variability of soil properties is common within a field which affects crop yield water and nitrogen dynamics and gas emissions zhao et al 2018 chen et al 2020a different degrees of spatial variability are usually found in soils which vary with the study area and sampling interval adhikari et al 2012 ovalles and collins 1988 besides numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of soil spatial temporal variability on crop growth

et al 2020 reading et al 2019 chen et al 2020a 2020b however analysis and evaluation of the geostatistical characteristics of simulated water balances by using agricultural system models is not a common topic of research a better understanding of water balance crop yield wp and their spatial distribution characteristics within a field is essential for applying precision irrigated agriculture brown et al 2021 ohana levi et al 2019 in this study apsim and whcns were selected because they offer two contrasting approaches for simulating water balance including reference evapotranspiration et0 etc and soil water movement liang et al 2016a keating et al 2003 therefore the aims of this study were to assess the performance of apsim and whcns for simulating maize yield water balance and wp based on the spatial variability of the soil properties in a large field and then to evaluate the characteristics of geospatial models constructed with simulated data 2 materials and methods 2 1 field

apsim is a process based model that can simulate soil crop atmospheric processes at a daily time step keating et al 2003 in apsim soil water balance can be simulated by two modules namely soilwat probert et al 1998 and swim verburg et al 1996 huth et al 2012 in this study soilwat was used to simulate water balance in apsim version 7 10 soilwat uses a cascading flow type method for estimating

swsfm and measured swc data from 2016 91 sampling points were used to calibrate whcns and apsim while data from 2017 and 2018 110 sampling points were used for validation based on the measured soil particle components and bd table a1 soil hydraulic parameters table a2 were estimated by using pedo transfer functions motaghian and mohammadi 2011 irrigation schedule and total precipitation during the growth period of maize in 2016 2018 were shown in table a3 these data were used in both whcns and apsim for obtaining a close agreement between simulations and measurements a trial and error approach was used to calibrate the basic crop parameters in each model table 1 three statistical indices normalized root mean square error nrmse yang et al 2014 index of agreement ia willmott 1982 and

jamieson et al 1991 nrmse 25 25 75 and 75 were categorized as good moderate and poor agreement respectively the closer the value of ia to 1 the better the performance of model simulations while nse 1 can determine the relative magnitude of model residuals compared to the variance of measurements and describe model accuracy 2 6 statistical analysis the coefficient of variation cv was used to describe the variation in the simulated yield and water balance for cv 10 10 100 and 100 represented low medium and high heterogeneity respectively warrick and nielsen 1980 for the simulated yield swsf etc dp and wp measured yield and swsf spatial distribution maps were drawn by using arcgis 10 2 while semivariogram models were fitted using gs 7 0 3 results 3 1 models calibration and validation the statistical indices nrmse ia and nse indicated that the calibration and validation performances of whcns for swc swsf and yield were slightly better than for apsim table 2 for calibration of swsf nrmse was less than 13 ia was more than 0 82 and nse was more than 0 78 regardless of the model for yield nrmse was less than 7 ia was more than 0 88 and nse was more than 0 81 for swc in soil layers nrmse was less than 11 ia was more than 0 76 and nse was more than 0 49 for validation the statistical indices were very similar to those for calibration indicating that the models are robust and have good predictive power 3 2 geostatistical analysis semivariogram models and parameters were used to characterize the spatial variability of the measurements of yield and swsf in comparison with the simulations using whcns and apsim table 3 compared with the models based on measured yield and swsf the semivariogram ranges for simulations were larger and random variation was greater notably the dsd was only classified as moderate for yielda in 2017 and swsfw in 2018 compared with the strong dsd for the measured data for all semivariogram models the coefficient of determination r2 was above 0 81 table 3 the type of the best fitted semivariogram model often varied between agricultural system models and across years but there were instances where the best model was the same for both years the fitted models of yielda and dpa were spherical and gaussian models in both years respectively the yieldm was fitted with a spherical and swsfm was fitted with a gaussian model for both years the semivariogram ranges of swsfm and yieldm were smaller than for the simulated data for the simulations of swsf etc wp dp and yield the semivariogram ranges varied from 110 6 m etcw in 2018 to 374 3 m yieldw in 2018 in whcns and varied from 136 2 m etca in 2018 to 432 7 m dpa in 2018 in apsim for most of the measurements and simulations there was a strong spatial dependence however there were some exceptions with a moderate spatial dependence including dpa in 2017 and 2018 dsd values were 27 5 and 35 7 respectively yielda in 2017 dsd 26 9 and the swsfw in 2018 dsd 27 4 3 3 spatial distributions of water balance and maize yield values of cv for measured yield and swsf were higher than those of simulated models which indicated a higher degree of variation for measurements than simulations low heterogeneity was found in the simulated yield etc and wp nevertheless medium heterogeneity was found in the measured yield and swsf and simulated swsf and dp table 4 the magnitudes of simulated water variables indicated that water is predominantly lost via etc accounting for 70 4 81 3 of water input irrigation plus precipitation with whcns and 68 8 81 9 with apsim when averaged across the field the proportion of dp to water input ranged from 8 0 to 18 4 with whcns and 6 9 21 3 with apsim table 4 spatial distributions of measured yield and swsf simulated yield swsf etc dp and wp are presented in the ordinary kriging maps based on the fitted semivariogram parameters figs 1 and 2 spatially measured yield and swsf were more diverse than the simulated data which is consistent with the cv results spatial distribution of swsf etc and wp was high and dp was low in the high yield areas with the effects of spatial variability of soil properties changing from north to south chen et al 2020a 2020b 4 discussion 4 1 sources of differences in simulation results of whcns and apsim simulations of yield and swsf using whcns and apsim were in good agreement with the measured data although the accuracy of whcns was higher than that of apsim table 2 because of the differences in the model structures it is unsurprising that the simulations of apsim and whcns were different different outcomes of simulated water balance in whcns and apsim are likely caused by the differences in the water balance modules of the two models liang et al 2016a for whcns et0 is calculated by the penman monteith method and etc is calculated based on the crop coefficient and compensated root water method but in apsim et0 is calculated by the priestly taylor method and etc by the cascading flow method soilwat sections 2 3 and 2 4 crop water consumption is reported to be closely related to the root growth srayeddin and doussan 2009 zegada lizarazu et al 2012 and the main component of water balance in apsim the cascading flow method simulates water balance which consequently affects soil water dynamics archontoulis et al 2014 ebrahimi mollabashi et al 2019 crop water uptake gaydon et al 2017 and drainage malone et al 2007 in the cascading flow method the total plant available water in the soil profile is defined as the sum of the differences between dul and ll15 for all layers while the root extraction is calculated based on the growth dynamics of the root system crop factors and the available water in each layer soil factors a compensated root water method šimůnek and hopmans 2009 is used in whcns which can be used for various spatial and temporal distributions of root growth with this method a threshold value called the root adaptability factor is used when the threshold value is exceeded the root water uptake in the water limited layers decreases but the plant compensates for evapotranspiration by taking up more water from other layers with sufficiently available water otherwise soil water movement was simulated using the green ampt formula and richards equation in whcns liang et al 2016a the compensation root water method and soil water module in whcns may explain

9851,estimating water balance is the foundation of improving water productivity wp and managing crop production efficiently in fields with significant spatial variability of soil properties agricultural system models are useful tools to simulate crop yield wp and water balance however they are rarely focused on geostatistical characteristics on the spatial scale if agricultural system models are used spatially it is important to consider whether the geostatistical characteristics of the simulations are similar to those based on measured data in this study two process based models the widely used agricultural production systems simulator apsim and the newly developed soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator whcns were used to simulate crop yield water balance and wp in a 54 ha field with spatially variable soil properties performance of the simulations was good for both models however the simulation accuracy of whcns was higher than for apsim geostatistical characteristics of measured maize yield and final soil water storage swsf were different from the simulated data the fitted semivariogram models of simulated yield and swsf had a higher semivariogram range and lower random variation than that of measured data the fitted semivariogram models and geostatistical characteristics of simulated water balance also varied between the two models although the agricultural system models simulated the spatial distribution of variables efficiently their spatial structure was changed in comparison with the spatial structure of measured data this would affect the interpolation precision of spatial distribution maps more work is required on the robustness and prediction accuracy of both models for their implementation in a spatial way keywords water balance spatial variability geostatistics whcns apsim 1 introduction with the concurrent increases in water shortages and food demand it is necessary to improve crop yield and water productivity wp in many regions across the world du et al 2010 kang et al 2017 to design efficient water use strategies it is important to understand and quantify the water loss in the agricultural system which include crop evapotranspiration etc processes and deep percolation dp soldevilla martinez et al 2014 such quantifications are critical and essential in arid areas where water scarcity and high evaporative demand are common gonzález perea et al 2016 agricultural system models can be used to simulate the components of water balance and crop yield efficiently which can provide valuable information for decision making rötter et al 2012 ahmed et al 2016 agricultural system models are useful tools for simulation of agricultural systems especially when measurements are time or labor consuming or not feasible for example greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen transformations were simulated and evaluated by using dndc and apsim models vogeler et al 2013 simulations of etc by using dssat ran et al 2020 and aquacrop toumi et al 2016 showed good agreement with measurements hydrus 1d tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 and soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator whcns model liang et al 2016b could also simulate water and nitrogen leaching with good accuracy agricultural system models are often used to simulate primarily homogeneous conditions however spatial variability of soil properties is common within a field which affects crop yield water and nitrogen dynamics and gas emissions zhao et al 2018 chen et al 2020a different degrees of spatial variability are usually found in soils which vary with the study area and sampling interval adhikari et al 2012 ovalles and collins 1988 besides numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of soil spatial temporal variability on crop growth and water balance herbst and diekkrüger 2002 van der weerden et al 2014 chen et al 2021 which indicated soil was one of the main causes for the heterogeneity of crop yield and water balance on the time and spatial scale delineating a field into homogeneous areas at an appropriate spatial scale is one way to upscale agricultural system model applications elliott et al 2016 anand et al 2018 attia et al 2019 simulation accuracy of this approach is however dependent on the resolution of the input data e g soil climate topography and management senthilkumar et al 2015 hoffmann et al 2015 for field scale research reliable results can be obtained by collecting measured data from a large number of sampling points using measurements of soil properties at multiple sampling points as the input

process based models that can simulate crop yield and water balance in agricultural systems apsim for example is the most widely cited agricultural system model morel et al 2020 and has been used to quantify the effects of variability in soil texture on simulated water balance and nitrous oxide emissions vogeler and cichota 2018 gaydon et al 2017 used apsim to simulate crop yield of different

2020b both models have been successfully applied in field scale research under heterogeneous conditions and can reflect the impacts of soil water and nitrogen management on crops and soil moisture bai et al 2020 reading et al 2019 chen et al 2020a 2020b however analysis and evaluation of the geostatistical characteristics of simulated water balances by using agricultural system models is not a common topic of research a better understanding of water balance crop yield wp and their spatial distribution characteristics within a field is essential for applying precision irrigated agriculture brown et al 2021 ohana levi et al 2019 in this study apsim and whcns were selected because they offer two contrasting approaches for simulating water balance including reference evapotranspiration et0 etc and soil water movement liang et al 2016a keating et al 2003 therefore the aims of this study were to assess the performance of apsim and whcns for simulating maize yield water balance and wp

describe the variation in the simulated yield and water balance for cv 10 10 100 and 100 represented low medium and high heterogeneity respectively warrick and nielsen 1980 for the simulated yield swsf etc dp and wp measured yield and swsf spatial distribution maps were drawn by using arcgis 10 2 while semivariogram models were fitted using gs 7 0 3 results 3 1 models calibration and validation the statistical indices nrmse ia and nse indicated that the calibration and validation performances of whcns for swc swsf and yield were slightly better than for apsim table 2 for calibration of swsf nrmse was less than 13 ia was more than 0 82 and nse was more than 0 78 regardless of the model for yield nrmse was less than 7 ia was more than 0 88 and nse was more than 0 81 for swc in soil layers nrmse was less than 11 ia was more than 0 76 and nse was more than 0 49 for validation the statistical indices were very similar to those for calibration indicating that the models are robust and have good predictive power 3 2 geostatistical analysis semivariogram models and parameters were used to characterize the spatial variability of the measurements of yield and swsf in comparison with the simulations using whcns and apsim table 3 compared with the models based on measured yield and swsf the semivariogram ranges for simulations were larger and random variation was greater notably the dsd was only classified as moderate for yielda in 2017 and swsfw in 2018 compared with the strong dsd for the measured data for all semivariogram models the coefficient of determination r2 was above 0 81 table 3 the type of the best fitted semivariogram model often varied between agricultural system models and across years but there were instances where the best model was the same for both years the fitted models of yielda and dpa were spherical and gaussian models in both years respectively the yieldm was fitted with a spherical and swsfm was fitted with a gaussian model for both years the semivariogram ranges of swsfm and yieldm were smaller than for the simulated data for the simulations of swsf etc wp dp and yield the semivariogram ranges varied from 110 6 m etcw in 2018 to 374 3 m yieldw in 2018 in whcns and varied from 136 2 m etca in 2018 to 432 7 m dpa in 2018 in apsim for most of the measurements and simulations there was a strong spatial dependence however there were some exceptions with a moderate spatial dependence including dpa in 2017 and 2018 dsd values were 27 5 and 35 7 respectively yielda in 2017 dsd 26 9 and the swsfw in 2018 dsd 27 4 3 3 spatial distributions of water balance and maize yield values of cv for measured yield and swsf were higher than those of simulated models which indicated a higher degree of variation for measurements than simulations low heterogeneity was found in the simulated yield etc and wp nevertheless medium heterogeneity was found in the measured yield and swsf and simulated swsf and dp table 4 the magnitudes of simulated water variables indicated that water is predominantly lost via etc accounting for 70 4 81 3 of water input irrigation plus precipitation with whcns and 68 8 81 9 with apsim when averaged across the field the proportion of dp to water input ranged from 8 0 to 18 4 with whcns and 6 9 21 3 with apsim table 4 spatial distributions of measured yield and swsf simulated yield swsf etc dp and wp are presented in the ordinary kriging maps based on the fitted semivariogram parameters figs 1 and 2 spatially measured yield and swsf were more diverse than the simulated data which is consistent with the cv results spatial distribution of swsf etc and wp was high and dp was low in the high yield areas with the effects of spatial variability of soil properties changing from north to south chen et al 2020a 2020b 4 discussion 4 1 sources of differences in simulation results of whcns and apsim simulations of yield and swsf using whcns and apsim were in good agreement with the measured data although the accuracy of whcns was higher than that of apsim table 2 because of the differences in the model structures it is unsurprising that the simulations of apsim and whcns were different different outcomes of simulated water balance in whcns and apsim are likely caused by the differences in the water balance modules of the two models liang et al 2016a for whcns et0 is calculated by the penman monteith method and etc is calculated based on the crop coefficient and compensated root water method but in apsim et0 is calculated by the priestly taylor method and etc by the cascading flow method soilwat sections 2 3 and 2 4 crop water consumption is reported to be closely related to the root growth srayeddin and doussan 2009 zegada lizarazu et al 2012 and the main component of water balance in apsim the cascading flow method simulates water balance which consequently affects soil water dynamics archontoulis et al 2014 ebrahimi mollabashi et al 2019 crop water uptake gaydon et al 2017 and drainage malone et al 2007 in the cascading flow method the total plant available water in the soil profile is defined as the sum of the differences between dul and ll15 for all layers while the root extraction is calculated based on the growth dynamics of the root system crop factors and the available water in each layer soil factors a compensated root water method šimůnek and hopmans 2009 is used in whcns which can be used for various spatial and temporal distributions of root growth with this method a threshold value called the root adaptability factor is used when the threshold value is exceeded the root water uptake in the water limited layers decreases but the plant compensates for evapotranspiration by taking up more water from other layers with sufficiently available water otherwise soil water movement was simulated using the green ampt formula and richards equation in whcns liang et al 2016a the compensation root water method and soil water module in whcns may explain the more accurate water balance simulations spatial variability in soil properties can contribute to the heterogeneous spatial distribution of yield and water balance katerji and mastrorilli 2009

9852,the transmission of water through soil is one of the critical links to reflect the hydrological process at present there are controversies about the infiltration of farmland irrigation water and the replacement of old and new water in arid areas which significantly reduces the scientific nature of the irrigation policy formulation in this study we monitored the temporal and spatial changes of stable isotopes of soil water in minqin oasis farmland analyzed the infiltration process of irrigation water used the mixsiar isotope mixture model to estimate the contribution of irrigation water to soil water and evaluated their effective contribution time to different soil layers this study suggests that the temporal and spatial changes in pore water isotope reflect the process of artificial irrigation and evaporation within 5 days after irrigation the average contribution rate of irrigation at 0 20 cm 20 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers was 31 11 17 74 19 17 12 72 and 31 56 12 42 respectively under the influence of soil water content topography and plastic film cover the effective contribution time of irrigation water to 0 20 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers was more than 5 d and

preferential flow path is generally soil macropores caused by cracks rotting plant roots rocks etc dusek et al 2012 gazis and feng 2004 at this time a large amount of water input often causes solutes to quickly migrate down the preferential flow path which may cause groundwater pollution klaus et al 2013 in natural soil soil macropores soil structure soil texture soil water content soil initial water content the application rate of water and solute and solute application method are important factors affecting water infiltration liu et al 2015 x li et al 2017 z li et al 2017 jačka et al 2021 in contrast farmland soil is more disturbed by human activities under the same irrigation system irrigation and rainfall in film mulching treatment can only flow into corn growth porosity and the bare area between film mulching at this time the soil water potential under plastic film mulching is higher than that of no film mulching li et al 2021 sintim et al 2021 so plastic film mulching was more likely to increase water leakage after irrigation in addition high intensity artificial irrigation will inevitably lead to more preferential flows in arid oasis areas m li et al 2019 z li et al 2019 the stable isotope has the functions of tracing integrating and indicating to the research object and can more accurately record the process information of infiltration evaporation transpiration and mixing in various water bodies it is a powerful tool for exploring hydrogeological processes and characteristics barnes and allison 1988 zhu et al 2019 wenninger et al 2010 seasonal changes in precipitation isotopes are often used to track the seepage process of soil moisture koeniger et al 2016 the high variability of the isotope signals of the soil profile and the seasonal absence of precipitation signals can identify preferential flows in the soil peralta tapia et al 2015 and the cyclic changes of isotope composition reflect the passage of new water to old water ma et al 2017 furthermore the soil isotope profile can not only distinguish the replenishment ratio of preferential flow and plug flow xiang et al 2019 but also can be used to track the contribution ratio of various water sources to soil moisture to determine the effective contribution time of different water sources to soil moisture liu et al 2015 at present stable isotopes are not only used in the hydrological analysis to obtain soil water infiltration process stumpp and maloszewski 2010 residence time liu et al 2015 and update rate hu et al 2015 it is also used to model preferential flow paths weiler and mcdonnell 2004 and soil water travel time sprenger et al 2015 2016b in arid areas where water resources are extremely scarce agricultural water resources are generally higher than 80 of the total water resources water shortage is the most important limiting factor for agriculture in arid regions wang et al 2018 we monitored the soil moisture after each irrigation event in minqin oasis in 2019 to further understand the infiltration process and replenishment mechanism of irrigation water in the unsaturated zone of farmland soil in an arid oasis area we proposed the following research goals i the contribution and effective contribution time of irrigation water to the soil moisture of farmland ii the infiltration of irrigation water in the soil reflected by the isotope of pore water 2 study sites 2 1 overview of the study area minqin oasis 38 27 10 39 06 53 n 102 53 16 103 49 00 e is located in the eastern end of hexi corridor and the lower reaches of shiyang river basin surrounded by badain jaran desert and tenge desert in the west north and east minqin oasis is formed under shiyang river s nourishment are 206 km east west and 156 km north south fig 1 it is a typical continental climate with intense solar radiation long sunshine hours and a large temperature difference between day and night sparse precipitation 113 2 mm per year and strong evaporation 2675 6 mm per year which is one of the regions with the most severe water resources shortage and sand storm hazards in the world the formation process of oasis soil was affected by parent material and soluble salts accumulate natural soil includes gray brown desert soil aeolian sandy soil saline soil and meadow soil cultivated soil is mainly irrigated silt soil which evolved under the effects of long term cultivation irrigation and fertilization the minqin area has little precipitation and surface water and groundwater are the keys to the oasis s existence the only external surface runoff is the shiyang river which originates from the qilian mountains and its main replenishment sources are alpine snow meltwater and atmospheric precipitation 2 2 overview of the experiment station the experiment station is located in beidong village 38 47 29 n 103 13 52 e datan township in the middle of minqin oasis the experiment field is 67 m long and 26 m wide surrounded by roads irrigation canals and ridges the changes in temperature relative humidity precipitation and irrigation volume during the experimental station s growth period in 2019 are shown in fig 2 during the corn growing period there were 6 irrigations in total the irrigation water source was underground well water and the irrigation mode was surface flooding we used the hzqp d ic card intelligent water distribution terminal to monitor the irrigation water volume during the irrigation process the experiment field is covered with plastic film width 115 cm thickness 0 012 mm at 40 cm intervals the original width of the plastic film is 140 cm we took approximately 12 5 cm from the left and right sides of the plastic film and bury it in the soil 3 data and methods 3 1 sample collection this study collected soil water rainwater and irrigation water samples in the experimental field during the corn growing period from april to september 2019 3 1 1 sample collection fresh soil samples in 0 5 5 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 50 60 60 70 70 80 80 90 90 100 cm layers were drilled in the sample plot the sampling location is covered by the film and located in the field ditches during the observation period there were 6 irrigations in total soil samples were collected intensively before and after irrigation once before irrigation and continuously for five days after irrigation four parallel samples were collected for each soil layer put three of them into a 50 ml glass bottle sealed the bottle with parafilm wrote down the sampling date and depth on the bottle and then frozen and stored until experimental isotope analysis put another parallel sample in an aluminum box and store it for soil moisture content determination immediately after each irrigation or precipitation event irrigation water and rainwater samples were transferred to an 80 ml high density polyethylene sample bottle sealed with a parafilm membrane and then frozen and stored until the experimental analysis 3 2 sample analysis sample analysis processing and determination were all completed in the isotope laboratory of the college of geography and environmental science northwest normal university water from the soil was extracted using an li 2100 fully automated cryogenic vacuum extraction system all water samples were analyzed using a dlt 100 liquid water isotope analyzer developed by los gatos research usa during the analysis each water sample and isotope standard sample was injected consecutively 6 times in order to avoid the memory effect of isotope analysis we discarded the values of the first two injections and used the average value of the last four injections as the final value the analysis is expressed as a thousandth of the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow 1 δ r sample r standard 1 1000 in the formula r sampleis the ratio of 18o 16o or 2h 1h in the sample and r standard is the ratio of 18o 16o or 2h 1h in v smow the standard error of measurement is 0 6 for δ 2h and 0 2 for δ 18o respectively 3 3 meteorological data the automatic weather station watchdog 2000 series weather stations set up near the sample site was used to obtain and record the local temperature and relative humidity and other meteorological data during the sampling period 3 4 lc excess the linear relationship between δ 2h and δ 18o in precipitation and soil water is defined as the lmwl local meteoric water line and swl soil waterline respectively the lc excess in different water bodies can characterize the evaporation index of different water bodies relative to local precipitation landwehr and coplen 2006 landwehr et al 2014 2 lc excess δ 2 h a δ 2 h b where a and b are the slope and intercept of lmwl respectively δ 2h and δ 18o are the hydrogen and oxygen isotope values in the sample based on the isotope analysis s precision and the slope of the lmwl the lc excess of soil water and rainfall was derived and their uncertainty was estimated to be 2 27 3 5 mixsiar model the mixsiar isotope mixture model based on bayesian theory was used to identify the water source of soil water and quantify the contribution ratio f of different water sources stock and semmens 2013 the bayesian mixing models have advantages over simple linear mixing models in estimating probability distributions of source contributions which combines multiple sources of uncertainty isotopic characteristics and isotopic fractionation in this study the underground water level is 26 m far beyond the groundwater evaporation limit in addition the minqin oasis had very little rainwater the strong surface evaporation made most of the rainwater evaporate quickly after falling on the surface of the mulch and only a small amount of water entered the soil to mix with the original pore water therefore groundwater and rainwater were not considered as the water source of soil water in this study soil water mainly comes from irrigation water soil water in the previous layer and early soil water in the mixsiar model the markov chain monte carlo mcmc running step length was very long and the model error was selected from process residual after running the mixsiar we conducted a check diagnostic according to stock and semmens 2013 for confirming the validity of the result stock and semmens 2016 4 results 4 1 temporal variation of soil water isotope in farmland during the 6 irrigation events the average values of δ 2h and δ 18o of soil water were 67 35 5 90 93 07 to 54 73 and 9 02 1 06 13 13 to 5 19 table 1 the slope and intercept of swl were smaller than lmwl indicating that input water entered the soil and was affected by evaporation making the soil water isotope enriched most of the soil water isotope values fell on the lower right of the irrigation water confirming that artificial irrigation was the main source of soil water replenishment the study compared 6 irrigation events with different input water volumes i1 112 mm i2 90 6 mm i3 92 1 mm i4 94 7 mm i5 94 7 mm i6 92 6 mm according to dunn s test results the soil isotope 2h and 18o was significantly different from other irrigations after the fifth irrigation there was little difference in the amount of input water during each irrigation process and it had no obvious correlation with the isotope value the amount of irrigation water didn t affect the enrichment and depletion of the isotope value fig 3a the water in the soil pores underwent a renewal process before and after the irrigation event we further compared the similarities and differences of soil isotope in the period before and after irrigation the results showed that the soil water isotope values 2h and 18o were significantly different between the 1 3 days after the irrigation water input and before the irrigation by the fourth day this difference ceased to exist after irrigation the input water was mixed with the original water in the soil pores making the latter have the former s isotopic characteristics and deplete which is especially obvious in shallow soils after the irrigation was completed the dynamic fractionation of isotopes was caused by the soil pore water s evaporation the isotopic composition gradually returned to the state before irrigation after the fourth day fig 3b 4 2 spatial variation of soil water isotope we can observe clear signals of irrigation water input in the soil water isotope profile fig 4 the arid environment caused fractionation of soil moisture that had not been input by precipitation or irrigation water at that time the isotope values in the topsoil pores were significantly enriched and the swlc excess was still negative at 80 cm after the irrigation start the isotopes of irrigation water were significantly smaller than those of shallow soil water so water infiltration and mixing depleted the surface soil water isotopes and weakened the evaporation signal as the water continued to penetrate the soil in the middle and lower parts was also affected after we stop irrigation the soil moisture penetrates the deep soil 60 100 cm at this time the evaporation effect is smaller and the isotope value is more depleted due to the arid environment the isotope fractionation of middle and upper soil water gradually appeared and the light isotope fractionation in the surface soil water made heavy isotopes quickly enriched on the surface as time went by the fractionation signal swlc excess gradually went to the lower layer of soil and the isotope value of soil pore water gradually returned to the level before irrigation the change of gwc in soil pores is the most intuitive manifestation of water infiltration when irrigation occurred with water input the gwc content s growth in the gaps at different soil depths was different at different infiltration stages the topsoil first received irrigation water and became moist at that time the change range of gwc would be reduced in each soil layer when the water completely penetrated the underlying soil s pores the newly input water would mix with the original soil pore water causing the gwc to reach the peak value we could observe this phenomenon in every irrigation process it often occurred on the second or third day after irrigation after the gwc reached its peak part of the water continued to infiltrate to cause deep leakage and the other part of the water became vapor into the atmosphere due to evapotranspiration 4 3 contribution of irrigation water to water in soil profiles based on changes in soil water isotope we estimated the contribution of irrigation water to soil moisture five days after the event fig 5 from one day to five days after the event the average contribution f of irrigation water to soil water within 1 m was 33 98 16 76 32 59 8 71 34 29 15 51 19 93 8 74 and 13 86 9 66 to understand the migration of irrigation water in the soil layer more clearly we divided the 1 m soil layer into 3 layers shallow layer 0 20 cm middle layer 20 60 cm deep layer 60 100 cm on the first day after the irrigation event the 0 20 cm soil layer reached the peak contribution 59 53 3 73 in the five consecutive days the contribution f of irrigation water to the soil layer was greater than 10 the 20 60 cm soil layer reached the peak contribution 34 25 10 69 on the second day after irrigation from the fifth day the contribution f of irrigation water to this layer of soil water was less than 10 the peak contribution of irrigation water to the 60 100 cm soil layer appeared on the third day 50 55 11 87 overall within five days after irrigation the average contribution rate of irrigation water to 0 20 cm 20 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers is 31 11 17 74 19 17 12 72 and 31 56 12 42 respectively the contribution of irrigation water to 20 60 cm soil is relatively small 5 discussion 5 1 effective contribution time of irrigation water to soil water 5 1 1 effective contribution time of irrigation water unlike natural soil farmland is easily disturbed by human activities such as farming and irrigation altering the water supply to the soil in this research when the irrigation contribution rate is less than 5 in the model calculation on a certain day after irrigation the contribution of this irrigation event disappears from the soil moisture the time that irrigation water contributed to the different soil layers of agricultural land was different after the irrigation event the average contribution of the 0 20 cm soil layer exceeded 10 on the fifth day after irrigation which means that irrigation water s contribution to soil water still existed after 5 d the 20 60 cm soil layer s contribution rate on the fifth day was less than 5 and the effective contribution time of irrigation water to this layer of soil water was only 4 d on the fifth day the average contribution rate of the 60 100 cm soil layer was greater than that of the 0 20 cm and 20 60 cm soil layers it is reasonable to believe that the contribution of irrigation water to the soil layer will continue and that the soil layer s effective contribution time will be longer table 2 5 1 2 the main factors affecting the effective contribution time of irrigation water the time during which irrigation water actually contributes is affected by natural conditions and human activities preferential flow is a common form of water and solute transportation in farmland soil which changes the effective contribution of irrigation water to soil water by affecting the hydrological transport of soil water gazis and feng 2004 our research was in an extremely arid environment the average soil water content was much lower than the saturated water content and excessive water input would cause the rapid movement of soil water padilla et al 1999 compared with the vertical push type seepage method the preferential flow of macropores quickly seeps through the soil matrix to the deep soil shortening the contribution of input water to the middle and upper soil although the effective contribution time of 0 20 cm soil layer irrigation water was more than 5 d its contribution rate had become lower the use of plastic film to cover the topsoil in arid areas allows for the purpose of cooling and hydration and interferes with water infiltration on the one hand after covering with mulch irrigation water can only flow into corn growth porosity and the bare area between film mulching at this time the soil water potential under plastic film mulching is definitely higher than that of no film mulching li et al 2021 so plastic film mulching was more likely to increase water leakage after irrigation on the other hand plastic film may weaken the direct exchange between the soil and the atmosphere thereby significantly reducing the evaporation of surface soil moisture yang et al 2015 water vapor that evaporates from the soil under the mulch will accumulate on the surface soil or adhere to the mulch thereby increasing the moisture of the surface soil this assists in increasing the effective duration of irrigation water on the surface soil in the 60 100 cm soil layer evaporation becomes weak and the distribution of corn roots in this soil layer is also less and it is not easy to form a large pore flow in addition the slop and softness of the terrain affected the contribution of the inlet water to the soil water studies found that the average residence time of soil water in a 1 m soil profile with a gentle catchment is 0 4 4 months while the average residence time in a steep catchment area is only 4 27 d mcguire et al 2002 our test field is located in a small oasis basin compared with sloping land irrigation water will remain in the farmland after input and it has not been easy to form runoff which increases the replenishment time for shallow soil 5 2 migration of irrigation water in the soil our research has revealed that soil water isotopes temporal and spatial changes in farmland are the result of the interaction between artificial irrigation and evaporation before irrigation evaporation is the main driving force of soil moisture changes and it is particularly evident in the topsoil sprenger et al 2017 gazis and feng 2004 tang and feng 2001 tian et al 2002 after irrigation water enters the soil the difference in the evaporation intensity of different soil layers the push of plug flow to water and the ubiquitous preferential flow in the soil are the main factors to explain the isotope changes of the soil profile renshaw et al 2003 kortelainen and karhu 2004 the difference in lc excess between soil layers is a clear evaporation signal sprenger et al 2016a mccutcheon et al 2017 the arid environment causes the topsoil isotope have strong evaporation signals and pushes the evaporation signals to move to the middle and lower soil layers before irrigation the lc excess of 0 5 cm soil water was the smallest lc excess 20 and the most concentrated evaporation overall soil water isotope fractionation is relatively stable after the irrigation water was input the mixing of new water and old water caused the isotopes to be depleted quickly thereby losing the fractionation signal and increasing the isotopic variability in the soil profile in the irrigation process plug flow and preferential flow coexisted and the two interacted to complete the replacement of water fig 6 plug flow is the complete mixing of water with shallow free water after passing through the soil matrix under the action of plug flow the input water infiltrates along the hydraulic gradient pushing the original soil pore water to flow downward xiang et al 2020 gazis and feng 2004 in the preferential flow the external input water rapidly enters the shallow soil through the large soil holes and forms deep leaks tang and feng 2001 gazis and feng 2004 in unsaturated soils preferential flow dominates when the water content is low or non existent padilla et al 1999 the changes in soil water isotope in farmland correspond to irrigation which further confirms that a part of irrigation water can penetrate the middle and lower part of soil quickly through preferential flow tian et al 2002 as the main source of replenishment in our research irrigation water could reach a soil layer less than 100 cm and effectively replace old water in the farmland soil 5 3 enlightenment to farmland management strategies in arid areas the isotope method was used to analyze the migration and replenishment of irrigation water in the soil and it was found that the infiltration depth of single irrigation water exceeds the depth of water absorption by crop roots in farmland in arid oasis areas maximum maize root depth seedling stage 20 cm jointing period 40 cm heading period 60 cm grouting period 80 cm maturation period 90 cm extensive irrigation mode overflow irrigation is inefficient which causes the residual toxic and harmful substances in agricultural production to migrate with water to the deep soil resulting in groundwater pollution x li et al 2017 z li et al 2017 zhao and chang 2014 a scientifically effective irrigation scheme should aim to replenish water deficits in the root zone while minimizing leaching in this depth zhang et al 2014 bourazanis et al 2015 therefore the accurate assessment of soil moisture balance components irrigation drainage and evapotranspiration is essential to improve oasis farmland irrigation management strategies m li et al 2019 z li et al 2019 the root system of corn is mostly distributed within 60 cm and under the traditional flood irrigation method the effective contribution time of irrigation water to the middle and upper soil water is shorter this will lead to a serious waste of agricultural water resources the cost of a drip irrigation system is high and when drip irrigation is performed on soil with high salt content the salt will accumulate on the edge of the wet area in the precipitation event the salt will be washed into the root area of the crop without being diluted which will damage the plant s roots under film mulched drip irrigation which combines the advantages of drip irrigation technology and mulching technology can effectively solve the above problems m li et al 2019 z li et al 2019 ning et al 2021 drip irrigation only wets the crop root development area which is a form of local irrigation since the drip intensity is less than the soil s infiltration rate it will not form runoff to harden the soil under film mulched drip irrigation has a small amount of drip water and can make the limited water in the soil circulate between the soil and the mulch reducing the evaporation of crops covering with mulch can also turn small ineffective rainfall into effective rainfall and improve the utilization rate of natural rainfall in addition drip irrigation strips have replaced country water transport ditches reducing evaporation and unnecessary leakage during water transport arid oasis is a unique ecosystem in a state of delicate ecological hydrological balance liu et al 2015 based on ensuring food security reducing water consumption to improve water resource utilization efficiency and reducing groundwater pollution formulating an effective irrigation plan is necessary for realizing regional sustainable agricultural development zhang al et al 2014 6 conclusion our research monitored the dynamic changes of soil water isotope and its water content in the minqin oasis during the irrigation period estimated the contribution rate of irrigation water to different soil layers for 5 days after irrigation and discussed the effective contribution time and its influencing factors in the farmland of minqin oasis the contribution rate of irrigation water to different soil layers is different within 5 days after irrigation the average contribution rate from irrigation at 0 20 cm 20 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers was 31 11 17 74 19 17 12 72 and 31 56 12 42 respectively irrigation water contributes relatively light to the 20 60 cm soil layer soil water content topography and plastic film cover are important factors which affect the effective contribution time of irrigation water the 0 20 cm soil layer peaks on the first day after irrigation with an effective contribution time of more than 5 d the 20 60 cm soil layer reached its peak on the second day after irrigation and the effective contribution time was only 4 d the peak of the contribution of irrigation water to the 60 100 cm soil layer appeared on the third day and the effective contribution time was longer than that of the upper middle layer as the primary source of replenishment in our research irrigation water could reach a soil layer less than 1 m and effectively replace the old water in the farmland soil the research results will help understand the process of soil moisture infiltration and replenishment after irrigation of farmland in arid oasis areas and provide a scientific basis for agricultural operators to plan irrigation schemes rationally credit authorship

9852,the transmission of water through soil is one of the critical links to reflect the hydrological process at present there are controversies about the infiltration of farmland irrigation water and the replacement of old and new water in arid areas which significantly reduces the scientific nature of the irrigation policy formulation in this study we monitored the temporal and spatial changes of stable isotopes of soil water in minqin oasis farmland analyzed the infiltration process of irrigation water used the mixsiar isotope mixture model to estimate the contribution of irrigation water to soil water and evaluated their effective contribution time to different soil layers this study suggests that the temporal and spatial changes in pore water isotope reflect the process of artificial irrigation and evaporation within 5 days after irrigation the average contribution rate of irrigation at 0 20 cm 20 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers was 31 11 17 74 19 17 12 72 and 31 56 12 42 respectively under the influence of soil water content topography and plastic film cover the effective contribution time of irrigation water to 0 20 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers was more than 5 d and the effective contribution time to the 60 100 cm soil layer is only 4 d the research results will help understand the hydrological process of farmland in the arid oasis area and provide a scientific basis for improving agricultural irrigation mode which will help realize the sustainable development of regional agriculture keywords arid oasis area irrigation water stable isotope contribution rate effective contribution time 1 introduction as an essential part of the hydrological cycle shallow soil water is the primary water source for most plants pan et al 2020 and a solvent for many nutrients gazis and feng 2004 in the ecosystem whether it is natural precipitation or artificial irrigation water it can only provide the water needed for crop growth after being converted into soil water yamanaka 2004 beyer and dubbert 2019 the replacement of old and new water caused by water infiltration has always been a hot topic in soil hydrology in any soil hydrological system plug and preferential flow are coexistent infiltration methods dusek et al 2012 under plug flow the input water infiltrates along the hydraulic gradient forcing the original soil pore water to flow downwards in this process new and old water is often mixed xiang et al 2020 as a widespread form of water and solute transport in field soil preferential flow exists widely throughout the soil layer the preferential flow path is generally soil macropores caused by cracks rotting plant roots rocks etc dusek et al 2012 gazis and feng 2004 at this time a large amount of water input often causes solutes to quickly migrate down the preferential flow path which may cause groundwater pollution klaus et al 2013 in natural soil soil macropores soil structure soil texture soil water content soil initial water content the application rate of water and solute and solute application method are important factors affecting water infiltration liu et al 2015 x li et al 2017 z li et al 2017 jačka et al 2021 in contrast farmland soil is more disturbed by human activities under the same irrigation system irrigation and rainfall in film mulching treatment can only flow into corn growth porosity and the bare area between film mulching at this time the soil water potential under plastic film mulching is higher than that of no film mulching li et al 2021 sintim et al 2021 so plastic film mulching was more likely to increase water leakage after irrigation in addition high intensity artificial irrigation will inevitably lead to more preferential flows in arid oasis areas m li et al 2019 z li et al 2019 the stable isotope has the functions of tracing integrating and indicating to the research object and can more accurately record the process information of infiltration evaporation transpiration and mixing in various water bodies it is a powerful tool for exploring hydrogeological processes and characteristics barnes and allison 1988 zhu et al 2019 wenninger et al 2010 seasonal changes in

hydrological analysis to obtain soil water infiltration process stumpp and maloszewski 2010 residence time liu et al 2015 and update rate hu et al 2015 it is also used to model preferential flow paths

total water resources water shortage is the most important limiting factor for agriculture in arid regions wang et al 2018 we monitored the soil moisture after each irrigation event in minqin oasis in 2019 to further understand the infiltration process and replenishment mechanism of irrigation water in the unsaturated zone of farmland soil in an arid oasis area we proposed the following research goals i the contribution and effective contribution time of irrigation water to the soil moisture of farmland ii the infiltration of irrigation water in the soil reflected by the isotope of pore water 2 study sites 2 1 overview of the study area minqin oasis 38 27 10 39 06 53 n 102 53 16 103 49 00 e is located in the eastern end of hexi corridor and the lower reaches of shiyang river basin surrounded by badain jaran desert and tenge desert in the west north and east minqin oasis is formed under shiyang river s nourishment are 206 km east west and 156 km north south fig 1 it is a typical continental climate with intense solar radiation long sunshine hours and a large temperature difference between day and night sparse precipitation 113 2 mm per year and strong evaporation 2675 6 mm per year which is one of the regions with the most severe water resources shortage and sand storm hazards in the world the formation process of oasis soil was affected by parent material and soluble salts accumulate natural soil includes gray brown desert soil aeolian sandy soil saline soil and meadow soil cultivated soil is mainly irrigated silt soil which evolved under the effects of long term cultivation irrigation and fertilization the minqin area has little precipitation and surface water and groundwater are the keys to the oasis s existence the only external surface runoff is the shiyang river which originates from the qilian mountains and its main replenishment sources are alpine snow meltwater and atmospheric precipitation 2 2 overview of the experiment station the experiment station is located in beidong village 38 47 29 n 103 13 52 e datan township in the middle of minqin oasis the experiment field is 67 m long and 26 m wide surrounded by roads irrigation canals and ridges the changes in temperature relative humidity precipitation and irrigation volume during the experimental station s growth period in 2019 are shown in fig 2 during the corn growing period there were 6 irrigations in total the irrigation water source was underground well water and the irrigation mode was surface flooding we used the hzqp d ic card intelligent water distribution terminal to monitor the irrigation water volume during the irrigation process the experiment field is covered with plastic film width 115 cm thickness 0 012 mm at 40 cm intervals the original width of the plastic film is 140 cm we took approximately 12 5 cm from the left and right sides of the plastic film and bury it in the soil 3 data and methods 3 1 sample collection this study collected soil

for each soil layer put three of them into a 50 ml glass bottle sealed the bottle with parafilm wrote down the sampling date and depth on the bottle and then frozen and stored until experimental isotope analysis put another parallel sample in an aluminum box and store it for soil moisture content determination immediately after each irrigation or precipitation event irrigation water and rainwater samples were transferred to an 80 ml high density polyethylene sample bottle sealed with a parafilm membrane and then frozen and stored until the experimental analysis 3 2 sample analysis sample analysis processing and determination were all completed in the isotope laboratory of the college of geography and environmental science northwest normal university water from the soil was extracted using an li 2100 fully automated cryogenic vacuum extraction system all water samples were analyzed using a dlt 100 liquid water isotope analyzer developed by los gatos research usa during the analysis each water sample and isotope standard sample was injected consecutively 6 times in order to avoid the memory effect of isotope analysis we discarded the values of the first two injections and used the average value of the last four injections as the final value the analysis is expressed as a thousandth of the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow 1 δ r sample r standard 1 1000 in the formula r sampleis the ratio of 18o 16o or 2h 1h in the sample and r standard is the ratio of 18o 16o or 2h 1h in v smow the standard error of measurement is 0 6 for δ 2h and 0 2 for δ 18o respectively 3 3 meteorological data the automatic weather station watchdog 2000 series weather stations set up near the sample site was used to obtain and record the local temperature and relative humidity and other meteorological data during the sampling period 3 4 lc excess the linear relationship between δ 2h and δ 18o in precipitation and soil water is defined as the lmwl local meteoric water line and swl soil waterline respectively the lc excess in different water bodies can characterize the evaporation index of different water bodies relative to local precipitation landwehr and coplen 2006 landwehr et al 2014 2 lc excess δ 2 h a δ 2 h b where a and b are the slope and intercept of lmwl respectively δ 2h and δ 18o are the hydrogen and oxygen isotope values in the sample based on the isotope analysis s precision and the slope of the lmwl the lc excess of soil water and rainfall was derived and their uncertainty was estimated to be 2 27 3 5 mixsiar model the mixsiar isotope mixture model based on bayesian theory was used to identify the water source of soil water and quantify the contribution ratio f of different water sources stock and semmens 2013 the bayesian mixing models have advantages over simple linear mixing models in estimating probability distributions of source contributions which combines multiple sources of uncertainty isotopic characteristics and isotopic fractionation in this study the underground water level is 26 m far beyond the groundwater evaporation limit in addition the minqin oasis had very little rainwater the strong surface evaporation made most of the rainwater evaporate quickly after falling on the surface of the mulch and only a small amount of water entered the soil to mix with the original pore water therefore groundwater and rainwater were not considered as the water source of soil water in this study soil water mainly comes from irrigation water soil water in the previous layer and early soil water in the mixsiar model the markov chain monte carlo mcmc running step length was very long and the model error was selected from process residual after running the mixsiar we conducted a check diagnostic according to stock and semmens 2013 for confirming the validity of the result stock and semmens 2016 4 results 4 1 temporal variation of soil water isotope in farmland during the 6 irrigation events the average values of δ 2h and δ 18o of soil water were 67 35 5 90 93 07 to 54 73 and 9 02 1 06 13 13 to 5 19 table 1 the slope and intercept of swl were smaller than lmwl indicating that input water entered the soil and was affected by evaporation making the soil water isotope enriched most of the soil water isotope values fell on the lower right of the irrigation water confirming that artificial irrigation was the main source of soil water replenishment the study compared 6 irrigation events with different input water volumes i1 112 mm i2 90 6 mm i3 92 1 mm i4 94 7 mm i5 94 7 mm i6 92 6 mm according to dunn s test results the soil isotope 2h and 18o was significantly different from other irrigations after the fifth irrigation there was little difference in the amount of input water during each irrigation process and it had no obvious correlation with the isotope value the amount of irrigation water didn t affect the enrichment and depletion of the isotope value fig 3a the water in the soil pores underwent a renewal process before and after the irrigation event we further compared the similarities and differences of soil isotope in the period before and after irrigation the results showed that the soil water isotope values 2h and 18o were significantly different between the 1 3 days after the irrigation water input and before the irrigation by the fourth day this difference ceased to exist after irrigation the input water was mixed with the original water in the soil pores making the latter have the former s isotopic characteristics and deplete which is especially obvious in shallow soils after the irrigation was completed the dynamic fractionation of isotopes was caused by the soil pore water s evaporation the isotopic composition gradually returned to the state before irrigation after the fourth day fig 3b 4 2 spatial variation of soil water isotope we can observe clear signals of irrigation water input in the soil water isotope profile fig 4 the arid environment caused fractionation of soil moisture that had not been input by precipitation or irrigation water at that time the isotope values in the topsoil pores were significantly enriched and the swlc excess was still negative at 80 cm after the irrigation start the isotopes of irrigation water were significantly smaller than those of shallow soil water so water infiltration and mixing depleted the surface soil water isotopes and weakened the evaporation signal as the water continued to penetrate the soil in the middle and lower parts was also affected after we stop irrigation the soil moisture penetrates the deep soil 60 100 cm at this time the evaporation effect is smaller and the isotope value is more depleted due to the arid environment the isotope fractionation of middle and upper soil water gradually appeared and the light isotope fractionation in the surface soil water made heavy isotopes quickly enriched on the surface as time went by the fractionation signal swlc excess gradually went to the lower layer of soil and the isotope value of soil pore water gradually returned to the level before irrigation the change of gwc in soil pores is the most intuitive manifestation of water infiltration when irrigation occurred with water input the gwc content s growth in the gaps at different soil depths was different at different infiltration stages the topsoil first received irrigation water and became moist at that time the change range of gwc would be reduced in each soil layer when the water completely penetrated the underlying soil s pores the newly input water would mix with the original soil pore water causing the gwc to reach the peak value we could observe this phenomenon in every irrigation process it often occurred on the second or third day after irrigation after the gwc reached its peak part of the water continued to infiltrate to cause deep leakage and the other part of the water became vapor into the atmosphere due to evapotranspiration 4 3 contribution of irrigation water to water in soil profiles based on changes in soil water isotope we estimated the contribution of irrigation water to soil moisture five days after the event fig 5 from one day to five days after the event the average contribution f of irrigation water to soil water within 1 m was 33 98 16 76 32 59 8 71 34 29 15 51 19 93 8 74 and 13 86 9 66 to understand the migration of irrigation water in the soil layer more clearly we divided the 1 m soil layer into 3 layers shallow layer 0 20 cm middle layer 20 60 cm deep layer 60 100 cm on the first day after the irrigation event the 0 20 cm soil layer reached the peak contribution 59 53 3 73 in the five consecutive days the contribution f of irrigation water to the soil layer was greater than 10 the 20 60 cm soil layer reached the peak contribution 34 25 10 69 on the second day after irrigation from the fifth day the contribution f of irrigation water to this layer of soil water was less than 10 the peak contribution of irrigation water to the 60 100 cm soil layer appeared on the third day 50 55 11 87 overall within five days after irrigation the average contribution rate of irrigation water to 0 20 cm 20 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers is 31 11 17 74 19 17 12 72 and 31 56 12 42 respectively the contribution of irrigation water to 20 60 cm soil is relatively small 5 discussion 5 1 effective contribution time of irrigation water to soil water 5 1 1 effective contribution time of irrigation water unlike natural soil farmland is easily disturbed by human activities such as farming and irrigation altering the water supply to the soil in this research when the irrigation contribution rate is less than 5 in the model calculation on a certain day after irrigation the contribution of this irrigation event disappears from the soil moisture the time that irrigation water contributed to the different soil layers of agricultural land was different after the irrigation event the average contribution of the 0 20 cm soil layer exceeded 10 on the fifth day after irrigation which means that irrigation water s contribution to soil water still existed after 5 d the 20 60 cm soil layer s contribution rate on the fifth day was less than 5 and the effective contribution time of irrigation water to this layer of soil water was only 4 d on the fifth day the average contribution rate of the 60 100 cm soil layer was greater than that of the 0 20 cm and 20 60 cm soil layers it is reasonable to believe that the contribution of irrigation water to the soil layer will continue and that the soil layer s effective contribution time will be longer table 2 5 1 2 the main factors affecting the effective contribution time of irrigation water the time during which irrigation water actually contributes is affected by natural conditions and human activities preferential flow is a common form of water and solute transportation in farmland soil which changes the effective contribution of irrigation water to soil water by affecting the hydrological transport of soil water gazis and feng 2004 our research was in an extremely arid environment the average soil water content was much lower than the saturated water content and excessive water input would cause the rapid movement of soil water padilla et al 1999 compared with the vertical push type seepage method the preferential flow of macropores quickly seeps through the soil matrix to the deep soil shortening the contribution of input water to the middle and upper soil although the effective contribution time of 0 20 cm soil layer irrigation water was more than 5 d its contribution rate had become lower the use of plastic film to cover the topsoil in arid areas allows for the purpose of cooling and hydration and interferes with water infiltration on the one hand after covering with mulch irrigation water can only flow into corn growth porosity and the bare area between film mulching at this time the soil water potential under plastic film mulching is definitely higher than that of no film mulching li et al 2021 so plastic film mulching was more likely to increase water leakage after irrigation on the other hand plastic film may weaken the direct exchange between the soil and the atmosphere thereby significantly reducing the evaporation of surface soil moisture yang et al 2015 water vapor that evaporates from the soil under the mulch will accumulate on the surface soil or adhere to the mulch thereby increasing the moisture of the surface soil this assists in increasing the effective duration of irrigation water on the surface soil in the 60 100 cm soil layer evaporation becomes weak and the distribution of corn roots in this soil layer is also less and it is not easy to form a large pore flow in addition the slop and softness of the terrain affected the contribution of the inlet water to the soil water studies found that the average residence time of soil water in a 1 m soil profile with a gentle catchment is 0 4 4 months while the average residence time in a steep catchment area is only 4 27 d mcguire et al 2002 our test field is located in a small oasis basin compared with sloping land irrigation water will remain in the farmland after input and it has not been easy to form runoff which increases the replenishment time for shallow soil 5 2 migration of irrigation water in the soil our research has revealed that soil water isotopes temporal and spatial changes in farmland are the result of the interaction between artificial irrigation and evaporation before irrigation evaporation is the main driving force of soil moisture changes and it is particularly evident in the topsoil sprenger et al 2017 gazis and feng 2004 tang and feng 2001 tian et al 2002 after irrigation water enters the soil the difference in the evaporation intensity of different soil layers the push of plug flow to water and the ubiquitous preferential flow in the soil are the main factors to explain the isotope changes of the soil profile renshaw et al 2003 kortelainen and karhu 2004 the difference in lc excess between soil layers is a clear evaporation signal sprenger et al 2016a mccutcheon et al 2017 the arid environment causes the topsoil isotope have strong evaporation signals and pushes the evaporation signals to move to the middle and lower soil layers before irrigation the lc excess of 0 5 cm soil water was the smallest lc excess 20 and the most concentrated evaporation overall soil water isotope fractionation is relatively stable after the irrigation water was input the mixing of new water and old water caused the isotopes to be depleted quickly thereby losing the fractionation signal and increasing the isotopic variability in the soil profile in the irrigation process plug flow and preferential flow coexisted and the two interacted to complete the replacement of water fig 6 plug flow is the complete mixing of water with shallow free water after passing through the soil matrix under the action of plug flow the input water infiltrates along the hydraulic gradient pushing the original soil pore water to flow downward xiang et al 2020 gazis and feng 2004 in the preferential flow the external input water rapidly enters the shallow soil through the large soil holes and forms deep leaks tang and feng 2001 gazis and feng 2004 in unsaturated soils preferential flow dominates when the water content is low or non existent padilla et al 1999 the changes in soil water isotope in farmland correspond to irrigation which further confirms that a part of irrigation water can penetrate the middle and lower part of soil quickly through preferential flow tian et al 2002 as the main source of replenishment in our research irrigation water could reach a soil layer less than 100 cm and effectively replace old water in the farmland soil 5 3 enlightenment to farmland management strategies in arid areas the isotope method was used to analyze the migration and replenishment of irrigation water in the soil and it was found that the infiltration depth of single irrigation water exceeds the depth of water absorption by crop roots in farmland in arid oasis areas maximum maize root depth seedling stage 20 cm jointing period 40 cm heading period 60 cm grouting period 80 cm maturation period 90 cm extensive irrigation mode overflow irrigation is inefficient which causes the residual toxic and harmful substances in agricultural production to migrate with water to the deep soil resulting in groundwater pollution x li et al 2017 z li et al 2017 zhao and chang 2014 a scientifically effective irrigation scheme should aim to replenish water deficits in the root zone while minimizing leaching in this depth zhang et al 2014 bourazanis et al 2015 therefore the accurate assessment of soil moisture balance components irrigation drainage and evapotranspiration is essential to improve oasis farmland irrigation management strategies m li et al 2019 z li et al 2019 the root system of corn is mostly distributed within 60 cm and under the traditional flood irrigation method the effective contribution time of irrigation water to the middle and upper soil water is shorter this will lead to a serious waste of agricultural water resources the cost of a drip irrigation system is high and when drip irrigation is performed on soil with high salt content the salt will accumulate on the edge of the wet area in the precipitation event the salt will be washed into the root area of the crop without being diluted which will damage the plant s roots under film mulched drip irrigation which combines the advantages of drip irrigation technology and mulching technology can effectively solve the above problems m li et al 2019 z li et al 2019 ning et al 2021 drip irrigation only wets the crop root development area which is a form of local irrigation since the drip intensity is less than the soil s infiltration rate it will not form runoff to harden the soil under film mulched drip irrigation has a small amount of drip water and can make the limited water in the soil circulate between the soil and the mulch reducing the evaporation of crops covering with mulch can also turn small ineffective rainfall into effective rainfall and improve the utilization rate of natural rainfall in addition drip irrigation strips have replaced country water transport ditches reducing evaporation and unnecessary leakage during water transport arid oasis is a unique ecosystem in a state of delicate ecological hydrological balance liu et al 2015 based on ensuring food security reducing water consumption to improve water resource utilization efficiency and reducing groundwater pollution formulating an effective irrigation plan is necessary for realizing regional sustainable agricultural development zhang al et al 2014 6 conclusion our research monitored the dynamic changes of soil water isotope and its water content in the minqin oasis during the irrigation period estimated the contribution rate of irrigation water to different soil layers for 5 days after irrigation and discussed the effective contribution time and its influencing factors in the farmland of minqin oasis the contribution rate of irrigation water to different soil layers is different within 5 days after irrigation the average contribution rate from irrigation at 0 20 cm 20 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers was 31 11 17 74 19 17 12 72 and 31 56 12 42 respectively irrigation water contributes relatively light to the 20 60 cm soil layer soil water content topography and plastic film cover are important factors which affect the effective contribution time of irrigation water the 0 20 cm soil layer peaks on the first day after irrigation with an effective contribution time of more than 5 d the 20 60 cm soil layer reached its peak on the second day after irrigation and the effective contribution time was only 4 d the peak of the contribution of irrigation water to the 60 100 cm soil layer appeared on the third day and the effective contribution time was longer than that of the upper middle layer as the primary source of replenishment in our research irrigation water could reach a soil layer less than 1 m and effectively replace the old water in the farmland soil the research results will help understand the process of soil moisture infiltration and replenishment after irrigation of farmland in arid oasis areas and provide a scientific basis for agricultural operators to plan irrigation schemes rationally credit authorship

9853,the consumption of nutrient solution is very important in the production of vegetables especially tomatoes in this study the effect of two hydroponic systems on yield components nutrient solution efficiency and stomatal gas exchanges of two greenhouse tomato cultivars have been investigated this experiment is in the form of split plots in a randomized complete block design with the treatment of tomato cultivars v4 22 and amira and type of hydroponic cultivation system open and closed in which 3 replicates were implemented at shahid chamran university of ahvaz the studied traits included crop yield fruit number fruit weight cluster weight nutrient solution efficiency and stomatal gas exchanges net photosynthesis rate stomatal conductance transpiration rate intercellular co2 concentration and leaf temperature the results showed that the effect of the hydroponic system had a significant effect on the efficiency rate of nutrient solution usage the number of fruits the weight of the third fourth and sixth cluster stomatal conductance transpiration rate and leaf temperature the highest number of fruits stomatal conductance transpiration rate and leaf temperature were measured in the open hydroponic system the highest and lowest rate of water productivity performance were obtained in the closed system 33 70 kg m3 and open system 21 84 kg m3 respectively the closed system increased water productivity for yield and biomass by 54 3 and 42 respectively as compared to the open system whatsmore the highest and lowest water productivity per biomass were obtained in the closed system 48 91 kg m3 and open system 34 42 kg m3 respectively tomato cultivars had significant differences in crop yield the highest and lowest crop yields were measured in v4 22 cultivar 3874 29 g per plant and amira cultivar 3648 70 g per plant respectively based on the results the closed hydroponic system was superior in terms of water and fertilizer saving without a significant effect on crop yield due to the reduction of nutrient solution consumption up to 96 and fertilizer consumption up to 97 keywords gas exchange water productivity hydroponics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global population growth has increased the need for food production especially in the agricultural sector significantly albaji et al 2014 neissi et al 2020 since agriculture is among one of the sectors that consume the most water this increase in production could have an adverse effect on water resources therefore necessary measures should be taken to improve crop water productivity and current production systems in agriculture atzori et al 2019 water resources can be used more efficiently through the production of greenhouse crops because there is better control of environmental conditions for crop production rosa rodriguez et al 2020 the highest yield of tomatoes is produced per unit area in hydroponic cultivation moreover it reduces the amount of water and fertilizer consumed thus significantly increasing the crop water productivity zhang et al 2016 rodriguez jurado et al 2020 in a study examined several crops tomatoes cucumbers and lettuce in three hydroponic systems open soil and closed reported open and closed hydroponic systems and found them to have no significant difference in yield performance the most efficient water consumption system was the closed hydroponic system with water consumption savings of 55 69 as compared to the open system rosa rodriguez et al 2020 in a study compared the nutrient solution efficiency in closed and open hydroponic systems in tomato production and concluded that the efficiency of water and fertilizer consumption was higher in a closed system in as such that such a system produces 13 5 kg more fruits per cubic meter of water than an open system rufi salis et al 2020 in a study on nutrient recycling of closed hydroponic cultivation systems in green pea production concluded that closed hydroponic systems reduce water consumption by 40 and nutrient consumption by 35 54 daily mendez cifuentes et al 2020 in a study on open and closed hydroponic cultivation systems concluded that to produce 1 kg of tomatoes in an open system 53 l of a nutrient solution and in a closed system 22 l of a nutrient solution are used and the open system had 9 5 higher yield and consumed 86 more water rodriguez ortega et al 2019 in a study of three hydroponic cultivation systems deep flow technique perlite nutrient film technique concluded that crop water productivity was higher for tomato plants which are grown using a nutrient film technique whereas the highest yield was obtained in the open system katsoulas et al 2013 compared three hydroponic cultivation systems open system closed system semi closed system in a greenhouse tomato crop and concluded that the closed system was the most effective in minimizing nutrient solution drainage in hydroponic systems thus maximizing water usage productivity grewal et al 2011 in a study on the efficiency of the nutrient solution in closed hydroponic systems for a greenhouse cucumber crop concluded that water recycling reduces the amount of water used for cucumber production by 33 maboko et al 2011 in their study on the yield of 4 tomato cultivars in open and closed hydroponic systems reported that there is a difference in the yield and the amount of fruit that can be sold in open and closed systems moreover they observed that the nutrient solution efficiency in the closed system is higher de souza et al 2020 in a study on the efficiency of a nutrient solution in a nutrient film technique system and its effect on the growth and development of watercress observed that by increasing the concentration of the nutrient solution the rate of photosynthesis stomatal conductance and transpiration rate would be reduced in another study the ecological characteristics of pepper plants in both hydroponic and aquaponic cultivation systems were investigated they concluded that the rate of photosynthesis stomatal conductance transpiration and crop water productivity were higher in the aquaponic treatment sajadinia et al 2009 the innovation of this research is the use of integration of several combined irrigation systems included drip irrigation system aeroponics system wick system and deep water culture system the combination of these systems in a closed system has been proposed as a new method in hydroponics its benefits include the main advantages of the closed systems over the open ones are the reduction in water and nutrient loss to the environment resulting in better water productivity and the closed hydroponic cultivation system has water productivity up to 96 and nutrients up to 97 as compared to the open hydroponic system in a closed system the solution is continually moving there is very little short term variation in salinity it is possible therefore to grow plants in much higher salinity to increase fruit quality closed systems use minimal substrate so the problem of pollution of the environment from its disposal is also reduced this provides good contact between the recirculating solution and air which is sufficient to maintain the oxygen level required by the roots without additional aeration of the solution in the closed system irrigation was done by gravity and there was no need to use an electric pump irrigation by a set of these systems causes if one of the irrigation methods in the closed system is disturbed during the cultivation period the other method of irrigation will compensate for this problem the closed system as described presents several advantages over other hydroponic nutrient delivery system options therefore the purpose of the current study was to investigate the effect of open and closed hydroponic systems on yield components water usage productivity and the gas exchange after the inaugurating of two greenhouse tomato cultivars in the shahid chamran university of ahvaz 2 materials and methods this experiment was done as split plot design based on completely randomized block design with three 3 replications at shahid chamran university of ahvaz the two hydroponic systems open and close and two cultivars v4 22 and amira were treatments the parameters such as yield components nutrient solution efficiency and stomatal gas exchange were measured during and end of the experiment an experiment was conducted in autumn 2019 at latitude 31 20 n and longitude 48 41 e with an elevation of 22 m tomato seeds were planted in the planting tray on september 23 2019 and the seedlings were transferred to open and closed hydroponic systems on october 20 2019 the amira cultivar was bred in the netherlands and procured from sepahan royesh isfahan company representative of rijk zwaan company in the netherlands the v4 22 cultivar was bred in the shahid chamran university of ahvaz in the closed hydroponic system the nutrient solution had a constant volume in the pots and flowed consistently during the day and night during the culture period the nutrient solution was recycled and reused in the closed system by adjusting the electrical conductivity in the reported range in the open hydroponic system the nutrient solution was transferred to the plant by pipes and drippers using a digital timer irrigation started from the beginning of the project with 150 cc per day for each plant in the open hydroponic system and by the end this amount reached 1800 cc per day for each plant the dripper flow was adjusted to 100 cc min in the open hydroponic system in the open hydroponic system during the production stage on average 18 20 irrigations per day were applied in each pot one emitter 6 l h 1 was installed the culture medium in the open hydroponic system was 50 cocopeat 50 perlite however the closed hydroponic system was without any culture medium in both hydroponic systems the pots were placed in rows at 100 cm apart with a spacing of 25 cm between each pot in a row fig 1 a resh nutrient solution was used to feed the plants resh 2013 table 1 after preparing the nutrient solution the ec and ph of the nutrient solution in both the closed and the open hydroponic system were measured using a manual digital conductivity meter and a ph meter the ec of the nutrient solution was adjusted to 3 2 ds m 1 in the open system and ranged from 1 6 to 4 6 ds m 1 in the closed system after resetting the ec of the nutrient solution in the closed hydroponic system the ph of the nutrient solution was measured and adjusted using h2so4 or naoh in the range of 5 5 6 5 as required greenhouse temperature and humidity were recorded using a digital thermometer from the time of seedling transfer fig 2 3 measured variables 3 1 yield compounds yield compounds included fruit number fruit weight clusters weight and total yield were investigated in this study in the current study by aggregating the weight of healthy and marketable fruits above 70 g and without damage packaged and sent to the consumer market the yield of marketable fruits was determined the number of fruits were counted weekly and were calculated cumulatively 3 2 volume of applied solution the amount of nutrient solution consumed in the closed hydroponic system from the first day after transplanting to the end of the growing season was calculated daily using a volumetric meter in the open hydroponic system in order to determine the nutrient solution consumed the volume of water drained from the pots was recorded daily and reported as a percentage value 3 3 water productivity to determine the water productivity per yield the relationship between the production weight of fruits obtained in kilograms during the entire cycle in both the open and the closed hydroponics systems was obtained as well as the amount of water applied during the entire cycle in m 3 to calculate these values the researchers used the below equation rosa rodriguez et al 2020 1 water productivity kilograms of fruits cubic meters applied water productivity per biomass in the open and the closed hydroponic system was obtained from the ratio of total crop yield kg and plant biomass kg to water applied cubic meters hooshmand et al 2019 2 water productivity biomass y b w water productivity biomass kg m3 y crop yield kg b plant biomass

marques et al 2020 3 6 statistical analysis statistical analyzes were performed using mstat c analysis of variance and spss correlation between trait software and graphs were drawn by excel software 4 results and discussion 4 1 number of fruits the effect of hydroponic system on the number of fruits had a significant difference at a level of 5 while the effect of cultivar and the interaction of the hydroponic system and the cultivar did not differ significantly although the hydroponic systems had a significant difference in terms of fruit formation from day 99 until the end of the experiment the fruit formation process in the two hydroponic systems from initial fruit formation to day 99 did not have a significant difference fig 3 the findings of the current research was consistant with the results of lennard and leonard 2006 schmautz et al 2016 ahmad khan et al 2017 and shongwe et al 2019 these studies reported that by increasing the concentration of the nutrient solution within the optimal range of tomato production reduces the number of fruits in a closed hydroponic system but does not have a significant difference in terms of yield while if the concentration of the nutrient solution exceeds the optimal range it will reduce the crop yield plants in a closed system have more severe osmotic conditions this in itself reduces the number of fruits in such a system if this increase in nutrient solution concentration is in the proper range for tomato production the number of fruits will decrease without a significant effect on yield but if this increase is too high it will significantly reduce crop yield rodriguez ortega et al 2019 4 2 fruit weight the effect of hydroponic system on the fruit weight of the third fourth and sixth cluster of tomato plants was significantly different at the level of 5 table 6 the effect of cultivar and the interaction of the hydroponic system and cultivar on fruit weight did not show a significant difference the highest fruit weight was obtained in the third cluster open system 99 49 g the fourth cluster closed system 89 40 g and the sixth cluster open system 99 44 g and the lowest fruit weight was obtained in the third cluster closed system 90 76 g the fourth cluster open system 86 31 g and the sixth cluster closed system 99 44 g in general the fruit weight in the open system was higher than the closed system was due to the greater and continuous availability of water in this hydroponic system valenzano et al 2008 stomatal conductance had a positive and significant correlation with fruit weight 0 62 the results showed that during fruit growth a decrease in stomatal conductance occurs due to the increasing of the concentration of the nutrient solution in the closed hydroponic system which in itself reduces fruit weight and yield nemeskeri et al 2019 4 3 cluster weight the effect of the hydroponic system on the yield of the fourth and fifth clusters had a significant difference at a 5 level table 6 the effect of the interaction of the hydroponic system and cultivar on the weight of the first and second clusters of tomato plants showed a significant difference at a 1 level while it had no effect on other clusters the effect of the cultivar on cluster weight did not show a significant difference the highest weight of the fourth cluster 618 08 g and the fifth cluster 511 08 g were measured in the open system and the lowest weight of the fourth cluster 401 33 g and the fifth cluster 356 33 g in the closed system were also measured table 2 the highest and lowest weights of the first cluster were obtained in v4 22 cultivar in the closed hydroponic system 634 16 g and in the amira cultivar in the closed hydroponic system 496 66 g respectively table 2 the highest and lowest weight of the second cluster was obtained in the v4 22 cultivar in the open hydroponic system 460 16 g and in the amira cultivar in the open hydroponic system 361 00 g respectively table 2 4 4 yield based on the results of the analysis of variance table 6 the effect of the cultivar on tomato plant yield showed a significant difference at a 5 level however the treatment of the hydroponic system and their interaction was not significant date of harvesting of tomato was done in the open irrigation system after 144 days and in the closed system after 141 days the highest fruit yield was related to the v4 22 cultivar 3874 29 g per plant and the lowest fruit yield was obtained in the amira cultivar 3648 70 g per plant table 3 the findings are consistent with the results of schmautz et al 2016 rosa rodriguez et al 2020 and rodriguez jurado et al 2020 in hydroponic systems there is a difference between the yields of different cultivars and this difference may be due to the genetic characteristics of each cultivar cultivars commonly show high sensitivity to production conditions in hydroponic systems the crop yield had a positive and significant correlation with stomatal conductance 0 61 and the transpiration rate 0 62 there was no significant difference between the two hydroponic systems but with increased transpiration in the open hydroponic system more water reached the fruit and the yield increased the results clearly show that to improve crop yield and the tolerance of increasing nutrient solution concentration in tomatoes one should focus on controlling these traits tembe et al 2017 in addition the yield had a strong and significant correlation with cluster weight 0 99 fruit weight 0 80 and the number of fruits 0 68 and showed that the decrease in fruit yield in the closed hydroponic system was due to the decrease in the number of fruits in this system zhang et al 2016 tables 4 and 5 4 5 water productivity wp the effect of the hydroponic systems at the 1 level on water productivity were significantly different while the effect of the cultivar and the interaction of the hydroponic system and cultivar did not cause any significant difference table 7 the highest water productivity occurred in the closed hydroponic system with an average consumption of 33 70 kg m3 whereas the lowest water productivity occurred in the open hydroponic system with an average of 21 84 kg m3 table 3 the closed hydroponic system showed an increased water productivity by 54 3 in this system the findings in this study correspond with those of valenzano et al 2008 rodriguez ortega et al 2017 2019 wang et al 2019 and rodriguez jurado et al 2020 in which it is stated that the water use efficiency in the closed hydroponic system is higher due to the rotation of the nutrient solution and its reuse moreover for the production of each kilogram of the tomato crop in the closed hydroponic system 46 l of nutrient solution is needed however in this study to produce each kilogram of fresh fruit 45 83 l were used in the open system and 29 8 l in the closed system 4 6 water productivity biomass wpb the effect of the hydroponic system on water productivity biomass caused a significant difference at the level of 1 and the effect of the cultivar and the interaction between the cultivar and the hydroponic system had no effect on water productivity biomass table 7 the highest and lowest water productivity biomass of the tomato plant were measured in a closed hydroponic system 48 91 kg m3 and an open hydroponic system 34 42 kg m3 respectively and a reduction of water was observed table 3 the closed system produced significantly less biomass than the open system lennard and leonard 2006 zhang et al 2016 schmautz et al 2016 rodriguez ortega et al 2017 the reduction of water productivity biomass in the open hydroponic system was due to the increased nutrient solution consumed in this system while in the closed hydroponic system the nutrient solution consumption had a higher efficiency due to its reuse and rotation within the system resulting into an increased water productivity biomass by 42 4 7 efficient quantity and consumption of nutrients and fertilizers in this experiment the total volume of the nutrient solution consumed in a culture period was measured as being 2310 l for an open hydroponic system and 1181 l for a closed hydroponic system the consumption of the nutrient solution in the open hydroponic system was 192 50 l per plant and in the closed hydroponic system the consumption of the nutrient solution was equal to 98 43 l per plant the results show that the hydroponic system had reduced the consumption of the nutrient solution depending on the amount by 96 the amount of fertilizers used during the cultivation period approx 6 months was calculated to be 4 95 kg in the open hydroponic system and 2 53 kg in the closed hydroponic system respectively while it was observed that the closed hydroponic system reduced fertilizer application by 97 in open hydroponic systems even for the short cultivation cycle of tomato required a large supply of water which implied abundant release into the environment of drained ns that was still rich in potentially polluting nutrients this suggests the closed hydroponic system was consumed the least water and fertilizer while avoiding contamination since it did not release fertilizer into the environment valenzano et al 2008 rodriguez ortega et al 2017 rodriguez jurado et al 2020 4 8 percentage of drainage the amount of drainage in the open hydroponic system was calculated to be 23 5 on average moreover 543 l of the nutrient solution which was calculated as being between 20 and 25 was removed from the open system as drainage 5 electrical conductivity ec and ph of nutrient solution 5 1 effect of closed hydroponic system on ec hydroponic nutrient solutions are composed of 13 main elements each nutrient has the right concentration and proportions for the natural growth of a plant ion concentrations in nutrient solutions change over time and subsequent nutrient imbalances occur in the closed hydroponic system son et al 2020 therefore the ec of a nutrient solution may increase over time this increase is due to the fact that the nutrient solution loses some water due to evapotranspiration whatsmore the plant absorbs more water than the nutrients so the nutrient solution becomes thicker after a while eridani et al 2017 the results of the current study show that the ec of the nutrient in the closed hydroponic system increased within the range of 1 6 4 6 ds m 1 with an average of 3 02 from the beginning of construction to the consumption of the solution at the time of plant maturity the observed increase in the solution concentration parallel the tresults of rosa rodriguez et al 2020 and son et al 2020 5 2 effect of open hydroponic system on ec the ec of the nutrient solution in the open system was 3 2 ds m 1 the ec of the nutrient solution increased to 4 8 ds m 1 after passing through the culture medium in the open system in the open system the increase in ec occurs after the nutrient solution leaves the pots and this increase is due to the evaporation of water from the nutrient solution and the effect of the root of the nutrient solution during the hydroponic phase within the pots and after leaving the pots an increase of 40 in the ec above the standard improves the quality of tomato fruit without loss of yield increasing the ec of the nutrient solution in the closed system above the total standard with nacl seems to be a practical way to improve the quality of tomato fruit hao et al 1998 adjusting the concentration of the nutrient solution allows growers to improve the product s access to water thereby improving fruit quality in high ec fruit size is inversely related to ec so periodic washing of the culture medium is necessary to prevent excessive salt concentration in the medium manipulation of indoor greenhouse conditions such as humidity temperature and co2 environment may compensate for the negative effect of increasing the nutrient solution concentration on fruit yield and quality such as fruit rot at the end dorais et al 2001 5 3 effect of hydroponic systems on the ph of the nutrient solution the ph level in the open hydroponic system was adjusted between 5 5 and 6 5 with an average of 6 2 the ph changes in the closed hydroponic system ranged from 5 5 to 7 5 with an average of 6 60 this variation was dependent on the ammonium nitrate ratio in ns which supply n nh4 the amount of ph tends to decrease while in the elements that supply n no3 the amount of ph rises rosa rodriguez et al 2020 5 4 net photosynthesis rate pn the effect of the hydroponic system the effect of the cultivar and the interaction of the hydroponic system and the cultivar on net photosynthesis rate was not significant table 8 5 5 stomatal conductance gs the effect of the hydroponic system on stomatal conductance was significant at the 1 level the effect of the cultivar and the interaction of the hydroponic system and the cultivar on stomatal conduction did not cause significant differences table 8 the maximum and minimum stomatal conductivity were measured for the open hydroponic system at an average of 0 49 mol m2 s and for the closed hydroponic system at an average of 0 37 mol m2 s respectively the findings are consistent with the results of rodriguez ortega et al 2017 de souza et al 2020 and wang et al 2019 they stated that in the closed system the pore conductance decreases with the increasing of the concentration of the nutrient solution due to the lower pore conductance in a closed system the photosynthesis rate increases via aperture conduction a gas which in itself indicates better water productivity in the product production of such a system wang et al 2019 various factors such as light humidity co2 temperature and air flow are influential in water productivity which also reduces the amount of co2 haworth et al 2016 ultimately co2 fixation by the enzyme rubisco is less which may lead to lower biomass production which is consistent with the results obtained in the current study on biomass reduction in the closed hydroponic system leakey et al 2009 wang et al 2019 in addition a positive and significant correlation with the transpiration rate 0 79 was observed it seems that increasing the concentration of the nutrient solution in the closed hydroponic system causes an accumulation of abscisic acid in the roots which is transferred to the shoot and which subsequently leads to the closure of the stomata and reduces transpiration khan et al 1998 5 6 transpiration rate tr the hydroponic system had a significant difference at a 5 level on the transpiration rate but there was no significant difference between the cultivar and the system cultivar interaction table 8 the highest transpiration rate was observed in the open hydroponic system with an average of 3 54 mmol m2 s and the lowest transpiration rate was observed in the closed hydroponic system with an average of 2 33 mmol m2 s the current research findings were in line with the results of romero aranda et al 2001 rodriguez ortega et al 2019 wang et al 2019 and maeda et al 2020 in the aforementioned studies it had been observed that increasing the concentration of the nutrient solution in the closed hydroponic system retains water in the plant body and thus reduces the amount of transpiration from the leaf surface occurs when the plant retains water in its tissues and prevents it from escaping in order to regulate its water potential and counteract the effects of the increasing nutrient solution transpiration rate has a positive and significant correlation with leaf temperature 0 862 this confirms the high leaf temperature and transpiration rate in the open hydroponic system increasing transpiration is a mechanism to control the increase in leaf temperature and prevent the reduction of photosynthetic efficiency in plants 5 7 intercellular co2 concentration ci the effect of the hydroponic system the cultivar and the interaction of the hydroponic system and the cultivar on intercellular co2 concentration was not significant table 8 5 8 leaf temperature lt the hydroponic system had a significant difference at the level of 1 on leaf temperature but the cultivar and the interaction between the hydroponic system and the cultivar were not significantly different table 8 the highest and lowest leaf temperatures were measured in the open hydroponic system with an average of 28 18 c and in the closed hydroponic system with an average of 24 64 c respectively high leaf temperature has a beneficial effect on plant gas exchange photosynthesis and plant yield in addition to affecting photosynthetic structures high temperature increases light respiration and thus decreases photosynthetic efficiency sajadinia et al 2009 the high leaf temperature in the open hydroponic system indicates the lower photosynthetic efficiency of this system due to the fact that photosynthesis is not significant in the treatment of the hydroponic system but it is higher in the closed system 6 conclusions the main advantage of the modern hydroponic system is water saving and increasing the productivity per unit area the results of the present study indicate that tomato plants respond differently regarding the crop water productivity the number of fruits stomatal conductance transpiration rate and leaf temperature when grown in an open system or in a closed hydroponic system in terms of the ecophysiological characteristics of the plants the two systems did not differ in terms of their photosynthesis but the open system had better ecophysiological properties than the closed system due to its higher stomatal conductance and transpiration rate the closed hydroponic cultivation system has a water productivity up to 96 and nutrients up to 97 as compared to the open hydroponic system and used of closed hydroponic system can not only increase the yield per cubic meter of water used but also conserve fertilizer tomato cultivars had significant differences in crop yield the highest and lowest crop yields were measured in v4 22 cultivar 3874 29 g per plant and amira cultivar 3648 70 g per plant respectively in the closed system by reusing drainage contamination due to excessive salt contents in aquifers or soil can be reduced and the water available for agriculture can be managed more conservatively ethical approval not applicable funding this study was funded by shahid chamran university of ahvaz consent to participate consent was

9853,the consumption of nutrient solution is very important in the production of vegetables especially tomatoes in this study the effect of two hydroponic systems on yield components nutrient solution efficiency and stomatal gas exchanges of two greenhouse tomato cultivars have been investigated this experiment is in the form of split plots in a randomized complete block design with the treatment of tomato cultivars v4 22 and amira and type of hydroponic cultivation system open and closed in which 3 replicates were implemented at shahid chamran university of ahvaz the studied traits included crop yield fruit number fruit weight cluster weight nutrient solution efficiency and stomatal gas exchanges net photosynthesis rate stomatal conductance transpiration rate intercellular co2 concentration and leaf temperature the results showed that the effect of the hydroponic system had a significant effect on the efficiency rate of nutrient solution usage the number of fruits the weight of the third fourth and sixth cluster stomatal conductance transpiration rate and leaf temperature the highest number of fruits stomatal conductance transpiration rate and leaf temperature were measured in the open hydroponic system the highest and lowest rate of water productivity performance were obtained in the closed system 33 70 kg m3 and open system 21 84 kg m3 respectively the closed system increased water productivity for yield and biomass by 54 3 and 42 respectively as compared to the open system whatsmore the highest and lowest water productivity per biomass were obtained in the closed system 48 91 kg m3 and open system 34 42 kg m3 respectively tomato cultivars had significant differences in crop yield the highest and lowest crop yields were measured in v4 22 cultivar 3874 29 g per plant and amira cultivar 3648 70 g per plant respectively based on the results the closed hydroponic system was superior in terms of water and fertilizer saving without a significant effect on crop yield due to the reduction of nutrient solution consumption up to 96 and fertilizer consumption up to 97 keywords gas exchange water productivity hydroponics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global population growth has increased the need for food production especially in the agricultural sector significantly albaji et al 2014 neissi et al 2020 since agriculture is among one of the sectors that consume the most water this increase in production could have an adverse effect on water resources therefore necessary measures should be taken to improve crop water productivity and current production systems in agriculture atzori et al 2019 water resources can be used more efficiently through the production of greenhouse crops because there is better control of environmental conditions for crop production rosa rodriguez et al 2020 the highest yield of tomatoes is produced per unit area in hydroponic cultivation moreover it reduces the amount of water and fertilizer consumed thus significantly increasing the crop water productivity zhang et al 2016 rodriguez jurado et al 2020 in a study examined several crops tomatoes cucumbers and lettuce in three hydroponic systems open soil and closed reported open and closed hydroponic systems and found them to have no significant difference in yield performance the most efficient water consumption system was the closed hydroponic system with water consumption savings of 55 69 as compared to the open system rosa rodriguez et al 2020 in a study compared the nutrient solution efficiency in closed and open hydroponic systems in tomato production and concluded that the efficiency of water and fertilizer consumption was higher in a closed system in as such that such a system produces 13 5 kg more fruits per cubic meter of water than an open system rufi salis et al 2020 in a study on nutrient recycling of closed hydroponic cultivation systems in green pea production concluded that closed hydroponic systems reduce water consumption by 40 and nutrient consumption by 35 54 daily mendez cifuentes et al 2020 in a study on open and closed hydroponic cultivation systems concluded that to produce 1 kg of tomatoes in an open system 53 l of a nutrient solution and in a closed system 22 l of a nutrient solution are used and the open system had 9 5 higher yield and consumed 86 more water rodriguez ortega et al 2019 in a study of three hydroponic cultivation systems deep flow technique perlite nutrient film technique concluded that crop water productivity was higher for tomato plants which are grown using a nutrient film technique whereas the highest yield was obtained in the open system katsoulas et al 2013 compared three hydroponic cultivation systems open system closed system semi closed system in a greenhouse tomato crop and concluded that the closed system was the most effective in minimizing nutrient solution drainage in hydroponic systems thus maximizing water usage productivity grewal et al 2011 in a study on the efficiency of the nutrient solution in closed hydroponic systems for a greenhouse cucumber crop concluded that water recycling reduces the amount of water used for cucumber production by 33 maboko et al 2011 in their study on the yield of 4 tomato cultivars in open and closed hydroponic systems reported that there is a difference in the yield and the amount of fruit that can be sold in open and closed systems moreover they observed that the nutrient solution efficiency in the closed system is higher de souza et al 2020 in a study on the efficiency of a nutrient solution in a nutrient film technique system and its effect on the growth and development of watercress observed that by increasing the concentration of the nutrient solution the rate of photosynthesis stomatal conductance and transpiration rate would be reduced in another study the ecological characteristics of pepper plants in both hydroponic and aquaponic cultivation systems were investigated they concluded that the rate of photosynthesis stomatal conductance transpiration and crop water productivity were higher in the aquaponic treatment sajadinia et al 2009 the innovation of this research is the use of integration of several combined irrigation systems included drip irrigation system aeroponics system wick system and deep water culture system the combination of these systems in a closed system has been proposed as a new method in hydroponics its benefits include the main advantages of the closed systems over the open ones are the reduction in water and nutrient loss to the environment resulting in better water productivity and the closed hydroponic cultivation system has water productivity up to 96 and nutrients up to 97 as compared to the open hydroponic system in a closed system the solution is continually moving there is very little short term variation in salinity it is possible therefore to grow plants in much higher salinity to increase fruit quality closed systems use minimal substrate so the problem of pollution of the environment from its disposal is also reduced this provides good contact between the recirculating solution and air which is sufficient to maintain the oxygen level required by the roots without additional aeration of the solution in the closed system irrigation was done by gravity and there was no need to use an electric pump irrigation by a set of these systems causes if one of the irrigation methods in the closed system is disturbed during the cultivation period the other method of irrigation will compensate for this problem the closed system as described presents several advantages over other hydroponic nutrient delivery system options therefore the purpose of the current study was to investigate the effect of open and closed hydroponic systems on yield components water usage productivity and the gas exchange after the inaugurating of two greenhouse tomato cultivars in the shahid chamran university of ahvaz 2 materials and methods this experiment was done as split plot design based on completely randomized block design with three 3 replications at shahid chamran university of ahvaz the two hydroponic systems open and close and two cultivars v4 22 and amira were treatments the parameters such as yield components nutrient solution efficiency and stomatal gas exchange were measured during and end of the experiment an experiment was conducted in autumn 2019 at latitude 31 20 n and longitude 48 41 e with an elevation of 22 m tomato seeds were planted in the planting tray on september 23 2019 and the seedlings were transferred to open and closed hydroponic systems on october 20 2019 the amira cultivar was bred in the netherlands and procured from sepahan royesh isfahan company representative of rijk zwaan company in the netherlands the v4 22 cultivar was bred in the shahid chamran university of ahvaz in the closed hydroponic system the nutrient solution had a constant volume in the pots and flowed consistently during the day and night during the culture period the nutrient solution was recycled and reused in the closed system by adjusting the electrical conductivity in the reported range in the open hydroponic system the nutrient solution was transferred to the plant by pipes and drippers using a digital timer irrigation started from the beginning of the project with 150 cc per day for each plant in the open hydroponic system and by the end this amount reached 1800 cc per day for each plant the dripper flow was adjusted to 100 cc min in the open hydroponic system in the open hydroponic system during the production stage on average 18 20 irrigations per day were applied in each pot one emitter 6 l h 1 was installed the culture medium in the open hydroponic system was 50 cocopeat 50 perlite however the closed hydroponic system was without any culture medium in both hydroponic systems the pots were placed in rows at 100 cm apart with a spacing of 25 cm between each pot in a row fig 1 a resh nutrient solution was used to feed the plants resh 2013 table 1 after preparing the nutrient solution the ec and ph of the nutrient solution in both the closed and the open hydroponic system were measured using a manual digital conductivity meter and a ph meter the ec of the nutrient solution was adjusted to 3 2 ds m 1 in the open system and ranged from 1 6 to 4 6 ds m 1 in the closed system after resetting the ec of the nutrient solution in the closed hydroponic system the ph of the nutrient solution was measured and adjusted using h2so4 or naoh in the range of 5 5 6 5 as required greenhouse temperature and humidity were recorded using a digital thermometer from the time of seedling transfer fig 2 3 measured variables 3 1 yield compounds yield compounds included fruit number fruit weight clusters weight and total yield were investigated in this study in the current study by aggregating the weight of healthy and marketable fruits above 70 g and without damage packaged and sent to the consumer market the yield of marketable fruits was determined the number of fruits were counted weekly and were calculated cumulatively 3 2 volume of applied solution the amount of nutrient solution consumed in the closed hydroponic system from the first day after transplanting to the end of the growing season was calculated daily using a volumetric meter in the open hydroponic system in order to determine the nutrient solution consumed the volume of water drained from the pots was recorded daily and reported as a percentage value 3 3 water productivity to determine the water productivity per yield the relationship between the production weight of fruits obtained in kilograms during the entire cycle in both the open and the closed hydroponics systems was obtained as well as the amount of water applied during the entire cycle in m 3 to calculate these values the researchers used the below equation rosa rodriguez et al 2020 1 water productivity kilograms of fruits cubic meters applied water productivity per biomass in the open and the closed hydroponic system was obtained from the ratio of total crop yield kg and plant biomass kg to water applied cubic meters hooshmand et al 2019 2 water productivity biomass y b w water productivity biomass kg m3 y crop yield kg b plant biomass

according to the following formula rosa rodriguez et al 2020 3 drainage percentage ns drained ns applied 100 3 5 gas exchange leaf gas exchanges parameters included net photosynthesis rate a stomatal conductance gs transpiration rate tr intercellular co2 concentration ci and leaf temperature were measured using an lci sd device made in england all measurements were performed at 10 12 am at a light intensity of 950 μmol m 2 s photons mature and middle leaves were used for sampling so that the first three leaflets of each leaf were used for measurement 9 samples were taken in each treatment marques et al 2020 3 6 statistical analysis statistical analyzes were performed using mstat c analysis of variance and spss correlation between trait software and graphs were drawn by excel software 4 results and discussion 4 1 number of fruits the effect of hydroponic system on the number of fruits had a significant difference at a level of 5 while the effect of cultivar and the interaction of the hydroponic system and the cultivar did not differ significantly although the hydroponic systems had a significant difference in terms of fruit formation from day 99 until the end of the experiment the fruit formation process in the two hydroponic systems from initial fruit formation to day 99 did not have a significant difference fig 3 the findings of the current research was consistant with the results of lennard and leonard 2006 schmautz et al 2016 ahmad khan et al 2017 and shongwe et al 2019 these studies reported that by increasing the concentration of the nutrient solution within the optimal range of tomato production reduces the number of fruits in a closed hydroponic system but does not have a significant difference in terms of yield while if the concentration of the nutrient solution exceeds the optimal range it will reduce the crop yield plants in a closed system have more severe osmotic conditions this in itself reduces the number of fruits in such a system if this increase in nutrient solution concentration is in the proper range for tomato production the number of fruits will decrease without a significant effect on yield but if this increase is too high it will significantly reduce crop yield rodriguez ortega et al 2019 4 2 fruit weight the effect of hydroponic system on the fruit weight of the third fourth and sixth cluster of tomato plants was significantly different at the level of 5 table 6 the effect of cultivar and the interaction of the hydroponic system and cultivar on fruit weight did not show a significant difference the highest fruit weight was obtained in the third cluster open system 99 49 g the fourth cluster closed system 89 40 g and the sixth cluster open system 99 44 g and the lowest fruit weight was obtained in the third cluster closed system 90 76 g the fourth cluster open system 86 31 g and the sixth cluster closed system 99 44 g in general the fruit weight in the open system was higher than the closed system was due to the greater and continuous availability of water in this hydroponic system valenzano et al 2008 stomatal conductance had a positive and significant correlation with fruit weight 0 62 the results showed that during fruit growth a decrease in stomatal conductance occurs due to the increasing of the concentration of the nutrient solution in the closed hydroponic system which in itself reduces fruit weight and yield nemeskeri et al 2019 4 3 cluster weight the effect of the hydroponic system on the yield of the fourth and fifth clusters had a significant difference at a 5 level table 6 the effect of the interaction of the hydroponic system and cultivar on the weight of the first and second clusters of tomato plants showed a significant difference at a 1 level while it had no effect on other clusters the effect of the cultivar on cluster weight did not show a significant difference the highest weight of the fourth cluster 618 08 g and the fifth cluster 511 08 g were measured in the open system and the lowest weight of the fourth cluster 401 33 g and the fifth cluster 356 33 g in the closed system were also measured table 2 the highest and lowest weights of the first cluster were obtained in v4 22 cultivar in the closed hydroponic system 634 16 g and in the amira cultivar in the closed hydroponic system 496 66 g respectively table 2 the highest and lowest weight of the second cluster was obtained in the v4 22 cultivar in the open hydroponic system 460 16 g and in the amira cultivar in the open hydroponic system 361 00 g respectively table 2 4 4 yield based on the results of the analysis of variance table 6 the effect of the cultivar on tomato plant yield showed a significant difference at a 5 level however the treatment of the hydroponic system and their interaction was not significant date of harvesting of tomato was done in the open irrigation system after 144 days and in the closed system after 141 days the highest fruit yield was related to the v4 22 cultivar 3874 29 g per plant and the lowest fruit yield was obtained in the amira cultivar 3648 70 g per plant table 3 the findings are consistent with the results of schmautz et al 2016 rosa rodriguez et al 2020 and rodriguez jurado et al 2020 in hydroponic systems there is a difference between the yields of different cultivars and this difference may be due to the genetic characteristics of each cultivar cultivars commonly show high sensitivity to production conditions in hydroponic systems the crop yield had a positive and significant correlation with stomatal conductance 0 61 and the transpiration rate 0 62 there was no significant difference between the two hydroponic systems but with increased transpiration in the open hydroponic system more water reached the fruit and the yield increased the results clearly show that to improve crop yield and the tolerance of increasing nutrient solution concentration in tomatoes one should focus on controlling these traits tembe et al 2017 in addition the yield had a strong and significant correlation with cluster weight 0 99 fruit weight 0 80 and the number of fruits 0 68 and showed that the decrease in fruit yield in the closed hydroponic system was due to the decrease in the number of fruits in this system zhang et al 2016 tables 4 and 5 4 5 water productivity wp the effect of the hydroponic systems at the 1 level on water productivity were significantly different while the effect of the cultivar and the interaction of the hydroponic system and cultivar did not cause any significant difference table 7 the highest water productivity occurred in the closed hydroponic system with an average consumption of 33 70 kg m3 whereas the lowest water productivity occurred in the open hydroponic system with an average of 21 84 kg m3 table 3 the closed hydroponic system showed an increased water productivity by 54 3 in this system the findings in this study correspond with those of valenzano et al 2008 rodriguez ortega et al 2017 2019 wang et al 2019 and rodriguez jurado et al 2020 in which it is stated that the water use efficiency in the closed hydroponic system is higher due to the rotation of the nutrient solution and its reuse moreover for the production of each kilogram of the tomato crop in the closed hydroponic system 46 l of nutrient solution is needed however in this study to produce each kilogram of fresh fruit 45 83 l were used in the open system and 29 8 l in the closed system 4 6 water productivity biomass wpb the effect of the hydroponic system on water productivity biomass caused a significant difference at the level of 1 and the effect of the cultivar and the interaction between the cultivar and the hydroponic system had no effect on water productivity biomass table 7 the highest and lowest water productivity biomass of the tomato plant were measured in a closed hydroponic system 48 91 kg m3 and an open hydroponic system 34 42 kg m3 respectively and a reduction of water was observed table 3 the closed system produced significantly less biomass than the open system lennard and leonard 2006 zhang et al 2016 schmautz et al 2016 rodriguez ortega et al 2017 the reduction of water productivity biomass in the open hydroponic system was due to the increased nutrient solution consumed in this system while in the closed hydroponic system the nutrient solution consumption had a higher efficiency due to its reuse and rotation within the system resulting into an increased water productivity biomass by 42 4 7 efficient quantity and consumption of nutrients and fertilizers in this experiment the total volume of the nutrient solution consumed in a culture period was measured as being 2310 l for an open hydroponic system and 1181 l for a closed hydroponic system the consumption of the nutrient solution in the open hydroponic system was 192 50 l per plant and in the closed hydroponic system the consumption of the nutrient solution was equal to 98 43 l per plant the results show that the hydroponic system had reduced the consumption of the nutrient solution depending on the amount by 96 the amount of fertilizers used during the cultivation period approx 6 months was calculated to be 4 95 kg in the open hydroponic system and 2 53 kg in the closed hydroponic system respectively while it was observed that the closed hydroponic system reduced fertilizer application by 97 in open hydroponic systems even for the short cultivation cycle of tomato required a large supply of water which implied abundant release into the environment of drained ns that was still rich in potentially polluting nutrients this suggests the closed hydroponic system was consumed the least water and fertilizer while avoiding contamination since it did not release fertilizer into the environment valenzano et al 2008 rodriguez ortega et al 2017 rodriguez jurado et al 2020 4 8 percentage of drainage the amount of drainage in the open hydroponic system was calculated to be 23 5 on average moreover 543 l of the nutrient solution which was calculated as being between 20 and 25 was removed from the open system as drainage 5 electrical conductivity ec and ph of nutrient solution 5 1 effect of closed hydroponic system on ec hydroponic nutrient solutions are composed of 13 main elements each nutrient has the right concentration and proportions for the natural growth of a plant ion concentrations in nutrient solutions change over time and subsequent nutrient imbalances occur in the closed hydroponic system son et al 2020 therefore the ec of a nutrient solution may increase over time this increase is due to the fact that the nutrient solution loses some water due to evapotranspiration whatsmore the plant absorbs more water than the nutrients so the nutrient solution becomes thicker after a while eridani et al 2017 the results of the current study show that the ec of the nutrient in the closed hydroponic system increased within the range of 1 6 4 6 ds m 1 with an average of 3 02 from the beginning of construction to the consumption of the solution at the time of plant maturity the observed increase in the solution concentration parallel the tresults of rosa rodriguez et al 2020 and son et al 2020 5 2 effect of open hydroponic system on ec the ec of the nutrient solution in the open system was 3 2 ds m 1 the ec of the nutrient solution increased to 4 8 ds m 1 after passing through the culture medium in the open system in the open system the increase in ec occurs after the nutrient solution leaves the pots and this increase is due to the evaporation of water from the nutrient solution and the effect of the root of the nutrient solution during the hydroponic phase within the pots and after leaving the pots an increase of 40 in the ec above the standard improves the quality of tomato fruit without loss of yield increasing the ec of the nutrient solution in the closed system above the total standard with nacl seems to be a practical way to improve the quality of tomato fruit hao et al 1998 adjusting the concentration of the nutrient solution allows growers to improve the product s access to water thereby improving fruit quality in high ec fruit size is inversely related to ec so periodic washing of the culture medium is necessary to prevent excessive salt concentration in the medium manipulation of indoor greenhouse conditions such as humidity temperature and co2 environment may compensate for the negative effect of increasing the nutrient solution concentration on fruit yield and quality such as fruit rot at the end dorais et al 2001 5 3 effect of hydroponic systems on the ph of the nutrient solution the ph level in the open hydroponic system was adjusted between 5 5 and 6 5 with an average of 6 2 the ph changes in the closed hydroponic system ranged from 5 5 to 7 5 with an average of 6 60 this variation was dependent on the ammonium nitrate ratio in ns which supply n nh4 the amount of ph tends to decrease while in the elements that supply n no3 the amount of ph rises rosa rodriguez et al 2020 5 4 net photosynthesis rate pn the effect of the hydroponic system the effect of the cultivar and the interaction of the hydroponic system and the cultivar on net photosynthesis rate was not significant table 8 5 5 stomatal conductance gs the effect of the hydroponic system on stomatal conductance was significant at the 1 level the effect of the cultivar and the interaction of the hydroponic system and the cultivar on stomatal conduction did not cause significant differences table 8 the maximum and minimum stomatal conductivity were measured for the open hydroponic system at an average of 0 49 mol m2 s and for the closed hydroponic system at an average of 0 37 mol m2 s respectively the findings are consistent with the results of rodriguez ortega et al 2017 de souza et al 2020 and wang et al 2019 they stated that in the closed system the pore conductance decreases with the increasing of the concentration of the nutrient solution due to the lower pore conductance in a closed system the photosynthesis rate increases via aperture conduction a gas which in itself indicates better water productivity in the product production of such a system wang et al 2019 various factors such as light humidity co2 temperature and air flow are influential in water productivity which also reduces the amount of co2 haworth et al 2016 ultimately co2 fixation by the enzyme rubisco is less which may lead to lower biomass production which is consistent with the results obtained in the current study on biomass reduction in the closed hydroponic system leakey et al 2009 wang et al 2019 in addition a positive and significant correlation with the transpiration rate 0 79 was observed it seems that increasing the concentration of the nutrient solution in the closed hydroponic system causes an accumulation of abscisic acid in the roots which is transferred to the shoot and which subsequently leads to the closure of the stomata and reduces transpiration khan et al 1998 5 6 transpiration rate tr the hydroponic system had a significant difference at a 5 level on the transpiration rate but there was no significant difference between the cultivar and the system cultivar interaction table 8 the highest transpiration rate was observed in the open hydroponic system with an average of 3 54 mmol m2 s and the lowest transpiration rate was observed in the closed hydroponic system with an average of 2 33 mmol m2 s the current research findings were in line with the results of romero aranda et al 2001 rodriguez ortega et al 2019 wang et al 2019 and maeda et al 2020 in the aforementioned studies it had been observed that increasing the concentration of the nutrient solution in the closed hydroponic system retains water in the plant body and thus reduces the amount of transpiration from the leaf surface occurs when the plant retains water in its tissues and prevents it from escaping in order to regulate its water potential and counteract the effects of the increasing nutrient solution transpiration rate has a positive and significant correlation with leaf temperature 0 862 this confirms the high leaf temperature and transpiration rate in the open hydroponic system increasing transpiration is a mechanism to control the increase in leaf temperature and prevent the reduction of photosynthetic efficiency in plants 5 7 intercellular co2 concentration ci the effect of the hydroponic system the cultivar and the interaction of the hydroponic system and the cultivar on intercellular co2 concentration was not significant table 8 5 8 leaf temperature lt the hydroponic system had a significant difference at the level of 1 on leaf temperature but the cultivar and the interaction between the hydroponic system and the cultivar were not significantly different table 8 the highest and lowest leaf temperatures were measured in the open hydroponic system with an average of 28 18 c and in the closed hydroponic system with an average of 24 64 c respectively high leaf temperature has a beneficial effect on plant gas exchange photosynthesis and plant yield in addition to affecting photosynthetic structures high temperature increases light respiration and thus decreases photosynthetic efficiency sajadinia et al 2009 the high leaf temperature in the open hydroponic system indicates the lower photosynthetic efficiency of this system due to the fact that photosynthesis is not significant in the treatment of the hydroponic system but it is higher in the closed system 6 conclusions the main advantage of the modern hydroponic system is water saving and increasing the productivity per unit area the results of the present study indicate that tomato plants respond differently regarding the crop water productivity the number of fruits stomatal conductance transpiration rate and leaf temperature when grown in an open system or in a closed hydroponic system in terms of the ecophysiological characteristics of the plants the two systems did not differ in terms of their photosynthesis but the open system had better ecophysiological properties than the closed system due to its higher stomatal conductance and transpiration rate the closed hydroponic cultivation system has a water productivity up to 96 and nutrients up to 97 as compared to the open hydroponic system and used of closed hydroponic system can not only increase the yield per cubic meter of water used but also conserve fertilizer tomato cultivars had significant differences in crop yield the highest and lowest crop yields were measured in v4 22 cultivar 3874 29 g per plant and amira cultivar 3648 70 g per plant respectively in the closed system by reusing drainage contamination due to excessive salt contents in aquifers or soil can be reduced and the water available for agriculture can be managed more conservatively ethical approval not applicable funding this study was funded by shahid chamran university of ahvaz consent to participate consent was

9854,regulated deficit irrigation rdi strategy using reclaimed water rw is becoming a common procedure in some mediterranean regions full and regulated deficit irrigation were combined with desalinated ecw 1 ds m 1 and saline ecw 3 ds m 1 reclaimed water to irrigate young potted almond trees over a 3 year period the full irrigation treatments received 130 of the crop evapotranspiration etc and the rdi treatments received 80 of etc during the kernel filling trunk diameter decreased in both rdi treatments at the end of the experimental period although this response was more marked in the trees irrigated with saline rw there were negative relationships between shoot growth and leaf na and cl contents in the saline treated trees in which the accumulation of salts in leaves was associated with osmotic adjustment which was responsible for maintaining midday leaf turgor plant water status measured by the leaf and water potential decreased in almond exposed to water deficit or irrigated with saline rw indicating a slight dehydration in these plants due to the difficulty in water uptake from the substrate trees subjected to both deficit irrigation treatments showed lower stomatal conductance values than full irrigated treatments during the rdi period however at the end of experimental period the lowest pn values were found in plants irrigated with saline rw especially in trees irrigated with saline rw combined with rdi strategy verifying the relevance of duration of exposure to the stress saline and desalinated rw can be successfully used for irrigating almond trees which might be of great economic and competitive significance for agriculture but further research focused on a longer term should be carried out since detrimental effects might appear deficit

relations 1 introduction water shortages are very frequent in many countries and together with the rising demand for industry growth of human population climate change and specifically the trend towards irrigated agriculture have led to widespread problems of water scarcity especially in mediterranean countries romero trigueros et al 2020 this situation imposes the need to optimize its use in all human activities fulcher et al 2016 álvarez et al 2019 among the different productive uses of water agriculture is by far the main water user in most water scarce regions and consequently any potential improvement in the use of the available water resources may play a role toward achieving a more sustainable use of water fereres and soriano 2007 alcon et al 2013 stakeholders involved in water resource management are looking for knowledge necessary to successfully irrigation management to achieve this objective several water conservation strategies have been recommended for example by using precise tools for assessing crop water requirements mirás avalos et al 2016 reclaimed water grant et al 2012 nicolás et al 2018 erel et al 2019 drought and salt tolerant genotypes or rootstocks yadollahi et al 2011 jiménez et al 2013 álvarez et al 2020 applying deficit irrigation strategies ruiz sánchez et al 2010 romero trigueros et al 2019a sánchez blanco et al 2019 and providing information about the water use requirements of the trees depending on the phenological periods varying goldhamer and beede 2004 almond prunus dulcis mill d a webb is a major tree nut species whose production and proﬁtability are highly dependent on irrigation supply egea et al 2010 especially in regions such as the mediterranean basin characterized by low rainfall and high evaporative demand during the almond growing season the physiological and morphological response of almond to different irrigation levels has been extensively investigated torrecillas et al 1988 shackel 2007 egea et al 2010 espadafor et al 2017 one of the most promising techniques to maximize the water use in tree crops with little or no impact on crop yield and quality is regulated deficit irrigation rdi which is defined as an irrigation strategy that provides irrigation water below the full needs for specific development stages past research has revealed the interest of this irrigation technique with special attention paid to fruit crops including almonds where it has been successfully employed goldhamer and viveros 2000 girona et al 2005 romero and botía 2006 stewart et al 2011 due to the increasing pressure on fresh water resources the use of saline waters and reclaimed water rw has become a reliable alternative for irrigation in agriculture acosta motos et al 2016 romero trigueros et al 2019b this situation imposes the need to use non conventional water resources desalinated or reclaimed water for irrigation saline rw has been successfully used in several fruit crops like citrus nicolás et al 2016 olive erel et al 2019 and other species pedrero et al 2018 perulli et al 2019 the main conclusions from these studies are that treated wastewater can be used as an additional water resource for tree irrigation in water scarce mediterranean environments little information is available on the effect of using saline or reclaimed water to irrigate almond trees although they represent an important section of fruit trees production and such information be of great interest for designing and promoting water conservation strategies phogat et al 2018 notably the studies related to salinity in almonds are speciﬁcally focused on the evaluation of salt tolerance in genotypes rouhi et al 2007 dejampour et al 2012 rajabpoor et al 2014 bahrami et al 2015 and rootstocks doll et al 2014 momenpour et al 2018 research on the physiological performance of p dulcis irrigated with rw is still lacking as the previous studies about salinity tolerance of almonds have been conducted just on irrigation nacl solutions and it is well known that the chemical properties of the water applied also affect the response of plant being the kind of water a relevant aspect gómez bellot et al 2013 in addition increasing water resource problems in arid regions are even leading to growers to use the rw combined with deficit strategies mounzer et al 2013 many works have focused on water and salt stress applied individually but very few have evaluated the physiological changes that take place when both stresses applied simultaneously despite the fact of being known that the response by plants to combination of these two stresses may differ if water and salt stress applied individually or simultaneously brown et al 2006 sucre and suárez 2011 glenn et al 2012 in general under saline or drought conditions plants reduce their water uptake capacity but using irrigation waters with high salt concentrations can also cause ion toxicities and nutritional imbalance depending on the kind of salts in the irrigation water acosta motos et al 2014 in this sense rw may contain high concentrations of salts and in consequence their use in irrigation for long term may have negative effects on soils and plants ayers and westcot 1985 particularly for those crops relatively sensitive to salinity such as almonds phogat et al 2018 it is for these reasons that reducing salt concentration in these water resources leading to desalinated rw could be an interesting option to reduce problems associated with salinity providing different solutions to agriculture of arid and semi arid environments however studies regarding the physiological effects of the irrigation with rw on almond trees are lacking the short term response in term of growth and yield of almond trees to irrigation with desalinated and saline rw combined with rdi strategy during 1 year has been well described in a previous study vivaldi et al 2019 but no information is available on its physiological response of several years of irrigation with these non conventional water resources due to that the response of plants to salinity depends not only on the water composition but also on the time of exposure to salt stress nicolás et al 2016 the present work was carried out over a three year period in p dulcis using the same trees tested by vivaldi et al 2019 but after two additional growing seasons three seasons in total from 2017 to 2019 the main objective of this research was to study the mid term effects on young almond potted trees exposed to rw and different irrigation strategies with special interest in plant growth ion accumulation and tree water status in order to identify the mechanisms that the plants develop to cope with these stresses for this a three year experiment was designed to evaluate single and interaction effects of different levels of irrigation and salinity in an attempt to check the sustainability of these irrigation strategies and to identify the most adequate in each context the results can also be important contributions to scheduling irrigation strategies in water scarce regions where low quality waters are often combined with deficit irrigation strategies as well as making more sustainable almond crop production in regions with limited water resources our working hypothesis were responses of almonds irrigated with reclaimed water would be different from those of trees irrigated with saline water with the same level of salinity degree of salt stress tolerance would be correlated with the ability to control ion accumulation in leaves and reclaimed water would confer a protective effect on water stress tolerance as observed for other species 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material and experimental conditions the study was performed during three consecutive seasons 2017 2019 in an experimental orchard cultivated with 3 years old in 2017 almond trees prunus dulcis mill d a webb cv guara grafted on a hybrid rootpak 20 of prunus besey prunus cerasifera l h bailey and ehrh plants were transplanted in january 2017 into 100 l polyethylene pots diameter 50 cm height 65 cm filled with soil the soil texture was classified as loam 44 78 sand 12 32 clay and 42 90 silt usda textural soil classification plants were placed outdoors in a plot in the university of bari experimental station located in the southeast of italy bari apulia region 41 06 41 n 16 52 57 e 5 m above sea level pots were on the ground with a 1 85 2 10 m planting system in rows oriented n ne to s sw the climate data were recorded by an automatic weather station located about 100 m from the experimental site air temperature solar radiation air relatively humidity rainfall and wind speed 2 5 m above the soil surface were collected every 15 min these data were used for calculating et0 and crop water requirements all treatments received the same amounts of fertilizer n p2o5 k2o applied through the drip irrigation system pest control practices and pruning were those commonly used by growers in the area and no weeds were allowed to develop in the pots 2 2 treatments two irrigation water sources were used the first was desalinated rw d produced on the desert prototype and obtained by treating secondary wastewater from the bari italy secondary wastewater treatment plant using ultrafiltration active carbon and reverse osmosis to reach an ecw of 1 0 ds m 1 desert low cost water desalination and sensor technology is an innovative water desalination compact module that enhances the energy savings by using solar energy developed in the framework of the desert european project water jpi 2016 the second source was saline rw s obtained by mixing the secondary wastewater from bari swtp with the brine produced in the desert prototype reaching a final ecw of 3 ds m 1 for each water source two irrigation treatments were established the full irrigation fi treatments involved irrigation with d or s during the whole season at 130 etc d fi and s fi respectively the rdi treatments consisted of irrigation at 130 etc except during the kernel filling when received 80 of the etc from late june to early august 35 40 days d rdi and s rdi irrigation was applied each year from march to october therefore four irrigation treatments based on the water quality of the irrigation source and water quantity were performed the irrigation treatments consisted of a desalinated full irrigation treatment d fi irrigated through the growing season to fully satisfy crop water requirements using desalinated reclaimed water a saline full irrigation treatment s fi using saline reclaimed water and two regulated deficit irrigation treatments desalinated regulated deficit irrigation d rdi plants were irrigated using desalinated rw and saline regulated deficit irrigation s rdi plants were irrigated using saline rw the irrigation doses were scheduled on the basis of the daily crop evapotranspiration etc calculated by the water balance method etc was calculated using the following equation recommended by fao etc kr kc et0 where kr is the reduction coefficient kr 0 75 kc is the crop coefficient as described by vivaldi et al 2019 and et0 is reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated by penman monteith equation using climate data provided by the climate station located 100 m from the experiment the water was supplied by drip irrigation with three pressure compensated drippers per tree each with a flow rate of 2 l h 1 trees were irrigated daily during the three year experiment the irrigation was controlled automatically by a head unit programmer and the amount of water applied for each irrigation treatment were measured with in line flowmeters placed in each treatment a total of 40 trees made up this assay 10 per treatment each irrigation treatment had five replicates distributed in a completely randomized design each replicate consisted of two trees 2 3 water quality the inorganic solute content ph and ecw of each irrigation water source were assessed monthly during the irrigation season in 2017 2018 and 2019 the samples were collected in glass bottles transported in an ice chest to the laboratory and stored at 5 c before processed for chemical and physical analyzes the concentrations of na k ca 2 b 3 and mg were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp icap 6500

ph was measured with a ph meter crison 507 crison instruments s a barcelona spain 2 4 plant growth and water status measurements at the beginning and at the end of each growing season trunk diameter was measured in five trees per treatment with a sliding caliper 0 20 m above the soil surface shoot length values were collected during growing period in 2018 by measuring the length of two shoots for each tree and four trees per treatment and the relative growth rate rgr was calculated as the rate of increase of length per unit of initial shoot length at the end of growing period in 2018 twenty leaves per tree in four trees per treatment were washed with distilled water and dried at 80 c before stored at room temperature for inorganic solute analyzes the concentration of cl was analyzed by chloride analyzer chloride analyser model 926 sherwood scientific ltd in the aqueous extracts obtained when mixing 100 mg of dry vegetable powder with 40 ml of water before shaking for 30 min and filtering the concentrations of na were determined in a digestion extract with hno3 hclo4 2 1 v v by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp icap 6500 duo thermo england seasonal changes in

transpiring leaves that had been bagged with both a plastic sheet and aluminum foil for at least 2 h before measurement in order to prevent leaf transpiration in this way leaf water potential equaled stem water potential begg and turner 1970 in six representatives dates during the experimental period leaves from the ψl measurements were frozen in liquid nitrogen 196 c and stored at 30 c after thawing the osmotic potential ψo was measured in the extracted sap using a wescor 5520 vapour pressure osmometer wescor inc logan ut usa according to gucci et al 1991 ψt was estimated as the difference between leaf water potential ψl and leaf osmotic potential ψo throughout the experimental period leaf osmotic potential at full turgor ψ100s was estimated as indicated above for ψo using excised leaves with their petioles placed in distilled water overnight to reach full saturation ψl and ψ100s were only measured during 2018 and 2019 leaf stomatal conductance gs net photosynthesis

square transformation before statistical analysis to ensure homogeneity of variance treatments means were separated by duncan s multiple range test p 0 05 pearson s correlation analysis was used to test for relationship between leaf ion concentrations and rgr of shoot length 3 results 3 1 irrigation water quality and volume applied significant differences on the water quality were found between the two irrigation sources during the whole experiment table 1 saline reclaimed water s had high salinity with ecw values 3 ds m 1 higher than those measured in the desalinated reclaimed water d 1 1 1 ds m 1 s also increased the concentrations of some nutrients such as no3 po4 3 so4 2 k mg and ca 2 with respect to d whereas the concentration of b 3 remained invariable the high na concentration observed in s also increased the water sodium adsorption ratio sarw level from a mean value close to 4 6 meq l 0 5 observed in the d source to about 6 7 meq l 0 5 in the s source it is also noteworthy that concentrations of phytotoxic elements such as na and cl concentrations were clearly different in each irrigation water source d had lower na and cl concentration as a result of desalination process reaching on the average values of na 165 mg l 1 and cl 211 mg l 1 as compared to the s 328 for na and 416 mg l 1 for cl the mean annual et0 and rainfall for the three experimental seasons were 1291 and 586 mm fig 1 the amounts of irrigation water applied in 2017 2018 and 2019 in the full irrigation treatments were 368 246 and 221 mm while in the rdi treatments were 305 201 and 184 mm respectively which meant reductions of about 20 each year in the rdi treatments fig 1 3 2 plant growth and leaf mineral concentrations regulated deficit irrigation and reclaimed water affected the growth and size of the almond trees and a significant decrease in trunk diameter and shoot length compared with d fi trees was measured during the experimental period however the specific response depended on the treatment and parameter in question throughout the experiment trunk diameter was similar in all treatments but began to be inhibited three years after application of the rdi table 2 at the end of the experimental period trunk diameter was significantly inhibited by both rdi compared to full irrigation trees the smallest plants 4 2 cm being those subjected to rdi combined with saline rw as regard rgr as a function of shoot length no differences between the d fi and d rdi treatments were observed but lower rates were found in the trees irrigated with saline rw fig 2 f 17 91 p 0 00003 while no accumulation of na and cl was found in the leaves of trees submitted to d rdi treatment compared with d fi treatment the contents of both ions increased in the leaves of the trees irrigated with saline rw fig 2 in all treatments the cl content in the leaves was markedly higher than the corresponding of na content between 12 and 30 fold higher despite that the concentrations of both ions in the irrigation water were similar 7 0 and 5 5 mmol l 1 in d 11 7 and 10 6 mmol l 1 in s for na and cl respectively this means that p dulcis plants are able to restrict na accumulation in leaves to a greater extent than cl thus the trees increased their leaf cl content sharply reaching a value of 2 4 in s rdi plants the highest cl value was measured in leaves of s rdi plants while the highest na value was in s fi which means that the retention and transport of both ions was different significant relationships between rgr and leaf na and cl content were observed in the almond trees in 2018 at the end of the deficit irrigation period fig 2 3 3 plant water relations and osmotic adjustment the seasonal evolution of stem water potential ψs and leaf water potential ψl during the experimental period for both water sources d and s and irrigation treatments fi and rdi is shown in fig 3a b plants irrigated at full water requirements using desalinated rw maintained the ψs close to 1 0 mpa during the three year experimental period fig 3a by contrast under drought conditions the ψs values progressively decreased in both rdi treatments compared with full irrigation trees reaching values at midday of 2 5 and 2 6 mpa for the s rdi and d rdi treatments respectively at the end of deficit irrigation period in 2018 however these values were never reached in 2019 which was a year characterized by a larger amount of rainfall over the deficit irrigation period and lower evaporative demand compared with 2017 and 2018 fig 1 once full irrigation conditions were restored ψs in the rdi treatments immediately recovered and matched that of the full irrigation trees during the first two growing seasons while in 2019 this recovery took more time especially in s rdi and differences among treatments only disappeared at the end of the experimental period no pronounced differences in ψs were found between trees of both full irrigation treatments d fi and s fi during most of the experimental period although lower ψs values were observed in plants irrigated with saline rw compared with trees irrigated with desalinated rw in 2019 similarly in plants subjected to both rdi 3 years after the beginning of the irrigation with reclaimed water s rdi plants had the lowest ψs as expected ψs and ψl were higher in general in the trees of both full irrigation treatments than in both rdi treatments although ψs measured at midday showed lower variability than ψl fig 3a b thus ψs was able to detect differences among treatments to a greater extent than ψl the application of the rdi strategy with desalinated or saline rw reduced the leaf osmotic potential ψo values compared with d fi during the water stress periods which induced similar values of leaf turgor potential ψt in the d fi and s rdi treatments and even higher in d rdi at the end of the deficit period in 2019 fig 3c the lowest values for ψt were found in d rdi trees reaching a value of 0 5 mpa during the rdi period in 2018 coinciding with the lowest value of ψs fig 3d at the end of the deficit irrigation periods in 2018 and 2019 leaf osmotic potential values at full turgor ψ100s decreased in trees irrigated with saline rw s fi and s rdi especially under the combination of saline reclaimed water and regulated deficit irrigation s rdi table 3 this reduction was indicative of the osmotic adjustment that took place in these trees as a consequence of the irrigation 0 37 mpa and 0 79 mpa for s fi and s rdi treatments respectively 3 4 leaf gas exchange stomatal conductance gs and the photosynthetic rate pn are shown in fig 4 the trees subjected to both deficit irrigation treatments showed lower gs values than the full irrigated trees during the rdi period especially in the case of trees irrigated with desalinated rw in 2018 fig 4a such reductions with respect to the full irrigation trees were also observed in photosynthesis levels although the differences were less marked fig 4b once well watered conditions were restored both the pn and gs values of the plants that had been exposed to deficit irrigation showed recovery with respect to the full irrigation treatments and similar values of pn and gs were obtained in all treatments at the end of each growing season trees irrigated at full water requirements using saline water reduced pn with respect to d fi in 2019 3 years after the beginning of the saline irrigation at that time the lowest pn values were found in s rdi plants this is when the two constraints were combined in general trees subjected to rdi treatments showed higher pn gs ratios intrinsic water use efficiency than full irrigated trees during the deficit irrigation period but these differences between treatments disappeared when irrigation was restored fig 4c all treatments showed a decline in leaf transpiration rate e as the evaporative demand of the atmosphere increased whereas more pronounced e reductions were found in d rdi and s rdi treatments in response to a decrease in the irrigation amount fig 4d this parameter changed in the rdi treatments according to the irrigation applied in each phase in the rdi treatments when irrigation pattern was changed the trees increased or decreased their leaf transpiration e and adjusted to the new conditions but with some particular characteristics when trees were exposed to deficit irrigation after full irrigation conditions plants of both rdi treatments restricted their e in relation to the full irrigation trees this reduction was earlier and more marked in plants irrigated with desalinated rw while the leaf rate readjustment in s rdi took more time and during the first deficit irrigation period the leaf transpiration rate of s rdi was similar to that of full irrigation plants despite the lower levels of water applied fig 4d once well watered conditions were restored the e in d rdi plants quickly recovered and their e matched that of trees that had been well irrigated since the beginning of the experiment in contrast e values in the s rdi plants increased more slowly and even were significantly lower than that in full irrigated trees at the end of growing season in 2017 the net photosynthetic rates pn decreased as stomatal conductance decreased particularly when gs was below 150 mmol m 2 s 1 fig 5a in addition plants showed higher pn gs ratios when stomatal conductance decreased from maximum to around 100 mmol m 2 s 1 but when g 100 mmol m 2 s 1 the decline in pn gs was more pronounced fig 5b only trees of the d rdi treatment reached gs values below 100 mmol m 2 s 1 during the deficit irrigation period fig 6 presents the response of gs for all treatments to the decline of ψs stomatal conductance was maintained relatively high until ψs reached at about 1 2 mpa afterwards it declined gradually and by the time ψs was below 2 mpa gs was lower than 100 mmol m 2 s 1 4 discussion fruit trees in general have demonstrated wide variability in their reaction to water stress and salinity variations in plant growth have been previously used to identify water or salt tolerant plants tattini and traversi 2008 sidari et al 2008 in our experiment shoot growth in prunus dulcis plants was more influenced by the irrigation with saline reclaimed water than by water deficit however pedrero et al 2015 irrigated young grapefruit trees for 3 consecutive years with saline rw with the same level of salinity used in our essay ec 3 ds m 1 reporting no reductions of the canopy volume which confirms the differences between species and points to the higher relative salt sensitivity of almond compared with grapefruit when using reclaimed water the effects of salinity and water stress on plant growth were additive as trees submitted to rdi combined with saline rw had the lowest values of shoot length and trunk diameter as previously reported by glenn et al 2012 each of the different stresses tested in our study caused differences in growth responses of p dulcis indicating that the kind of stress and their interaction are key factors to success when using reclaimed water and or regulated deficit irrigation strategies in contrast to shoot length trunk diameter was not reduced by saline rw irrigation under full irrigation while trees submitted to both deficit irrigation treatments showed the lowest values of trunk diameter therefore in almond trees trunk growth was more sensitive to water deficit than to salinity the reported differential response between shoot elongation and trunk diameter to salinity and deficit irrigation might be attributed to the variation in the time required by salts to affect each parameter in fact not all growth parameters are similarly affected by ionic and osmotic stress this result is in agreement with munns and tester 2008 who reported that the reduction in growth parameters like plant size or trunk cross sectional area is evident much later than the reduction in cell production in young leaves p dulcis plants can cope with water shortage during kernel filling or irrigation with saline rw with no important reduction in growth however growth was markedly reduced by the combination of saline reclaimed water and regulated deficit irrigation which is a negative aspect as the reduction of the tree canopy could affect the crop fruit load potential yield nicolás et al 2016 romero trigueros et al 2017 in general an increase in na and cl concentration in the irrigation water led to an accumulation of na and cl in the plant tissues of numerous species munns and tester 2008 zrig et at 2015 álvarez et al 2018 momenpour et al 2018 in our study higher na and cl contents were observed in the leaves of p dulcis trees irrigated with s correlating with their lower shoot growth acosta motos et al 2017 under salt stress conditions the ability to control the na and or cl contents of the leaves minimizing entry through the roots retaining ions in the roots and lower stem and or limiting transport to the aerial parts is a crucial mechanism that can result in improved plant growth and survival under saline conditions pérez alfocea et al 2000 colmer et al 2005 in the present study p dulcis were not able to retain na and cl in the woody parts of the tree especially for cl ions although the retention and transport of each ion was different as previously reported by tattini and traversi 2008 trees irrigated with saline rw of 3 ds m 1 ec increased their cl content in leaves especially in s rdi while the increase in the na content was similarly for both levels of irrigation regardless the amount of water the greater decline in plant growth observed in the almond trees submitted to rdi combined with saline rw could be attributed to excessive cl in leaves indeed in certain species cl toxicity seems to be more severe than na fornes et al 2007 in plants exposed to water deficit turgor maintenance is usually obtained by means of increasing concentrations of solutes as a consequence of cell volume reduction which has been described as more efficient that turgor maintenance achieved through the production of organic solutes navarro et al 2009 turner 2018 in our assay the almond trees exposed to rdi reduced leaf osmotic potential as a tolerance mechanism to drought which allow trees to maintain the high cell turgor pressure values in addition the irrigation with saline rw pointed to lower values of leaf osmotic potential at full turgor in almond trees which is indicative of the osmotic adjustment process that occurs in these trees as previously found in almond trees subjected to similar salinity levels shibli et al 2003 zrig et al 2015 however osmotic adjustment was not observed in almond trees exposed to water deficit when irrigated with desalinated rw similar observations are described in other species grown under salinity and water stress where lower osmotic adjustment was found in water stress than in salt stress sucre and suárez 2011 álvarez et al 2012 2018 the osmotic adjustment can be achieved by uptake the inorganic ion from the soil solution or by synthesis of organic solutes the latter being the more cost effective strategy slama et al 2008 this could indicate that these solutes na and cl were responsible for the osmotic adjustment observed in almond plants when irrigated with saline rw zrig et al 2015 found that cl and na were the main osmolytes involved in osmotic adjustment in almonds subjected to salinity however this mechanism of leaf turgor maintenance by the accumulation of inorganic solutes especially cl can have deleterious effects on the plant pérez pérez et al 2007 in the present investigation it appeared that the high accumulation of cl in leaves of both s especially s rdi may have been responsible for the reduction in growth and death of older leaves observed in these plants plant water status measured by the leaf and water potential decreased in almond exposed to water deficit or irrigated with saline rw indicating a slight dehydration in these plants zrig et al 2015 espadafor et al 2017 during the first two years the lowest values of the ψs and ψl were observed in d rdi producing the lowest values of stomatal conductance and leaf transpiration rate however in the last year of the experiment 2019 the lowest values were observed for plants irrigated with s especially when combined with rdi due to the accumulation of salts together with passive dehydration slama et al 2008 álvarez and sánchez blanco 2015 reported that stem water potential measured at midday can be used as an indicator of the stress resulting from water and salt stress in c laevis plants not only with salinity and water deficit separately but also when combined a similar response was also noted in our essay with p dulcis when saline and desalinated reclaimed water was used for irrigation combined with rdi as ψs was the most discriminating indicator for these stresses choné et al 2001 p dulcis is considered a species with high stomatal sensitivity to water deficit that prevents xylem cavitation by controlling stomatal function espadafor et al 2017 studies aimed at developing regulated deficit irrigation strategies in almonds have reported that plant water status had a dominant role in controlling stomatal closure and the reduction in stomatal conductance was attributed to a decrease in leaf and stem water potential the results of this study are consistent with the finding of shackel 2007 who reported a reduction of 50 in gs when ψs was 1 4 to 1 8 mpa a level of water stress that may be moderate for almond as values as low as 4 0 mpa have been reported for severe stress levels the decline in gs observed in the present work in response to the lowering of ψs suggests a high sensitivity to almond to water deficit in this sense almond trees are able to adapt to a reduced moisture level in the soil and as a result leaf transpiration rate e is reduced espadafor et al 2017 in our experiment environmental conditions and level of irrigation applied clearly affected transpiration as pointed out by phogat et al 2013 álvarez et al 2013 and fereres et al 2014 although the amount of water applied was the same in both rdi treatments the lowest values for both e and gs were found in the trees submitted to rdi combined with desalinated rw for the first two years and in trees submitted to rdi combined with saline rw for the third year this indicates that these parameters do not only depend on the amount of water applied but also on the ec of the water applied the inhibition of transpiration under deficit irrigation or salinity is seen as an adaptation and it is one of the key mechanisms allowing plans to reduce water losses delay the onset of more severe stress under drought conditions and limit the accumulation of toxic ions in the shoots in plants exposed to salinity evapotranspiration reductions have been attributed to lower stomatal conductance in the short term and to the reduction in leaf area in the long term as stress increases ali et al 2012 espadafor et al 2017 in this sense wilting and a great leaf loss was observed during the last growing season in s rdi treatment when salt injury became evident in the old leaves a decline in pn due to irrigation with saline reclaimed water has also been described in a variety of species such as carrizo citrange a plant sensitive to salinity pérez pérez et al 2007 or in m communis an ornamental plant tolerant to salinity acosta motos et al 2014 nevertheless this parameter is not always decreased by the irrigation with reclaimed water nicolás et al 2016 reported that the rates of photosynthesis were not reduced in mandarin trees after six years irrigating with reclaimed water with the same salt level 3 ds m 1 and hassena et al 2018 mentioned that irrigation with treated wastewater significantly increased the pn in young olive trees in similar experimental conditions as indicated in the results no pronounced differences in photosynthesis were observed during the first two years of the experiment between plants irrigated under full irrigation regardless the quality of the water source d fi and s fi however the cumulative effect of irrigation with saline rw 3 ds m 1 for a longer period 3 years was a reduction of pn in our study trees submitted to the combination of water deficit and saline rw showed a small degree of pn reduction during the first two years however the third year the reduction in pn and gs was more pronounced in s rdi than in d rdi plants several works have verified that the morphological and physiological responses of plants to the combination of water and salt stress are more complex than a simple additive effect of water and salt stress applied individually mittler 2006 pérez pérez et al 2007 some studies have shown that drought may magnify the adverse effects of salinity reporting more negative impact on plant growth than their individual effects álvarez and sánchez blanco 2015 however numerous studies have demonstrated that the addition of salt to plants submitted to water deficit actually has a positive effect on biomass accumulation in several species and found that salinity mitigates the deleterious effects of water stress and enhances plant survival glenn and brown 1998 martinez et al 2005 alla et al 2011 sucre and suárez 2011 glenn et al 2012 álvarez and sánchez blanco 2014 2015 in c citrinus and c laevis reported that if plants show gs values below 100 mmol m 2 s 1 for long periods reductions in pn are mainly caused by non stomatal factors and intrinsic water use efficiency is sharply reduced which could delay plant relief or cause irreversibly effects as indicated in the results the values of gs observed in our study were maintained relatively high being above 200 mmol m 2 s 1 during most of the experiment while gs values lower than 100 mmol m 2 s 1 corresponding to ψs 2 mpa were only observed occasionally in this sense the subsequent recovery in pn that occurred in these plants when irrigation was restored suggest that water stress did no cause irreversible damage to leaf tissue indicating that the maximal psii primary photochemistry was not permanently affected by the stressful conditions experienced by plants and leaves can recover photosynthetic capacity after stress álvarez et al 2018 5 conclusion our results showed that although both regulated deficit irrigation and saline reclaimed water slightly decrease tree vegetative growth in prunus dulcis plants displayed different morphological and physiological responses to each stress being different between water and salt stress and the combination of both stresses the use of desalinated reclaimed water of low conductivity 1 ds m 1 combined or not with rdi treatment is a viable irrigation management strategy for saving water without compromising the overall performance of the almond trees the tolerance of p dulcis to drought was related to an effective mechanism of stomatal control and its ability to recover water status and photosynthesis capacity accompanied by an increased water use efficiency pn gs ratio which are aspect positives of deficit irrigation prunus dulcis responded to irrigation with saline reclaimed water of moderate conductivity 3 ds m 1 combined or not with rdi treatment by reducing vegetative growth restricting na accumulation in leaves in a great extent than cl and showing osmotic adjustment thought prunus dulcis appears to develop mechanisms to confront drought and salt stress separately saline reclaimed water combined with deficit irrigation is not recommended due to it reduced photosynthesis affected the capacity of plants to recover water and carbon balance after water stress and induced a great reduction in growth due to leaf tissue dehydration and the high content of cl and na accumulated in leaves based on the results of this study desalinated and saline reclaimed water can be used as additional water resources for almond tree irrigation the use of desalinated rw could be successfully applied combined or not with rdi strategies while the use of saline rw could be only recommended if full irrigation is carried out so to ensure the sustainability of almond trees this finding should be borne in mind when deciding irrigation strategies for use

9854,regulated deficit irrigation rdi strategy using reclaimed water rw is becoming a common procedure in some mediterranean regions full and regulated deficit irrigation were combined with desalinated ecw 1 ds m 1 and saline ecw 3 ds m 1 reclaimed water to irrigate young potted almond trees over a 3 year period the full irrigation treatments received 130 of the crop evapotranspiration etc and the rdi treatments received 80 of etc during the kernel filling trunk diameter decreased in both rdi treatments at the end of the experimental period although this response was more marked in the trees irrigated with saline rw there were negative relationships between shoot growth and leaf na and cl contents in the saline treated trees in which the accumulation of salts in leaves was associated with osmotic adjustment which was responsible for maintaining midday leaf turgor plant water status measured by the leaf and water potential decreased in almond exposed to water deficit or irrigated with saline rw indicating a slight dehydration in these plants due to the difficulty in water uptake from the substrate trees subjected to both deficit irrigation treatments showed lower stomatal conductance values than full irrigated treatments during the rdi period however at the end of experimental period the lowest pn values were found in plants irrigated with saline rw especially in trees irrigated with saline rw combined with rdi strategy verifying the relevance of duration of exposure to the stress saline and desalinated rw can be successfully used for irrigating almond trees which might be of great economic and competitive significance for agriculture but further research focused on a longer term should be carried out since detrimental effects might appear deficit

relations 1 introduction water shortages are very frequent in many countries and together with the rising demand for industry growth of human population climate change and specifically the trend towards irrigated agriculture have led to widespread problems of water scarcity especially in mediterranean countries romero trigueros et al 2020 this situation imposes the need to optimize its use in all human activities fulcher et al 2016 álvarez et al 2019 among the different productive uses of water agriculture is by far the main water user in most water scarce regions and consequently any potential improvement in the use of the available water resources may play a role toward achieving a more sustainable use of water fereres and soriano 2007 alcon et al 2013 stakeholders involved in water resource management are looking for knowledge necessary to successfully irrigation management to achieve this objective several water conservation strategies have been recommended for example by using precise tools for assessing crop water requirements mirás avalos et al 2016 reclaimed water grant et al 2012 nicolás et al 2018 erel et al 2019 drought and salt tolerant genotypes or rootstocks yadollahi et al 2011 jiménez et al 2013 álvarez et al 2020 applying deficit irrigation strategies ruiz sánchez et al 2010 romero trigueros et al 2019a sánchez blanco et al 2019 and providing information about the water use requirements of the trees depending on the phenological periods varying goldhamer and beede 2004 almond prunus dulcis mill d a webb is a major tree nut species whose production and proﬁtability are highly dependent on irrigation supply egea et al 2010 especially in regions such as the mediterranean basin characterized by low rainfall and high evaporative demand during the almond growing season the physiological and morphological response of almond to different irrigation levels has been extensively investigated torrecillas et al 1988 shackel 2007 egea et al 2010 espadafor et al 2017 one of the most promising techniques to maximize the water use in tree crops with little or no impact on crop yield and quality is regulated deficit irrigation rdi which is defined as an irrigation strategy that provides irrigation water below the full needs for specific development stages past research has revealed the interest of this irrigation technique with special attention paid to fruit crops including almonds where it has been successfully employed goldhamer and viveros 2000 girona et al 2005 romero and botía 2006 stewart et al 2011 due to the increasing pressure on fresh water resources the use of saline waters and reclaimed water rw has become a reliable alternative for irrigation in agriculture acosta motos et al 2016 romero trigueros et al 2019b this situation imposes the need to use non conventional water resources desalinated or reclaimed water for irrigation saline rw has been successfully used in several fruit crops like citrus nicolás et al 2016 olive erel et al 2019 and other species pedrero et al 2018 perulli et al 2019 the main conclusions from these studies are that treated wastewater can be used as an additional water resource for tree irrigation in water scarce mediterranean environments little information is available on the effect of using saline or reclaimed water to irrigate almond trees although they represent an important section of fruit trees production and such information be of great interest for designing and promoting water conservation strategies phogat et al 2018 notably the studies related to salinity in almonds are speciﬁcally focused on the evaluation of salt tolerance in genotypes rouhi et al 2007 dejampour et al 2012 rajabpoor et al 2014 bahrami et al 2015 and rootstocks doll et al 2014 momenpour et al 2018 research on the physiological performance of p dulcis irrigated with rw is still lacking as the previous studies about salinity tolerance of almonds have been conducted just on irrigation nacl solutions and it is well known that the chemical properties of the water applied also affect the response of plant being the kind of water a relevant aspect gómez bellot et al 2013 in addition increasing water resource problems in arid regions are even leading to growers to use the rw combined with deficit strategies mounzer et al 2013 many works have focused on water and salt stress applied individually but very few have evaluated the physiological changes that take place when both stresses applied simultaneously despite the fact of being known that the response by plants to combination of these two stresses may differ if water and salt stress applied individually or simultaneously brown et al 2006 sucre and suárez 2011 glenn et al 2012 in general under saline or drought conditions plants reduce their water uptake capacity but using irrigation waters with high salt concentrations can also cause ion toxicities and nutritional imbalance depending on the kind of salts in the irrigation water acosta motos et al 2014 in this sense rw may contain high concentrations of salts and in consequence their use in irrigation for long term may have negative effects on soils and plants ayers and westcot 1985 particularly for those crops relatively sensitive to salinity such as almonds phogat et al 2018 it is for these reasons that reducing salt concentration in these water resources leading to desalinated rw could be an interesting option to reduce problems associated with salinity providing different solutions to agriculture of arid and semi arid environments however studies regarding the physiological effects of the irrigation with rw on almond trees are lacking the short term response in term of growth and yield of almond trees to irrigation with desalinated and saline rw combined with rdi strategy during 1 year has been well described in a previous study vivaldi et al 2019 but no information is available on its physiological response of several years of irrigation with these non conventional water resources due to that the response of plants to salinity depends not only on the water composition but also on the time of exposure to salt stress nicolás et al 2016 the present work was carried out over a three year period in p dulcis using the same trees tested by vivaldi et al 2019 but after two additional growing seasons three seasons in total from 2017 to 2019 the main objective of this research was to study the mid term effects on young almond potted trees exposed to rw and different irrigation strategies with special interest in plant growth ion accumulation and tree water status in order to identify the mechanisms that the plants develop to cope with these stresses for this a three year experiment was designed to evaluate single and interaction effects of different levels of irrigation and salinity in an attempt to check the sustainability of these irrigation strategies and to identify the most adequate in each context the results can also be important contributions to scheduling irrigation strategies in water scarce regions where low quality waters are often combined with deficit irrigation strategies as well as making more sustainable almond crop production in regions with limited water resources our working hypothesis were responses of almonds irrigated with reclaimed water would be different from those of trees irrigated with saline water with the same level of salinity degree of salt stress tolerance would be correlated with the ability to control ion accumulation in leaves and reclaimed water would confer a protective effect on water stress tolerance as observed for other species 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material and experimental conditions the study was performed during three consecutive seasons 2017 2019 in an experimental orchard cultivated with 3 years old in 2017 almond trees prunus dulcis mill d a webb cv guara grafted on a hybrid rootpak 20 of prunus besey prunus cerasifera l h bailey and ehrh plants were transplanted in january 2017 into 100 l polyethylene pots diameter 50 cm height 65 cm filled with soil the soil texture was classified as loam 44 78 sand 12 32 clay and 42 90 silt usda textural soil classification plants were placed outdoors in a plot in the university of bari experimental station located in the southeast of italy bari apulia region 41 06 41 n 16 52 57 e 5 m above sea level pots were on the ground with a 1 85 2 10 m planting system in rows oriented n ne to s sw the climate data were recorded by an automatic weather station located about 100 m from the experimental site air temperature solar radiation air relatively humidity rainfall and wind speed 2 5 m above the soil surface were collected every 15 min these data were used for calculating et0 and crop water requirements all treatments received the same amounts of fertilizer n p2o5 k2o applied through the drip irrigation system pest control practices and pruning were those commonly used by growers in the area and no weeds were allowed to develop in the pots 2 2 treatments two irrigation water sources were used the first was desalinated rw d produced on the desert prototype and obtained by treating secondary wastewater from the bari italy secondary wastewater treatment plant using ultrafiltration active carbon and reverse osmosis to reach an ecw of 1 0 ds m 1 desert low cost water desalination and sensor technology is an innovative water desalination compact module that enhances the energy savings by using solar energy developed in the framework of the desert european project water jpi 2016 the second source was saline rw s obtained by mixing the secondary wastewater from bari swtp with the brine produced in the desert prototype reaching a final ecw of 3 ds m 1 for each water source two irrigation treatments were established the full irrigation fi treatments involved irrigation with d or s during the whole season at 130 etc d fi and s fi respectively the rdi treatments consisted of irrigation at 130 etc except during the kernel filling when received 80 of the etc from late june to early august 35 40 days d rdi and s rdi irrigation was applied each year from march to october therefore four irrigation treatments based on the water quality of the irrigation source and water quantity were performed the irrigation treatments consisted of a desalinated full irrigation treatment d fi irrigated through the growing season to fully satisfy crop water requirements using desalinated reclaimed water a saline full irrigation treatment s fi using saline reclaimed water and two regulated deficit irrigation treatments desalinated regulated deficit irrigation d rdi plants were irrigated using desalinated rw and saline regulated deficit irrigation s rdi plants were irrigated using saline rw the irrigation doses were scheduled on the basis of the daily crop evapotranspiration etc calculated by the water balance method etc was calculated using the following equation recommended by fao etc kr kc et0 where kr is the reduction coefficient kr 0 75 kc is the crop coefficient as described by vivaldi et al 2019 and et0 is reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated by penman monteith equation using climate data provided by the climate station located 100 m from the experiment the water was supplied by drip irrigation with three pressure compensated drippers per tree each with a flow rate of 2 l h 1 trees were irrigated daily during the three year experiment the irrigation was controlled automatically by a head unit programmer and the amount of water applied for each irrigation treatment were measured with in line flowmeters placed in each treatment a total of 40 trees made up this assay 10 per treatment each irrigation treatment had five replicates distributed in a completely randomized design each replicate consisted of two trees 2 3 water quality the inorganic solute content ph and ecw of each irrigation water source were assessed monthly during the irrigation season in 2017 2018 and 2019 the samples were collected in glass bottles transported in an ice chest to the laboratory and stored at 5 c before processed for chemical and physical analyzes the concentrations of na k ca 2 b 3 and mg were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp icap 6500

ph was measured with a ph meter crison 507 crison instruments s a barcelona spain 2 4 plant growth and water status measurements at the beginning and at the end of each growing season trunk diameter was measured in five trees per treatment with a sliding caliper 0 20 m above the soil surface shoot length values were collected during growing period in 2018 by measuring the length of two shoots for each tree and four trees per treatment and the relative growth rate rgr was calculated as the rate of increase of length per unit of initial shoot length at the end of growing period in 2018 twenty leaves per tree in four trees per treatment were washed with distilled water and dried at 80 c before stored at room temperature for inorganic solute analyzes the concentration of cl was analyzed by chloride analyzer chloride analyser model 926 sherwood scientific ltd in the aqueous extracts obtained when mixing 100 mg of dry vegetable powder with 40 ml of water before shaking for 30 min and

test for relationship between leaf ion concentrations and rgr of shoot length 3 results 3 1 irrigation water quality and volume applied significant differences on the water quality were found between the two irrigation sources during the whole experiment table 1 saline reclaimed water s had high salinity with ecw values 3 ds m 1 higher than those measured in the desalinated reclaimed water d 1 1 1 ds m 1 s also increased the concentrations of some nutrients such as no3 po4 3 so4 2 k mg and ca 2 with respect to d whereas the concentration of b 3 remained invariable the high na concentration observed in s also increased the water sodium adsorption ratio sarw level from a mean value close to 4 6 meq l 0 5 observed in the d source to about 6 7 meq l 0 5 in the s source it is also noteworthy that concentrations of phytotoxic elements such as na and cl concentrations were clearly different in each irrigation water source d had lower na and cl concentration as a result of desalination process reaching on the average values of na 165 mg l 1 and cl 211 mg l 1 as compared to the s 328 for na and 416 mg l 1 for cl the mean annual et0 and rainfall for the three experimental seasons were 1291 and 586 mm fig 1 the amounts of irrigation water applied in 2017 2018 and 2019 in the full irrigation treatments were 368 246 and 221 mm while in the rdi treatments were 305 201 and 184 mm respectively which meant reductions of about 20 each year in the rdi treatments fig 1 3 2 plant growth and leaf mineral concentrations regulated deficit irrigation and reclaimed water affected the growth and size of the almond trees and a significant decrease in trunk diameter and shoot length compared with d fi trees was measured during the experimental period however the specific response depended on the treatment and parameter in question throughout the experiment trunk diameter was similar in all treatments but began to be inhibited three years after application of the rdi table 2 at the end of the experimental period trunk diameter was significantly inhibited by both rdi compared to full irrigation trees the smallest plants 4 2 cm being those subjected to rdi combined with saline rw as regard rgr as a function of shoot length no differences between the d fi and d rdi treatments were observed but lower rates were found in the trees irrigated with saline rw fig 2 f 17 91 p 0 00003 while no accumulation of na and cl was found in the leaves of trees submitted to d rdi treatment compared with d fi treatment the contents of both ions increased in the leaves of the trees irrigated with saline rw fig 2 in all treatments the cl content in the leaves was markedly higher than the corresponding of na content between 12 and 30 fold higher despite that the concentrations of both ions in the irrigation water were similar 7 0 and 5 5 mmol l 1 in d 11 7 and 10 6 mmol l 1 in s for na and cl respectively this means that p dulcis plants are able to restrict na accumulation in leaves to a greater extent than cl thus the trees increased their leaf cl content sharply reaching a value of 2 4 in s rdi plants the highest cl value was measured in leaves of s rdi plants while the highest na value was in s fi which means that the retention and transport of both ions was different significant relationships between rgr and leaf na and cl content were observed in the almond trees in 2018 at the end of the deficit irrigation period fig 2 3 3 plant water relations and osmotic adjustment the seasonal evolution of stem water potential ψs and leaf water potential ψl during the experimental period for both water sources d and s and irrigation treatments fi and rdi is shown in fig 3a b plants irrigated at full water requirements using desalinated rw maintained the ψs close to 1 0 mpa during the three year experimental period fig 3a by contrast under drought conditions the ψs values progressively decreased in both rdi treatments compared with full irrigation trees reaching values at midday of 2 5 and 2 6 mpa for the s rdi and d rdi treatments respectively at the end of deficit irrigation period in 2018 however these values were never reached in 2019 which was a year characterized by a larger amount of rainfall over the deficit irrigation period and lower evaporative demand compared with 2017 and 2018 fig 1 once full irrigation conditions were restored ψs in the rdi treatments immediately recovered and matched that of the full irrigation trees during the first two growing seasons while in 2019 this recovery took more time especially in s rdi and differences among treatments only disappeared at the end of the experimental period no pronounced differences in ψs were found between trees of both full irrigation treatments d fi and s fi during most of the experimental period although lower ψs values were observed in plants irrigated with saline rw compared with trees irrigated with desalinated rw in 2019 similarly in plants subjected to both rdi 3 years after the beginning of the irrigation with reclaimed water s rdi plants had the lowest ψs as expected ψs and ψl were higher in general in the trees of both full irrigation treatments than in both rdi treatments although ψs measured at midday showed lower variability than ψl fig 3a b thus ψs was able to detect differences among treatments to a greater extent than ψl the application of the rdi strategy with desalinated or saline rw reduced the leaf osmotic potential ψo values compared with d fi during the water stress periods which induced similar values of leaf turgor potential ψt in the d fi and s rdi treatments and even higher in d rdi at the end of the deficit period in 2019 fig 3c the lowest values for ψt were found in d rdi trees reaching a value of 0 5 mpa during the rdi period in 2018 coinciding with the lowest value of ψs fig 3d at the end of the deficit irrigation periods in 2018 and 2019 leaf osmotic potential values at full turgor ψ100s decreased in trees irrigated with saline rw s fi and s rdi especially under the combination of saline reclaimed water and regulated deficit irrigation s rdi table 3 this reduction was indicative of the osmotic adjustment that took place in these trees as a consequence of the irrigation 0 37 mpa and 0 79 mpa for s fi and s rdi treatments respectively 3 4 leaf gas exchange stomatal conductance gs and the photosynthetic rate pn are shown in fig 4 the trees subjected to both deficit irrigation treatments showed lower gs values than the full irrigated trees during the rdi period especially in the case of trees irrigated with desalinated rw in 2018 fig 4a such reductions with respect to the full irrigation trees were also observed in photosynthesis levels although the differences were less marked fig 4b once well watered conditions were restored both the pn and gs values of the plants that had been exposed to deficit irrigation showed recovery with respect to the full irrigation treatments and similar values of pn and gs were obtained in all treatments at the end of each growing season trees irrigated at full water requirements using saline water reduced pn with respect to d fi in 2019 3 years after the beginning of the saline irrigation at that time the lowest pn values were found in s rdi plants this is when the two constraints were combined in general trees subjected to rdi treatments showed higher pn gs ratios intrinsic water use efficiency than full irrigated trees during the deficit irrigation period but these differences between treatments disappeared when irrigation was restored fig 4c all treatments showed a decline in leaf transpiration rate e as the evaporative demand of the atmosphere increased whereas more pronounced e reductions were found in d rdi and s rdi treatments in response to a decrease in the irrigation amount fig 4d this parameter changed in the rdi treatments according to the irrigation applied in each phase in the rdi treatments when irrigation pattern was changed the trees increased or decreased their leaf transpiration e and adjusted to the new conditions but with some particular characteristics when trees were exposed to deficit irrigation after full irrigation conditions plants of both rdi treatments restricted their e in relation to the full irrigation trees this reduction was earlier and more marked in plants irrigated with desalinated rw while the leaf rate readjustment in s rdi took more time and during the first deficit irrigation period the leaf transpiration rate of s rdi was similar to that of full irrigation plants despite the lower levels of water applied fig 4d once well watered conditions were restored the e in d rdi plants quickly recovered and their e matched that of trees that had been well irrigated since the beginning of the experiment in contrast e values in the s rdi plants increased more slowly and even were significantly lower than that in full irrigated trees at the end of growing season in 2017 the net photosynthetic rates pn decreased as stomatal conductance decreased particularly when gs was below 150 mmol m 2 s 1 fig 5a in addition plants showed higher pn gs ratios when stomatal conductance decreased from maximum to around 100 mmol m 2 s 1 but when g 100 mmol m 2 s 1 the decline in pn gs was more pronounced fig 5b only trees of the d rdi treatment reached gs values below 100 mmol m 2 s 1 during the deficit irrigation period fig 6 presents the response of gs for all treatments to the decline of ψs stomatal conductance was maintained relatively high until ψs reached at about 1 2 mpa afterwards it declined gradually and by the time ψs was below 2 mpa gs was lower than 100 mmol m 2 s 1 4 discussion fruit trees in general have demonstrated wide variability in their reaction to water stress and salinity variations in plant growth have been previously used to identify water or salt tolerant plants tattini and traversi 2008 sidari et al 2008 in our experiment shoot growth in prunus dulcis plants was more influenced by the irrigation with saline reclaimed water than by water deficit however pedrero et al 2015 irrigated young grapefruit trees for 3 consecutive years with saline rw with the same level of salinity used in our essay ec 3 ds m 1 reporting no reductions of the canopy volume which confirms the differences between species and points to the higher relative salt sensitivity of almond compared with grapefruit when using reclaimed water the effects of salinity and water stress on plant growth were additive as trees submitted to rdi combined with saline rw had the lowest values of shoot length and trunk diameter as previously reported by glenn et al 2012 each of the different stresses tested in our study caused differences in growth responses of p dulcis indicating that the kind of stress and their interaction are key factors to success when using reclaimed water and or regulated deficit irrigation strategies in contrast to shoot length trunk diameter was not reduced by saline rw irrigation under full irrigation while trees submitted to both deficit irrigation treatments showed the lowest values of trunk diameter therefore in almond trees trunk growth was more sensitive to water deficit than to salinity the reported differential response between shoot elongation and trunk diameter to salinity and deficit irrigation might be attributed to the variation in the time required by salts to affect each parameter in fact not all growth parameters are similarly affected by ionic and osmotic stress this result is in agreement with munns and tester 2008 who reported that the reduction in growth parameters like plant size or trunk cross sectional area is evident much later than the reduction in cell production in young leaves p dulcis plants can cope with water shortage during kernel filling or irrigation with saline rw with no important reduction in growth however growth was markedly reduced by the combination of saline reclaimed water and regulated deficit irrigation which is a negative aspect as the reduction of the tree canopy could affect the crop fruit load potential yield nicolás et al 2016 romero trigueros et al 2017 in general an increase in na and cl concentration in the irrigation water led to an accumulation of na and cl in the plant tissues of numerous species munns and tester 2008 zrig et at 2015 álvarez et al 2018 momenpour et al 2018 in our study higher na and cl contents were observed in the leaves of p dulcis trees irrigated with s correlating with their lower shoot growth acosta motos et al 2017 under salt stress conditions the ability to control the na and or cl contents of the leaves minimizing entry through the roots retaining ions in the roots and lower stem and or limiting transport to the aerial parts is a crucial mechanism that can result in improved plant growth and survival under saline conditions pérez alfocea et al 2000 colmer et al 2005 in the present study p dulcis were not able to retain na and cl in the woody parts of the tree especially for cl ions although the retention and transport of each ion was different as previously reported by tattini and traversi 2008 trees irrigated with saline rw of 3 ds m 1 ec increased their cl content in leaves especially in s rdi while the increase in the na content was similarly for both levels of irrigation regardless the amount of water the greater decline in plant growth observed in the almond trees submitted to rdi combined with saline rw could be attributed to excessive cl in leaves indeed in certain species cl toxicity seems to be more severe than na fornes et al 2007 in plants exposed to water deficit turgor maintenance is usually obtained by means of increasing concentrations of solutes as a consequence of cell volume reduction which has been described as more efficient that turgor maintenance achieved through the production of organic solutes navarro et al 2009 turner 2018 in our assay the almond trees exposed to rdi reduced leaf osmotic potential as a tolerance mechanism to drought which allow trees to maintain the high cell turgor pressure values in addition the irrigation with saline rw pointed to lower values of leaf osmotic potential at full turgor in almond trees which is indicative of the osmotic adjustment process that occurs in these trees as previously found in almond trees subjected to similar salinity levels shibli et al 2003 zrig et al 2015 however osmotic adjustment was not observed in almond trees exposed to water deficit when irrigated with desalinated rw similar observations are described in other species grown under salinity and water stress where lower osmotic adjustment was found in water stress than in salt stress sucre and suárez 2011 álvarez et al 2012 2018 the osmotic adjustment can be achieved by uptake the inorganic ion from the soil solution or by synthesis of organic solutes the latter being the more cost effective strategy slama et al 2008 this could indicate that these solutes na and cl were responsible for the osmotic adjustment observed in almond plants when irrigated with saline rw zrig et al 2015 found that cl and na were the main osmolytes involved in osmotic adjustment in almonds subjected to salinity however this mechanism of leaf turgor maintenance by the accumulation of inorganic solutes especially cl can have deleterious effects on the plant pérez pérez et al 2007 in the present investigation it appeared that the high accumulation of cl in leaves of both s especially s rdi may have been responsible for the reduction in growth and death of older leaves observed in these plants plant water status measured by the leaf and water potential decreased in almond exposed to water deficit or irrigated with saline rw indicating a slight dehydration in these plants zrig et al 2015 espadafor et al 2017 during the first two years the lowest values of the ψs and ψl were observed in d rdi producing the lowest values of stomatal conductance and leaf transpiration rate however in the last year of the experiment 2019 the lowest values were observed for plants irrigated with s especially when combined with rdi due to the accumulation of salts together with passive dehydration slama et al 2008 álvarez and sánchez blanco 2015 reported that stem water potential measured at midday can be used as an indicator of the stress resulting from water and salt stress in c laevis plants not only with salinity and water deficit separately but also when combined a similar response was also noted in our essay with p dulcis when saline and desalinated reclaimed water was used for irrigation combined with rdi as ψs was the most discriminating indicator for these stresses choné et al 2001 p dulcis is considered a species with high stomatal sensitivity to water deficit that prevents xylem cavitation by controlling stomatal function espadafor et al 2017 studies aimed at developing regulated deficit irrigation strategies in almonds have reported that plant water status had a dominant role in controlling stomatal closure and the reduction in stomatal conductance was attributed to a decrease in leaf and stem water potential the results of this study are consistent with the finding of shackel 2007 who reported a reduction of 50 in gs when ψs was 1 4 to 1 8 mpa a level of water stress that may be moderate for almond as values as low as 4 0 mpa have been reported for severe stress levels the decline in gs observed in the present work in response to the lowering of ψs suggests a high sensitivity to almond to water deficit in this sense almond trees are able to adapt to a reduced moisture level in the soil and as a result leaf transpiration rate e is reduced espadafor et al 2017 in our experiment environmental conditions and level of irrigation applied clearly affected transpiration as pointed out by phogat et al 2013 álvarez et al 2013 and fereres et al 2014 although the amount of water applied was the same in both rdi treatments the lowest values for both e and gs were found in the trees submitted to rdi combined with desalinated rw for the first two years and in trees submitted to rdi combined with saline rw for the third year this indicates that these parameters do not only depend on the amount of water applied but also on the ec of the water applied the inhibition of transpiration under deficit irrigation or salinity is seen as an adaptation and it is one of the key mechanisms allowing plans to reduce water losses delay the onset of more severe stress under drought conditions and limit the accumulation of toxic ions in the shoots in plants exposed to salinity evapotranspiration reductions have been attributed to lower stomatal conductance in the short term and to the reduction in leaf area in the long term as stress increases ali et al 2012 espadafor et al 2017 in this sense wilting and a great leaf loss was observed during the last growing season in s rdi treatment when salt injury became evident in the old leaves a decline in pn due to irrigation with saline reclaimed water has also been described in a variety of species such as carrizo citrange a plant sensitive to salinity pérez pérez et al 2007 or in m communis an ornamental plant tolerant to salinity acosta motos et al 2014 nevertheless this parameter is not always decreased by the irrigation with reclaimed water nicolás et al 2016 reported that the rates of photosynthesis were not reduced in mandarin trees after six years irrigating with reclaimed water with the same salt level 3 ds m 1 and hassena et al 2018 mentioned that irrigation with treated wastewater significantly increased the pn in young olive trees in similar experimental conditions as indicated in the results no pronounced differences in photosynthesis were observed during the first two years of the experiment between plants irrigated under full irrigation regardless the quality of the water source d fi and s fi however the cumulative effect of irrigation with saline rw 3 ds m 1 for a longer period 3 years was a reduction of pn in our study trees submitted to the combination of water deficit and saline rw showed a small degree of pn reduction during the first two years however the third year the reduction in pn and gs was more pronounced in s rdi than in d rdi plants several works have verified that the morphological and physiological responses of plants to the combination of water and salt stress are more complex than a simple additive effect of water and salt stress applied individually mittler 2006 pérez pérez et al 2007 some studies have shown that drought may magnify the adverse effects of salinity reporting more negative impact on plant growth than their individual effects álvarez and sánchez blanco 2015 however numerous studies have demonstrated that the addition of salt to plants submitted to water deficit actually has a positive effect on biomass accumulation in several species and found that salinity mitigates the deleterious effects of water stress and enhances plant survival glenn and brown 1998 martinez et al 2005 alla et al 2011 sucre and suárez 2011 glenn et al 2012 álvarez and sánchez blanco 2014 2015 in c citrinus and c laevis reported that if plants show gs values below 100 mmol m 2 s 1 for long periods reductions in pn are mainly caused by non stomatal factors and intrinsic water use efficiency is sharply reduced which could delay plant relief or cause irreversibly effects as indicated in the results the values of gs observed in our study were maintained relatively high being above 200 mmol m 2 s 1 during most of the experiment while gs values lower than 100 mmol m 2 s 1 corresponding to ψs 2 mpa were only observed occasionally in this sense the subsequent recovery in pn that occurred in these plants when irrigation was restored suggest that water stress did no cause irreversible damage to leaf tissue indicating that the maximal psii primary photochemistry was not permanently affected by the stressful conditions experienced by plants and leaves can recover photosynthetic capacity after stress álvarez et al 2018 5 conclusion our results showed that although both regulated deficit irrigation and saline reclaimed water slightly decrease tree vegetative growth in prunus dulcis plants displayed different morphological and physiological responses to each stress being different between water and salt stress and the combination of both stresses the use of desalinated reclaimed water of low conductivity 1 ds m 1 combined or not with rdi treatment is a viable irrigation management strategy for saving water without compromising the overall performance of the almond trees the tolerance of p dulcis to drought was related to an effective mechanism of stomatal control and its ability to recover water status and photosynthesis capacity accompanied by an increased water use efficiency pn gs ratio which are aspect positives of deficit irrigation prunus dulcis responded to irrigation with saline reclaimed water of moderate conductivity 3 ds m 1 combined or not with rdi treatment by reducing vegetative growth restricting na accumulation in leaves in a great extent than cl and showing osmotic adjustment thought prunus dulcis appears to develop mechanisms to confront drought and salt stress separately saline reclaimed water combined with deficit irrigation is not recommended due to it reduced photosynthesis affected the capacity of plants to recover water and carbon balance after water stress and induced a great reduction in growth due to leaf tissue dehydration and the high content of cl and na accumulated in leaves based on the results of this study desalinated and saline reclaimed water can be used as additional water resources for almond tree irrigation the use of desalinated rw could be successfully applied combined or not with rdi strategies while the use of saline rw could be only recommended if full irrigation is carried out so to ensure the sustainability of almond trees this finding should be borne in mind when deciding irrigation strategies for use
