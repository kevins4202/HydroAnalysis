combined process ecological restoration 1 introduction the water environment is an important part of the urban ecological environment it is also closely related to the health and life of people who depend on water for recreation daily life agricultural production hydroelectric power generation and fishing etc 1 black smelly water bodies are common in china due to the direct discharge of industrial and domestic waste as well as urban and rural water into rivers and it seriously affects the living conditions of local residents the function of the ecosystem and the urban landscape 2 the blackening of the water body is mainly due to the presence of metal sulfides such as fes and mns in the water body and the odor formation is caused by voscs h2s and various algal metabolites 3 4 at present the prevention and control of black smelly rivers in china mainly takes measures such as source pollution treatment garbage removal dredging of silt and ecological restoration through a combination of comprehensive treatment and technical treatment black smelly water bodies are systematically managed 5 the treatment technologies for black smelly water bodies can be divided into four categories physical remediation technologies chemical remediation technologies and biological remediation technologies 6 physical remediation techniques include sediment dredging mulching and deep aeration chemical remediation includes chemical oxidation sedimentation and flocculation which improve water clarity by removing pollutants such as suspended matter dissolved phosphorus and nitrogen 8 chemical process can quickly remediate contaminated river water 9 bioremediation refers to biological measures such as biological absorption transformation removal or degradation of environmental pollutants it mainly includes microbial enhancement technology artificial floating islands artificial wetland technology and filler enhanced purification technology 10 artificial floating islands have a wide range of applications and are effective in purifying polluted water bodies and aquatic plants have good purification effect in wastewater treatment 11 12 although single physical or chemical methods can improve the water quality of water bodies in a short period of time the investment is large and the duration is short traditional biotechnology has problems such as low efficiency large floor space long adaptation time of microorganisms and susceptibility to environmental conditions 13 15 black smelly rivers are formed after a long period of pollution its treatment project is a comprehensive treatment which requires a combination of two or more types of technology to achieve the treatment goal 16 17 in practical application black smelly water bodies are treated with a combination of physical chemical and biological remediation techniques and the treatment effect is better and can achieve the expected treatment effect yuan et al found that the combination of aeration bioaugmentation and biostimulation greatly reduced cod and nitrogen and maintained rich bacterial diversity in rivers polluted with both organic matter and nitrogen integrated treatment is more promising than single treatment 18 wang et al used a combined process of biological contact oxidation and co culture of native microorganisms for pretreatment of black odorous water with high removal efficiency of cod uv254 nh3 n tn and tp 19 the biological contact oxidation method is a method between activated sludge and biofilter combining the advantages of both it does not clog the bed and is less prone to sludge expansion li et al conducted a comparative analysis of two types of conventional biological contact oxidation tanks in which the better treatment had an average removal rate of 56 5 28 1 and 44 2 for cod tn and tp respectively 20 tang et al pretreated surface water by filling the biological contact oxidation process with modified suspended biochemical fillers the average removal rates of this process were 65 16 10 94 39 82 and 19 87 for nh3 n organic pollutants total nitrogen and turbidity respectively 21 the biological contact oxidation process has been widely used it is characterized by high efficiency simple operation and low cost but still has many shortcomings at present in order to solve the problems of carrier biofilm clogging frequent replacement of carriers and nitrogen elimination efficiency that exist in traditional biological contact oxidation the new multi stage biological contact oxidation tank is being further explored to improve the pollutant removal efficiency 22 23 zheng et al used a spiral biocarrier multi stage contact oxidation method to treat beer wastewater under optimal process conditions the system achieved 77 0 87 6 and 92 2 removal of total nitrogen ammonia nitrogen and codcr respectively 24 zhu et al used a physical chemical method to pretreat the experimental automotive painting wastewater and then

actual site treatment of a river in jiangmen city guangdong province the engineering treatment objectives are as follows do 2 0 mg l cod 40 mg l tp 0 4 mg l nh3 n 2 0 mg l 2 materials and research methods 2 1 overview of the project the gonghe river is located in guangdong province china the xianghehuayuan river is a branch of the gonghe river with a total length of 400 m an average width of 3 m and a depth of 0 7 m the river is a black and smelly water body and has characteristics such as seasonality and susceptibility during the heavy rainfall season the water quality of the river is unstable due to rain and surface runoff resulting in its blackness and odor the pollution source is mainly the domestic sewage discharged by nearby residents and the volume of domestic sewage is 250 300 m3 d part of the sewage can be collected and treated by pipeline however the sewage forms backflow in the rainy season so that the water quality and substrate of the drainage channel are subject to long term pollution and the land around the river is being developed there is soil erosion the river is seriously silted up and there are more weeds on both sides of the slope which affects the smooth drainage of the river this has led to a reduction in the flood discharge capacity of the xianghehuayuan river the water system map is shown in fig 1 2 2 water quality characteristics the water quality of the river was analyzed for 4 weeks before the start of the project s1 and s2 in fig 1 the average value of each analysis result was taken the results showed that the indicators failed to meet the inferior grade v quality specified in the chinese environmental quality standard for surface water gb3838 2002 the water quality characteristics of the river are shown in table 1 as can be seen in table 1 the ph had reached the requirement of the inferior grade v quality before treatment therefore this indicator parameter is not emphasized in the subsequent text 2 3 water quality analysis methods water quality analysis includes ph transparency dissolved oxygen chemical oxygen demand ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus analysis the analytical methods for water quality are divided into chemical analysis and instrumental analysis the analytical methods refer to the analytical methods for water and wastewater monitoring 4th edition of the state environmental protection administration the ph is determined using as218 portable ph agent sigma guangzhou china transparency is determined using xh ssp model of sai disc xinhu shanghai china determination of do using do8500 portable dissolved oxygen meter sanshin shanghai china determination of codcr is performed using the potassium dichromate method hj828 2017 nh3 n is determined using sodium reagent photometric method hj535 2009 tp is determined using ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method gb11893 89 2 4 technology route considering the on site conditions of the river first the exogenous pollution of the river was reduced through interception and source control then the endogenous pollution of the river was reduced by in situ treatment finally pollutants were degraded by biological contact oxidation basin artificial aeration system and ecological floating island system the technical route of this project is shown in fig 2 2 4 1 interception and source control in this project the point source pollution of the river was mainly the outfall located in the upstream which was equal to the width of the river the sewage flowed directly from the upstream into the river in large quantities resulting in the river s black odor in response to the above situation a filtration slope was set up upstream to pretreat the effluent from its outfall and minimize the impact of the combined rainwater and sewage flow on the water quality of the river the filter slope was composed of a highly efficient materializer package with good water permeability as the river flowed from upstream through the filter slope the water came into full contact with the agent package the pollutants in the water react with the highly effective physical and chemical agents thus the pollutant content was reduced considering that the filter slope had a certain image to the flooding capacity and landscape of the river when the river regained a certain self purification capacity the filter slope was removed the surface source pollution of the experimental river is mainly rainwater and sewage accompanied by soil erosion on both banks as the two rivers are in the development stage there is soil erosion in the rainy season rainwater and surface runoff flow into the river resulting in unstable water quality and water volume and increasing pollution according to the actual situation of the river the river bank shall be reconstructed both banks of the river were paved with double buckle bricks and planted with grass seeds because the lawn fully exerts its buffering effect it prevented soil erosion it was conducive to the restoration of the sloping shore ecosystem the reconstruction of the water and land ecological relationship as well as the improvement of biodiversity then the water quality was improved 2 4 2 in situ restoration of substrates as domestic sewage industrial wastewater and a large amount of agricultural runoff enter the aquatic ecosystem the water quality of urban rivers has deteriorated these heavily polluted aquatic environments usually contain perennial or seasonal black and odorous sediments which can lead to substrate contamination 26 due to the accumulation and desorption processes of toxic pollutants in the sediment water system sediments not only affect benthic organisms but also have adverse effects on aquatic organisms thereby water quality is also affected 27 in situ sediment restoration can provide better and long term restoration of river ecosystems and water quality in the construction a combination of mechanical and manual operations was used with staff using high pressure water guns to flush up the river bottom mud after a certain concentration was formed in the river channel high efficiency materializing agent was applied with the amount of 500 1000 g m2 high efficiency materializing agent was applied twice with one week interval each time the best construction temperature was 15 35 c 2 4 3 biological contact oxidation artificial aeration system biological contact oxidation is a wastewater biological treatment method derived from the biofilm method it uses the same aeration method as the oxidation tank to provide oxygen required by microorganisms which can effectively reduce the concentration of various pollutants finally do transparency nh3 n tp and other indicators meet the standard 28 29 bioremediation of heavily polluted rivers using a combination of biotechnology and engineering has attracted increasing attention in the field of environmental protection 6 this method is widely used it does not require sludge reflux has low sludge production is resistant to shock loading and facilitates the growth of nitrifying bacteria the system has both free activated sludge and biofilm attached to the filler artificial aeration operation has been widely studied internationally artificial aeration is expected to improve not only the removal of nitrogen but also the removal rate of tp however aeration technology can only temporarily improve water quality while the enhancement of self purification depends on the restoration of the whole ecosystem 30 the river used a combined three stage biological contact oxidation tank and artificial aeration process an aeration pipeline was installed under the river with a length of 200 m the water body passed through the biological contact oxidation tank artificial aeration was performed to increase the do of the water body and inhibit denitrification thereby increasing the nh3 n removal rate the daily processing capacity of the biological contact oxidation tank is 300 m3 the hydraulic retention time hrt is 3 6 h and the air water ratio is 6 10 1 the water temperature is 18 25 c there is a grit tank before the biological contact oxidation tank the water from the river entered the pond and flowed out after three stages of treatment since the oxidation tank was a three stage type it could make full use of the synergistic effect between similar microbial populations and overcome the antagonistic effect between different microbial populations therefore the processing efficiency was greatly improved aeration pipes and microporous aeration disks փ 300 mm were installed at the bottom of the pool and used yqrs65 submerged roots blowers for aeration p 0 75 7 5 kw q 0 76 2 59 m3 min the oxygen distribution was even during the aeration process watermelon petal type suspended fillers փ 120 mm pp material were installed above the aeration system and the optimal thickness of the filler was 25 35 cm the advantage of watermelon flap suspension filler is that the microorganism hanging film is fast and easy to fall off acid and alkali resistance aging resistance small impact by water flow etc the water passed through the three stage biological contact oxidation pond to improve the water quality of the river the structure of the three stage biological contact oxidation tank is shown in fig 3 after the biological contact oxidation tank starts operation it took about 20 days for the reactor to start hanging film the best environment for hanging film was the water temperature of 18 25 c 20 days later a layer of obvious yellow brown biofilm could be seen on the suspended filler through the electron microscope we were able to observe that the biofilm contained a large number of protozoa and post zoa such as bellworms and nematodes finally samples were taken and the analysis results showed that the removal rate of each water quality index tended to be stable it can be considered as successful for hanging the film 2 4 4 ecological floating bed ecological floating bed efb is a new type of water restoration technology developed on the basis of traditional artificial wetlands due to its low investment high efficiency no additional land occupation strong adaptability to water depth flexible operation and simple maintenance it is becoming more and more popular and widely used in landscape water restoration projects 31 the principle is that aquatic plants are planted on a carrier with certain buoyancy to float on the water surface for water purification studies have shown that efb has a high efficiency in removing pollutants from water and it can effectively inhibit the growth of algae and provide habitat for aquatic animals and birds 32 33 the project set up three floating islands of 1 5 m long and 3 m wide enclosed by pvc pipes in the river myriophyllum elatinoides gaudich was spread all over the floating islands and fixed with fishing nets set up 3 floating islands composed of iris tectorum maxim and thalia dealbata fraser whose length was 1 5 m and width was 3 m the two floating islands were placed alternately which could effectively remove pollutants such as n and p from the water and inhibit the growth of algae it could also effectively prevent eutrophication of water bodies and play a landscape role 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of operation effect the project lasted for three months from system start up to stable operation it is divided into three stages which are i in situ treatment stage ii microbial membrane hanging stage iii successful film hanging stage the biological contact oxidation artificial aeration system started to operate from the 15th day and the artificial aeration changed from continuous to intermittent aeration 60 days after the project started samples were taken every 5 days during the first 40 days of operation and every 10 days after 40 days three sampling sections in the river channel area sampling sections between the interval of 120 m in the cross section of the middle hong vertical line underwater 0 5 m to took a point sampling c1 c2 c3 in fig 1 the samples were analyzed for each pollution index transparency and do were detected in situ with portable instruments after transferring the samples to the laboratory the concentrations of codcr nh3 n and tp were tested 3 1 1 transparency as can be seen from fig 4 the transparency of the water body was improved from 3 5 cm to 57 cm after three months of the project the operation effect was obvious the transparency of the first stage was increased from 3 5 cm to 21 cm in situ treatment is done by adding high efficiency physical and chemical agents the flocculant inside reacted in the water body to generate flocs which precipitated quickly the clarity of the water body is significantly improved after 15 days the biological contact oxidation artificial aeration system became operational aeration caused the river sediments to float resulting in a decrease in transparency however with the success of microbial film hanging do improved and the self purification capacity of the water body gradually recovered transparency recovered and steadily improved after day 40 3 1 2 do the variation of do during project operation is shown in fig 5 in the early stage of system operation the rate of reoxygenation was relatively fast it rose from 0 19 mg l to 2 1 mg l which reached the surface water grade v the anaerobic state of the river was changed in the middle period the do increased slowly because the biological contact oxidation tank had not been successfully installed after the 40th day with the success of microbial film hanging do increased rapidly to 6 1 mg l and reached the surface water class ii standard the ecosystem of the river was gradually restored at 60 days the artificial aeration system changed from continuous aeration to intermittent aeration it can be seen that do was maintained at a high value and continued to rise from 0 19 mg l to 6 1 mg l the process has a significant effect on do enhancement and has a strong resistance to pollutant impact 3 1 3 codcr as can be seen from fig 6 the value of codcr decreased from 191 mg l to 23 mg l reaching the v standard with a removal rate of 88 0 after conducting in situ treatment some organic pollutants were degraded and adsorbed the codcr content dropped rapidly to 90 mg l and the removal rate reached 52 9 at this stage the codcr removal was not obvious from the 15th day to the 40th day of project operation this is due to 1 aeration stirring in the river resulting in sludge uplifting to make microbial loss 2 the biological contact oxidation basin was not completely film mounted resulting in its treatment effect on the river was not obvious with the increase of dissolved oxygen concentration the microbial activity increased with the success of microbial film hanging the indigenous microflora in the water body gradually accumulated codcr decreased significantly 90 days later the cod decreased to 23 mg l 3 1 4 nh3 n the change curve of nh3 n with time is shown in fig 7 the nh3 n content decreased from 18 29 mg l to 1 6 mg l de treated up to 91 3 the river was injected with high efficiency physical and chemical agents the nh3 n content was rapidly reduced to 8 05 mg l due to adsorption and oxidation after 15 days the ammonia nitrogen removal effect was not significant at this stage there are several reasons for this 1 microbial film hanging was not completed the lack of microbial species and nitrifying bacteria were not the dominant species 2 due to aeration stirring the substrate pollutants were suspended again leading to the release of nitrogenous pollutants after 40 days do rose due to continuous aeration in the river and the continuous action of the biological contact oxidation basin inhibiting denitrification and with the enrichment of microorganisms in the biological contact oxidation basin and the microbial community on the biofilm the ammonia nitrogen in the water column decreased significantly 90 days later the nh3 n in the water column decreased to 1 6 mg l which reached the standard of surface water grade v 3 1 5 tp as can be seen in fig 8 the tp content in the sediment and overlying water bodies decreased substantially after the in situ treatment stage the average value of tp in the tested section decreased from 2 72 mg l to 0 27 mg l and the removal rate reached 90 1 at 15 40 days due to the operation of the biological contact oxidation artificial aeration system aeration stirring resulted in the release of phosphorus containing contaminants from the sediment into the water column microbial hanging film was also not completely therefore the removal effect of tp at this stage was not obvious after 40 days with the completion of microbial hanging film and the rise of do the activity of phosphorus loving bacteria was enhanced the phosphorus containing pollutants in the water body were gradually degraded and transformed on the 90th day the content of tp decreased significantly to 0 27 mg l which reached the standard of surface water v 3 2 comparison of the treatment effect of process during the first 15 days of the project only the substrate was originally restored in the river after the 15th day the combined biological contact oxidation basin artificial aeration system and ecological floating islands started to operate from the 15th day to the 40th day the biofilm hanging process of the biological contact oxidation tank was not completed therefore it does not have a good evolutionary effect the main role in this stage is played by the ecological floating island after the 40th day the biological contact oxidation cell was successfully installed the removal rates of pollutants at each stage are shown in table 2 from table 2 it is known that the removal rates for codcr and nh3 n were 65 15 and 70 96 respectively from the 40th day to the 90th day which were higher than the previous two time periods the removal rate for tp was slightly lower than that at 15th day a comprehensive analysis showed that the best effect on pollutant purification was achieved in 40 90 days this is due to the fact that the biological contact oxidation tank artificial aeration system starts to play a purifying role after the biological contact oxidation tank successfully hangs a film it can be clearly seen that it has a better purification effect on pollutants 3 3 river water quality status the project was analyzed after three months and the water quality of the river was analyzed for 1 week the average of the results of each analysis was taken the water quality characteristics of the river are shown in table 3 4 conclusions the project lasted for 3 months the river was purified from worse than grade v to v water through interception and source control in situ restoration combined biological contact oxidation artificial aeration process and ecological floating island treatment after the river course is treated the highest water quality indicators codcr nh3 n tp removal rate can reach 88 0 91 3 and 90 1 the do content reached the surface water class ii standard the water environment of the river has been significantly improved with good growth of aquatic plants and beautiful ecological landscape the operation of the project is shown in fig 9 the results show that the removal of codcr nh3 n and tp reached 73 3 78 7 and 70 3 after the water body was treated by the biological contact oxidation tank treatment system the system has a significant effect on the treatment of black smelly water bodies moreover the biological contact oxidation tank combined with artificial aeration can steadily improve water quality and it can reduce the pollutant concentration by increasing dissolved oxygen and microbial activity in the water body the process method has a rapid and stable effect on the treatment of black smelly water bodies it has the advantages of low cost low secondary pollution and easy maintenance it has high feasibility in engineering applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

biological contact oxidation tank is 300 m3 the hydraulic retention time hrt is 3 6 h and the air water ratio is 6 10 1 the water temperature is 18 25 c there is a grit tank before the biological contact oxidation tank the water from the river entered the pond and flowed out after three stages of treatment since the oxidation tank was a three stage type it could make full use of the synergistic effect between similar microbial populations and overcome the antagonistic effect between different microbial populations therefore the processing efficiency was greatly improved aeration pipes and microporous aeration disks փ 300 mm were installed at the bottom of the pool and used yqrs65 submerged roots blowers for aeration p 0 75 7 5 kw q 0 76 2 59 m3 min the oxygen distribution was even during the aeration process watermelon petal type suspended fillers փ 120 mm pp material were installed above the aeration system and the optimal thickness of the filler was 25 35 cm the advantage of watermelon flap suspension filler is that the microorganism hanging film is fast and easy to fall off acid and alkali resistance aging resistance small impact by water flow etc the water passed through the three stage biological contact oxidation pond to improve the water quality of the river the structure of the three stage biological contact oxidation tank is shown in fig 3 after the biological contact oxidation tank starts operation it took about 20 days for the reactor to start hanging film the best environment for hanging film was the water temperature of 18 25 c 20 days later a layer of obvious yellow brown biofilm could be seen on the suspended filler through the electron microscope we were able to observe that the biofilm contained a large number of protozoa and post zoa such as bellworms and nematodes finally samples were taken and the analysis results showed that the removal rate of each water quality index tended to be stable it can be considered as successful for hanging the film 2 4 4 ecological floating bed ecological floating bed efb is a new type of water restoration technology developed on the basis of traditional artificial wetlands due to its low investment high efficiency no additional land occupation strong adaptability to water depth flexible operation and simple maintenance it is becoming more and more popular and widely used in landscape water restoration projects 31 the principle is that aquatic plants are planted on a carrier with certain buoyancy to float on the water surface for water purification studies have shown that efb has a high efficiency in removing pollutants from water and it can effectively inhibit the growth of algae and provide habitat for aquatic animals and birds 32 33 the project set up three floating islands of 1 5 m long and 3 m wide enclosed by pvc pipes in the river myriophyllum elatinoides gaudich was spread all over the floating islands and fixed with fishing nets set up 3 floating islands composed of iris tectorum maxim and thalia dealbata fraser whose length was 1 5 m and width was 3 m the two floating islands were placed alternately which could effectively remove pollutants such as n and p from the water and inhibit the growth of algae it could also effectively prevent eutrophication of water bodies and play a landscape role 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of operation effect the project lasted for three months from system start up to stable operation it is divided into three stages which are i in situ treatment stage ii microbial membrane hanging stage iii successful film hanging stage the biological contact oxidation artificial aeration system started to operate from the 15th day and the artificial aeration changed from continuous to intermittent aeration 60 days after the project started samples were taken every 5 days during the first 40 days of operation and every 10 days after 40 days three sampling sections in the river channel area sampling sections between the interval of 120 m in the cross section of the middle hong vertical line underwater 0 5 m to took a point sampling c1 c2 c3 in fig 1 the samples were analyzed for each pollution index transparency and do were detected in situ with portable instruments after transferring the samples to the laboratory the concentrations of codcr nh3 n and tp were tested 3 1 1 transparency as can be seen from fig 4 the transparency of the water body was improved from 3 5 cm to 57 cm after three months of the project the operation effect was obvious the transparency of the first stage was increased from 3 5 cm to 21 cm in situ treatment is done by adding high efficiency physical and chemical agents the flocculant inside reacted in the water body to generate flocs which precipitated quickly the clarity of the water body is significantly improved after 15 days the biological contact oxidation artificial aeration system became operational aeration caused the river sediments to float resulting in a decrease in transparency however with the success of microbial film hanging do improved and the self purification capacity of the water body gradually recovered transparency recovered and steadily improved after day 40 3 1 2 do the variation of do during project operation is shown in fig 5 in the early stage of system operation the rate of reoxygenation was relatively fast it rose from 0 19 mg l to 2 1 mg l which reached the surface water grade v the anaerobic state of the river was changed in the middle period the do increased slowly because the biological contact oxidation tank had not been successfully installed after the 40th day with the success of microbial film hanging do increased rapidly to 6 1 mg l and reached the surface water class ii standard the ecosystem of the river was gradually restored at 60 days the artificial aeration system changed from continuous aeration to intermittent aeration it can be seen that do was maintained at a high value and continued to rise from 0 19 mg l to 6 1 mg l the process has a significant effect on do enhancement and has a strong resistance to pollutant impact 3 1 3 codcr as can be seen from fig 6 the value of codcr decreased from 191 mg l to 23 mg l reaching the v standard with a removal rate of 88 0 after conducting in situ treatment some organic pollutants were degraded and adsorbed the codcr content dropped rapidly to 90 mg l and the removal rate reached 52 9 at this stage the codcr removal was not obvious from the 15th day to the 40th day of project operation this is due to 1 aeration stirring in the river resulting in sludge uplifting to make microbial loss 2 the biological contact oxidation basin was not completely film mounted resulting in its treatment effect on the river was not obvious with the increase of dissolved oxygen concentration the microbial activity increased with the success of microbial film hanging the indigenous microflora in the water body gradually accumulated codcr decreased significantly 90 days later the cod decreased to 23 mg l 3 1 4 nh3 n the change curve of nh3 n with time is shown in fig 7 the nh3 n content decreased from 18 29 mg l to 1 6 mg l de treated up to 91 3 the river was injected with high efficiency physical and chemical agents the nh3 n content was rapidly reduced to 8 05 mg l due to adsorption and oxidation after 15 days the ammonia nitrogen removal effect was not significant at this stage there are several reasons for this 1 microbial film hanging was not completed the lack of microbial species and nitrifying bacteria were not the dominant species 2 due to aeration stirring the substrate pollutants were suspended again leading to the release of nitrogenous pollutants after 40 days do rose due to continuous aeration in the river and the continuous action of the biological contact oxidation basin inhibiting denitrification and with the enrichment of microorganisms in the biological contact oxidation basin and the microbial community on the biofilm the ammonia nitrogen in the water column decreased significantly 90 days later the nh3 n in the water column decreased to 1 6 mg l which reached the standard of surface water grade v 3 1 5 tp as can be seen in fig 8 the tp content in the sediment and overlying water bodies decreased substantially after the in situ treatment stage the average value of tp in the tested section decreased from 2 72 mg l to 0 27 mg l and the removal rate reached 90 1 at 15 40 days due to the operation of the biological contact oxidation artificial aeration system aeration stirring resulted in the release of phosphorus containing contaminants from the sediment into the water column microbial hanging film was also not completely therefore the removal effect of tp at this stage was not obvious after 40 days with the completion of microbial hanging film and the rise of do the activity of phosphorus loving bacteria was enhanced the phosphorus containing pollutants in the water body were gradually degraded and transformed on the 90th day the content of tp decreased significantly to 0 27 mg l which reached the standard of surface water v 3 2 comparison of the treatment effect of process during the first 15 days of the project only the substrate was originally restored in the river after the 15th day the combined biological contact oxidation basin artificial aeration system and ecological floating islands started to operate from the 15th day to the 40th day the biofilm hanging process of the biological contact oxidation tank was not completed therefore it does not have a good evolutionary effect the main role in this stage is played by the ecological floating island after the 40th day the biological contact oxidation cell was successfully installed the removal rates of pollutants at each stage are shown in table 2 from table 2 it is known that the removal rates for codcr and nh3 n were 65 15 and 70 96 respectively from the 40th day to the 90th day which were higher than the previous two time periods the removal rate for tp was slightly lower than that at 15th day a comprehensive analysis showed that the best effect on pollutant purification was achieved in 40 90 days this is due to the fact that the biological contact oxidation tank artificial aeration system starts to play a purifying role after the biological contact oxidation tank successfully hangs a film it can be clearly seen that it has a better purification effect on pollutants 3 3 river water quality status the project was analyzed after three months and the water quality of the river was analyzed for 1 week the average of the results of each analysis was taken the water quality characteristics of the river are shown in table 3 4 conclusions the project lasted for 3 months the river was purified from worse than grade v to v water through interception and source control in situ restoration combined biological contact oxidation artificial aeration process and ecological floating island treatment after the river course is treated the highest water quality indicators codcr nh3 n tp removal rate can reach 88 0 91 3 and 90 1 the do content reached the surface water class ii standard the water environment of the river has been significantly improved with good growth of aquatic plants and beautiful ecological landscape the operation of the project is shown in fig 9 the results show that the removal of codcr nh3 n and tp reached 73 3 78 7 and 70 3 after the water body was treated by the biological contact oxidation tank treatment system the system has a significant effect on the treatment of black smelly water bodies moreover the biological contact oxidation tank combined with artificial aeration can steadily improve water quality and it can reduce the pollutant concentration by increasing dissolved oxygen and microbial activity in the water body the process method has a rapid and stable effect on the treatment of black smelly water bodies it has the advantages of low cost low secondary pollution and easy maintenance it has high feasibility in engineering applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13011,as a consequence of the poor implantation of sanitation systems more than 80 of the wastewater from human activity is dumped which poses a threat to public health and generates water stress in contrast its depuration and reuse for irrigation improves the efficiency of the water management cycle and reduces the use of fresh water in the context of grey water purification in rural areas of europe constructed wetlands are the preferred option furthermore in developing countries they are particularly attractive as an alternative to conventional purification systems the design of such facilities tends to avoid the complexity of the interactions between solids pollutants microorganisms and plants in this work a more rigorous mathematical model is proposed which considers the mass balances of the substrate and the microorganisms in addition to the degradation kinetics typical of biotechnological processes the life cycles of microorganisms and their horizontal and vertical transport processes this model was tuned based on the responses of already installed systems located in zapote costa rica and san salvador el salvador the model foresees start up times close to three

2015 aims to explore new ways to improve the quality of life ensuring that no one is left behind with this aim the agenda establishes 17 objectives among which the sixth objective seeks to guarantee the availability of water for all in addition to its sustainable management and sanitation although progress has been made in the coverage of water supplies and sanitation systems billions of individuals worldwide still lack such services especially in rural areas more specifically according to un data 1 6 out of 10 individuals lack access to safely managed sanitation facilities which is equivalent to more than 4 billion people worldwide and implies that over 80 of the water resulting from human activity is dumped without any kind of treatment among the targets corresponding to this objective number 6 3 claims that water quality should be improved by reducing pollution eliminating dumping and minimising the release of hazardous chemicals and materials this could halve the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increase recycling and safe reuse globally in addition to protecting public health wastewater treatment through recycling reuse and recovery can alleviate water stress and provide social economic and environmental benefits 2 3 taking into account that 69 of global water withdrawals correspond to agriculture including irrigation livestock and aquaculture 2 wastewater reuse for irrigation purposes has received attention to improve the efficiency of the water management cycle ultimately alleviating the exploitation of fresh water sources and decreasing their pollution after use and discharge 4 5 grey water is defined as domestic wastewater generated from sinks laundry and showers but excludes toilet water or black water 6 when grey water originates exclusively from personal hygiene it is referred to as light grey water in contrast the sources of dark grey water include laundry machines dishwashers and kitchen sinks 7 8 grey water represents up to 75 of total domestic wastewater with approximately 100 150 l person 1 d 1 being generated in developed countries although smaller volumes are generally generated in developing countries 9 grey water presents a lower organic nutrient and pathogen load than black water and consequently is easier to treat 7 10 thereby rendering on site treatment possible 11 thus the source separation of grey and black water can contribute to reducing discharge to wastewater treatment plants and can also help address the issue of potable water scarcity worldwide 6 12 13 moreover the reuse of grey water for non potable uses e g in toilets washing and irrigation reduces the consumption of high quality water to promote a circular economy 14 among the wide technological proposals suggested for the treatment of grey water ranging from sand filters to sophisticated biological and chemical treatments 13 15 constructed wetlands have proven to be nature based solutions which enable reduction of massive energy consumption 16 17 in fact these facilities are economically and energetically efficient for reducing the contents of organic species and biological organisms which ultimately allows the requirements of non potable reuse to be met 7 13 constructed wetlands are made up of shallow lagoons or channels depths less than 1 m that are planted with local species typical of humid areas and in which decontamination processes take place through interactions between water solid substrates microorganisms vegetation and even fauna 18 based on the water circulation characteristics constructed wetlands can be classified into surface and subsurface flows 19 20 in contrast to surface flow wetlands their subsurface equivalents admit higher organic loads reduce the risk of contact with the population and prevent the appearance of insects 21 although they are less attractive to environmental projects due to the absence of an accessible sheet of water subsurface flow constructed wetlands are the preferred option for grey water purification in rural areas of europe 18 12 subsurface constructed wetlands consist of a gravel bed that acts as a substrate for plant growth and depending on the configuration employed the wastewater flows vertically or horizontally through the bed 6 which acts as a biofilter in addition a large number of physical chemical and biological processes also take place in the bed including sedimentation filtration precipitation adsorption plant uptake and microbial decomposition 22 23 furthermore subsurface vertical flow constructed wetlands enhance oxygen transfer from the air to the wastewater flow improving their nitrification capacity with respect to that of the horizontal configuration 4 5 however the pulsed water circulation is discontinuous and so the granular medium is not permanently flooded in developed countries vertical systems are combined with horizontal ones and although this configuration appears superior it requires more sophisticated and expensive installations not to mention additional maintenance hence due to the low economic and energetic costs of horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands in addition to their particularly low impact on the environment and landscape the implementation of such configurations is especially attractive for developing countries 24 25 where natural biodegradation processes can be applied to improve n removal 26 among the disadvantages of this type of natural wastewater treatment system it should be taken into account that they require large surface areas start up lasts between three and six months and once running there are few options for their control thus at the design stage the maximum and minimum flow peaks should be considered furthermore it should be considered that they require periodic maintenance consisting of the removal of flocs from the inlet pipes the pruning of plants cleaning of the outer surface of the bed and control of the height of the flooded bed moreover in the case of observing the appearance of water on the surface the removal clearance and or replacement of the gravel with a new material of the same characteristics is required when constructed wetlands are used for the purification of dark grey water it must be considered that fats and oils prevent contact between the microorganisms and the water and could even provoke flow blockage to avoid this issue flotation is commonly employed 27 wherein a grease trap is employed for pretreatment such devices are effective for the removal of emulsified oil and grease droplets and so they are commonly employed in restaurants prior to wastewater disposal into the sanitation system 28 these devices require periodical maintenance to remove the hydrophobic layer of fats that accumulates on top to avoid overflow and bad odours an alternative method to reduce the amount of accumulated fats and avoid its subsequent treatment is bioactivation by the addition of lipases which are enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of lipids to glycerol and fatty acids 29 30 these compounds can pass through the cell walls of microorganisms 31 and so can be digested with the organic load upon reaching the sanitation system the interest in constructed wetlands as a natural based solution for wastewater treatment began in the 1980s although scientific production during the last century has been limited despite the fact that in the last decade the scientific community has returned to focus on these kinds of solutions 7 there are very few studies addressing the rigorous design of these complex systems and their dynamic responses to possible disturbances 32 33 34 grey water treatment in constructed wetlands is a complex process that includes sedimentation filtration sorption plant uptake and microbial decomposition 35 wherein each factor influences the other factors moreover modelling these interactions is difficult and complex due to a lack of appropriate models until the beginning of the 21st century the use of first order k c models was common these models assume an ideal plug flow and consider that the various parameters do not depend on the inlet concentration or the incoming flow in 2000 kadlec 36 demonstrated that these models present serious limitations for the rigorous modelling of constructed wetlands and proposed the p k c model which is based on a scheme of tanks in series indeed laaffat et al 23 used this model to estimate the profiles of degradation at the simulated gravel bed more recently mohammed and ismail 37 proposed the use of a multi layer artificial neural network model to predict the efficiency of a lab scale constructed wetland to treat real food industry wastewater from a cheese factory gomes ferreira et al 38 validated the utility of the model proposed by chan and chu for the reaction kinetics of fenton s process on the removal of atrazine 39 dittrich et al 40 and samsó et al 41 focused on modelling single physicochemical phenomena occurring on sshfcw transport processes and clogging while yuan et al 42 reviewed several single models that describe these and other complex processes occurring in cws including biochemical hydraulic reactive transport plant and clogging models these authors conclude that a single or a composite model coupling a small number of sub models cannot fully predict the decontamination processes while a comprehensive model including all sub models involves numerous parameters making the model complex and leading to diffuse interaction however the most common design procedure which is explained in detail in various technical manuals such as those published by garcía and serrano 18 and delgadillo et al 19 is based on the experience accumulated by companies and organisations from the civil engineering field and does not address the complexity of the processes and interactions that occur between solids pollutants microorganisms and plants these semi empirical models usually propose simplifications regarding the flow of wastewater though the bed the substrate degradation kinetics the kinetics of the proliferation and death of microorganisms the effect of pretreatment the horizontal transport promoted by dragging and the vertical sedimentation of microorganisms thus the current work aims to address this lack of knowledge to develop a more rigorous mathematical model than those previously published and which will describe the dynamic behaviour of a horizontal subsurface constructed wetland containing a bioactive grease trap subsequently the model will be tuned based on the response of already installed systems in addition this simulation tool will be used to study the response of the model to various disturbances such as punctual stops or seasonal variations in the incoming flow furthermore our model will consider the mass balances of the substrate and the microorganisms in addition to the degradation kinetics typical of biotechnological processes the life cycle of the microorganisms and their horizontal and vertical transport 2 modelling fig 1 shows a diagrammatic scheme of the system proposed for modelling consisting of a grease trap followed by a subsurface horizontal flow constructed wetland 2 1 the bioactive grease trap lipases are enzymes belonging to the class of esterases that catalyse the hydrolysis of lipids they use water to break the bonds of triglycerides generating glycerol and fatty acids the interfacial properties of such enzymes allow them to activate reactions that occur at the interface which is the point at which they are active 43 these unique properties render lipases an interesting additive for grease traps more specifically lipases can be added after their isolation or by means of specialised microorganisms that produce these biocatalysts such microorganisms are very common in nature where they can be collected and cultivated this is common practice in certain communities of el salvador importantly the addition of microorganisms instead of isolated enzymes is cheaper easier and more effective for the self maintenance of constructed wetland in this case the enzymatic reaction products which pass into the aqueous phase serve as the substrates for microbial activity since they can pass through the cell wall therefore the aqueous phase contains biomass microorganisms grey water and the enzymatic reaction products as outlined in fig 2 the kinetic mechanism of enzymatic lipid hydrolysis has been previously described in the literature 44 more specifically the kinetic models of such reactions that occur in biphasic organic aqueous systems consider a reaction rate based on the interfacial substrate concentration 45 46 that may be reduced to the michaelis menten form 47 1 r o k cat eo k o o where k o is the michaelis menten constant of the enzymatic reaction r o is the enzymatic reaction rate of the oils and fats k cat is the kinetic constant of the enzymatic reaction and e and o are the enzyme and oil fat concentrations at the interface respectively which are assumed to be constant e is proportional to the concentration of microorganisms in the aqueous fraction the evolution of the microbial population in the grease trap has been modelled assuming monod type kinetics 2 μ f μ f max f k f f where μ f is the specific growth rate of the microorganisms in the grease trap μ f max is the maximum growth rate of these microorganisms f is the concentration of the enzymatic reaction products in the aqueous phase and k f the monod constant or half velocity constant for the growth rate of the microorganisms in the grease trap i e the value of f when μ μ f max 0 5 modelling of the grease trap requires solving mass balances for the oils and fats and also for the microorganisms and enzymatic reaction products taking into account the high disaffinity of oils and fats towards water it can be assumed that phase segregation occurs instantaneously on the other hand due to the turbulence generated by the incoming stream the aqueous phase can be modelled as a stirred tank reactor therefore the mass balances can be written as follows 3 d m o dt q x o ρ o r o a 4 d m t dt v t μ f k dt m t v t 5 df dt v t qf r o a μ f m t y xst v t where v t is the grease trap volume q is the feed flow rate m o is the mass of the oils and fats in the grease trap x o is the volume fraction of the oils and fats in the incoming stream ρ o is the average density of the oils and fats a is the biphasic organic aqueous interface surface m t is the concentration of microorganisms in the aqueous fraction k dt is the constant desorption rate and y xst is the yield rate of the microorganisms during ordinary operation constructed wetlands do not receive a constant flow rate of grey water since this flow rate is directly determined by domestic rhythms for example kitchen sinks are used most commonly during mealtime hours while taps showers and washing machines are used at specific and punctual times the proposed model therefore simulates the inflow through pulses of adjustable durations in addition to changes in the flow rate and concentration as a result it can be adapted to the constructed wetlands that serve homes restaurants and rural hotels likewise the addition of the biocatalysts in the form of cultivated microorganisms is not constant but is carried out periodically 2 2 the constructed wetland wastewater reaches the constructed wetland after leaving the grease trap and so it accesses the gravel bed free of oils and fats but with an additional load of organic matter namely the fatty acids and glycerol components generated during enzymatic digestion of the grease likewise the microorganisms added to the grease trap for enzyme production are carried away by the water flow and enter the gravel bed mixing with the local microbial population and participating in the removal of organic matter as mentioned previously the evolution of the microbial population in the gravel bed can been modelled according to the concentration of organic matter when assuming monod type kinetics 6 μ s μ s max s k s s where μ s is the specific growth rate of microorganisms in the gravel bed μ s max is the maximum growth rate of this microbial population s is the concentration of the substrate organic matter as bod and k s is the monod constant for the growth rate of microorganisms in the wetland μ s max increases with temperature according to the modified arrhenius equation 7 μ s max r 20 σ t 20 where r 20 is the rate constant of microbial growth at a standard temperature of 20 c σ is the temperature dependence coefficient corresponding to the growth of microorganisms and t is the water temperature in c nevertheless it should be noted that several authors have demonstrated that the efficiency of wetlands in removing organic matter is not significantly affected by seasonal temperature variations 35 inside the bed microorganisms are attached to gravel particles and are also suspended in the stream to form large clusters or flocs the model should therefore consider microorganism transport both horizontally and vertically wherein the former facilitates colonisation and extends the microbial activity to the entire bed furthermore vertical transport is taken into account to consider that the sedimentation of flocs can generate a layer of sludge that blocks the interparticular voids and reduces the flow section for the wastewater thereby rendering the wetland useless the properties of the wastewater depend on both the time and the longitudinal position along the process and so for modelling purposes the gravel bed is divided longitudinally into n nodes wherein the cross section is wh and the length is δz l n w is the total width of the constructed wetland h is the flooded height of the gravel bed and l is the total length of the wetland in each node this model should resolve the mass balance of the substrate and the microorganisms in addition to the height of the sludge layer which determines the flow velocity it has also been considered that the amount of microorganisms passing from one node to the next horizontal transport as well as the amount of sludge accumulated in the bottom of the gravel bed due to settling vertical transport are both proportional to the concentration of microorganisms in each node thus the quantification coefficients f h and f v are proposed for horizontal and vertical transport respectively and the mass balances in the i node can be written as follows 8 wδzε d y i s i dt q s i 1 s i μ s i y xsw x i y i wδzε 9 wδzε d y i x i dt q x i 1 f h x i f h f v μ s i k dw x i y i wδzε 10 wδzε x s d h i dt q x i f v where ε is the gravel bed voidage x i is the concentration of microorganisms in the i node y i is the height of the free flow section in the i node x s is the concentration of microorganisms in the sludge layer and h i is the height of the sludge layer so that y i h h i as can be deduced from the previous equations the proposed model resembles that developed by kadlec 36 35 and used by laaffat et al 23 with regard to the division of the gravel bed into tanks in series however the p k c model does not consider sludge sedimentation or colonisation of the subsequent tanks by the entrapment of microorganisms and does not include grease trap modelling furthermore the degradation rate is described in terms of first order kinetics instead of using the kinetic equations of microbiological processes although the effect of evapotranspiration et and precipitation p have not been considered in the proposed development eqs 8 and 9 can be easily adapted to take into account dilution and an increase in the flow rate at each node due to meteorological conditions δq i 11 δ q i w x i p et where x i il n an algorithm written in scilab was employed for model implementation and this algorithm includes the subroutine ode for solving the set of 3n 3 ordinary differential equations eqs 3 5 and eqs 8 10 3 model parameters 3 1 dimensioning the use of the model proposed in this paper for simulating real or projected facilities requires establishing values for all the parameters defined in section 2 to date several studies have been published in the literature that are useful to determine the flow rate 32 15 48 4 5 the average grey water production per inhabitant and day and its composition in different regions throughout the world 7 49 as well as the physicochemical and biological properties of different types of wastewaters i e light mixed and dark 6 likewise several works have focused on characterisation of the outflow of operating facilities both in terms of the composition 50 20 51 13 and the efficiency of the wetland in removing the usual pollutants 12 52 53 54 55 which usually is defined as follows 12 η c o c l c o where c o and c l are the pollutant concentration at the wetland inlet and outlet respectively investigations that gather information regarding the specifications for possible reuses established in various regulations 7 10 are also useful since they allow the establishment of design objectives to size future wetlands to date several configurations have been proposed for the grease trap however its dimensions usually depend on the flow rate and the oil fat concentration in the treatment stream 28 to carry out dimensioning of the constructed wetland the standard procedure employed is based on the k c model which as mentioned above is based on the assumption that the wetland behaves as a plug flow biological reactor and that the degradation of pollutants can be described by first order kinetic equations related to the concentration of each pollutant instead of the degradation kinetic constant whose dimension is t 1 it is usual to use the product of this based on the porosity ε and the flooded height of the gravel beds h so that the dimensions of this kinetic constant k a are l t 1 table 1 lists several of the values proposed in the literature integrating the mass balance of the pollutant in the bed and taking into account that the hydraulic retention time τ i e the time that grey water remains retained in the gravel bed is defined as 13 τ εwhl q the required wetland area a wl can be estimated by the following equation 14 a q k a log c o c l it should be noted that the k c model is not valid when horizontal constructed wetland is integrated in a combined system and when it is located after a subsurface vertical flow constructed wetland in this case it should be considered that the previous system generates a certain amount of pollutants which is referred to as the background concentration c for these cases kadlec 36 proposed the p k c model accordingly the required wetland area should be estimated by 15 a q k a log c o c c l c to calculate the background concentration kadlec and wallace 35 proposed the following equations more specifically for the bod5 16 c 3 5 0 053 c o where 0 c o 200 mg l 1 for the tss 17 c 7 8 0 063 c o for the tn 18 c 1 5 mg l 1 and for the tp 19 c 0 02 mg l 1 once the wetland area has been defined its width w can be calculated using the following expression derived from darcy s law which describes the flow of a fluid through a porous bed 20 w q k h mh where k h is the hydraulic conductivity of the bed and m is the wetland slope as in the case of ε k h depends on the particle diameter of the gravel 58 on the other hand m tends to be approximately 1 2 18 while h 1 m 52 57 finally the length of the gravel bed l can be determined by 21 l a w 3 2 enzymatic activity in the bioactive grease trap in addition to the physicochemical parameters of the inlet stream the facility requirements i e the removal efficiency of pollutants and the geometric dimensioning which can be carried out based on previously published literature the simulation of a wetland using the model proposed in this work requires the definition of all parameters related to the biological activity both in the grease trap and also in the gravel bed of the wetland thus microorganisms collected from the soil of forested areas of the santa marta community in el salvador were used to obtain reference values for the kinetic constant of the enzymatic reaction and the corresponding michaelis menten constant eq 1 the constant of proportionality to determine the surface concentration of the enzymes at the interface the maximum growth rate and the monod constant corresponding to the growth rate of the microorganisms eq 2 the constant desorption rate eq 4 and the yield rate of the microorganisms added to the bioactive grease trap eq 5 the microorganisms were isolated and grown according to a procedure developed by the ades santa marta technicians i e an association for community economic and social development this procedure was based on the common practices of local farmers who use these crops for organic amendment and for soil decontamination indeed these microorganisms have demonstrated a remarkable enzymatic activity in regulating the fat and oil levels in the pretreatment stages of constructed wetlands following their cultivation which was carried out under anoxic conditions and in the absence of sunlight the microorganisms were dispersed in water to obtain the additive that will be periodically added to the grease trap in the case of the additive prepared in our laboratory several hydrolysis tests were carried out using sunflower oil and olive oil with constant stirring of the aqueous phase fatty acid production was measured via acid base titrations using phenolphthalein as the indicator and it was found that the microorganisms exhibited a slightly higher degradation capacity in the case of sunflower oil although it would be interesting to carry out the same experiments using other types of vegetable oils e g rapeseed soybean and palm and also using animal fats e g chicken pork cow and lamb the average values obtained in the tests carried out using sunflower and olive oil were considered valid see table 2 based on the values shown in table 2 the behaviour of the bioactive grease trap of a typical catering establishment was simulated the volume of the simulated trap was 0 62 m3 and the radius was 0 38 m the inlet flow rate was 600 l h 1 the concentration of fats and oils was 550 g m 3 and ρ o 900 kg m 3 finally the grease concentration at the interface was estimated to be 50 g m 2 to simulate discontinued use of the kitchen it was assumed that the service was open from 7 00 am to 1 00 pm for breakfast and lunch and from 7 00 pm to 11 00 pm for the dinner shift microorganisms were added periodically every 15 d which is the usual recharge time at the ades santa marta facilities fig 3 a shows the evolution over time for the height of the layer of oils and fats while fig 3 b reflects the concentrations of fatty acids and glycerol in the aqueous phase and fig 3 c shows the evolution of the microorganism concentration the proposed values for the parameters that describe the microbiological activity in the bioactive grease trap are given in table 2 and allow us to predict the usual behaviour of this type of facility when the appropriate additive i e that prepared following the ades santa marta procedure is employed it can be observed that during a three month period of operation the layer of fats and oils was not expected to exceed 3 5 cm as shown in fig 3 a moreover the periodic feeding of the additive prepared from the oil microorganisms significantly reduced its thickness and following the second addition the layer practically disappeared during the 5 days after recharge the subsequent exponential increase in the layer thickness was attributed to a reduction in the microbial population due to its transport by the influent towards the constructed wetland the concentration of fatty acids and glycerol in the aqueous phase both of which are products from the enzymatic reaction fig 3 b followed an inverse trend with maximum values reaching approximately 3000 g m 3 after use of the kitchen and in the initial days following addition of the bioadditive the minimum values which were approximately between 100 and 300 g m 3 occurred in the hours prior to the use of the kitchen and particularly in the days prior to recharging when the concentration of microorganisms in the aqueous phase reached its minimum value of approximately 850 g m 3 fig 3 c 3 3 biological activity in the wetland bed to establish reference values for the parameters that describe the biological activity in the wetland bed the results published by moncada 56 and bolaños and gonzález 57 have been particularly useful more specifically the first of these works evaluated the design of a horizontal constructed wetland installed in zapote costa rica while the latter evaluated the efficiency of a constructed wetland designed to treat dark grey water from the kitchens of the university of el salvador although in both cases the facilities included pretreatment systems for fat and oil elimination the authors only reported information related to pollutant concentrations of the inlet and outlet streams the dimensions of the costa rican wetland were as follows w 1 0 m h 0 7 m and l 5 m q 70 l h 1 s in 230 g m 3 and ε 0 5 the organic matter concentration in the outlet stream measured by moncada was 18 1 g m 3 which is equivalent to a removal efficiency of 92 in contrast the wetland built in the salvadoran university campus was markedly larger where w 5 0 m h 0 8 m and l 15 m this larger size was necessary since it is designed to treat a significantly higher flow rate of q 14 5 m3 d 1 and has an estimated organic load approximately three times higher than that of the first facility i e s in 700 g m 3 the gravel used in the construction of this second facility is also finer and consequently its voidage is lower ε 0 35 the organic matter concentration in the outlet of the gravel bed measured by bolaños and gonzález was 35 g m 3 which is equivalent to a removal efficiency of 95 fig 4 shows the evolution over time of the removal efficiency estimated based on the simulation of these two constructed wetlands and using the parameters proposed in table 3 these parameters were determined by establishing ranges based on the usual values in biological reactions of degradation of organic matter in wastewater the optimum values set out in table 3 were obtained by constrained optimization using the subroutine fminsearch in scilab which is based on the modified nelder mead algorithm the objective function was defined as the variance associated with the differences between the results published in the literature and those predicted by the model it can be seen that in both cases the fitting between the results obtained with the model and those measured experimentally is reasonably good since after one year of operation the estimated efficiencies agree with the reported values and remain stable over time the model also predicts start up periods of approximately three months for the facilities which is a typical time scale in tropical regions in the smaller wetland studied by moncada the start up time was slightly faster although a few additional weeks were required to reach a stable operating value η 92 furthermore the model was able to foresee a slight decrease in efficiency as the operating time increased this will be discussed in the following section in the larger facility the start up was initially slower but after the first month the microbial activity increased and quickly reached values above 90 the model also foresees slightly higher efficiency values during the first weeks after reaching optimal operation levels in addition to a slight decrease from the fifth month to stabilise at the value reported by the authors i e η 95 these slight differences in the behaviours of the two wetlands can be attributed to the differences in their dimensions the influent flow and the organic load in the treated water thus when treating wastewater with a significantly higher organic load it is expected that the salvadoran wetland is more efficient the values proposed in table 3 have been also used to simulate the facility studied by laaffat et al 23 and built at a primary school in marrakech morocco in this case the model was able to foresee an efficiency of approximately 94 which agrees with the data reported by the authors it would be interesting to simulate additional facilities to confirm these values or to extend the ranges proposed in table 3 since it is foreseeable that these will be affected by the type of organic load i e light or dark grey water by the average annual temperature by the rainfall regime and even by the plant species present on the surface nevertheless the results obtained in the simulations show that the model is able to accurately simulate the operation of three facilities installed in two different regions with widely different nominal dimensions and capacities it can therefore be expected that it will be well suited for the modelling and simulation of any subsurface horizontal flow constructed wetland 4 simulations although future works will produce additional experimental data to consolidate the tuning of the model the developed simulation tool has demonstrated its ability to simulate real systems and it can also be used to analyse the evolution of non measurable parameters in operating facilities and to study the effect of modifying the operating parameters as a result our simulation tool can be used to anticipate the response of the system to establish stabilisation measures in case of occasional disturbances and to predict the future behaviours of projected facilities to demonstrate some of these possibilities the results obtained in several simulations that aim to address these situations are discussed below more specifically fig 5 shows the evolution of the amount of organic matter as bod and microorganism concentrations over time at the outlet of a system consisting of a 250 l bioactive grease trap and a constructed wetland with a 1 m width a 5 m length and a 0 7 m height this wetland is assumed to be fed with a flow rate of 70 l h 1 and a substrate load of 230 g m 3 in the same hourly intervals previously defined for the simulation of the grease trap in fig 3 the other model parameters are comparable to those presented in tables 2 and 3 in fig 5 a it can be seen that the model foresees a period close to two months until the substrate concentration in the outlet reaches values that allow the reuse of water for agriculture applications and one additional month until it is stabilised at values that correspond to an efficiency close to 94 which is typical for this type of facility fig 5 b where the evolution of the outlet microorganism concentration over time can be observed shows that using the proposed values this parameter reaches a maximum slightly higher than 45 g m 3 during the start up phase which rapidly reduces to negligible values once the steady state is reached this maximum which occurs after approximately 50 d can be attributed to the poor performance of the constructed wetland during the initial weeks which results in higher substrate and microorganism concentrations throughout the entire gravel bed once the bacterial population grows and stabilises in the section close to the wastewater inlet the microbiological activity is sufficient to significantly reduce the substrate concentration as the wastewater flows towards the outlet thereby limiting the growth of microorganisms in this section of the bed this hypothesis was confirmed by analysing the evolution of the substrate and microorganism concentrations over time in addition to their analysing longitudinal positions as shown in figs 6 and 7 accordingly in fig 6 it can be seen that although the substrate concentration profile along the gravel bed is always descending during the initial weeks after start up of the facility the achieved reduction in the organic load is moderate but it increases during the subsequent weeks of operation reaching pronounced levels after two months of operation in fig 7 it can be seen that bacterial population in the bed which initially does not contain microorganisms grows rapidly during the first weeks and in particular in the section closest to the inlet where it reaches values above 600 g m 3 after the first two months of operation as a consequence of this increase of the bacterial population close to the entrance the supply of substrate to the subsequent sections is notably reduced and the microorganism colony becomes unable to find adequate conditions to continue proliferating as a result its growth is contained this reduction in the digestion capacity of the bed explains the slight decrease in efficiency after the maximum is reached during the third month of operation this correlates with the observations made for the simulated installation based on the study by bolaños and gonzález 57 fig 4 complementing this information fig 8 shows the evolution over time and the longitudinal position of the thickness of the sludge layer in the gravel bed this sludge layer is formed by the sedimentation of flocs suspended in the wastewater it can be seen that the increase in the bacterial population in the section closest to the entrance leads to a linear increase in the amount of sludge deposited although after one year of operation the sludge does not block any more than 6 cm of the bed and this only occurs in specific longitudinal positions since the thickness of the settled layer is significantly lower in the latter sections of the wetland consequently the reduction in the hydraulic retention time is moderate i e less than 0 2 with values slightly higher than 1 d being achieved during the entire period of time simulated using this model it should also be possible to study the response of the system to a variation in the operating conditions as an example the effect of a six week shutdown was studied in a facility containing a grease trap similar to that simulated in fig 3 volume 0 62 m3 radius 0 38 m in addition to a constructed wetland similar to the one analysed by bolaños and gonzález 57 w 5 0 m h 0 8 m l 15 m which is fed with a flow of 14 5 m3 d 1 and an organic load of 700 g m 3 in the same hourly intervals previously defined for the simulation above this facility is located on a university campus and so the simulation of this shutdown allows anticipation of the system response to the holiday period during which time the coffee shops are closed for this simulation it was considered that the shutdown begins after 200 d when the steady state has been reached and the concentration profiles of the substrate and the microorganisms along the bed are stable it was assumed that during the shutdown period no wastewater is fed into the system although maintenance of the grease trap is continued fig 9 shows the evolution over time of the microorganism concentration in addition to its longitudinal position from this figure it can be observed that as a consequence of the shutdown when no substrate is fed into the system the microbial population is unable to proliferate and is greatly affected by the death rate consequently the microorganisms concentration decreases rapidly below 200 g m 3 accordingly it should be pointed out that the model proposed does not include the death rate of microorganisms thus the results of the simulations showed that under the usual operating conditions in the constructed wetland the residence times are rather short and therefore the decrease in the microbial population is much more affected by the horizontal and vertical transport than by the death rate nevertheless this parameter should be considered when the set up does not receive inlet flow given that in this case the residence time increases considerably and therefore the horizontal transport of microorganisms is cancelled when campus activity is resumed and wastewater is fed once again into the constructed wetland the microbiological growth is quickly reactivated and over a period of two or three weeks high microbial concentrations are reached although these concentrations are slightly lower than those predicted by the simulation during the period prior to the shutdown it is remarkable that this new start up of the facility is faster than that foreseen by the model at the beginning of the simulation and it is also noteworthy that concentration of microorganisms at the outlet does not increase as is observed in the initial weeks after commissioning this phenomenon was also observed when studying the behaviour of the other simulated facility see fig 7 the decrease in the bacterial population has a very significant effect on the efficiency of the constructed wetland in the purification of wastewater as can be observed in fig 10 at the end of the holiday shutdown activity returns to the coffee shops and consequently substrate is fed back into the system however since the microorganism concentration in the bed decreased during the shutdown the substrate concentration in the outlet increases rapidly during the initial weeks to reach high values close to 650 g m 3 thereby affecting the efficiency of the facility the presence of substrate nutrients then activates bacterial proliferation as can be seen in fig 9 and consequently the purification capacity of the bed recovers over a period of six to eight weeks to give contamination levels in the outlet comparable to those observed prior to shutdown and the efficiency is raised above 96 it is noteworthy that according to the results foreseen by the model the slight reduction in the concentration of microorganisms in the section closest to the inlet of the wastewater after the shutdown foreseen by the model fig 9 does not affect the good performance of the constructed wetland since following stabilisation the substrate concentration at the outlet returns to the same values reached prior to the shutdown in tropical countries the rainy season leads to a considerable alteration of the wetland operating conditions not only due to the increase in flow but also due to dilution of the organic load although the effect of climatic events on the performance of water disinfection system 59 and wastewater treatment plants 60 has been previously discussed in the literature there is a lack of knowledge regarding their effect on the performance of constructed wetland thus to anticipate the effect of this meteorological phenomenon on the wetland performance the entry of an additional flow of rainwater i e without an organic load from the surface of the constructed wetland was simulated and as a result the flow through the bed was found to increase longitudinally in this simulation it must be considered that the additional contribution of diluted wastewater directly accesses the gravel bed without passing through the bioactive grease trap it should be noted here that this simulated system is the same as that proposed for the previous simulation which is based on that studied by bolaños and gonzález 57 and is located on a salvadoran university campus the average daily precipitation in this region in the rainy season i e from may to october is close to 240 mm which is equivalent to an incoming flow of 10 l m 2 h 1 for the simulation it was considered that the rainy season begins after 200 d when the steady state has been reached and the concentration profiles of the substrate and the microorganisms in the bed are stable in fig 11 it can be seen that the beginning of the rainy season initially causes a moderate decrease in the concentration of microorganisms in the bed likely due to dilution and that in the following weeks the bed adapts the bacterial population to the new flow conditions and the available substrate as a result in the following rainy months a slight but continued decrease in this parameter is foreseen when the dry season returns after 180 d the concentration of microorganisms increases rapidly in the section closest to the wastewater entrance as a consequence of an increase in the substrate concentration although as can be seen from fig 9 the maximum level was slightly lower than the value foreseen by the model for the period before the start of the rainy season as previously mentioned the entry of rainwater into the constructed wetland causes dilution of the nutrient concentration in the bed fig 12 however contrary to our observations at the restart following the holiday shutdown the arrival of the dry season does not substantially alter the good performance of the installation and although a slight increase in the substrate concentration is observed the values are very similar to those foreseen by the model before the beginning of the rainy season these results agree with those obtained by masi et al 32 who carried out a two year performance evaluation of the performances of four different constructed wetland treatment systems established to treat wastewater effluent from tourist activities i e with a high variability in the water consumption and the wastewater flow depending on the season and the weather they concluded that constructed wetlands are robust and relatively resistant to peak flows and loads finally the differences in the behaviour of the wetland in the two simulations was attributed to the fact that in this second case the precipitation dilutes but does not substantially reduce the bacterial population of the bed as a result when recovering the conditions prior to the alteration the bed exhibits a sufficient biological activity to rapidly adapt to the slight increase in the substrate concentration dilution of the substrate due to rainfall which is foreseen throughout the bed in fact involves a reduction in the substrate concentration at the outlet which causes a slight increase in the efficiency of the wetland during the rainy months fig 13 5 conclusions a rigorous mathematical model has been proposed to describe the dynamic behaviour of horizontal subsurface constructed wetlands containing a bioactive grease trap this model considers the mass balances of the substrate and the microorganisms in addition to the degradation kinetics of the biological processes the life cycle of the microorganisms and their horizontal and vertical transport processes the former i e horizontal transport guarantees the propagation and maintenance of the microbial colony in all sections of the bed while the latter i e vertical transport causes the collapse of the facility by sedimentation the tuning of this model was completed by setting values for all parameters to ensure that the developed simulation tool allows the simulation of real or projected facilities the model foresees start up times close to three months and depuration efficiencies above 90 these values are in accordance with those measured in operating facilities and published in the literature this new simulation tool can also be used to analyse the evolution of unmeasurable parameters in operating facilities and to study the effects of modifying operating parameters it is therefore able to anticipate the response of the system to establish stabilisation measures in case of occasional disturbances and also to predict the future behaviour of projected facilities thus during the ordinary start up the model foresees an increase in the bacterial population in the entrance section which reduces the supply of substrate to the subsequent sections and slightly decreases the efficiency after the maximum reached during the third month of operation furthermore the simulation of a six week shutdown allowed anticipation of the system response to the holiday period more specifically the model foresees that under these conditions the microbial population cannot proliferate and is greatly affected by the death microbial rate which significantly affects the efficiency of the wetland in contrast the arrival of the rainy season does not significantly affect the wetland performance since the substrate concentration in the outlet is reduced slightly due to dilution and as a result the efficiency increases

13011,as a consequence of the poor implantation of sanitation systems more than 80 of the wastewater from human activity is dumped which poses a threat to public health and generates water stress in contrast its depuration and reuse for irrigation improves the efficiency of the water management cycle and reduces the use of fresh water in the context of grey water purification in rural areas of europe constructed wetlands are the preferred option furthermore in developing countries they are particularly attractive as an alternative to conventional purification systems the design of such facilities tends to avoid the complexity of the interactions between solids pollutants microorganisms and plants in this work a more rigorous mathematical model is proposed which considers the mass balances of the substrate and the microorganisms in addition to the degradation kinetics typical of biotechnological processes the life cycles of microorganisms and their horizontal and vertical transport processes this model was tuned based on the responses of already installed systems located in zapote costa rica and san salvador el salvador the model foresees start up times close to three

2015 aims to explore new ways to improve the quality of life ensuring that no one is left behind with this aim the agenda establishes 17 objectives among which the sixth objective seeks to guarantee the availability of water for all in addition to its sustainable management and sanitation although progress has been made in the coverage of water supplies and sanitation systems billions of individuals worldwide still lack such services especially in rural areas more specifically according to un data 1 6 out of 10 individuals lack access to safely managed sanitation facilities which is equivalent to more than 4 billion people worldwide and implies that over 80 of the water resulting from human activity is dumped without any kind of treatment among the targets corresponding to this objective number 6 3 claims that water quality should be improved by reducing pollution eliminating dumping and minimising the release of hazardous chemicals and materials this could halve the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increase recycling and safe reuse globally in addition to protecting public health wastewater treatment through recycling reuse and recovery can alleviate water stress and provide social economic and environmental benefits 2 3 taking into account that 69 of global water withdrawals correspond to agriculture including irrigation livestock and aquaculture 2 wastewater reuse for irrigation purposes has received attention to improve the efficiency of the water management cycle ultimately alleviating the exploitation of fresh water sources and decreasing their pollution after use and discharge 4 5 grey water is defined as domestic wastewater generated from sinks laundry and showers but excludes toilet water or black water 6 when grey water originates exclusively from personal hygiene it is referred to as light grey water in contrast the sources of dark grey water include laundry machines dishwashers and kitchen sinks 7 8 grey water represents up to 75 of total domestic wastewater with approximately 100 150 l person 1 d 1 being generated in developed countries although smaller volumes are generally generated in developing countries 9 grey water presents a lower organic nutrient and pathogen load than black water and consequently is easier to treat 7 10 thereby rendering on site treatment possible 11 thus the source separation of grey and black water can contribute to reducing discharge to wastewater treatment plants and can also help address the issue of potable water scarcity worldwide 6 12 13 moreover the reuse of grey water for non potable uses e g in toilets washing and irrigation reduces the consumption of high quality water to promote a circular economy 14 among the wide technological proposals suggested for the treatment of grey water ranging from sand filters to sophisticated biological and chemical treatments 13 15 constructed wetlands have proven to be nature based solutions which enable reduction of massive energy consumption 16 17 in fact these facilities are economically and energetically efficient for reducing the contents of organic species and biological organisms which ultimately allows the requirements of non potable reuse to be met 7 13 constructed wetlands are made up of shallow lagoons or channels depths less than 1 m that are planted with local species typical of humid areas and in which decontamination processes take place through interactions between water solid substrates microorganisms vegetation and even fauna 18 based on the water circulation characteristics constructed wetlands can be classified into surface and subsurface flows 19 20 in contrast to surface flow wetlands their subsurface equivalents admit higher organic loads reduce the risk of contact with the population and prevent the appearance of insects 21 although they are less attractive to environmental projects due to the absence of an accessible sheet of water subsurface flow constructed wetlands are the preferred option for grey water purification in rural areas of europe 18 12 subsurface constructed wetlands consist of a gravel bed that acts as a substrate for plant growth and depending on the configuration employed the wastewater flows vertically or horizontally through the bed 6 which acts as a biofilter in addition a large number of physical chemical and biological processes also take place in the bed including sedimentation filtration precipitation adsorption plant uptake and microbial decomposition 22 23 furthermore subsurface vertical flow constructed wetlands enhance oxygen transfer from the air to the wastewater flow improving their nitrification capacity with respect to that of the horizontal configuration 4 5 however the pulsed water circulation is discontinuous and so the granular medium is not permanently flooded in developed countries vertical systems are combined with horizontal ones and although this configuration appears superior it requires more sophisticated and expensive installations not to mention additional maintenance hence due to the low economic and energetic costs of horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands in addition to their particularly low impact on the environment and landscape the implementation of such configurations is especially attractive for developing countries 24 25 where natural biodegradation processes can be applied to improve n removal 26 among the disadvantages of this type of natural wastewater treatment system it should be taken into account that they require large surface areas start up lasts between three and six months and once running there are few options for their control thus at the design stage the maximum and minimum flow peaks should be considered furthermore it should be considered that they require periodic maintenance consisting of the removal of flocs from the inlet pipes the pruning of plants cleaning of the outer surface of the bed and control of the height of the flooded bed moreover in the case of observing the appearance of water on the surface the removal clearance and or replacement of the gravel with a new material of the same characteristics is required when constructed wetlands are used for the purification of dark grey water it must be considered that fats and oils prevent contact between the microorganisms and the water and could even provoke flow blockage to avoid this issue flotation is commonly employed 27 wherein a grease trap is employed for pretreatment such devices are effective for the removal of emulsified oil and grease droplets and so they are commonly employed in restaurants prior to wastewater disposal into the sanitation system 28 these devices require periodical maintenance to remove the hydrophobic layer of fats that accumulates on top to avoid overflow and bad odours an alternative method to reduce the amount of accumulated fats and avoid its subsequent treatment is bioactivation by the addition of lipases which are enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of lipids to glycerol and fatty acids 29 30 these compounds can pass through the cell walls of microorganisms 31 and so can be digested with the organic load upon reaching the sanitation system the interest in constructed wetlands as a natural based solution for wastewater treatment began in the 1980s although scientific production during the last century has been limited despite the fact that in the last decade the scientific community has returned to focus on these kinds of solutions 7 there are very few studies addressing the rigorous design of these complex systems and their dynamic responses to possible disturbances 32 33 34 grey water treatment in constructed wetlands is a complex process that includes sedimentation filtration sorption plant uptake and microbial decomposition 35 wherein each factor influences the other factors moreover modelling these interactions is difficult and complex due to a lack of appropriate models until the beginning of the 21st century the use of first order k c models was common these models assume an ideal plug flow and consider that the various parameters do not depend on the inlet concentration or the incoming flow in 2000 kadlec 36 demonstrated that these models present serious limitations for the rigorous modelling of constructed wetlands and proposed the p k c model which is based on a scheme of tanks in series indeed laaffat et al 23 used this model to estimate the profiles of degradation at the simulated gravel bed more recently mohammed and ismail 37 proposed the use of a multi layer artificial neural network model to predict the efficiency of a lab scale constructed wetland to treat real food industry wastewater from a cheese factory gomes ferreira et al 38 validated the utility of the model proposed by chan and chu for the reaction kinetics of fenton s process on the removal of atrazine 39 dittrich et al 40 and samsó et al 41 focused on modelling single physicochemical phenomena occurring on sshfcw transport processes and clogging while yuan et al 42 reviewed several single models that describe these and other complex processes occurring in cws including biochemical hydraulic reactive transport plant and clogging models these authors conclude that a single or a composite model coupling a small number of sub models cannot fully predict the decontamination processes while a comprehensive model including all sub models involves numerous parameters making the model complex and leading to diffuse interaction however the most common design procedure which is explained in detail in various technical manuals such as those published by garcía and serrano 18 and delgadillo et al 19 is based on the experience accumulated by companies and organisations from the civil engineering field and does not address the complexity of the processes and interactions that occur between solids pollutants microorganisms and plants these semi empirical models usually propose simplifications regarding the flow of wastewater though the bed the substrate degradation kinetics the kinetics of the proliferation and death of microorganisms the effect of pretreatment the horizontal transport promoted by dragging and the vertical sedimentation of microorganisms thus the current work aims to address this lack of knowledge to develop a more rigorous mathematical model than those previously published and which will describe the dynamic behaviour of a horizontal subsurface constructed wetland containing a bioactive grease trap subsequently the model will be tuned based on the response of already installed systems in addition this simulation tool will be used to study the response of the model to various disturbances such as punctual stops or seasonal variations in the incoming flow furthermore our model will consider the mass balances of the substrate and the microorganisms in addition to the degradation kinetics typical of biotechnological processes the life cycle of the microorganisms and their horizontal and vertical transport 2 modelling fig 1 shows a diagrammatic scheme of the system proposed for modelling consisting of a grease trap followed by a subsurface horizontal flow constructed wetland 2 1 the bioactive grease trap lipases are enzymes belonging to the class of esterases that catalyse the hydrolysis of lipids they use water to break the bonds of triglycerides generating glycerol and fatty acids the interfacial properties of such enzymes allow them to activate reactions that occur at the interface which is the point at which they are active 43 these unique properties render lipases an interesting additive for grease traps more specifically lipases can be added after their isolation or by means of specialised microorganisms that produce these biocatalysts such microorganisms are very common in nature where they can be collected and cultivated this is common practice in certain communities of el salvador importantly the addition of microorganisms instead of isolated enzymes is cheaper easier and more effective for the self maintenance of constructed wetland in this case the enzymatic reaction products which pass into the aqueous phase serve as the substrates for microbial activity since they can pass through the cell wall therefore the aqueous phase contains biomass microorganisms grey water and the enzymatic reaction products as outlined in fig 2 the kinetic mechanism of enzymatic lipid hydrolysis has been previously described in the literature 44 more specifically the kinetic models of such reactions that occur in biphasic organic aqueous systems consider a reaction rate based on the interfacial substrate concentration 45 46 that may be reduced to the michaelis menten form 47 1 r o k cat eo k o o where k o is the michaelis menten constant of the enzymatic reaction r o is the enzymatic reaction rate of the oils and fats k cat is the kinetic constant of the enzymatic reaction and e and o are the enzyme and oil fat concentrations at the interface respectively which are assumed to be constant e is proportional to the concentration of microorganisms in the aqueous fraction the evolution of the microbial population in the grease trap has been modelled assuming monod type kinetics 2 μ f μ f max f k f f where μ f is the specific growth rate of the microorganisms in the grease trap μ f max is the maximum growth rate of these microorganisms f is the concentration of the enzymatic reaction products in the aqueous phase and k f the monod constant or half velocity constant for the growth rate of the microorganisms in the grease trap i e the value of f when μ μ f max 0 5 modelling of the grease trap requires solving mass balances for the oils and fats and also for the microorganisms and enzymatic reaction products taking into account the high disaffinity of oils and fats towards water it can be assumed that phase segregation occurs instantaneously on the other hand due to the turbulence generated by the incoming stream the aqueous phase can be modelled as a stirred tank reactor therefore the mass balances can be written as follows 3 d m o dt q x o ρ o r o a 4 d m t dt v t μ f k dt m t v t 5 df dt v t qf r o a μ f m t y xst v t where v t is the grease trap volume q is the feed flow rate m o is the mass of the oils and fats in the grease trap x o is the volume fraction of the oils and fats in the incoming stream ρ o is the average density of the oils and fats a is the biphasic organic aqueous interface surface m t is the concentration of microorganisms in the aqueous fraction k dt is the constant desorption rate and y xst is the yield rate of the microorganisms during ordinary operation constructed wetlands do not receive a constant flow rate of grey water since this flow rate is directly determined by domestic rhythms for example kitchen sinks are used most commonly during mealtime hours while taps showers and washing machines are used at specific and punctual times the proposed model therefore simulates the inflow through pulses of adjustable durations in addition to changes in the flow rate and concentration as a result it can be adapted to the constructed wetlands that serve homes restaurants and rural hotels likewise the addition of the biocatalysts in the form of cultivated microorganisms is not constant but is carried out periodically 2 2 the constructed wetland wastewater reaches the constructed wetland after leaving the grease trap and so it accesses the gravel bed free of oils and fats but with an additional load of organic matter namely the fatty acids and glycerol components generated during enzymatic digestion of the grease likewise the microorganisms added to the grease trap for enzyme production are carried away by the water flow and enter the gravel bed mixing with the local microbial population and participating in the removal of organic matter as mentioned previously the evolution of the microbial population in the gravel bed can been modelled according to the concentration of organic matter when assuming monod type kinetics 6 μ s μ s max s k s s where μ s is the specific growth rate of microorganisms in the gravel bed μ s max is the maximum growth rate of this microbial population s is the concentration of the substrate organic matter as bod and k s is the monod constant for the growth rate of microorganisms in the wetland μ s max increases with temperature according to the modified arrhenius equation 7 μ s max r 20 σ t 20 where r 20 is the rate constant of microbial growth at a standard temperature of 20 c σ is the temperature dependence coefficient corresponding to the growth of microorganisms and t is the water temperature in c nevertheless it should be noted that several authors have demonstrated that the efficiency of wetlands in removing organic matter is not significantly affected by seasonal temperature variations 35 inside the bed microorganisms are attached to gravel particles and are also suspended in the stream to form large clusters or flocs the model should therefore consider microorganism transport both horizontally and vertically wherein the former facilitates colonisation and extends the microbial activity to the entire bed furthermore vertical transport is taken into account to consider that the sedimentation of flocs can generate a layer of sludge that blocks the interparticular voids and reduces the flow section for the wastewater thereby rendering the wetland useless the properties of the wastewater depend on both the time and the longitudinal position along the process and so for modelling purposes the gravel bed is divided longitudinally into n nodes wherein the cross section is wh and the length is δz l n w is the total width of the constructed wetland h is the flooded height of the gravel bed and l is the total length of the wetland in each node this model should resolve the mass balance of the substrate and the microorganisms in addition to the height of the sludge layer which determines the flow velocity it has also been considered that the amount of microorganisms passing from one node to the next horizontal transport as well as the amount of sludge accumulated in the bottom of the gravel bed due to settling vertical transport are both proportional to the concentration of microorganisms in each node thus the quantification coefficients f h and f v are proposed for horizontal and vertical transport respectively and the mass balances in the i node can be written as follows 8 wδzε d y i s i dt q s i 1 s i μ s i y xsw x i y i wδzε 9 wδzε d y i x i dt q x i 1 f h x i f h f v μ s i k dw x i y i wδzε 10 wδzε x s d h i dt q x i f v where ε is the gravel bed voidage x i is the concentration of microorganisms in the i node y i is the height of the free flow section in the i node x s is the concentration of microorganisms in the sludge layer and h i is the height of the sludge layer so that y i h h i as can be deduced from the previous equations the proposed model resembles that developed by kadlec 36 35 and used by laaffat et al 23 with regard to the division of the gravel bed into tanks in series however the p k c model does not consider sludge sedimentation or colonisation of the subsequent tanks by the entrapment of microorganisms and does not include grease trap modelling furthermore the degradation rate is described in terms of first order kinetics instead of using the kinetic equations of microbiological processes although the effect of evapotranspiration et and precipitation p have not been considered in the proposed development eqs 8 and 9 can be easily adapted to take into account dilution and an increase in the flow rate at each node due to meteorological conditions δq i 11 δ q i w x i p et where x i il n an algorithm written in scilab was employed for model implementation and this algorithm includes the subroutine ode for solving the set of 3n 3 ordinary differential equations eqs 3 5 and eqs 8 10 3 model parameters 3 1 dimensioning the use of the model proposed in this paper for simulating real or projected facilities requires establishing values for all the parameters defined in section 2 to date several studies have been published in the literature that are useful to determine the flow rate 32 15 48 4 5 the average grey water production per inhabitant and day and its composition in different regions throughout the world 7 49 as well as the physicochemical and biological properties of different types of wastewaters i e light mixed and dark 6 likewise several works have focused on characterisation of the outflow of operating facilities both in terms of the composition 50 20 51 13 and the efficiency of the wetland in removing the usual pollutants 12 52 53 54 55 which usually is defined as follows 12 η c o c l c o where c o and c l are the pollutant concentration at the wetland inlet and outlet respectively investigations that gather information regarding the specifications for possible reuses established in various regulations 7 10 are also useful since they allow the establishment of design objectives to size future wetlands to date several configurations have been proposed for the grease trap however its dimensions usually depend on the flow rate and the oil fat concentration in the treatment stream 28 to carry out dimensioning of the constructed wetland the standard procedure employed is based on the k c model which as mentioned above is based on the assumption that the wetland behaves as a plug flow biological reactor and that the degradation of pollutants can be described by first order kinetic equations related to the concentration of each pollutant instead of the degradation kinetic constant whose dimension is t 1 it is usual to use the product of this based on the porosity ε and the flooded height of the gravel beds h so that the dimensions of this kinetic constant k a are l t 1 table 1 lists several of the values proposed in the literature integrating the mass balance of the pollutant in the bed and taking into account that the hydraulic retention time τ i e the time that grey water remains retained in the gravel bed is defined as 13 τ εwhl q the required wetland area a wl can be estimated by the following equation 14 a q k a log c o c l it should be noted that the k c model is not valid when horizontal constructed wetland is integrated in a combined system and when it is located after a subsurface vertical flow constructed wetland in this case it should be considered that the previous system generates a certain amount of pollutants which is referred to as the background concentration c for these cases kadlec 36 proposed the p k c model accordingly the required wetland area should be estimated by 15 a q k a log c o c c l c to calculate the background concentration kadlec and wallace 35 proposed the following equations more specifically for the bod5 16 c 3 5 0 053 c o where 0 c o 200 mg l 1 for the tss 17 c 7 8 0 063 c o for the tn 18 c 1 5 mg l 1 and for the tp 19 c 0 02 mg l 1 once the wetland area has been defined its width w can be calculated using the following expression derived from darcy s law which describes the flow of a fluid through a porous bed 20 w q k h mh where k h is the hydraulic conductivity of the bed and m is the wetland slope as in the case of ε k h depends on the particle diameter of the gravel 58 on the other hand m tends to be approximately 1 2 18 while h 1 m 52 57 finally the length of the gravel bed l can be determined by 21 l a w 3 2 enzymatic activity in the bioactive grease trap in addition to the physicochemical parameters of the inlet stream the facility requirements i e the removal efficiency of pollutants and the geometric dimensioning which can be carried out based on previously published literature the simulation of a wetland using the model proposed in this work requires the definition of all parameters related to the biological activity both in the grease trap and also in the gravel bed of the wetland thus microorganisms collected from the soil of forested areas of the santa marta community in el salvador were used to obtain reference values for the kinetic constant of the enzymatic reaction and the corresponding michaelis menten constant eq 1 the constant of proportionality to determine the surface concentration of the enzymes at the interface the maximum growth rate and the monod constant corresponding to the growth rate of the microorganisms eq 2 the constant desorption rate eq 4 and the yield rate of the microorganisms added to the bioactive grease trap eq 5 the microorganisms were isolated and grown according to a procedure developed by the ades santa marta technicians i e an association for community economic and social development this procedure was based on the common practices of local farmers who use these crops for organic amendment and for soil decontamination indeed these microorganisms have demonstrated a remarkable enzymatic activity in regulating the fat and oil levels in the pretreatment stages of constructed wetlands following their cultivation which was carried out under anoxic conditions and in the absence of sunlight the microorganisms were dispersed in water to obtain the additive that will be periodically added to the grease trap in the case of the additive prepared in our laboratory several hydrolysis tests were carried out using sunflower oil and olive oil with constant stirring of the aqueous phase fatty acid production was measured via acid base titrations using phenolphthalein as the indicator and it was found that the microorganisms exhibited a slightly higher degradation capacity in the case of sunflower oil although it would be interesting to carry out the same experiments using other types of vegetable oils e g rapeseed soybean and palm and also using animal fats e g chicken pork cow and lamb the average values obtained in the tests carried out using sunflower and olive oil were considered valid see table 2 based on the values shown in table 2 the behaviour of the bioactive grease trap of a typical catering establishment was simulated the volume of the simulated trap was 0 62 m3 and the radius was 0 38 m the inlet flow rate was 600 l h 1 the concentration of fats and oils was 550 g m 3 and ρ o 900 kg m 3 finally the grease concentration at the interface was estimated to be 50 g m 2 to simulate discontinued use of the kitchen it was assumed that the service was open from 7 00 am to 1 00 pm for breakfast and lunch and from 7 00 pm to 11 00 pm for the dinner shift microorganisms were added periodically every 15 d which is the usual recharge time at the ades santa marta facilities fig 3 a shows the evolution over time for the height of the layer of oils and fats while fig 3 b reflects the concentrations of fatty acids and glycerol in the aqueous phase and fig 3 c shows the evolution of the microorganism concentration the proposed values for the parameters that describe the microbiological activity in the bioactive grease trap are given in table 2 and allow us to predict the usual behaviour of this type of facility when the appropriate additive i e that prepared following the ades santa marta procedure is employed it can be observed that during a three month period of operation the layer of fats and oils was not expected to exceed 3 5 cm as shown in fig 3 a moreover the periodic feeding of the additive prepared from the oil microorganisms significantly reduced its thickness and following the second addition the layer practically disappeared during the 5 days after recharge the subsequent exponential increase in the layer thickness was attributed to a reduction in the microbial population due to its transport by the influent towards the constructed wetland the concentration of fatty acids and glycerol in the aqueous phase both of which are products from the enzymatic reaction fig 3 b followed an inverse trend with maximum values reaching approximately 3000 g m 3 after use of the kitchen and in the initial days following addition of the bioadditive the minimum values which were approximately between 100 and 300 g m 3 occurred in the hours prior to the use of the kitchen and particularly in the days prior to recharging when the concentration of microorganisms in the aqueous phase reached its minimum value of approximately 850 g m 3 fig 3 c 3 3 biological activity in the wetland bed to establish reference values for the parameters that describe the biological activity in the wetland bed the results published by moncada 56 and bolaños and gonzález 57 have been particularly useful more specifically the first of these works evaluated the design of a horizontal constructed wetland installed in zapote costa rica while the latter evaluated the efficiency of a constructed wetland designed to treat dark grey water from the kitchens of the university of el salvador although in both cases the facilities included pretreatment systems for fat and oil elimination the authors only reported information related to pollutant concentrations of the inlet and outlet streams the dimensions of the costa rican wetland were as follows w 1 0 m h 0 7 m and l 5 m q 70 l h 1 s in 230 g m 3 and ε 0 5 the organic matter concentration in the outlet stream measured by moncada was 18 1 g m 3 which is equivalent to a removal efficiency of 92 in contrast the wetland built in the salvadoran university campus was markedly larger where w 5 0 m h 0 8 m and l 15 m this larger size was necessary since it is designed to treat a significantly higher flow rate of q 14 5 m3 d 1 and has an estimated organic load approximately three times higher than that of the first facility i e s in 700 g m 3 the gravel used in the construction of this second facility is also finer and consequently its voidage is lower ε 0 35 the organic matter concentration in the outlet of the gravel bed measured by bolaños and gonzález was 35 g m 3 which is equivalent to a removal efficiency of 95 fig 4 shows the evolution over time of the removal efficiency estimated based on the simulation of these two constructed wetlands and using the parameters proposed in table 3 these parameters were determined by establishing ranges based on the usual values in biological reactions of degradation of organic matter in wastewater the optimum values set out in table 3 were obtained by constrained optimization using the subroutine fminsearch in scilab which is based on the modified nelder mead algorithm the objective function was defined as the variance associated with the differences between the results published in the literature and those predicted by the model it can be seen that in both cases the fitting between the results obtained with the model and those measured experimentally is reasonably good since after one year of operation the estimated efficiencies agree with the reported values and remain stable over time the model also predicts start up periods of approximately three months for the facilities which is a typical time scale in tropical regions in the smaller wetland studied by moncada the start up time was slightly faster although a few additional weeks were required to reach a stable operating value η 92 furthermore the model was able to foresee a slight decrease in efficiency as the operating time increased this will be discussed in the following section in the larger facility the start up was initially slower but after the first month the microbial activity increased and quickly reached values above 90 the model also foresees slightly higher efficiency values during the first weeks after reaching optimal operation levels in addition to a slight decrease from the fifth month to stabilise at the value reported by the authors i e η 95 these slight differences in the behaviours of the two wetlands can be attributed to the differences in their dimensions the influent flow and the organic load in the treated water thus when treating wastewater with a significantly higher organic load it is expected that the salvadoran wetland is more efficient the values proposed in table 3 have been also used to simulate the facility studied by laaffat et al 23 and built at a primary school in marrakech morocco in this case the model was able to foresee an efficiency of approximately 94 which agrees with the data reported by the authors it would be interesting to simulate additional facilities to confirm these values or to extend the ranges proposed in table 3 since it is foreseeable that these will be affected by the type of organic load i e light or dark grey water by the average annual temperature by the rainfall regime and even by the plant species present on the surface nevertheless the results obtained in the simulations show that the model is able to accurately simulate the operation of three facilities installed in two different regions with widely different nominal dimensions and capacities it can therefore be expected that it will be well suited for the modelling and simulation of any subsurface horizontal flow constructed wetland 4 simulations although future works will produce additional experimental data to consolidate the tuning of the model the developed simulation tool has demonstrated its ability to simulate real systems and it can also be used to analyse the evolution of non measurable parameters in operating facilities and to study the effect of modifying the operating parameters as a result our simulation tool can be used to anticipate the response of the system to establish stabilisation measures in case of occasional disturbances and to predict the future behaviours of projected facilities to demonstrate some of these possibilities the results obtained in several simulations that aim to address these situations are discussed below more specifically fig 5 shows the evolution of the amount of organic matter as bod and microorganism concentrations over time at the outlet of a system consisting of a 250 l bioactive grease trap and a constructed wetland with a 1 m width a 5 m length and a 0 7 m height this wetland is assumed to be fed with a flow rate of 70 l h 1 and a substrate load of 230 g m 3 in the same hourly intervals previously defined for the simulation of the grease trap in fig 3 the other model parameters are comparable to those presented in tables 2 and 3 in fig 5 a it can be seen that the model foresees a period close to two months until the substrate concentration in the outlet reaches values that allow the reuse of water for agriculture applications and one additional month until it is stabilised at values that correspond to an efficiency close to 94 which is typical for this type of facility fig 5 b where the evolution of the outlet microorganism concentration over time can be observed shows that using the proposed values this parameter reaches a maximum slightly higher than 45 g m 3 during the start up phase which rapidly reduces to negligible values once the steady state is reached this maximum which occurs after approximately 50 d can be attributed to the poor performance of the constructed wetland during the initial weeks which results in higher substrate and microorganism concentrations throughout the entire gravel bed once the bacterial population grows and stabilises in the section close to the wastewater inlet the microbiological activity is sufficient to significantly reduce the substrate concentration as the wastewater flows towards the outlet thereby limiting the growth of microorganisms in this section of the bed this hypothesis was confirmed by analysing the evolution of the substrate and microorganism concentrations over time in addition to their analysing longitudinal positions as shown in figs 6 and 7 accordingly in fig 6 it can be seen that although the substrate concentration profile along the gravel bed is always descending during the initial weeks after start up of the facility the achieved reduction in the organic load is moderate but it increases during the subsequent weeks of operation reaching pronounced levels after two months of operation in fig 7 it can be seen that bacterial population in the bed which initially does not contain microorganisms grows rapidly during the first weeks and in particular in the section closest to the inlet where it reaches values above 600 g m 3 after the first two months of operation as a consequence of this increase of the bacterial population close to the entrance the supply of substrate to the subsequent sections is notably reduced and the microorganism colony becomes unable to find adequate conditions to continue proliferating as a result its growth is contained this reduction in the digestion capacity of the bed explains the slight decrease in efficiency after the maximum is reached during the third month of operation this correlates with the observations made for the simulated installation based on the study by bolaños and gonzález 57 fig 4 complementing this information fig 8 shows the evolution over time and the longitudinal position of the thickness of the sludge layer in the gravel bed this sludge layer is formed by the sedimentation of flocs suspended in the wastewater it can be seen that the increase in the bacterial population in the section closest to the entrance leads to a linear increase in the amount of sludge deposited although after one year of operation the sludge does not block any more than 6 cm of the bed and this only occurs in specific longitudinal positions since the thickness of the settled layer is significantly lower in the latter sections of the wetland consequently the reduction in the hydraulic retention time is moderate i e less than 0 2 with values slightly higher than 1 d being achieved during the entire period of time simulated using this model it should also be possible to study the response of the system to a variation in the operating conditions as an example the effect of a six week shutdown was studied in a facility containing a grease trap similar to that simulated in fig 3 volume 0 62 m3 radius 0 38 m in addition to a constructed wetland similar to the one analysed by bolaños and gonzález 57 w 5 0 m h 0 8 m l 15 m which is fed with a flow of 14 5 m3 d 1 and an organic load of 700 g m 3 in the same hourly intervals previously defined for the simulation above this facility is located on a university campus and so the simulation of this shutdown allows anticipation of the system response to the holiday period during which time the coffee shops are closed for this simulation it was considered that the shutdown begins after 200 d when the steady state has been reached and the concentration profiles of the substrate and the microorganisms along the bed are stable it was assumed that during the shutdown period no wastewater is fed into the system although maintenance of the grease trap is continued fig 9 shows the evolution over time of the microorganism concentration in addition to its longitudinal position from this figure it can be observed that as a consequence of the shutdown when no substrate is fed into the system the microbial population is unable to proliferate and is greatly affected by the death rate consequently the microorganisms concentration decreases rapidly below 200 g m 3 accordingly it should be pointed out that the model proposed does not include the death rate of microorganisms thus the results of the simulations showed that under the usual operating conditions in the constructed wetland the residence times are rather short and therefore the decrease in the microbial population is much more affected by the horizontal and vertical transport than by the death rate nevertheless this parameter should be considered when the set up does not receive inlet flow given that in this case the residence time increases considerably and therefore the horizontal transport of microorganisms is cancelled when campus activity is resumed and wastewater is fed once again into the constructed wetland the microbiological growth is quickly reactivated and over a period of two or three weeks high microbial concentrations are reached although these concentrations are slightly lower than those predicted by the simulation during the period prior to the shutdown it is remarkable that this new start up of the facility is faster than that foreseen by the model at the beginning of the simulation and it is also noteworthy that concentration of microorganisms at the outlet does not increase as is observed in the initial weeks after commissioning this phenomenon was also observed when studying the behaviour of the other simulated facility see fig 7 the decrease in the bacterial population has a very significant effect on the efficiency of the constructed wetland in the purification of wastewater as can be observed in fig 10 at the end of the holiday shutdown activity returns to the coffee shops and consequently substrate is fed back into the system however since the microorganism concentration in the bed decreased during the shutdown the substrate concentration in the outlet increases rapidly during the initial weeks to reach high values close to 650 g m 3 thereby affecting the efficiency of the facility the presence of substrate nutrients then activates bacterial proliferation as can be seen in fig 9 and consequently the purification capacity of the bed recovers over a period of six to eight weeks to give contamination levels in the outlet comparable to those observed prior to shutdown and the efficiency is raised above 96 it is noteworthy that according to the results foreseen by the model the slight reduction in the concentration of microorganisms in the section closest to the inlet of the wastewater after the shutdown foreseen by the model fig 9 does not affect the good performance of the constructed wetland since following stabilisation the substrate concentration at the outlet returns to the same values reached prior to the shutdown in tropical countries the rainy season leads to a considerable alteration of the wetland operating conditions not only due to the increase in flow but also due to dilution of the organic load although the effect of climatic events on the performance of water disinfection system 59 and wastewater treatment plants 60 has been previously discussed in the literature there is a lack of knowledge regarding their effect on the performance of constructed wetland thus to anticipate the effect of this meteorological phenomenon on the wetland performance the entry of an additional flow of rainwater i e without an organic load from the surface of the constructed wetland was simulated and as a result the flow through the bed was found to increase longitudinally in this simulation it must be considered that the additional contribution of diluted wastewater directly accesses the gravel bed without passing through the bioactive grease trap it should be noted here that this simulated system is the same as that proposed for the previous simulation which is based on that studied by bolaños and gonzález 57 and is located on a salvadoran university campus the average daily precipitation in this region in the rainy season i e from may to october is close to 240 mm which is equivalent to an incoming flow of 10 l m 2 h 1 for the simulation it was considered that the rainy season begins after 200 d when the steady state has been reached and the concentration profiles of the substrate and the microorganisms in the bed are stable in fig 11 it can be seen that the beginning of the rainy season initially causes a moderate decrease in the concentration of microorganisms in the bed likely due to dilution and that in the following weeks the bed adapts the bacterial population to the new flow conditions and the available substrate as a result in the following rainy months a slight but continued decrease in this parameter is foreseen when the dry season returns after 180 d the concentration of microorganisms increases rapidly in the section closest to the wastewater entrance as a consequence of an increase in the substrate concentration although as can be seen from fig 9 the maximum level was slightly lower than the value foreseen by the model for the period before the start of the rainy season as previously mentioned the entry of rainwater into the constructed wetland causes dilution of the nutrient concentration in the bed fig 12 however contrary to our observations at the restart following the holiday shutdown the arrival of the dry season does not substantially alter the good performance of the installation and although a slight increase in the substrate concentration is observed the values are very similar to those foreseen by the model before the beginning of the rainy season these results agree with those obtained by masi et al 32 who carried out a two year performance evaluation of the performances of four different constructed wetland treatment systems established to treat wastewater effluent from tourist activities i e with a high variability in the water consumption and the wastewater flow depending on the season and the weather they concluded that constructed wetlands are robust and relatively resistant to peak flows and loads finally the differences in the behaviour of the wetland in the two simulations was attributed to the fact that in this second case the precipitation dilutes but does not substantially reduce the bacterial population of the bed as a result when recovering the conditions prior to the alteration the bed exhibits a sufficient biological activity to rapidly adapt to the slight increase in the substrate concentration dilution of the substrate due to rainfall which is foreseen throughout the bed in fact involves a reduction in the substrate concentration at the outlet which causes a slight increase in the efficiency of the wetland during the rainy months fig 13 5 conclusions a rigorous mathematical model has been proposed to describe the dynamic behaviour of horizontal subsurface constructed wetlands containing a bioactive grease trap this model considers the mass balances of the substrate and the microorganisms in addition to the degradation kinetics of the biological processes the life cycle of the microorganisms and their horizontal and vertical transport processes the former i e horizontal transport guarantees the propagation and maintenance of the microbial colony in all sections of the bed while the latter i e vertical transport causes the collapse of the facility by sedimentation the tuning of this model was completed by setting values for all parameters to ensure that the developed simulation tool allows the simulation of real or projected facilities the model foresees start up times close to three months and depuration efficiencies above 90 these values are in accordance with those measured in operating facilities and published in the literature this new simulation tool can also be used to analyse the evolution of unmeasurable parameters in operating facilities and to study the effects of modifying operating parameters it is therefore able to anticipate the response of the system to establish stabilisation measures in case of occasional disturbances and also to predict the future behaviour of projected facilities thus during the ordinary start up the model foresees an increase in the bacterial population in the entrance section which reduces the supply of substrate to the subsequent sections and slightly decreases the efficiency after the maximum reached during the third month of operation furthermore the simulation of a six week shutdown allowed anticipation of the system response to the holiday period more specifically the model foresees that under these conditions the microbial population cannot proliferate and is greatly affected by the death microbial rate which significantly affects the efficiency of the wetland in contrast the arrival of the rainy season does not significantly affect the wetland performance since the substrate concentration in the outlet is reduced slightly due to dilution and as a result the efficiency increases

organics produced fe3 ions can act as effective coagulating agent removing dissolved solids through precipitation thus in this process oxidation and coagulation act in tandem increasing the overall

progresses 24 the dosing of chemicals needs to be optimized as it provides an estimate of the total amount of reagents needed and hence the economic viability peroxide in excess can have radical scavenging effect or may undergo self decomposition 25 excess of peroxide is harmful for ecological systems similarly iron in excess can also have scavenging effect affecting the available hydroxyl radicals for pollutant degradation 21 in this work application of fenton process for degradation of organics in the flowback water is investigated a kinetic model is developed to determine the

only uncomplexed fe iii participate as indicated by reaction numbers 13 14 in table 1 it is assumed that a part of initial form of organic r is mineralized to carbon dioxide and water while the rest

pretreatment the raw water samples were passed through a sand bed consisting of fine sand particles 22 tyler mesh undersize by gravity to remove any coagulating particles and flocs the filtrate thus collected was characterized refer table s1 in supplementary section the sand filtrate was further subjected to froth flotation to remove oil from water froth flotation was carried out at 900 mg l of surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide for 10 h at room temperature with air flow rate of 5 5 l min the froth layer was removed and the treated water thus obtained from the froth flotation was characterized refer table s2 in supplementary section and subjected to the fenton process 3 4 experimental procedure in order to design the aop experiments the effect of initial solution ph was investigated first for this purpose separate sample batches of 25 ml flowback water were taken and the solution ph was varied from 2 3 5 7 10 5 and 12 required ph was set using 1 m hno3 and 1 m naoh all the experiments to study the ph effect were carried out with fixed dose of ferrous sulfate and hydrogen peroxide fenton reagents 0 02 m of ferrous sulfate was added into water under constant stirring shaking speed 200 rpm in an orbital shaker at 25 c and sufficient time was allowed for the salt to dissolve completely after a dark greenish solution was obtained 1 m of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 was added sequentially for 20 min at an interval of 5 min in the absence of light after the final dose of peroxide the solution was kept under constant stirring for 48 h the sequential addition of hydrogen peroxide was reported for oxidation of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol and phenol for good supply of reactive species 28 38 the samples were collected and filtered through whatman filter paper and the insoluble brownish sludge was separated from the sample the filtered water was characterized to determine the residual amount of total organic carbon toc and other effluent parameters the above procedure was followed for both of the samples as described in section 3 1 for dose optimization of fenton reagents ferrous sulfate and hydrogen peroxide concentration of one of the reagent was varied at optimum ph keeping the concentration of the other reagent constant for optimization of ferrous sulfate dose its concentration was varied as 0 007 0 01 0 014 0 018 0 02 0 025 0 028 0 036 m at a fixed peroxide dose of 1 m and ph 7 optimized experiments were conducted at ambient temperature 25 c in absence of light filtrate was collected after 72 h for analysis similarly for optimization of hydrogen peroxide dose its concentration was varied as 0 5 0 7 0 9 1 1 1 3 1 5 1 7 1 9 m using sequential addition at fixed ferrous sulfate dose of 0 018 m filtrate was collected after 72 h for analysis for kinetic experiments optimized process conditions optimum dose of reagents and optimized ph were used to carry out the experiments the experiments were performed in 15 batches with 25 ml of pretreated flowback water required amount of ferrous sulfate and hydrogen peroxide adding sequentially up to 20 min at an interval of 5 min were added to each sample the reaction of each batch was terminated by adding 1 mg l of manganese dioxide mno2 after a fixed time point thus the reaction was allowed for all batches for 15 different time durations up to 72 h upon arresting the reactions the samples were filtered and analyzed for toc the percentage removal of organics was calculated as 2 removal 1 c f c 0 100 where c f is the final and c 0 is the initial concentration of toc 3 5

spectrometer spectrum 100 ftir spectrometer perkinelmer usa 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of initial ph the variation of percentage removal with initial solution ph is presented in fig 1 it is evident that the percentage removal of toc increases marginally up to ph 7 0 and then decreases for each of the samples maximum toc removal was obtained at ph 7 at acidic ph rate of degradation is higher compared to alkaline range because of higher concentration of free unreacted fe2 ions in the solution that reacts with hydrogen peroxide generating hydroxyl radicals facilitating the degradation of organics at ph beyond 7 precipitation of ferric ions results in reddish brown precipitate of fe oh 3 that inhibits the organic degradation 39 at ph 7 around 60 44 removal of toc is obtained for sample 1 similarly for sample 2 at ph 7 around 74 72 removal of toc is obtained 4 2 effect of ferrous sulfate and hydrogen peroxide the variation of toc removal with ferrous sulfate and hydrogen peroxide fenton reagents is presented in fig 2 a and b the variation of toc removal with ferrous sulfate for a fixed concentration of hydrogen peroxide is presented in fig 2 a from the figure it is observed that for each sample the percentage removal of toc increases with the ferrous sulfate concentration up to a particular value and decreases thereafter ferrous sulfate reacts with hydrogen peroxide facilitating the generation of hydroxyl radicals resulting in higher toc removal however excess iron present in the sample exhibits radical scavenging effect leading to recombination of fe2 and oh thereby reducing the organic removal efficiency ferrous ions combine with the hydroxyl ions to produce ferric ions table 1 reaction 9 decreasing the availability of hydroxyl radicals for organic degradation the ferric ions either form complexes or precipitate as ferric hydroxide while only a part of it produces ferrous ions which in turn react with hydrogen peroxide to generate more hydroxyl radicals leading to the organic degradation at lower than optimum dose of ferrous sulfate rate of removal of the organics decreases due to the unavailability of sufficient amount of catalyst for sample 1 at fixed peroxide concentration of 1 m and optimum ph of 7 percentage removal increases from 43 60 to 62 62 upon variation of ferrous sulfate dose from 0 014 to 0 021 m for sample 2 percentage removal increases from 41 27 to 78 75 upon variation of ferrous sulfate dose from 0 014 to 0 018 m after which it decreases thus 0 018 m ferrous sulfate can be considered optimum for both the samples after optimizing the amount of ferrous sulfate the effect of hydrogen peroxide was determined for the two samples the variation of percentage removal of toc with peroxide concentration was studied and is presented in fig 2 b it can be observed from the figure that the percentage of toc removal increases with the hydrogen peroxide dose up to 1 5 m and remains unaltered thereafter in presence of ferrous sulfate and subsequent addition of hydrogen peroxide in the solution hydroxyl radicals are produced that are scavenged by the organics with increase in the dose of peroxide in the solution radical scavenging effect increases leading to a decrease in the effective overall concentration of reactive species in the system however hydroxyl radicals are scavenged by hydrogen peroxide table 1 reaction no 10 itself beyond 1 5 m decreasing its availability for reaction with organics thus beyond that concentration of peroxide percentage toc removal becomes invariant interestingly this dose of hydrogen peroxide becomes same for both the samples for sample 1 at ferrous sulfate dose of 0 018 m at ph of 7 0 variation of hydrogen peroxide dose from 0 5 to 1 5 m increases the percentage removal from 43 to 69 26 increase similarly for sample 2 the percentage removal increases from 69 to 84 15 increase at the same conditions thus 1 5 m h2o2 may be considered as the optimum dose for both the samples 4 3 kinetic studies the kinetic model developed in this study was used to determine the degradation rate constants for the reactions 22 23 24 and 25 in table 1 for each of the samples using the method of the minimization of sum of square errors s as presented in section 2 the optimized rate constant values are reported in table 2 these rate constants obtained for sample 1 are used to calculate the profile of toc concentration in the sample 2 in predictive mode from the fig 3 it is observed that both the simulated concentration profiles corroborate satisfactorily with the experimental data fig 3 indicates that the toc concentration in both the samples decreases with the progress of reaction toc concentration at any point is the sum of concentration of r r1 and r2 it is observed that the rate of degradation is extremely high within first 30 min and decreases thereafter attaining a constant value after 30 h at the beginning surplus availability of ferrous ions and hydrogen peroxide produces large concentration of reactive hydroxyl radicals oh that degrade the organics efficiently this is corroborated by the profiles of concentration of hydrogen peroxide and other reactive species presented in fig s1 in the supplementary section fig s1 a shows the profile of hydrogen peroxide concentration its concentration decreases with time but spiked every 5 min due to its sequential addition up to 20 min the concentration of h2o2 declines steeply after that due to its consumption in the reaction beyond 30 h concentration of h2o2 becomes negligibly small o 2 and ho 2 radicals also participate in some reactions to regenerate fe2 and h2o2 however ho 2 is generated in some reactions and consumed in other reactions thus ho 2 attains its maximum concentration after 10 h refer fig s1 c o 2 is generated mainly by degradation of ho 2 hence its concentration reaches maximum at 20 min and falls sharply thereafter the concentration profiles of both these species show spike every 5 min up to 20 min of reaction because of sequential addition of h2o2 and the generation of these species depend on the concentration of h2o2 the most reactive hydroxyl radical oh is produced by the reaction of feso4 and h2o2 refer reaction 8 of table 1 therefore its concentration is directly proportional to concentration of h2o2 this is reflected in the spike of oh concentration in fig s1 d every 5 min on sequential addition of h2o2 up to 20 min however oh is consumed in many reactions including degradation reactions of organics therefore it shows a local maxima at 30 h and decreases thereafter all these observations corroborate that after 30 h degradation of organics is marginal a part of the initial organics r produces intermediate r1 that in turn results in the formation of inert r2 presence of inert organic r2 indicated the constant value of toc in the long run refer fig 3 fig 4 and fig s2 in supplementary section summarize the concentration profiles of the organics in sample 1 and sample 2 respectively it can be seen that r is mainly mineralised to simpler by products carbon dioxide and water a part of r is converted to r1 the profile of r1 indicates that it reaches maxima after which it starts degrading to carbon dioxide and water the curve for inert r2 shows its formation from r1 and then reaching a constant non zero value accounting for residual non zero toc in the solution 4 4 profile of ph of the reaction mixture variation of ph with time for optimum dose of fenton reagents ferrous sulfate and hydrogen peroxide are shown in fig 5 a and b for both the samples these figures indicate a sharp decrease in ph at the start of the reaction and gradually thereafter the decrease in ph is due to increase in h ions in the system the decrease becomes almost constant after 10 h when the reaction is almost completed the simulated data fits well with the experimental data 4 5 sludge characterization the fesem images of the sludge collected from both the samples under same magnification are presented in fig 6 from the images it can be observed that there is an absence of well defined crystalline appearance on the surface of sludge 40 it can also be interpreted that the surface texture and packing density are different for both the cases for the sludge collected from sample 1 fig 6 a the particles on the surface are tightly packed without much cracks and pores while for the sludge collected from sample 2 fig 6 b the texture is loosely packed indicating a more porous structure the xrd spectra for both the samples represented by fig 7 a b did not show any sharp peak over a broad range of d spacing 2ө indicating random arrangement of particles within the sludge both fesem and xrd though qualitatively give a reasonable idea about amorphous nature of sludge 41 in both the cases eds spectra indicate the presence of high content of iron in the sludge owing to formation of fe oh 3 quantitatively amount of sludge obtained from sample 1 and sample 2 were measured to be 0 5 g l and 0 42 g l respectively the iron rich sludge can be used for preparation of bricks in brick kilns as a reinforcing material elemental analysis results weight percentage and atomic percentage of sludge generated from both the samples were tabulated in table s3 of supplementary section fig s3 in the supplementary section shows the ir spectrum of sample 1 and sample 2 it can be observed that both the samples showed almost identical peaks the ftir spectrum of sample 1 indicates the presence of strong oh bond involved in hydrogen bonding at band 3435 65 cm 1 in the precipitate while bands at 1636 85 cm 1 1480 cm 1 correspond to cc alkenes and aromatic cc stretching similarly from ftir spectra of sample 2 it can be observed that band at 3435 342 cm 1 corresponds to intermolecular bonded oh stretching while bands at 1666 80 cm 1 and 1408 cm 1correspond to alkene cc stretching and sulfate so stretching respectively 5 conclusion fenton process was found effective in significant reduction of organics from pretreated flowback water the effectiveness of the method was verified using two samples collected from two different locations of ongc organic reduction was optimum at initial ph around 7 indicating that ph adjustment was not necessary for initiation of fenton reactions 0 018 m of ferrous sulfate and 1 5 m of hydrogen peroxide were found to be optimum for the effective degradation of organics degradation kinetics was very fast within first 5 h and gradual thereafter within 5 h 68 and 80 of organics were degraded in sample 1 and 2 and after 30 h degradation was 74 and 82 respectively the change in degradation was marginal thereafter the average generated sludge was 0 45 g l the sludge was found to be comprised mainly of carbon oxygen and iron the developed kinetic model agreed well with the experimental data and can be useful in scaling up overall fenton process can

treatment methods that utilize the non selective and highly reactive species such as ozone and hydroxyl radicals for complete mineralization of toxic organic pollutants to carbon dioxide and water broadly aops include fenton process with and without uv irradiation ozonation photocatalysis etc 13 electro fenton process produces strong hydroxyl radicals but accumulation of hydrogen peroxide at cathode is low which lowers the process efficiency 14 high cost of uv lamps makes photo fenton process expensive 15 fenton process is used to treat effluent generated from textile pulp bleaching

hydrogen peroxide fenton reagents is presented in fig 2 a and b the variation of toc removal with ferrous sulfate for a fixed concentration of hydrogen peroxide is presented in fig 2 a from the figure it is observed that for each sample the percentage removal of toc increases with the ferrous sulfate concentration up to a particular value and decreases thereafter ferrous sulfate reacts with hydrogen peroxide facilitating the generation of hydroxyl radicals resulting in higher toc removal however excess iron present in the sample exhibits radical scavenging effect leading to recombination of fe2 and oh thereby reducing the organic removal efficiency ferrous ions combine with the hydroxyl ions to produce ferric ions table 1 reaction 9 decreasing the availability of hydroxyl radicals for organic degradation the ferric ions either form complexes or precipitate as ferric hydroxide while only a part of it produces ferrous ions which in turn react with hydrogen peroxide to generate more hydroxyl radicals leading to the organic degradation at lower than optimum dose of ferrous sulfate rate of removal of the organics decreases due to the unavailability of sufficient amount of catalyst for sample 1 at fixed peroxide concentration of 1 m and optimum ph of 7 percentage removal increases from 43 60 to 62 62 upon variation of ferrous sulfate dose from 0 014 to 0 021 m for sample 2 percentage removal increases from 41 27 to 78 75 upon variation of ferrous sulfate dose from 0 014 to 0 018 m after which it decreases thus 0 018 m ferrous sulfate can be considered optimum for both the samples after optimizing the amount of ferrous sulfate the effect of hydrogen peroxide was determined for the two samples the variation of percentage removal of toc with peroxide concentration was studied and is presented in fig 2 b it can be observed from the figure that the percentage of toc removal increases with the hydrogen peroxide dose up to 1 5 m and remains unaltered thereafter in presence of ferrous sulfate and subsequent addition of hydrogen peroxide in the solution hydroxyl radicals are produced that are scavenged by the organics with increase in the dose of peroxide in the solution radical scavenging effect increases leading to a decrease in the effective overall concentration of reactive species in the system however hydroxyl radicals are scavenged by hydrogen peroxide table 1 reaction no 10 itself beyond 1 5 m decreasing its availability for reaction with organics thus beyond that concentration of peroxide percentage toc removal becomes invariant interestingly this dose of hydrogen peroxide becomes same for both the samples for sample 1 at ferrous sulfate dose of 0 018 m at ph of 7 0 variation of hydrogen peroxide dose from 0 5 to 1 5 m increases the percentage removal from 43 to 69 26 increase similarly for sample 2 the percentage removal increases from 69 to 84 15 increase at the same conditions thus 1 5 m h2o2 may be considered as the optimum dose for both the samples 4 3 kinetic studies the kinetic model developed in this study was used to determine the degradation rate constants for the reactions 22 23 24 and 25 in table 1 for each of the samples using the method of the minimization of sum of square errors s as presented in section 2 the optimized rate constant values are reported in table 2 these rate constants obtained for sample 1 are used to calculate the profile of toc concentration in the sample 2 in predictive mode from the fig 3 it is observed that both the simulated concentration profiles corroborate satisfactorily with the experimental data fig 3 indicates that the toc concentration in both the samples decreases with the progress of reaction toc concentration at any point is the sum of concentration of r r1 and r2 it is observed that the rate of degradation is extremely high within first 30 min and decreases thereafter attaining a constant value after 30 h at the beginning surplus availability of ferrous ions and hydrogen peroxide produces large concentration of reactive hydroxyl radicals oh that degrade the organics efficiently this is corroborated by the profiles of concentration of hydrogen peroxide and other reactive species presented in fig s1 in the supplementary section fig s1 a shows the profile of hydrogen peroxide concentration its concentration decreases with time but spiked every 5 min due to its sequential addition up to 20 min the concentration of h2o2 declines steeply after that due to its consumption in the reaction beyond 30 h concentration of h2o2 becomes negligibly small o 2 and ho 2 radicals also participate in some reactions to regenerate fe2 and h2o2 however ho 2 is generated in some reactions and consumed in other reactions thus ho 2 attains its maximum concentration after 10 h refer fig s1 c o 2 is generated mainly by degradation of ho 2 hence its concentration reaches maximum at 20 min and falls sharply thereafter the concentration profiles of both these species show spike every 5 min up to 20 min of reaction because of sequential addition of h2o2 and the generation of these species depend on the concentration of h2o2 the most reactive hydroxyl radical oh is produced by the reaction of feso4 and h2o2 refer reaction 8 of table 1 therefore its concentration is directly proportional to concentration of h2o2 this is reflected in the spike of oh concentration in fig s1 d every 5 min on sequential addition of h2o2 up to 20 min however oh is consumed in many reactions including degradation reactions of organics therefore it shows a local maxima at 30 h and decreases thereafter all these observations corroborate that after 30 h degradation of organics is marginal a part of the initial organics r produces intermediate r1 that in turn results in the formation of inert r2 presence of inert organic r2 indicated the constant value of toc in the long run refer fig 3 fig 4 and fig s2 in supplementary section summarize the concentration profiles of the organics in sample 1 and sample 2 respectively it can be seen that r is mainly mineralised to simpler by products carbon dioxide and water a part of r is converted to r1 the profile of r1 indicates that it reaches maxima after which it starts degrading to carbon dioxide and water the curve for inert r2 shows its formation from r1 and then reaching a constant non zero value accounting for residual non zero toc in the solution 4 4 profile of ph of the reaction mixture variation of ph with time for optimum dose of fenton reagents ferrous sulfate and hydrogen peroxide are shown in fig 5 a and b for both the samples these figures indicate a sharp decrease in ph at the start of the reaction and gradually thereafter the decrease in ph is due to increase in h ions in the system the decrease becomes almost constant after 10 h when the reaction is almost completed the simulated data fits well with the experimental data 4 5 sludge characterization the fesem images of the sludge collected from both the samples under same magnification are presented in fig 6 from the images it can be observed that there is an absence of well defined crystalline appearance on the surface of sludge 40 it can also be interpreted that the surface texture and packing density are different for both the cases for the sludge collected from sample 1 fig 6 a the particles on the surface are tightly packed without much cracks and pores while for the sludge collected from sample 2 fig 6 b the texture is loosely packed indicating a more porous structure the xrd spectra for both the samples represented by fig 7 a b did not show any sharp peak over a broad range of d spacing 2ө indicating random arrangement of particles within the sludge both fesem and xrd though qualitatively give a reasonable idea about amorphous nature of sludge 41 in both the cases eds spectra indicate the presence of high content of iron in the sludge owing to formation of fe oh 3 quantitatively amount of sludge obtained from sample 1 and sample 2 were measured to be 0 5 g l and 0 42 g l respectively the iron rich sludge can be used for preparation of bricks in brick kilns as a reinforcing material elemental analysis results weight percentage and atomic percentage of sludge generated from both the samples were tabulated in table s3 of supplementary section fig s3 in the supplementary section shows the ir spectrum of sample 1 and sample 2 it can be observed that both the samples showed almost identical peaks the ftir spectrum of sample 1 indicates the presence of strong oh bond involved in hydrogen bonding at band 3435 65 cm 1 in the precipitate while bands at 1636 85 cm 1 1480 cm 1 correspond to cc alkenes and aromatic cc stretching similarly from ftir spectra of sample 2 it can be observed that band at 3435 342 cm 1 corresponds to intermolecular bonded oh stretching while bands at 1666 80 cm 1 and 1408 cm 1correspond to alkene cc stretching and sulfate so stretching respectively 5 conclusion fenton process was found effective in significant reduction of organics from pretreated flowback water the effectiveness of the method was verified using two samples collected from two different locations of ongc organic reduction was optimum at initial ph around 7 indicating that ph adjustment was not necessary for initiation of fenton reactions 0 018 m of ferrous sulfate and 1 5 m of hydrogen peroxide were found to be optimum for the effective degradation of organics degradation kinetics was very fast within first 5 h and gradual thereafter within 5 h 68 and 80 of organics were degraded in sample 1 and 2 and after 30 h degradation was 74 and 82 respectively the change in degradation was marginal thereafter the average generated sludge was 0 45 g l the sludge was found to be comprised mainly of carbon oxygen and iron the developed kinetic model agreed well with the experimental data and can be useful in scaling up overall fenton process can

13013,membrane bioreactors mbrs have been well established as an advanced wastewater treatment technology that combines activated sludge with a pressure driven membrane separation process they have been widely applied in municipal and industrial wastewater treatment systems due to their advantages over conventional activated sludge systems however mbrs still face major issues hindering their widespread implementation such as poor effluent quality due to low retention of trace organic contaminants instability due to changing operating conditions and organic membrane fouling membrane distillation md bioreactor mdbr is a novel wastewater treatment technology that combines mbrs with an md unit either separated at a side stream or submerged in the bioreactor the concept of hybrid mdbr configuration was firstly introduced in 2007 which was followed by numerous journal articles these studies demonstrated the mdbr potential for water nutrients bioenergy and other value added product recovery from domestic and industrial wastewater however there is still a lack of a comprehensive study that shows the full mdbr potential hence there is a need for a dedicated review that summarize and critically analyse these research findings and highlight the research gaps to provide clear path for future research this review presents system availability and applications of hybrid mdbr in particular the review presents brief introduction of mbr and md technologies followed by covering the evolution of mdbr as a novel technology for municipal and industrial wastewater treatment several applications of mdbr systems are reviewed with a focus on system performance and removal efficiencies the potential of mdbr to widen wastewater reuse and achieve nutrient and biogas recovery is also presented finally the main challenges that hinder the development of mdbr are discussed while recommendations on future perspectives towards mdbr commercialization are suggested keywords hybrid md configurations wastewater reclamation high quality effluent energy recovery nutrient recovery 1 wastewater as a resource for circular economy almost 36 of the world s population is living in water scarce regions therefore countries around the world face an array of water policy to manage the water scarcity while maintaining the quality standards for eco system protection according to world bank report 2020 more than half of the world s population will be at risk of water scarcity by 2050 1 climate change and rapid urban sprawl in middle low income countries need to be considered as these elements may alter the quantity quality and distribution of water increase in population will also result in high energy and materials demand as resource scarcity is the driver behind the circular economy its careful utilization is critically important for future endeavors together these factors are creating major challenges for stakeholders to assure and continue to maintain sufficient resources public health and environmental protection given that wastewater reclamation has become an attractive platform the continuous advancements in analytical techniques and dedicated efforts of the research community demonstrated that wastewater is a mixture of multiple substances in fact it is no longer regarded as waste for treatment but instead considered as a valuable source to recover clean water renewable energy minerals salts and other value added compounds in addition the creation of innovative treatment approaches and paradigm shift from conventional to renewable energy for treatment plant operation has led to carbon free society attributed to significant reduction in green house gas emissions 2 5 hence wastewater reclamation not only helps in combating water scarcity the recovery of materials and renewable energy but can also add significant values to the process and lead to profit generation in a sustainable manner for instance municipal wastewater contains a high fraction of non exploited residuals of ingested food and their degraded products due to key contribution of human excrement the potential nutrient sources found in municipal wastewater include carbon i e carbohydrates proteins fats etc nitrogen i e ammonia urea and other organic nitrogen based compounds phosphorus i e dissolved ortho phosphate and organically bound phosphorus potassium and sulfur compounds from municipal wastewater the recovery of biogas cellulose bioplastics phosphorus alginate like exopolymers ammonia and biomass have been promisingly reported 6 likewise

range of chemicals and raw ingredients can be recovered from industrial wastewater depending upon the manufacturing processing industry type i e paper pulp automotive textile metallurgical chemical

plant wastewater 15 utilization of sludge receiving from physico chemical treatment of industrial wastewater as a component of clinker meals in cement plants 16 and recovery of metal free fuels from petroleum waste sludge 17 have been reported to protect the environment increase the product yield and improve the overall operational cost 2 membrane bioreactor inception and advancement the use of activated sludge process for wastewater treatment was first introduced in 1914 by edward ardern and william t lockett at savyhulme sewage works united kingdom 18 they found that biological organisms could be used to treat wastewater if provided with aeriation in the activated sludge process organic compounds present in wastewater serve as a food source for the microbial community and facilitate their growth this remarkable innovation revolutionized the society and provided better health and environment to human the use of activated sludge process for wastewater treatment retained a tremendous mandate and considered as a robust cost effective and reliable approach 19 20 the conventional activated sludge cas process is comprised of a bioreactor for treating wastewater using activated sludge and a secondary clarifier i e sedimentation tank to separate water from the biological sludge and other suspended solids via gravity settling the use of cas process require large footprints while the settling in the secondary clarifiers is not perfect 21 it results in slighter fraction of sludge and other suspended solids discharge with the treated effluent the settling obligation of secondary clarifier confined the use of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration to around 5000 mg l in the bioreactor making activity lower in addition effluent of the secondary clarifier requires media sand filtration and disinfection before it get discharged to the environment on the other hand the rapid urban sprawl and subsequent increase in water requirements had been raising a demand for more compact economical and efficient treatment method to practice water reuse in 1969 smith et al introduced the side stream membrane bioreactor mbr configuration by combining activated sludge process with membrane separation 22 biomass can be retained almost completely due to the membrane to destroy or alter contaminants by biodegradation while the excellent quality of effluent permeate is produced the proposed integration eliminated the need of secondary clarifier and instead utilized an ultrafiltration uf membrane for sludge water separation 23 it provided the advantage of controlling the solid retention time srt independent to the hydraulic retention time hrt and allowed system to operate at elevated mlss concentration i e 8000 12 000 mg l in the side stream mbr the mixed liquor from the bioreactor was circulated across uf membrane at high cross flow velocities i e ranging from 1 2 to 1 8 m s and pressure i e 150 185 kpa to prevent membrane fouling and to obtain sustainable flux performance since the pore size of the uf membrane was smaller than the bacterial size it further substituted the granular media filtration and subsequent disinfection process although the side stream mbr provided enhanced permeate quality and low footprint compared to the cas process the application was restricted due to its high energy for circulation membrane cost and associated membrane fouling issues 24 25 in 1989 yamamoto et al proposed an innovative mbr configuration by immerging the hollow fiber hf membrane into the bioreactor for direct solid liquid separation 26 27 this phenomenal approach transformed the mbr technology in submerged configuration the water was extracted using low suction pressure 13 kpa instead of high pressure application making the process even more compact and economical 24 following with this remarkable advancements have been made in mbr through process optimization the adopted strategies include the use of efficient strains i e photosynthetic bacteria micro algae quorum quenching bacteria etc different membranes i e material pore sizes and types and their modification i e surface coating grafting embedding nanomaterials module configurations i e rotating vibrating and oscillating modules and operating conditions to prevent membrane fouling and demonstrate sustainable performance 28 34 the dedicated efforts of the industrial and research field in embracing mbr technology can be seen from its increasing number of publications and commercially installed capacity as depicted in fig 1 2 1 membrane bioreactor configurations mbrs can be classified based on different categories including membrane positioning membrane configuration and bio treatment process in membrane positioning mbr is mainly configured in two ways 1 membrane placed outside the bioreactor side stream mbr and 2 membrane immersed inside the bioreactor submerged mbr in submerged mbr treated water from the membrane is extracted via suction pressure applied on the permeate side and or static head on the retentate side whereas in side stream mbr high transmembrane pressure is required for water to permeate through the membrane 35 in membrane configuration the membrane used in mbr can be of two types flat sheet and cylindrical shape flat sheet is one of the simplest configurations and usually employed in submerged mbrs configuration as it provides flexibility to develop small lab scale units for research and development activities however the use of flat sheet membranes for scale up applications is not preferable due to its low packing density and large footprint in contrast the use of cylindrical geometry is attractive due to its high packing density and economy of space 36 the cylindrical membrane can be either hf or multitube mt depending upon the lumen diameter and flow direction among them hf is commercially important in terms of installed area it represents narrow filaments with a diameter range from 0 4 2 6 mm where water flows from shell side to lumen side outside in whereas in mt water flows from lumen side to shell side inside out and possess relatively wider range of diameter i e 5 12 mm 35 likewise the bio treatment process can be of three different types aerobic anoxic and anaerobic 37 in aerobic process dissolved oxygen is mainly used to convert organic carbon and ammonia present in the waste stream into carbon dioxide and nitrate nitrification respectively the oxidation of organic carbon can also be occurred in the absence of dissolved oxygen if another source of oxygen oxyanions is available for example the formed nitrate from nitrification can be converted into nitrogen gas denitrification upon biochemical reaction with organic carbon this process condition is described as anoxic and occurred in the absence of dissolved oxygen whereas the lack of dissolved and other oxygen sources for biochemical conversion of organic carbon is referred as anaerobic state in municipal wastewater treatment anaerobic condition is usually employed to assist phosphorus removal 38 2 2 membrane bioreactor challenges and limitations the use of mbr for municipal and industrial wastewater treatment is highly attractive due to the stringent environmental quality standards economy of space low membrane price and ease of automation however it is regarded as an energy intensive technology as aerobic mbr is one of the most commercialized configurations the use of aeration has been accounted for 40 of the total operational cost 39 besides fouling in mbr which occurs due to the deposition of unwanted contaminants over the membrane surface is another limiting barrier 40 42 development of fouling layer over the membrane surface results in several operational issues including high transmembrane pressure tmp low permeate flux frequent cleaning backwash and shortened membrane lifetime 42 moreover the treated effluent obtained from mbr has poor quality and is not suitable for direct potable non potable applications thereby requires additional tertiary treatment processes for quality enhancement 43 44 the use of microfiltration mf uf in mbr does not efficiently remove low molecular weight lmw organics as it only eliminates those substances having size greater than the pore size of membrane such as biomass larger colloids and macro solutes therefore the retention time of these lmw organic contaminants is almost close to hrt resulting in their partial degradation only where the concentration of lmw organics in the permeate can be almost similar to their concentration in the bioreactor additionally in case of mbr using mf membrane the effluent also contains viable but not culturable vbnc bacteria because of its smaller size than the typical pore size of the membrane the presence of lmw organics and vbnc exacerbate fouling in reverse osmosis ro which is mainly used as a downstream tertiary treatment process for water reuse in addition it also promotes the formation of disinfection by products if employed for potable non potable applications substituting mf uf with hf nanofiltration nf membrane could be effective however it will affect the overall treatment cost as the low transmembrane pressure applied in conventional mbr will adversely affect the flux hence larger surface area of the nf membrane will be required 45 46 increasing the hrt can be helpful to obtain the adequate removal of lmw organics however this means enlarging the treatment facility size to maintain treatment capacity resulting in an increase in overall capital and operational costs decoupling of the solid retention time srt and the hrt through integrating mbr with other processes is another strategy to improve the degradation of lmw organics and several works have studied this option for instance integrating mbr with nf was reported in different studies 47 49 nf post treatment of the permeate of uf mbr for leachate treatment was conducted and the recovered organics were recycled back to the uf mbr to allow for microorganisms acclimatization 50 however the increased energy demand due to the high pressure requirements of nf realized this approach uneconomical other studies have reported the integration of mbr with ro as a hybrid systems 51 57 this integration has emerged as a promising technology for municipal wastewater reclamation and reuse and has been greatly explored over the past few years 57 60 in mbr ro the effluent of typical mf uf mbr is further treated by ro to produce high quality permeate it has been applied for reclamation of different industrial wastewaters such as textile dying 61 semiconductor 62 oilfield produced water 61 and thin film transistor liquid crystal display manufacturing 63 64 and wastewater produced by different factories at industrial organized zone 55 56 however the hybrid mbr ro system requires high capital and operational costs associated with the specialized requirements of the high pressure ro systems that includes heavy gauge piping complex pumps as well as maintenance demands 65 moreover the removal of trace organic contaminants trocs such as pharmaceuticals personal care products steroid hormones surfactants disinfection by products etc is another constraint their elevated amount in wastewater attributed to their increasing utilization is an emerging concern in water reuse due to their potential health issues on aquatic and territorial environment 66 the efficacy of mbr for trocs removal is subjective to its configuration such as aerobic anaerobic the performance of anaerobic mbr is reportedly inferior to aerobic one as the removal of recalcitrant trocs such as carbamazepine atrazine and diclofenac was found challenging owing to their resistance to biodegradation 67 tadkaew et al suggested that the biodegradability of trocs can be evaluated quantitatively via functional group present in their molecular structure i e electron donating or electron withdrawing their findings revealed that trocs with electron withdrawing functional groups were poorly removed by mbr compared with trocs having electron donating functional groups 68 the trocs removal by catalytic or enzymatic degradation has also been demonstrated by numerous studies 69 however these processes are complex and governed by several parameters such as ph temperature properties of trocs and characteristics of enzymes in addition retention of trocs in the bioreactor by mf uf membrane for their complete catalytic enzymatic degradation is another limitation due to their lmw and smaller structural size 70 nguyen et al obtained the enhanced degradation of hydrophobic trocs such as octocrylene amitriptyline and benzophenone by their adsorption on enzymatic gel layer formed on the membrane surface however the lack of adsorption mechanism in case of hydrophilic non phenolic trocs resulted in their poor removal 10 71 3 membrane distillation development and implementation membrane distillation md is a promising thermally driven membrane process to desalinate or treat high salinity waters in md a saline feed is heated and circulated around a hydrophobic membrane that allows only the vapor phase to pass through while repelling the liquid non volatile compounds and macromolecules the passed vapor is then condensed along a circulating cooler permeate side of the membrane and collected as clean distillate the vapor pressure difference across the membrane as a result of the temperature difference acts as the driving force in this process 72 md possess several advantages over other traditional water treatment technologies such as pressure driven ro and thermally driven multi stage flash msf and multi effect distillation med for instance md is not a pressure driven process and thus eliminates the need for complex high pressure pumps used in ro achieving high savings on energy demand moreover md requires much less footprint and can operate at lower temperatures than other thermal processes which allow the utilization of waste heat and renewable energy sources 73 it has been suggested and applied as an autonomous renewable energy powered technology for provision of clean drinking water in remote communities 74 additionally since only vapor is allowed to pass through the membrane md can treat hypersaline waters without being affected by the feed salinity and has the potential to achieve 100 rejection of ions and macromolecules 75 the concept of md was first patented by bodell in 1963 followed by the first publication four years later in 1967 by findley in the industrial engineering chemistry process design development journal 76 however md afterwards suffered a recession and did not receive much attention for quite some time mainly due to being technologically unfeasible and lacking suitable membranes it was not until 1980s when commercial ptfe membranes goretex gore associated co became available that md started to gain a worthy interest by both academia and industry 77 fig 2 illustrate such interest by the growing number of publications since then based on the number of md publications thomas et al 77 has classified the development and research in md into three main phases only 27 papers were published during the first initiation phase between 1960 and 1990 however the second emergence phase between 1990 and 2010 showed an increased attention towards md as a separation technology in various applications during this phase different research areas were investigated including membrane design process modeling and optimization this was then followed by a vast evolution of md studies and implementations during the third growth phase after 2011 in which the interest in md research and application has evolved significantly md is being currently explored for a wide range of applications including wastewater treatment and reuse brine management treatment of challenging industrial wastewaters resource recovery and oil water separation 3 1 membrane distillation configurations there are several md configurations that have been studied in the literature all sharing the same basic components but differing in the configuration of the feed cooling and permeate channels 78 each of these configurations possess advantages and disadvantages that affect the operational costs and energy use and thus the process efficiency however there are four primary md configurations that differ only in the permeate channel as seen in fig 3 advantages and disadvantages of these primary configurations are summarized in table 1 direct contact md dcmd is the most common type of md due to its simplicity and efficiency in dcmd both the hot feed and cool permeate circulate continuously at similar flow rates and are in direct contact with the membrane surface after volatile compounds pass through the membrane condensation at the permeate side takes place inside the module the simplicity and efficiency of dcmd has led to its adoption in wide range of applications including desalination wastewater treatment and food and acid production industry however compared to other md configurations a main drawback that is particular to dcmd is the heat loss through conduction which increases the energy requirements for evaporation 79 in air gap md agmd a stagnant air gap is introduced between a condensing plate and the membrane surface at the permeate side in which the liquid permeate is not in direct contact with the membrane surface in this configuration vapor that passes from the feed side has to also pass this stagnant air gap before condensing at the plate inside the module the presence of air gap presents an advantage by reducing the heat loss by conduction as opposed to dcmd however a drawback is that it creates a mass transfer resistance agmd is less suspectable to membrane wetting which is the passage of liquid phase through the membrane pores since the permeate is not in direct contact with the membrane and thus is typically used with feeds containing low surface tension compounds that otherwise can easily wet the membrane agmd involve complicated design but is considered the most energy efficient configuration due to the use of latent heat in sweeping gas md sgmd the reduction of heat loss and the enhancement in mass transfer are achieved by applying an inert gas at the permeate side that sweep the evaporated vapor from the membrane surface the main drawback of sgmd is its high operating costs due to the requirements of large gas amount making it economically unattractive sgmd is considered the least efficient and least used configuration 78 vacuum md vmd uses vacuum pump at the permeate side to continuously suck the vapor out of the system and condense it in an external condenser outside the membrane module the introduction of vacuum allows the system to operate at lower temperatures and pressures which results in lowers requirements of the membrane s mechanical strength moreover vmd results in higher flux lower conductive heat loss and reduced mass transfer resistance and achieves better thermal evaporation efficiency 79 during the three previously mentioned development phases the reported md configuration in all published studies followed the trend dcmd vmd agmd sgmd 77 dcmd was the mostly used configuration due to its simplicity and high gain output ratio gor 80 additionally as opposed to vmd and sgmd that require an external condenser the permeate in dcmd is collected immediately without the need for additional external equipment 79 however the industrial use of dcmd is still limited due to its high conductive heat losses while most of the current studies are limited to lab scale research it is worth noting that vmd and agmd have gained increased attention throughout the different development phases with 19 and 24 vmd and 8 and 15 agmd of the studies during emergence and growth phases respectively compared to dcmd the increased interest in vmd and agmd is mainly due to their higher fluxes and lower wetting potential respectively 4 membrane distillation bioreactor mdbr membrane distillation bioreactor mdbr is a novel process that combines a conventional wastewater bioreactor with md and results in a hybrid system that have the potential to resolve problems associated with domestic and industrial wastewaters treatment via conventional mbr mdbr have the potential to achieve in a single step reclaimed water quality comparable to that of mbr ro but at lower capital and operational requirements a qualitative economic comparison between mf uf mbr ro and mdbr systems is shown in table 2 moreover unlike mbr nf and mbr ro where wastewater reuse and potable water are the only recovered elements respectively mdbr has the potential to additionally recover other valuable resources such as nutrients and bioenergy in the mdbr systems the md unit can be configured in a side stream or submerged in the reactor tank fig 4 the contribution of md in hybrid mdbr systems can be different according to the applied configuration in the case of side stream the md unit is connected separately outside and after the mbr and does not directly affect the treatment biodegradation process of the mbr but rather acts as a post treatment step for the mbr effluent or in some cases the bioreactor effluent for instance liu et al used dcmd for the treatment of effluent from anaerobic mbr treating synthetic wastewater simulating sewage here the md was used as a post treatment step to increase the mbr treatment efficiency which reached 99 removal for cod protein and polysaccharide and almost 100 for po4 3 p under optimized md operational conditions 83 side stream md was also used as a post treatment after hybrid forward osmosis fo mbr system to regenerate the diluted draw solution of the fo and extract freshwater simultaneously 84 in contrast in submerged mdbr systems the md unit is directly submerged inside the bioreactor replacing the mf or uf membranes typically used in conventional mbrs with an md membrane that is directly involved in the treatment process rather than post treating an mbr effluent in this configuration the integration of md does not only result in high quality permeate but also allows for effective retention of lmw organics facilitating their degradation within the bioreactor for example khaing et al investigated a submerged mdbr system for treatment of petrochemical wastewater and achieved a permeate quality that consistently met the requirements of newater of singapore except for a slightly higher toc 85 different membrane modules have been applied such as flat sheet tubular and hollow fibers while different bioreactor conditions have been examined in literature including aerobic anaerobic and enzymatic 45 86 87 regardless of the mdbr configuration or the bioreactor conditions a feed with temperature range of 35 c to 70 c is evaporated and passed through the hydrophobic md membrane while a biological activity takes place in the bioreactor by thermophilic microorganisms 88 the mlss in the bioreactor is in direct contact with the feed side of the hydrophobic membrane in case of submerged md unit however it is worth noting that due to the hydrophobic nature of the membrane allowing only the vapor phase to transport across the permeate quality is independent of the biological activity in the bioreactor this way the mdbr can effectively achieve complete retention of non volatile organics microorganisms and salts resulting in high quality effluent additionally the lmw organics are retained in the bioreactor as opposed to their passage through the membrane in conventional mbr consequently the srt in mdbr is significantly longer than the hrt giving these organics longer time to degrade although md plays a significant role activity of the bioreactor is also a key element in hybrid mdbr process configuration as it equally contributes to sustainable supply of high quality treated permeate poor biological activity in the bioreactor could result into the deposition of carbohydrates and protein compounds and cause wetting in md membranes hence can affect treated permeate quality and continuity of the process table 3 shows the main performance and operational differences between conventional mbr and mdbr processes 45 compared to conventional mbr and other hybrid mbr systems the mdbr offers numerous benefits including constant high quality permeate smaller footprint given the submerged configuration that can achieve in a single step the same as other hybrid systems consisting of different units low sludge production low energy requirements given the potential of waste heat sources or solar power to provide the required thermal energy and enhanced organic matter biodegradation given longer residence time achieved to allow for gradual breakdown 45 89 90 these advantages had rendered mdbr favorable for different potential applications covering a wide range of industries such as textiles pharmaceuticals and food processing where high quality permeate is required or poorly degraded organics present as well as other industries where waste heat is plentiful and could be integrated such as oil rigs and large ships 91 however the most beneficial features of mdbr are represented by its near potable high quality product expanding wastewater reclamation and reuse and its potential for resources recovery in terms of nutrient and bioenergy 89 in addition the mdbr is a good option in the treatment of industrial wastewaters with high temperature or is accessible to waste heat with low concentration of volatile organic carbon 85 nevertheless membrane fouling is a necessary phenomenon due to the inclusion of the biomass in the mdbr resulting in the biofouling and flux decline 85 both thermal and hydraulic resistance of the fouling layer may influence the mass transfer resistance in the layer more than heat transfer resistance only in mdbr membrane fouling also promotes membrane wetting due to critical deposits of carbohydrate and protein on hydrophobic md membrane retarding membrane wetting needs to be achieved not only by adjusting the operational conditions but also improving membrane materials efforts have been made to reduce fouling with mdbr for example gas sparing along the surface of membrane however the loss of water vapor may occur in the mdbr because the aeration or air sparging should carry a load of moisture from the bioreactor 92 table 4 summarizes mdbr studies in the literature with focus on the used configuration removal efficiencies and usage of permeate and the different recovered resources 4 1 wastewater reclamation and reuse the ability of mdbr to achieve high quality permeate as a result of high removal efficiency for both organics and inorganics makes it a favorable option for water reuse high rejection of total organic substances up to 90 99 have been reported in different mdbr studies 45 85 87 91 96 in both side stream and submerged configurations the integration of md has been found to play a major role in achieving such high rejections for mdbr systems with side stream md unit duong et al 96 tested a thermophilic anaerobic granular sludge membrane distillation bioreactor thags mdbr for treatment of wastewater containing high organic loading rates of up to 19 kg cod m3 per day the system achieved more than 99 5 removal efficiency of cod with only 1 7 mg l detected in the permeate moreover high rejection of inorganic salts has been achieved with a permeate electrical conductivity of less than 120 μs cm compared to 23 100 μs cm in the bioreactor the system reclaimed in a single step high quality permeate that was suitable for domestic and industrial use 96 in another study duong et al 97 showed the advantage of md coupling with thermophilic anaerobic bioreactor tanbr md to eliminate the need for alkalinity supplement and act as a self buffering system md achieved high rejection of most solutes including alkaline salt which maintained the buffered ph inside the anaerobic bioreactor proving suitable alkaline environment for anaerobic microorganisms when compared with a conventional tanbr without md under the same conditions the tanbr needed alkalinity adjustment to maintain the same ph level with the tanbr md that achieved in a single step high organic carbon removal efficiency 99 4 without alkalinity supplement zero liquid discharge and high quality effluent that was suitable for irrigation industrial and domestic use 97 nguyen et al tested a novel moving sponge anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor membrane distillation anombr md system for simultaneous water and nutrient recovery 84 the anombr md was operated continuously for 45 days with minimized fouling for the forward osmosis fo membrane that was submerged in the bioreactor mainly due to the moving sponge around the module a side stream md module was then used to recover the diluted draw solution of the fo process yielding high salt rejection of 99 99 and achieving simultaneous draw solution recovery and clean permeate production for water reuse 84 mdbr systems with submerged md unit have also shown potential in wastewater reuse khaing et al 94 tested an aerobic submerged mdbr for petrochemical wastewater reclamation the system was fed with real petrochemical wastewater ran continuously for more than 105 days and produced a permeate with high quality that surpassed the requirements of newater of singapore except for a slightly higher toc the organic removal efficiency was reported to be more than 98 5 and the authors concluded that the electrical conductivity in the feed wastewater had an important effect on the mdbr product water quality 94 silva et al 98 evaluated a two stage anaerobic membrane bioreactor membrane distillation system 2sanmbr md for the removal of dissolved hydrogen sulphide h2s in the context of wastewater reclamation h2s is a toxic compound that causes corrosion damages to the environment health and safety problems 98 the integration of md for treatment of the 2sanmbr effluent rich in toxic h2s showed favorable removal efficiencies at lower ph values achieving up to 98 h2s removal efficiency and producing high quality permeate suitable for water reuse and safe wastewater discharge the efficient removal of h2s by md was due to the usage of sodium hydroxide naoh as a receiving solution at the permeate side of the md process when volatile h2s in the 2sammbr effluent transfer across the hydrophobic md membrane due to the temperature gradient it gets dissolved in the receiving naoh solution resulting in its conversion to a non hazardous form thus achieving high h2s removal 98 recently volpin et al 99 tested an aerobic mdbr system for sanitation and dewatering of human urine achieving simultaneous water reclamation and recovery of a non odorous high concentration liquid fertiliser fig 5 real human urine was collected and went through nitrification via mbr followed by de watered by md to produce clean permeate water and urine based fertiliser except for a very small amount of ammonia 2 found in the permeate water the md unit of the hybrid system completely rejected all other ions no3 na k ca2 mg2 po43 producing effluent suitable for water reuse in toilet flushing or irrigation the removal of trocs from wastewater is essential for water reuse due to their complexity and potential adverse effects on human health moreover the strict emerging regulations and regulatory standards of their discharge with treated wastewaters and the water reuse potential has made their removal a topic of significant interest 66 mdbr has been proposed as a robust system and showed efficient capacity in removing a wide range of trocs 67 70 86 100 102 the high removal efficiency of trocs in mdbr systems is attributed to factors related to both the bioreactor as well as the md process the removal by md is mainly governed by the trocs physiochemical properties including volatility and hydrophobicity while adsorption by sludge and biodegradation are affecting their removal in the bioreactor 89 for instance the removal of three antibiotics azithromycin clarithromycin and erythromycin and an anti inflammatory drug diclofenac in a seawater feed was assessed by md using hydrophobic ptfe membranes and showed complete removal but with different mechanisms 66 the three antibiotics were not detected in both permeate and retentate and their removal was due to thermal degradation while the diclofenac was rejected and concentrated in the retentate stream due to its physical and chemical characteristics of low volatility negative surface charge and hydrophilicity 103 regardless of the volatility and hydrophobicity high removal of trocs could be achieved by a combination of mbr and md the first study on coupling md as a post treatment for thermophilic mbr effluent was reported by wijekoon et al 102 they studied the removal of 29 compounds representing major trocs groups that occur in municipal wastewater while the mbr removed most of the studied trocs several compounds including propoxur atrazine ametryn clofibric acid diclofenac carbamazepine naproxen and fenoprop were not rejected by the mbr and found at high concentration in the effluent which was attributed to the disturbed metabolic activity associated with the biological treatment at elevated temperatures 104 however high removal efficiencies of 95 for all 29 trocs including those that were poorly rejected in mbr were achieved by the mdbr system the mdbr system can achieve high removal rates of trocs comparable to mbr ro nf systems 47 49 105 producing a high quality permeate for safe water reuse in another study the same authors assessed the removal of trocs in thermophilic side stream mdbr and found that the biological treatment alone was not efficient for some recalcitrant trocs having electron withdrawing functional groups in their molecular structure with as low rejection rate as 0 53 due to salinity build up and the thermophilic conditions in the bioreactor 100 the mdbr system performance however was not affected by these conditions and achieved high removal rate for all trocs 95 which was due to a combination of biodegradation sludge adsorption and md rejection 100 similarly high removal efficiencies of up to 90 99 of 30 phenolic and non phenolic types of trocs was achieved by an enzymatic side stream mdbr producing high quality effluent with toxicity below the detection limit 86 a laccase based high retention mbr was used in a novel enzymatic side stream mdbr for enhanced biodegradation of trocs high trocs degradation of 80 99 was reported while the mdbr achieved complete retention 99 of all trocs used 70 the integration of md with anmbr was suggested to simultaneously recover energy and produce high quality water for reuse from wastewater containing 26 different trocs 67 while some recalcitrant trocs showed low rejection 15 by the anmbr the integrated anmbr md system showed an overall removal efficiency from 76 of these recalcitrant trocs to complete removal for all others recently asif et al 101 evaluated the performance of an enzymatic membrane bioreactor membrane distillation embr md system with wastewater containing 30 trocs having different physicochemical properties the md component effectively retained all trocs with a removal efficiency of 94 99 producing a non toxic high quality effluent in addition to organic and trocs removal the removal of nutrients before wastewater discharge is also following strict regulations particularly where the effluent is discharged at water bodies liable to be influenced by eutrophication 89 mdbr has shown high efficiency in removing different nutrients and salinity including total nitrogen ammonia phosphate sodium calcium and magnesium ions 67 85 87 93 94 97 99 100 106 the high removal of nutrients in mdbr systems is mainly attributed to the md retention mechanism based on vapor transfer in tanbr md duong et al 97 showed that po4 3 p concentration in the permeate water was close to zero indicating complete rejection by the md membrane moreover the electrical conductivity of the permeate water was very low due to the rejection of most ions producing water suitable for irrigation industrial or domestic uses complete removal of sodium and calcium ions were achieved 99 high salt rejection of up to 99 75 94 and efficient removal of ammonia ion and tn from 96 to 99 3 85 93 100 were also reported 4 2 nutrients and biogas recovery though water is paramount among all resources and play multi disciplinary role in water food energy nexus recovery of nutrients and renewable energy sources as side or mainstream from wastewater is highly desirable for sustainable environment it does not only offer the direct cost advantage and minimize overall treatment expense but also provides the indirect benefits such as prevention of their discharge into environment avoiding cross contamination of resources reservoirs and fostering the sustainable use of resources and their conservation for future generations the use of mdbr is found to be promising for nutrients and bioenergy recovery as it allows the separation of resources in all three states such as solid liquid and gas depending upon the feed and configuration type yao et al observed biogas generation in the bioreactor when used tanbr md for the treatment of synthetic wastewater 107 their results demonstrated the formation of 0 14 l g cod biogas 42 methane when 45 c and 55 c temperature was maintained for the bioreactor and md permeate respectively the salinity concentrated by md membrane did not show adverse impact on the growth of biomass during operational period however the recovery of biomethane was relatively low compared to conventional thermophilic reactor probably due to the passage of vfas through the md membrane song et al also implemented mdbr anmbr md configuration and recovered biogas from anmbr unit when treated high strength domestic wastewater their findings revealed that 0 3 0 5 l g cod biogas could be produced with a stable methane content i e approximately 65 67 the formation of methane ranging from 0 18 0 11 l g cod from the mbr unit was also obtained during 45 days of sponge based moving bed anombr md operation 84 the generation was averaged to 0 16 l methane g cod for 15 days later a declining trend was observed attributed to the accumulation of salts i e up to 3 65 g l however methane production was slightly improved from day 26 to onwards the authors ascribed that the bacterial community was acclimatized in a high tds total dissolved solids environment demonstrating stable activity in the range of 310 to 330 mv orp oxidation reduction potential the generation of 0 24 l methane g cod in the bioreactor when used anombr md coupled with mesophilic mf membrane is also reported in another study the recovered biogas was accounted for 180 kj day energy and used for heating md feed hence eliminated the requirement of external energy source 167 kj day 108 likewise the extraction and further processing i e ph adjustment using sodium hydroxide and stirring at 180 rpm for 90 min of high tds solution taken on day 16 26 and 36 via mf membrane submerged in hybrid sponge based moving bed anombr md resulted in precipitation of 0 268 g l 0 279 g l and 0 285 g l respectively the authors reported 17 4 wt phosphorus as the highest obtained amount from the solution extracted on day 35 with minimal nitrogen recovery 1 3 wt the schematic of the treatment facility demonstrating its operation working principle and application is depicted in fig 6 84 chang et al recovered phosphorus ranging from 5 to 60 mg l subjected to ph variations 9 12 using anombr coupled with mesophilic mf membrane 108 the use of mdbr for fertigation from urine owing to its nutrient rich nature has also been reported 99 the md membrane can complement anmbr performance by improving the nutrient recovery such as ammonia due to its excellent concentration capability the anmbr has limited functionality to remove ammonia and thus post treatment is often needed the dcmd was applied as post treatment for the treatment of ammonium nitrogen present in the effluent produced by anaerobic fluidized bed membrane bioreactor afmbr at constant transmembrane temperature ammonia recovery was improved by increasing a recirculation flow rate on pvdf based md membrane however increasing feed temperature decreased rejection efficiency of ammonia while high organic removal efficiency more than 90 was achieved regardless of the operational conditions of dcmd 109 besides the use of hybrid configuration in improving specific product yield has also been explored the integration of md with the bioreactor in mdbr facilitates the extraction of generated volatile products hence improve yield of the process owing to their inhibitory role when accumulating in the bioreactor for instance yao et al observed 60 mg l of total organic carbon toc in the permeate at day 7 when operated tanbr md for wastewater reclamation authors ascribed this to the formation of volatile fatty acids intermediate products produced by acidogenesis in the anaerobic bioreactor and their subsequent separation from bioreactor to the permeate tank gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms measurement of the mixed liquor and permeate samples revealed the presence of acetic acid 97 9 and 58 6 mg l propanoic acid 1 1 and 1 3 mg l butyric acid 16 7 and 20 3 mg l and isovaleric acid 12 6 and 15 6 mg l respectively acetic acid had the highest amount in the permeate however the obtained value was lower from its concentration in the mixed liquor in contrast higher concentration of propanoic acid butyric acid and isovaleric acid were observed in the permeate compared to mixed liquor authors attributed this to their higher partitioning co efficient which facilitated their transport rate and enable easy recovery as valuable resource 107 gryta et al employed mdbr bioreactor with side stream md to enhance the ethanol production compared with the classical batch fermentation with an efficiency of 0 35 0 45 g ethanol g sugar and production rate of 0 8 2 g ethanol dm3 h mdbr attained significantly better efficiency and production rate with 0 4 0 51 g ethanol g sugar and 2 5 4 g ethanol dm3 h respectively 110 the authors attributed the high production to simultaneous removal of ethanol through the porous capillary polypropylene membranes used in md as specific growth and production rate of microorganisms declined when ethanol concentration in the fermentation broth reached ca 12 by volume in another study a selective removal of ethanol and acetic acid which served as inhibitor in fermentation of sugar with saccharomyces cerevisiae from the fermentation broth is also obtained by gryta et al when used hydrophobic polypropylene membrane 0 2 μm pore size 8 6 mm 5 5 mm internal external diameter ratio accurel pp v8 2 hf 111 the separated solution did not cause wetting even after 2500 h of operation tomaszewska et al also obtained higher yield of ethanol from lactose 112 and whey 113 when employed submerged mdbr in comparison with the classical fermentation reactor likewise li and co workers reported that high ethanol concentration 421 g l could be achieved by permeate fractional condensation with the process separation factor increased to 19 2 when mdbr was employed with synthetic feed 114 4 3 membrane distillation bioreactor challenges the low permeate flux of mdbr systems represent the main challenge since it would be difficult for wastewater treatment plants to realize treatment of high volumes of wastewaters via low flux membranes 89 conventional mbr systems have permeate fluxes in the ranges of 10 30 l m2 h whereas reported fluxes of mdbr systems were in the range of 2 15 l m2 h table 3 and in some studies were as low as 0 15 l m2 h ethanol flux at 35 c feed temperature 110 depending on feed temperatures and other operational conditions for instance kwon et al 106 tested an afbr fo md hybrid and reported an average permeate flux of 1 2 l m2 h for the md membrane at transmembrane temperature of 15 c in an anombr md system nguyen et al 84 reported a permeate flux for the md process at 2 75 l m2 h at 20 c of transmembrane temperature similarly several other studies on hybrid mdbr systems reported low permeate fluxes in the range of 1 2 5 4 l m2 h 45 100 107 115 nevertheless high permeate fluxes in the range of 15 22 1 l m2 h have been reported in other studies at high temperature gradients 30 40 c 96 97 99 116 while high feed operational temperatures of up to 80 c could be utilized to enhance the permeate flux 45 114 however high operational temperature can also bring problems such as elevated temperature polarization which is related back to lowering the flux due to lower transmembrane pressure accelerating membrane scaling which in turn represent a new resistance that result in flux decline 117 and increasing the level of highly volatile elements to pass through the membrane to the permeate water as will be discussed in the following paragraph although resources recovery represents a versatile feature of mdbr the rejection of highly volatile elements which are considered valuable resources themselves can be challenging especially at thermophilic conditions where high feed temperatures facilitate the passage of these elements such as ammonia through the md membrane into the permeate stream duong et al 96 showed the need of further treatment of the permeate of a thags mdbr to remove nh4 the presence of nh4 in the permeate was a result of passage of highly volatile nh3 from the bioreactor due to high temperature 56 c in another study operating an anmbr md for energy recovery and water reuse song et al 67 showed a gradual decrease in performance of the md unit for nh4 removal from 90 within the first 20 days to around 60 on day 30 authors attributed this decline in ammonium rejection due to its conversion to a highly volatile ammonia gas at high feed temperature of 45 c in the bioreactor and its passage to the permeate side concluding the need to control ammonia volatilisation and to further remove it from the product water 67 the present of ammonium nitrogen in the permeate of mdbr systems mbr coupled with side stream dcmd system was also reported at high feed temperatures causing more volatile nh3 gas to vaporise and pass through the hydrophobic md membrane potentially polluting the permeate 99 nevertheless some studies showed that the presence of ammonical nitrogen in the permeate is not considered an issue in cases where water reuse options are toilet flushing or irrigation or might even be desirable since reducing the amount of ammonia nitrogen in the feed would allow for higher nutrients recovery 99 moreover another study reported on the passage of volatile fatty acids in mdbr system tanbr md through the md membrane to the permeate stream but used this to their advantage through recovering it back from the permeate 107 another challenge that faces mdbr systems is the thermal energy requirements for feed heating and permeate cooling the separation mechanism of the md unit in mdbr depends on vapor pressure difference attained through temperature difference across both sides of the membrane which require energy provision to create such difference in their submerged mdbr system with a permeate flux of 1 84 l m2 h phattaranawik et al 45 reported an average power consumption of 3 6 and 3 4 kw h m3 of product water for heating and cooling respectively however in scenarios where low grade waste heat is available or pre heating the feed by recovering heat from the permeate energy requirements can be highly lowered when utilizing such options and thus eliminating the energy required for heating and cooling energy consumption of the mdbr system was reduced to as low as 1 1 2 kw h m3 of product water 45 moreover integrating these systems with renewable energy sources such as solar panels can also result in lowering the energy requirements additionally in some industrial sectors the wastewater is discharged at elevated temperatures which reduces the energy required for feed heating and eventually expanding its reclamation 89 90 also when coupled with anaerobic bioreactors md can use the recovered waste heat for heating purposes for instance duong et al 96 used waste heat from the thags to directly heat the feed entering into the md unit and reported reduced energy consumption salinity build up in the bioreactor due to high rejection of inorganic slats represent yet another challenge for mdbr systems the biochemical and physical properties of the activated sludge is highly affected by increased salinity 118 for instance microbial community alteration inhibition of microbial growth and tardy microbial kinetics are all associated with incremental salt concentration in the bioreactor 119 120 moreover higher concentrations of soluble microbial products and extracellular polymeric substances were found in the bioreactor as a result of salinity build up 118 which in turn accelerate the potential of membrane fouling by increasing pore block resistance 117 however constant sludge withdrawal can be made to reduce the salinity build up in the bioreactor but this can result in higher sludge disposal costs and lower the srt moreover special attention should be made to operate at an optimum concentration factor which is an indication of the bioreactor salt concentration in such a way that a balance between water recovery and salt accumulation can be achieved reducing the adverse effects of salinity build up 117 membrane fouling still needs to be overcome although the extent to fouling rate on md membrane may be slower due to lower permeate flux through larger membrane pores than high pressure driven membrane such as ro membrane better understanding of fouling mechanisms on md membrane can lead to improvements in the design and operation of various mdbr systems to optimize performance and reduce operational energy with mdbr the membrane fouling varies greatly depending upon the nature of the foulant materials present in wastewater which causes organic inorganic and biofouling both organic and inorganic fouling were observed on the surface of pvdf membrane as it was used in the dcmd as a post treatment for anaerobic membrane bioreactor 109 the deposition of various pollutants on md membrane due to its excellent rejection efficiency should result in both hydraulic and thermal resistances as the hydrophobic membrane is submerged into the mdbr system directly the microbial by products such as eps protein and polysaccharides should play important roles as main foulant materials due to their high sickness to membrane surface gas sparging along the md membrane is often considered to reduce the biofouling or its derivatives from membrane however the optimum module design for gas sparing to the md membrane combined with the bioreactors tailored for various aerobic or anaerobic bioreactors needs to be envisioned membrane fouling in mdbr has also shown to compromise membrane hydrophobicity and thereby accelerate wetting during mdbr operation the progressive accumulation of non volatile solutes such as salts carbohydrates polysaccharides and proteins on md membrane surface and pores can eventually lead to fouling induced membrane wetting which could lead to a significant deterioration in distillate quality and ultimately process failure 85 the issue of wetting further aggravates in cases where low surface tension amphiphilic contaminants e g surfactants and liquids e g alcohol oily substances are present in the feed wastewater these contaminants having hydrophobic tail moiety tend to adsorb on the membrane surface and pore walls through hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions and promote wetting by altering the hydrophobicity of membrane consequently the md membrane loses its unique property to retain the transport of non volatile components in the feed and infiltration of contaminated feed water via the pore structure to the distillate side deteriorate the overall process several studies that tested integrated md br process for wastewater treatment have witnessed fouling and scaling induced membrane wetting during the long term mdbr operation 85 96 107 121 delaying membrane wetting in mdbr process will enable systems to maintain high overall removal efficiencies for a longer operation period during the treatment of complex wastewaters measures such as pre treating wastewater to remove specific wetting promoting contaminants prior to mdbr application limiting the mdbr applications to specific wastewaters with low concentrations of foulants and developing superhydrophobic omniphobic and dense membranes with lower surface energy re entrant structures and chemical resistance have demonstrated a way forward to alleviate wetting in mdbr process for wastewater treatment however wetting of membranes in mdbr still largely remains an unsolved challenge that necessitate more practical and viable solutions 5 future perspectives to sum up the integration of md and biological reactors mdbr is still in an early stage of development and requires further exploration it worthwhile to mention that the current research on mdbr is limited to lab scale testing that sometimes applies unrealistic conditions and draw conclusions based on theoretical assumptions and thus testing these systems at pilot and full scale levels is necessary to give realistic views on their potential despite its various benefits in wastewater reclamation for achieving water reuse and resources recovery mdbr systems still face several operational and technological limitations that hinders their widespread application hence for the practical realization of mdbr technology in wastewater treatment the challenges described in this review namely low water recovery low rejection of highly volatile compounds thermal energy requirements salinity build up and membrane fouling and wetting should be explored and addressed a fundamental factor that will support the development of hybrid mdbr system is suitable membrane development with desired characteristics along with novel module configurations membrane properties and process design have a significant impact on the long term performance and energy efficiency of mdbr systems this underlines the need for developing specifically tuned membranes with desired properties and structures to improve distillation flux alleviate membrane fouling and wetting issues as well as to improve the energy efficiency of the system for instance the recent development and application of advanced md membranes such as nanocomposite membranes janus membranes omniphobic membranes and photothermal membranes have shown great potential in averting intrinsic limitation attributed to conventional md processes during wastewater treatment applications apart from achieving desired membrane characteristics the development of new membranes must take into consideration the ease of fabrication performance robustness and cost effectiveness for long term mdbr operation improving thermal energy efficiency in mdbr process is another potential area that requires immediate research attention it is envisioned that the thermal requirements for feed water heating in particular can be met from waste heat sources or renewable power low cost heat sources such as solar geothermal and industrial waste heat with suitable temperatures can be directly integrated with mdbr however further development is required to address design issues and to confirm its technoeconomic benefits also existing energy research in mdbr is primarily focused on enhancing thermal energy requirements particularly the heating part however cooling for condensing the vapor in md is also energy intensive and more research efforts should be carried out on the potential of low cost alternative sources for condensing till date limited studies have discussed the problem of membrane wetting in mdbr systems which leads to a catastrophic loss of membrane selectivity a systematic understanding of membrane wetting behaviors and underlying mechanisms in mdbr will better guide strategies for high performance membrane design moreover as above mentioned research focusing on the development of novel membranes with tailored surface wettability which are able to resist wetting by low surface tension contaminants and liquids can extend the application of mdbr for the treatment of challenging wastewaters lastly research focusing on detailed energy and cost analysis of hybrid mdbr systems is highly

13013,membrane bioreactors mbrs have been well established as an advanced wastewater treatment technology that combines activated sludge with a pressure driven membrane separation process they have been widely applied in municipal and industrial wastewater treatment systems due to their advantages over conventional activated sludge systems however mbrs still face major issues hindering their widespread implementation such as poor effluent quality due to low retention of trace organic contaminants instability due to changing operating conditions and organic membrane fouling membrane distillation md bioreactor mdbr is a novel wastewater treatment technology that combines mbrs with an md unit either separated at a side stream or submerged in the bioreactor the concept of hybrid mdbr configuration was firstly introduced in 2007 which was followed by numerous journal articles these studies demonstrated the mdbr potential for water nutrients bioenergy and other value added product recovery from domestic and industrial wastewater however there is still a lack of a comprehensive study that shows the full mdbr potential hence there is a need for a dedicated review that summarize and critically analyse these research findings and highlight the research gaps to provide clear path for future research this review presents system availability and applications of hybrid mdbr in particular the review presents brief introduction of mbr and md technologies followed by covering the evolution of mdbr as a novel technology for municipal and industrial wastewater treatment several applications of mdbr systems are reviewed with a focus on system performance and removal efficiencies the potential of mdbr to widen wastewater reuse and achieve nutrient and biogas recovery is also presented finally the main challenges that hinder the development of mdbr are discussed while recommendations on future perspectives towards mdbr commercialization are suggested keywords hybrid md configurations wastewater reclamation high quality effluent energy recovery nutrient recovery 1 wastewater as a resource for circular economy almost 36 of the world s population is living in water scarce regions therefore countries around the world face an array of water policy to manage the water scarcity while maintaining the quality standards for eco system protection according to world bank report 2020 more than half of the world s population will be at risk of water scarcity by 2050 1 climate change and rapid urban sprawl in middle low income countries need to be considered as these elements may alter the quantity quality and distribution of water increase in population will also result in high energy and materials demand as resource scarcity is the driver behind the circular economy its careful utilization is critically important for future endeavors together these factors are creating major challenges for stakeholders to assure and continue to maintain sufficient resources public health and environmental protection given that wastewater reclamation has become an attractive platform the continuous advancements in analytical techniques and dedicated efforts of the research community demonstrated that wastewater is a mixture of multiple substances in fact it is no longer regarded as waste for treatment but instead considered as a valuable source to recover clean water renewable energy minerals salts and other value added compounds in addition the creation of innovative treatment approaches and paradigm shift from conventional to renewable energy for treatment plant operation has led to carbon free society attributed to significant reduction in green house gas emissions 2 5 hence wastewater reclamation not only helps in combating water scarcity the recovery of materials and renewable energy but can also add significant values to the process and lead to profit generation in a sustainable manner for instance municipal wastewater contains a high fraction of non exploited residuals of ingested food and their degraded products due to key contribution of human excrement the potential nutrient sources found in municipal wastewater include carbon i e carbohydrates proteins fats etc nitrogen i e ammonia urea and other organic nitrogen based compounds phosphorus i e dissolved ortho phosphate and organically bound phosphorus

range of chemicals and raw ingredients can be recovered from industrial wastewater depending upon the manufacturing processing industry type i e paper pulp automotive textile metallurgical chemical batteries for instance recovery of lignin cellulose and hemicellulose as the raw ingredients for bioenergy production from paper and pulp effluent discharge 12 recovery of methyl blue and congo red dyes for reuse from textile industrial effluent 13 selective recovery of raw materials zinc from spent hydrochloric acid based galvanizing wastewater 14 recovery of lithium from battery recycling plant wastewater 15 utilization of sludge receiving from physico chemical treatment of industrial wastewater as a component of clinker meals in cement plants 16 and recovery of metal free fuels from petroleum waste sludge 17 have been reported to protect the environment increase the product yield and improve the overall operational cost 2 membrane bioreactor inception and advancement the use of activated sludge process for wastewater treatment was first introduced in 1914 by edward ardern and william t lockett at savyhulme sewage works united kingdom 18 they found that biological organisms could be used to treat wastewater if provided with aeriation in the activated sludge process organic compounds present in wastewater serve as a food source for the microbial community and facilitate their growth this remarkable innovation revolutionized the society and provided better health and environment to human the use of activated sludge process for wastewater treatment retained a tremendous mandate and considered as a robust cost effective and reliable approach 19 20 the conventional activated sludge cas process is comprised of a bioreactor for treating wastewater using activated sludge and a secondary clarifier i e sedimentation tank to separate water from the biological sludge and other suspended solids via gravity settling the use of cas process require large footprints while the settling in the secondary clarifiers is not perfect 21 it results in slighter fraction of sludge and other suspended solids discharge with the treated effluent the settling obligation of secondary clarifier confined the use of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration to around 5000 mg l in the bioreactor making activity lower in addition effluent of the secondary clarifier requires media sand filtration and disinfection before it get discharged to the environment on the other hand the rapid urban sprawl and subsequent increase in water requirements had been raising a demand for more compact economical and efficient treatment method to practice water reuse in 1969 smith et al introduced the side stream membrane bioreactor mbr configuration by combining activated sludge process with membrane separation 22 biomass can be retained almost completely due to the membrane to destroy or alter contaminants by biodegradation while the excellent quality of effluent permeate is produced the proposed integration eliminated the need of secondary clarifier and instead utilized an ultrafiltration uf membrane for sludge water separation 23 it provided the advantage of controlling the solid retention time srt independent to the hydraulic retention time hrt and allowed system to operate at elevated mlss concentration i e 8000 12 000 mg l in the side stream mbr the mixed liquor from the bioreactor was circulated across uf membrane at high cross flow velocities i e ranging from 1 2 to 1 8 m s and pressure i e 150 185 kpa to prevent membrane fouling and to obtain sustainable flux performance since the pore size of the uf membrane was smaller than the bacterial size it further substituted the granular media filtration and subsequent disinfection process although the side stream mbr provided enhanced permeate quality and low footprint compared to the cas process the application was restricted due to its high energy for circulation membrane cost and associated membrane fouling issues 24 25 in 1989 yamamoto et al proposed an innovative mbr configuration by immerging the hollow fiber hf membrane into the bioreactor for direct solid liquid separation 26 27 this phenomenal approach transformed the mbr technology in submerged configuration the water was extracted using low suction pressure 13 kpa instead of high pressure application making the process even more compact and economical 24 following with this remarkable advancements have been made in mbr through process optimization the adopted strategies include the use of efficient strains i e photosynthetic bacteria micro algae quorum quenching bacteria etc different membranes i e material pore sizes and types and their modification i e surface coating grafting embedding nanomaterials module configurations i e rotating vibrating and oscillating modules and operating conditions to prevent membrane fouling and demonstrate sustainable performance 28 34 the dedicated efforts of the industrial and research field in embracing mbr technology can be seen from its increasing number of publications and commercially installed capacity as depicted in fig 1 2 1 membrane bioreactor configurations mbrs can be classified based on different categories including membrane positioning membrane configuration and bio treatment process in membrane positioning mbr is mainly configured in two ways 1 membrane placed outside the bioreactor side stream mbr and 2 membrane immersed inside the bioreactor submerged mbr in submerged mbr treated water from the membrane is extracted via suction pressure applied on the permeate side and or static head on the retentate side whereas in side stream mbr high transmembrane pressure is required for water to permeate through the membrane 35 in membrane configuration the membrane used in mbr can be of two types flat sheet and cylindrical shape flat sheet is one of the simplest configurations and usually employed in submerged mbrs configuration as it provides flexibility to develop small lab scale units for research and development activities however the use of flat sheet membranes for scale up applications is not preferable due to its low packing density and large footprint in contrast the use of cylindrical geometry is attractive due to its high packing density and economy of space 36 the cylindrical membrane can be either hf or multitube mt depending upon the lumen diameter and flow direction among them hf is commercially important in terms of installed area it represents narrow filaments with a diameter range from 0 4 2 6 mm where water flows from shell side to lumen side outside in whereas in mt water flows from lumen side to shell side inside out and possess relatively wider range of diameter i e 5 12 mm 35 likewise the bio treatment process can be of three different types aerobic anoxic and anaerobic 37 in aerobic process dissolved oxygen is mainly used to convert organic carbon and ammonia present in the waste stream into carbon dioxide and nitrate nitrification respectively the oxidation of organic carbon can also be occurred in the absence of dissolved oxygen if another source of oxygen oxyanions is available for example the formed nitrate from nitrification can be converted into nitrogen gas denitrification upon biochemical reaction with organic carbon this process condition is described as anoxic and occurred in the absence of dissolved oxygen whereas the lack of dissolved and other oxygen sources for biochemical conversion of organic carbon is referred as anaerobic state in municipal wastewater treatment anaerobic condition is usually employed to assist phosphorus removal 38 2 2 membrane bioreactor challenges and limitations the use of mbr for municipal and industrial wastewater treatment is highly attractive due to the stringent environmental quality standards economy of space low membrane price and ease of automation however it is regarded as an energy intensive technology as aerobic mbr is one of the most commercialized configurations the use of aeration has been accounted for 40 of the total operational cost 39 besides fouling in mbr which occurs due to the deposition of unwanted contaminants over the membrane surface is another limiting barrier 40 42 development of fouling layer over the membrane surface results in several operational issues including high transmembrane pressure tmp low permeate flux frequent cleaning backwash and shortened membrane lifetime 42 moreover the treated effluent obtained from mbr has poor quality and is not suitable for direct potable non potable applications thereby requires additional tertiary treatment processes for quality enhancement 43 44 the use of microfiltration mf uf in mbr does not efficiently remove low molecular weight lmw organics as it only eliminates those substances having size greater than the pore size of membrane such as biomass larger colloids and macro solutes therefore the retention time of these lmw organic contaminants is almost close to hrt resulting in their partial degradation only where the concentration of lmw organics in the permeate can be almost similar to their concentration in the bioreactor additionally in case of mbr using mf membrane the effluent also contains viable but not culturable vbnc bacteria because of its smaller size than the typical pore size of the membrane the presence of lmw organics and vbnc exacerbate fouling in reverse osmosis ro which is mainly used as a downstream tertiary treatment process for water reuse in addition it also promotes the formation of disinfection by products if employed for potable non potable applications substituting mf uf with hf nanofiltration nf membrane could be effective however it will affect the overall treatment cost as the low transmembrane pressure applied in conventional mbr will adversely affect the flux hence larger surface area of the nf membrane will be required 45 46 increasing the hrt can be helpful to obtain the adequate removal of lmw organics however this means enlarging the treatment facility size to maintain treatment capacity resulting in an increase in overall capital and operational costs decoupling of the solid retention time srt and the hrt through integrating mbr with other processes is another strategy to improve the degradation of lmw organics and several works have studied this option for instance integrating mbr with nf was reported in different studies 47 49 nf post treatment of the permeate of uf mbr for leachate treatment was conducted and the recovered organics were recycled back to the uf mbr to allow for microorganisms acclimatization 50 however the increased energy demand due to the high pressure requirements of nf realized this approach uneconomical other studies have reported the integration of mbr with ro as a hybrid systems 51 57 this integration has emerged as a promising technology for municipal wastewater reclamation and reuse and has been greatly explored over the past few years 57 60 in mbr ro the effluent of typical mf uf mbr is further treated by ro to produce high quality permeate it has been applied for reclamation of different industrial wastewaters such as textile dying 61 semiconductor 62 oilfield produced water 61 and thin film transistor liquid crystal display manufacturing 63 64 and wastewater produced by different factories at industrial organized zone 55 56 however the hybrid mbr ro system requires high capital and operational costs associated with the specialized requirements of the high pressure ro systems that includes heavy gauge piping complex pumps as well as maintenance demands 65 moreover the removal of trace organic contaminants trocs such as pharmaceuticals personal care products steroid hormones surfactants disinfection by products etc is another constraint their elevated amount in wastewater attributed to their increasing utilization is an emerging concern in water reuse due to their potential health issues on aquatic and territorial environment 66 the efficacy of mbr for trocs removal is subjective to its configuration such as aerobic anaerobic the performance of anaerobic mbr is reportedly inferior to aerobic one as the removal of recalcitrant trocs such as carbamazepine atrazine and diclofenac was found challenging owing to their resistance to biodegradation 67 tadkaew et al suggested that the biodegradability of trocs can be evaluated quantitatively via functional group present in their molecular structure i e electron donating or electron withdrawing their findings revealed that trocs with electron withdrawing functional groups were poorly removed by mbr compared with trocs having electron donating functional groups 68 the trocs removal by catalytic or enzymatic degradation has also been demonstrated by numerous studies 69 however these processes are complex and governed by several parameters such as ph temperature properties of trocs and characteristics of enzymes in addition retention of trocs in the bioreactor by mf uf membrane for their complete catalytic enzymatic degradation is another limitation due to their lmw and smaller structural size 70 nguyen et al obtained the enhanced degradation of hydrophobic trocs such as octocrylene amitriptyline and benzophenone by their adsorption on enzymatic gel layer formed on the membrane surface however the lack of adsorption mechanism in case of hydrophilic non phenolic trocs resulted in their poor removal 10 71 3 membrane distillation development and implementation membrane distillation md is a promising thermally driven membrane process to desalinate or treat high salinity waters in md a saline feed is heated and circulated around a hydrophobic membrane that allows only the vapor phase to pass through while repelling the liquid non volatile compounds and macromolecules the passed vapor is then condensed along a circulating cooler permeate side of the membrane and collected as clean distillate the vapor pressure difference across the membrane as a result of the temperature difference acts as the driving force in this process 72 md possess several advantages over other traditional water treatment technologies such as pressure driven ro and thermally driven multi stage flash msf and multi effect distillation med for instance md is not a pressure driven process and thus eliminates the need for complex high pressure pumps used in ro achieving high savings on energy demand moreover md requires much less footprint and can operate at lower temperatures than other thermal processes which allow the utilization of waste heat and renewable energy sources 73 it has been suggested and applied as an autonomous renewable energy powered technology for provision of clean drinking water in remote communities 74 additionally since only vapor is allowed to pass through the membrane md can treat hypersaline waters without being affected by the feed salinity and has the potential to achieve 100 rejection of ions and macromolecules 75 the concept of md was first patented by bodell in 1963 followed by the first publication four years later in 1967 by findley in the industrial engineering chemistry process design development journal 76 however md afterwards suffered a recession and did not receive much attention for quite some time mainly due to being technologically unfeasible and lacking suitable membranes it was not until 1980s when commercial ptfe membranes goretex gore associated co became available that md started to gain a worthy interest by both academia and industry 77 fig 2 illustrate such interest by the growing number of publications since then based on the number of md publications thomas et al 77 has classified the development and research in md into three main phases only 27 papers were published during the first initiation phase between 1960 and 1990 however the second emergence phase between 1990 and 2010 showed an increased attention towards md as a separation technology in various applications during this phase different research areas were investigated including membrane design process modeling and optimization this was then followed by a vast evolution of md studies and implementations during the third growth phase after 2011 in which the interest in md research and application has evolved significantly md is being currently explored for a wide range of applications including wastewater treatment and reuse brine management treatment of challenging industrial wastewaters resource recovery and oil water separation 3 1 membrane distillation configurations there are several md configurations that have been studied in the literature all sharing the same basic components but differing in the configuration of the feed cooling and permeate channels 78 each of these configurations possess advantages and disadvantages that affect the operational costs and energy use and thus the process efficiency however there are four primary md configurations that differ only in the permeate channel as seen in fig 3 advantages and disadvantages of these primary configurations are summarized in table 1 direct contact md dcmd is the most common type of md due to its simplicity and efficiency in dcmd both the hot feed and cool permeate circulate continuously at similar flow rates and are in direct contact with the membrane surface after volatile compounds pass through the membrane condensation at the permeate side takes place inside the module the simplicity and efficiency of dcmd has led to its adoption in wide range of applications including desalination wastewater treatment and food and acid production industry however compared to other md configurations a main drawback that is particular to dcmd is the heat loss through conduction which increases the energy requirements for evaporation 79 in air gap md agmd a stagnant air gap is introduced between a condensing plate and the membrane surface at the permeate side in which the liquid permeate is not in direct contact with the membrane surface in this configuration vapor that passes from the feed side has to also pass this stagnant air gap before condensing at the plate inside the module the presence of air gap presents an advantage by reducing the heat loss by conduction as opposed to dcmd however a drawback is that it creates a mass transfer resistance agmd is less suspectable to membrane wetting which is the passage of liquid phase through the membrane pores since the permeate is not in direct contact with the membrane and thus is typically used with feeds containing low surface tension compounds that otherwise can easily wet the membrane agmd involve complicated design but is considered the most energy efficient configuration due to the use of latent heat in sweeping gas md sgmd the reduction of heat loss and the enhancement in mass transfer are achieved by applying an inert gas at the permeate side that sweep the evaporated vapor from the membrane surface the main drawback of sgmd is its high operating costs due to the requirements of large gas amount making it economically unattractive sgmd is considered the least efficient and least used configuration 78 vacuum md vmd uses vacuum pump at the permeate side to continuously suck the vapor out of the system and condense it in an external condenser outside the membrane module the introduction of vacuum allows the system to operate at lower temperatures and pressures which results in lowers requirements of the membrane s mechanical strength moreover vmd results in higher flux lower conductive heat loss and reduced mass transfer resistance and achieves better thermal evaporation efficiency 79 during the three previously mentioned development phases the reported md configuration in all published studies followed the trend dcmd vmd agmd sgmd 77 dcmd was the mostly used configuration due to its simplicity and high gain output ratio gor 80 additionally as opposed to vmd and sgmd that require an external condenser the permeate in dcmd is collected immediately without the need for additional external equipment 79 however the industrial use of dcmd is still limited due to its high conductive heat losses while most of the current studies are limited to lab scale research it is worth noting that vmd and agmd have gained increased attention throughout the different development phases with 19 and 24 vmd and 8 and 15 agmd of the studies during emergence and growth phases respectively compared to dcmd the increased interest in vmd and agmd is mainly due to their higher fluxes and lower wetting potential respectively 4 membrane distillation bioreactor mdbr membrane distillation bioreactor mdbr is a novel process that combines a conventional wastewater bioreactor with md and results in a hybrid system that have the potential to resolve problems associated with domestic and industrial wastewaters treatment via conventional mbr mdbr have the potential to achieve in a single step reclaimed water quality comparable to that of mbr ro but at lower capital and operational requirements a qualitative economic comparison between mf uf mbr ro and mdbr systems is shown in table 2 moreover unlike mbr nf and mbr ro where wastewater reuse and potable water are the only recovered elements respectively mdbr has the potential to additionally recover other valuable resources such as nutrients and bioenergy in the mdbr systems the md unit can be configured in a side stream or submerged in the reactor tank fig 4 the contribution of md in hybrid mdbr systems can be different according to the applied configuration in the case of side stream the md unit is connected separately outside and after the mbr and does not directly affect the treatment biodegradation process of the mbr but rather acts as a post treatment step for the mbr effluent or in some cases the bioreactor effluent for instance liu et al used dcmd for the treatment of effluent from anaerobic mbr treating synthetic wastewater simulating sewage here the md was used as a post treatment step to increase the mbr treatment efficiency which reached 99 removal for cod protein and polysaccharide and almost 100 for po4 3 p under optimized md operational conditions 83 side stream md was also used as a post treatment after hybrid forward osmosis fo mbr system to regenerate the diluted draw solution of the fo and extract freshwater simultaneously 84 in contrast in submerged mdbr systems the md unit is directly submerged inside the bioreactor replacing the mf or uf membranes typically used in conventional mbrs with an md membrane that is directly involved in the treatment process rather than post treating an mbr effluent in this configuration the integration of md does not only result in high quality permeate but also allows for effective retention of lmw organics facilitating their degradation within the bioreactor for example khaing et al investigated a submerged mdbr system for treatment of petrochemical wastewater and achieved a permeate quality that consistently met the requirements of newater of singapore except for a slightly higher toc 85 different membrane modules have been applied such as flat sheet tubular and hollow fibers while different bioreactor conditions have been examined in literature including aerobic anaerobic and enzymatic 45 86 87 regardless of the mdbr configuration or the bioreactor conditions a feed with temperature range of 35 c to 70 c is evaporated and passed through the hydrophobic md membrane while a biological activity takes place in the bioreactor by thermophilic microorganisms 88 the mlss in the bioreactor is in direct contact with the feed side of the hydrophobic membrane in case of submerged md unit however it is worth noting that due to the hydrophobic nature of the membrane allowing only the vapor phase to transport across the permeate quality is independent of the biological activity in the bioreactor this way the mdbr can effectively achieve complete retention of non volatile organics microorganisms and salts resulting in high quality effluent additionally the lmw organics are retained in the bioreactor as opposed to their passage through the membrane in conventional mbr consequently the srt in mdbr is significantly longer than the hrt giving these organics longer time to degrade although md plays a significant role activity of the bioreactor is also a key element in hybrid mdbr process configuration as it equally contributes to sustainable supply of high quality treated permeate poor biological activity in the bioreactor could result into the deposition of carbohydrates and protein compounds and cause wetting in md membranes hence can affect treated permeate quality and continuity of the process table 3 shows the main performance and operational differences between conventional mbr and mdbr processes 45 compared to conventional mbr and other hybrid mbr systems the mdbr offers numerous benefits including constant high quality permeate smaller footprint given the submerged configuration that can achieve in a single step the same as other hybrid systems consisting of different units low sludge production low energy requirements given the potential of waste heat sources or solar power to provide the required thermal energy and enhanced organic matter biodegradation given longer residence time achieved to allow for gradual breakdown 45 89 90 these advantages had rendered mdbr favorable for different potential applications covering a wide range of industries such as textiles pharmaceuticals and food processing where high quality permeate is required or poorly degraded organics present as well as other industries where waste heat is plentiful and could be integrated such as oil rigs and large ships 91 however the most beneficial features of mdbr are represented by its near potable high quality product expanding wastewater reclamation and reuse and its potential for resources recovery in terms of nutrient and bioenergy 89 in addition the mdbr is a good option in the treatment of industrial wastewaters with high temperature or is accessible to waste heat with low concentration of volatile organic carbon 85 nevertheless membrane fouling is a necessary phenomenon due to the inclusion of the biomass in the mdbr resulting in the biofouling and flux decline 85 both thermal and hydraulic resistance of the fouling layer may influence the mass transfer resistance in the layer more than heat transfer resistance only in mdbr membrane fouling also promotes membrane wetting due to critical deposits of carbohydrate and protein on hydrophobic md membrane retarding membrane wetting needs to be achieved not only by adjusting the operational conditions but also improving membrane materials efforts have been made to reduce fouling with mdbr for example gas sparing along the surface of membrane however the loss of water vapor may occur in the mdbr because the aeration or air sparging should carry a load of moisture from the bioreactor 92 table 4 summarizes mdbr studies in the literature with focus on the used configuration removal efficiencies and usage of permeate and the different recovered resources 4 1 wastewater reclamation and reuse the ability of mdbr to achieve high quality permeate as a result of high removal efficiency for both organics and inorganics makes it a favorable option for water reuse high rejection of total organic substances up to 90 99 have been reported in different mdbr studies 45 85 87 91 96 in both side stream and submerged configurations the integration of md has been found to play a major role in achieving such high rejections for mdbr systems with side stream md unit duong et al 96 tested a thermophilic anaerobic granular sludge membrane distillation bioreactor thags mdbr for treatment of wastewater containing high organic loading rates of up to 19 kg cod m3 per day the system achieved more than 99 5 removal efficiency of cod with only 1 7 mg l detected in the permeate moreover high rejection of inorganic salts has been achieved with a permeate electrical conductivity of less than 120 μs cm compared to 23 100 μs cm in the bioreactor the system reclaimed in a single step high quality permeate that was suitable for domestic and industrial use 96 in another study duong et al 97 showed the advantage of md coupling with thermophilic anaerobic bioreactor tanbr md to eliminate the need for alkalinity supplement and act as a self buffering system md achieved high rejection of most solutes including alkaline salt which maintained the buffered ph inside the anaerobic bioreactor proving suitable alkaline environment for anaerobic microorganisms when compared with a conventional tanbr without md under the same conditions the tanbr needed alkalinity adjustment to maintain the same ph level with the tanbr md that achieved in a single step high organic carbon removal efficiency 99 4 without alkalinity supplement zero liquid discharge and high quality effluent that was suitable for irrigation industrial and domestic use 97 nguyen et al tested a novel moving sponge anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor membrane distillation anombr md system for simultaneous water and nutrient recovery 84 the anombr md was operated continuously for 45 days with minimized fouling for the forward osmosis fo membrane that was submerged in the bioreactor mainly due to the moving sponge around the module a side stream md module was then used to recover the diluted draw solution of the fo process yielding high salt rejection of 99 99 and achieving simultaneous draw solution recovery and clean permeate production for water reuse 84 mdbr systems with submerged md unit have also shown potential in wastewater reuse khaing et al 94 tested an aerobic submerged mdbr for petrochemical wastewater reclamation the system was fed with real petrochemical wastewater ran continuously for more than 105 days and produced a permeate with high quality that surpassed the requirements of newater of singapore except for a slightly higher toc the organic removal efficiency was reported to be more than 98 5 and the authors concluded that the electrical conductivity in the feed wastewater had an important effect on the mdbr product water quality 94 silva et al 98 evaluated a two stage anaerobic membrane bioreactor membrane distillation system 2sanmbr md for the removal of dissolved hydrogen sulphide h2s in the context of wastewater reclamation h2s is a toxic compound that causes corrosion damages to the environment health and safety problems 98 the integration of md for treatment of the 2sanmbr effluent rich in toxic h2s showed favorable removal efficiencies at lower ph values achieving up to 98 h2s removal efficiency and producing high quality permeate suitable for water reuse and safe wastewater discharge the efficient removal of h2s by md was due to the usage of sodium hydroxide naoh as a receiving solution at the permeate side of the md process when volatile h2s in the 2sammbr effluent transfer across the hydrophobic md membrane due to the temperature gradient it gets dissolved in the receiving naoh solution resulting in its conversion to a non hazardous form thus achieving high h2s removal 98 recently volpin et al 99 tested an aerobic mdbr system for sanitation and dewatering of human urine achieving simultaneous water reclamation and recovery of a non odorous high concentration liquid fertiliser fig 5 real human urine was collected and went through nitrification via mbr followed by de watered by md to produce clean permeate water and urine based fertiliser except for a very small amount of ammonia 2 found in the permeate water the md unit of the hybrid system completely rejected all other ions no3 na k ca2 mg2 po43 producing effluent suitable for water reuse in toilet flushing or irrigation the removal of trocs from wastewater is essential for water reuse due to their complexity and potential adverse effects on human health moreover the strict emerging regulations and regulatory standards of their discharge with treated wastewaters and the water reuse potential has made their removal a topic of significant interest 66 mdbr has been proposed as a robust system and showed efficient capacity in removing a wide range of trocs 67 70 86 100 102 the high removal efficiency of trocs in mdbr systems is attributed to factors related to both the bioreactor as well as the md process the removal by md is mainly governed by the trocs physiochemical properties including volatility and hydrophobicity while adsorption by sludge and biodegradation are affecting their removal in the bioreactor 89 for instance the removal of three antibiotics azithromycin clarithromycin and erythromycin and an anti inflammatory drug diclofenac in a seawater feed was assessed by md using hydrophobic ptfe membranes and showed complete removal but with different mechanisms 66 the three antibiotics were not detected in both permeate and retentate and their removal was due to thermal degradation while the diclofenac was rejected and concentrated in the retentate stream due to its physical and chemical characteristics of low volatility negative surface charge and hydrophilicity 103 regardless of the volatility and hydrophobicity high removal of trocs could be achieved by a combination of mbr and md the first study on coupling md as a post treatment for thermophilic mbr effluent was reported by wijekoon et al 102 they studied the removal of 29 compounds representing major trocs groups that occur in municipal wastewater while the mbr removed most of the studied trocs several compounds including propoxur atrazine ametryn clofibric acid diclofenac carbamazepine naproxen and fenoprop were not rejected by the mbr and found at high concentration in the effluent which was attributed to the disturbed metabolic activity associated with the biological treatment at elevated temperatures 104 however high removal efficiencies of 95 for all 29 trocs including those that were poorly rejected in mbr were achieved by the mdbr system the mdbr system can achieve high removal rates of trocs comparable to mbr ro nf systems 47 49 105 producing a high quality permeate for safe water reuse in another study the same authors assessed the removal of trocs in thermophilic side stream mdbr and found that the biological treatment alone was not efficient for some recalcitrant trocs having electron withdrawing functional groups in their molecular structure with as low rejection rate as 0 53 due to salinity build up and the thermophilic conditions in the bioreactor 100 the mdbr system performance however was not affected by these conditions and achieved high removal rate for all trocs 95 which was due to a combination of biodegradation sludge adsorption and md rejection 100 similarly high removal efficiencies of up to 90 99 of 30 phenolic and non phenolic types of trocs was achieved by an enzymatic side stream mdbr producing high quality effluent with toxicity below the detection limit 86 a laccase based high retention mbr was used in a novel enzymatic side stream mdbr for enhanced biodegradation of trocs high trocs degradation of 80 99 was reported while the mdbr achieved complete retention 99 of all trocs used 70 the integration of md with anmbr was suggested to simultaneously recover energy and produce high quality water for reuse from wastewater containing 26 different trocs 67 while some recalcitrant trocs showed low rejection 15 by the anmbr the integrated anmbr md system showed an overall removal efficiency from 76 of these recalcitrant trocs to complete removal for all others recently asif et al 101 evaluated the performance of an enzymatic membrane bioreactor membrane distillation embr md system with wastewater containing 30 trocs having different physicochemical properties the md component effectively retained all trocs with a removal efficiency of 94 99 producing a non toxic high quality effluent in addition to organic and trocs removal the removal of nutrients before wastewater discharge is also following strict regulations particularly where the effluent is discharged at water bodies liable to be influenced by eutrophication 89 mdbr has shown high efficiency in removing different nutrients and salinity including total nitrogen ammonia phosphate sodium calcium and magnesium ions 67 85 87 93 94 97 99 100 106 the high removal of nutrients in mdbr systems is mainly attributed to the md retention mechanism based on vapor transfer in tanbr md duong et al 97 showed that po4 3 p concentration in the permeate water was close to zero indicating complete rejection by the md membrane moreover the electrical conductivity of the permeate water was very low due to the rejection of most ions producing water suitable for irrigation industrial or domestic uses complete removal of sodium and calcium ions were achieved 99 high salt rejection of up to 99 75 94 and efficient removal of ammonia ion and tn from 96 to 99 3 85 93 100 were also reported 4 2 nutrients and biogas recovery though water is paramount among all resources and play multi disciplinary role in water food energy nexus recovery of nutrients and renewable energy sources as side or mainstream from wastewater is highly desirable for sustainable environment it does not only offer the direct cost advantage and minimize overall treatment expense but also provides the indirect benefits such as prevention of their discharge into environment avoiding cross contamination of resources reservoirs and fostering the sustainable use of resources and their conservation for future generations the use of mdbr is found to be promising for nutrients and bioenergy recovery as it allows the separation of resources in all three states such as solid liquid and gas depending upon the feed and configuration type yao et al observed biogas generation in the bioreactor when used tanbr md for the treatment of synthetic wastewater 107 their results demonstrated the formation of 0 14 l g cod biogas 42 methane when 45 c and 55 c temperature was maintained for the bioreactor and md permeate respectively the salinity concentrated by md membrane did not show adverse impact on the growth of biomass during operational period however the recovery of biomethane was relatively low compared to conventional thermophilic reactor probably due to the passage of vfas through the md membrane song et al also implemented mdbr anmbr md configuration and recovered biogas from anmbr unit when treated high strength domestic wastewater their findings revealed that 0 3 0 5 l g cod biogas could be produced with a stable methane content i e approximately 65 67 the formation of methane ranging from 0 18 0 11 l g cod from the mbr unit was also obtained during 45 days of sponge based moving bed anombr md operation 84 the generation was averaged to 0 16 l methane g cod for 15 days later a declining trend was observed attributed to the accumulation of salts i e up to 3 65 g l however methane production was slightly improved from day 26 to onwards the authors ascribed that the bacterial community was acclimatized in a high tds total dissolved solids environment demonstrating stable activity in the range of 310 to 330 mv orp oxidation reduction potential the generation of 0 24 l methane g cod in the bioreactor when used anombr md coupled with mesophilic mf membrane is also reported in another study the recovered biogas was accounted for 180 kj day energy and used for heating md feed hence eliminated the requirement of external energy source 167 kj day 108 likewise the extraction and further processing i e ph adjustment using sodium hydroxide and stirring at 180 rpm for 90 min of high tds solution taken on day 16 26 and 36 via mf membrane submerged in hybrid sponge based moving bed anombr md resulted in precipitation of 0 268 g l 0 279 g l and 0 285 g l respectively the authors reported 17 4 wt phosphorus as the highest obtained amount from the solution extracted on day 35 with minimal nitrogen recovery 1 3 wt the schematic of the treatment facility demonstrating its operation working principle and application is depicted in fig 6 84 chang et al recovered phosphorus ranging from 5 to 60 mg l subjected to ph variations 9 12 using anombr coupled with mesophilic mf membrane 108 the use of mdbr for fertigation from urine owing to its nutrient rich nature has also been reported 99 the md membrane can complement anmbr performance by improving the nutrient recovery such as ammonia due to its excellent concentration capability the anmbr has limited functionality to remove ammonia and thus post treatment is often needed the dcmd was applied as post treatment for the treatment of ammonium nitrogen present in the effluent produced by anaerobic fluidized bed membrane bioreactor afmbr at constant transmembrane temperature ammonia recovery was improved by increasing a recirculation flow rate on pvdf based md membrane however increasing feed temperature decreased rejection efficiency of ammonia while high organic removal efficiency more than 90 was achieved regardless of the operational conditions of dcmd 109 besides the use of hybrid configuration in improving specific product yield has also been explored the integration of md with the bioreactor in mdbr facilitates the extraction of generated volatile products hence improve yield of the process owing to their inhibitory role when accumulating in the bioreactor for instance yao et al observed 60 mg l of total organic carbon toc in the permeate at day 7 when operated tanbr md for wastewater reclamation authors ascribed this to the formation of volatile fatty acids intermediate products produced by acidogenesis in the anaerobic bioreactor and their subsequent separation from bioreactor to the permeate tank gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms measurement of the mixed liquor and permeate samples revealed the presence of acetic acid 97 9 and 58 6 mg l propanoic acid 1 1 and 1 3 mg l butyric acid 16 7 and 20 3 mg l and isovaleric acid 12 6 and 15 6 mg l respectively acetic acid had the highest amount in the permeate however the obtained value was lower from its concentration in the mixed liquor in contrast higher concentration of propanoic acid butyric acid and isovaleric acid were observed in the permeate compared to mixed liquor authors attributed this to their higher partitioning co efficient which facilitated their transport rate and enable easy recovery as valuable resource 107 gryta et al employed mdbr bioreactor with side stream md to enhance the ethanol production compared with the classical batch fermentation with an efficiency of 0 35 0 45 g ethanol g sugar and production rate of 0 8 2 g ethanol dm3 h mdbr attained significantly better efficiency and production rate with 0 4 0 51 g ethanol g sugar and 2 5 4 g ethanol dm3 h respectively 110 the authors attributed the high production to simultaneous removal of ethanol through the porous capillary polypropylene membranes used in md as specific growth and production rate of microorganisms declined when ethanol concentration in the fermentation broth reached ca 12 by volume in another study a selective removal of ethanol and acetic acid which served as inhibitor in fermentation of sugar with saccharomyces cerevisiae from the fermentation broth is also obtained by gryta et al when used hydrophobic polypropylene membrane 0 2 μm pore size 8 6 mm 5 5 mm internal external diameter ratio accurel pp v8 2 hf 111 the separated solution did not cause wetting even after 2500 h of operation tomaszewska et al also obtained higher yield of ethanol from lactose 112 and whey 113 when employed submerged mdbr in comparison with the classical fermentation reactor likewise li and co workers reported that high ethanol concentration 421 g l could be achieved by permeate fractional condensation with the process separation factor increased to 19 2 when mdbr was employed with synthetic feed 114 4 3 membrane distillation bioreactor challenges the low permeate flux of mdbr systems represent the main challenge since it would be difficult for wastewater treatment plants to realize treatment of high volumes of wastewaters via low flux membranes 89 conventional mbr systems have permeate fluxes in the ranges of 10 30 l m2 h whereas reported fluxes of mdbr systems were in the range of 2 15 l m2 h table 3 and in some studies were as low as 0 15 l m2 h ethanol flux at 35 c feed temperature 110 depending on feed temperatures and other operational conditions for instance kwon et al 106 tested an afbr fo md hybrid and reported an average permeate flux of 1 2 l m2 h for the md membrane at transmembrane temperature of 15 c in an anombr md system nguyen et al 84 reported a permeate flux for the md process at 2 75 l m2 h at 20 c of transmembrane temperature similarly several other studies on hybrid mdbr systems reported low permeate fluxes in the range of 1 2 5 4 l m2 h 45 100 107 115 nevertheless high permeate fluxes in the range of 15 22 1 l m2 h have been reported in other studies at high temperature gradients 30 40 c 96 97 99 116 while high feed operational temperatures of up to 80 c could be utilized to enhance the permeate flux 45 114 however high operational temperature can also bring problems such as elevated temperature polarization which is related back to lowering the flux due to lower transmembrane pressure accelerating membrane scaling which in turn represent a new resistance that result in flux decline 117 and increasing the level of highly volatile elements to pass through the membrane to the permeate water as will be discussed in the following paragraph although resources recovery represents a versatile feature of mdbr the rejection of highly volatile elements which are considered valuable resources themselves can be challenging especially at thermophilic conditions where high feed temperatures facilitate the passage of these elements such as ammonia through the md membrane into the permeate stream duong et al 96 showed the need of further treatment of the permeate of a thags mdbr to remove nh4 the presence of nh4 in the permeate was a result of passage of highly volatile nh3 from the bioreactor due to high temperature 56 c in another study operating an anmbr md for energy recovery and water reuse song et al 67 showed a gradual decrease in performance of the md unit for nh4 removal from 90 within the first 20 days to around 60 on day 30 authors attributed this decline in ammonium rejection due to its conversion to a highly volatile ammonia gas at high feed temperature of 45 c in the bioreactor and its passage to the permeate side concluding the need to control ammonia volatilisation and to further remove it from the product water 67 the present of ammonium nitrogen in the permeate of mdbr systems mbr coupled with side stream dcmd system was also reported at high feed temperatures causing more volatile nh3 gas to vaporise and pass through the hydrophobic md membrane potentially polluting the permeate 99 nevertheless some studies showed that the presence of ammonical nitrogen in the permeate is not considered an issue in cases where water reuse options are toilet flushing or irrigation or might even be desirable since reducing the amount of ammonia nitrogen in the feed would allow for higher nutrients recovery 99 moreover another study reported on the passage of volatile fatty acids in mdbr system tanbr md through the md membrane to the permeate stream but used this to their advantage through recovering it back from the permeate 107 another challenge that faces mdbr systems is the thermal energy requirements for feed heating and permeate cooling the separation mechanism of the md unit in mdbr depends on vapor pressure difference attained through temperature difference across both sides of the membrane which require energy provision to create such difference in their submerged mdbr system with a permeate flux of 1 84 l m2 h phattaranawik et al 45 reported an average power consumption of 3 6 and 3 4 kw h m3 of product water for heating and cooling respectively however in scenarios where low grade waste heat is available or pre heating the feed by recovering heat from the permeate energy requirements can be highly lowered when utilizing such options and thus eliminating the energy required for heating and cooling energy consumption of the mdbr system was reduced to as low as 1 1 2 kw h m3 of product water 45 moreover integrating these systems with renewable energy sources such as solar panels can also result in lowering the energy requirements additionally in some industrial sectors the wastewater is discharged at elevated temperatures which reduces the energy required for feed heating and eventually expanding its reclamation 89 90 also when coupled with anaerobic bioreactors md can use the recovered waste heat for heating purposes for instance duong et al 96 used waste heat from the thags to directly heat the feed entering into the md unit and reported reduced energy consumption salinity build up in the bioreactor due to high rejection of inorganic slats represent yet another challenge for mdbr systems the biochemical and physical properties of the activated sludge is highly affected by increased salinity 118 for instance microbial community alteration inhibition of microbial growth and tardy microbial kinetics are all associated with incremental salt concentration in the bioreactor 119 120 moreover higher concentrations of soluble microbial products and extracellular polymeric substances were found in the bioreactor as a result of salinity build up 118 which in turn accelerate the potential of membrane fouling by increasing pore block resistance 117 however constant sludge withdrawal can be made to reduce the salinity build up in the bioreactor but this can result in higher sludge disposal costs and lower the srt moreover special attention should be made to operate at an optimum concentration factor which is an indication of the bioreactor salt concentration in such a way that a balance between water recovery and salt accumulation can be achieved reducing the adverse effects of salinity build up 117 membrane fouling still needs to be overcome although the extent to fouling rate on md membrane may be slower due to lower permeate flux through larger membrane pores than high pressure driven membrane such as ro membrane better understanding of fouling mechanisms on md membrane can lead to improvements in the design and operation of various mdbr systems to optimize performance and reduce operational energy with mdbr the membrane fouling varies greatly depending upon the nature of the foulant materials present in wastewater which causes organic inorganic and biofouling both organic and inorganic fouling were observed on the surface of pvdf membrane as it was used in the dcmd as a post treatment for anaerobic membrane bioreactor 109 the deposition of various pollutants on md membrane due to its excellent rejection efficiency should result in both hydraulic and thermal resistances as the hydrophobic membrane is submerged into the mdbr system directly the microbial by products such as eps protein and polysaccharides should play important roles as main foulant materials due to their high sickness to membrane surface gas sparging along the md membrane is often considered to reduce the biofouling or its derivatives from membrane however the optimum module design for gas sparing to the md membrane combined with the bioreactors tailored for various aerobic or anaerobic bioreactors needs to be envisioned membrane fouling in mdbr has also shown to compromise membrane hydrophobicity and thereby accelerate wetting during mdbr operation the progressive accumulation of non volatile solutes such as salts carbohydrates polysaccharides and proteins on md membrane surface and pores can eventually lead to fouling induced membrane wetting which could lead to a significant deterioration in distillate quality and ultimately process failure 85 the issue of wetting further aggravates in cases where low surface tension amphiphilic contaminants e g surfactants and liquids e g alcohol oily substances are present in the feed wastewater these contaminants having hydrophobic tail moiety tend to adsorb on the membrane surface and pore walls through hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions and promote wetting by altering the hydrophobicity of membrane consequently the md membrane loses its unique property to retain the transport of non volatile components in the feed and infiltration of contaminated feed water via the pore structure to the distillate side deteriorate the overall process several studies that tested integrated md br process for wastewater treatment have witnessed fouling and scaling induced membrane wetting during the long term mdbr operation 85 96 107 121 delaying membrane wetting in mdbr process will enable systems to maintain high overall removal efficiencies for a longer operation period during the treatment of complex wastewaters measures such as pre treating wastewater to remove specific wetting promoting contaminants prior to mdbr application limiting the mdbr applications to specific wastewaters with low concentrations of foulants and developing superhydrophobic omniphobic and dense membranes with lower surface energy re entrant structures and chemical resistance have demonstrated a way forward to alleviate wetting in mdbr process for wastewater treatment however wetting of membranes in mdbr still largely remains an unsolved challenge that necessitate more practical and viable solutions 5 future perspectives to sum up the integration of md and biological reactors mdbr is still in an early stage of development and requires further exploration it worthwhile to mention that the current research on mdbr is limited to lab scale testing that sometimes applies unrealistic conditions and draw conclusions based on theoretical assumptions and thus testing these systems at pilot and full scale levels is necessary to give realistic views on their potential despite its various benefits in wastewater reclamation for achieving water reuse and resources recovery mdbr systems still face several operational and technological limitations that hinders their widespread application hence for the practical realization of mdbr technology in wastewater treatment the challenges described in this review namely low water recovery low rejection of highly volatile compounds thermal energy requirements salinity build up and membrane fouling and wetting should be explored and addressed a fundamental factor that will support the development of hybrid mdbr system is suitable membrane development with desired characteristics along with novel module configurations membrane properties and process design have a significant impact on the long term performance and energy efficiency of mdbr systems this underlines the need for developing specifically tuned membranes with desired properties and structures to improve distillation flux alleviate membrane fouling and wetting issues as well as to improve the energy efficiency of the system for instance the recent development and application of advanced md membranes such as nanocomposite membranes janus membranes omniphobic membranes and photothermal membranes have shown great potential in averting intrinsic limitation attributed to conventional md processes during wastewater treatment applications apart from achieving desired membrane characteristics the development of new membranes must take into consideration the ease of fabrication performance robustness and cost effectiveness for long term mdbr operation improving thermal energy efficiency in mdbr process is another potential area that requires immediate research attention it is envisioned that the thermal requirements for feed water heating in particular can be met from waste heat sources or renewable power low cost heat sources such as solar geothermal and industrial waste heat with suitable temperatures can be directly integrated with mdbr however further development is required to address design issues and to confirm its technoeconomic benefits also existing energy research in mdbr is primarily focused on enhancing thermal energy requirements particularly the heating part however cooling for condensing the vapor in md is also energy intensive and more research efforts should be carried out on the potential of low cost alternative sources for condensing till date limited studies have discussed the problem of membrane wetting in mdbr systems which leads to a catastrophic loss of membrane selectivity a systematic understanding of membrane wetting behaviors and underlying mechanisms in mdbr will better guide strategies for high performance membrane design moreover as above mentioned research focusing on the development of novel membranes with tailored surface wettability which are able to resist wetting by low surface tension contaminants and liquids can extend the application of mdbr for the treatment of challenging wastewaters lastly research focusing on detailed energy and cost analysis of hybrid mdbr systems is highly

13014,four aerobic granular sludge reactors operated in sequential batch mode were implemented to understand the effect of low 7 c and high 26 c temperature in the removal of pharmaceuticals in the treated effluent the chemical oxygen demand and nitrogen removal ratio were affected during the startup period in reactors feeding with drugs but systems reached steady stability achieving similar values in terms of biodegradation processes pharmaceuticals were progressively being removed from the effluent at high temperature while at low temperature oscillations in results were obtained naproxen was the most recalcitrant compound and trimethoprim accomplished the better removal ratios for both temperatures the microbial community was completely dependent on operational temperature although the proliferation of specific otus flavobacterium and leadbetterella was detected in reactors amendment with drugs the metabolically active bacteria community showed lower diversity than total community the statistical analyses corroborated that the effect of the temperature on the microbial community was more decisive than the treatment of pharmaceuticals keywords pharmaceuticals aerobic granular sludge temperature active microbial community bacterial community 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags is an emerging biotechnological system which could replace the conventional activated sludge cas because it is able to remove organic matter and nutrients n and p of urban wastewaters in a single and compact reactor 1 2 in addition the technology has been tested for treating industrial wastewaters with high content of toxic compounds such as wastewater from paper agri food miner petrochemical piggery and chemical industries 3 8 this technology is mainly implemented in sequential batch cycles referred to filling aeration decantation and discharge periods to promote the wash out of floc forming microorganisms 9 ags is characterized by a compact granular structure conformed by biofilm without carrier material that improves the settleability and supports lower sludge volume index 10 the compact structure is composed by a high diversity of microbial communities and the extracellular polymeric substances eps segregated by themselves the eps are essential to conform the compact and dense granules and also promote the mass transfer behavior from the external to the inner layer allowing several metabolic pathways therefore the aerobic conditions on the outer layers favor the degradation of organic matter and the ammonium oxidation while on the interlayer and core the anoxic conditions promote the denitrification process and phosphate accumulation by anaerobic denitrifying and phosphate accumulating bacteria 2 pharmaceuticals phcs are extensively used for human population and animal health these pharmaceutical compounds are not fully metabolized by the body and thus excrete out in the wastewater stream for instance antibiotics are released ranging from 5 to 90 depending on chemical characteristics 11 generally phcs are persistent recalcitrant and ubiquitous compounds in several environmental niches nowadays it poses a worldwide concern because they produce undesired effects in non target organisms 12 the problem is that the excreted phcs are directed to the wastewater treatment plants wwtps as wwtp are able to remove fully the phcs are discharged to natural water bodies but actual water legislations do not yet contemplate the determination and analysis of the most dangerous and recalcitrant phcs found in effluent discharged from wwtp at that point wwtps could be a hot spot for the liberation of phcs to the aquatic environment additionally most of the hospitals in developed countries contribute to the higher load of phcs into the urban wastewater consequently technologies capable of degrading adsorbing or transforming these compounds should be implemented in wwtps so it does not present a potential drug concentration point ags technology has been postulated as a successful system for the treatment of water in the chemical industry and in the manufacture of drugs which is why the application of this type of system could represent an important advantage in terms of adsorption degradation or biotransformation of phcs 13 the high surface rate of granules allow larger contact of biomass with the raw wastewater and cells play the role of biotransforming and biodegrading are not isolated therefore the shock against chemicals is not dangerous than in single cells also the high eps segregation by microorganisms that conform granules promote the bioadsorption processes 14 the nature and composition of eps is extremely varied so the different surface charges allow to adsorb a great spectrum of phcs subsequently phcs attached to granules would not be available in the liquid phase which is one of the main challenges for treating emergent contaminant in this way ags technology is a robust biological treatment which allows to treat many wastewater of diverse nature with competitiveness against others biological treatments low cost and in a sustainable way for feasible implementation in small or medium areas with a need for high performance such as the case of a hospital effluent 15 ags systems have already been tested for the treatment of urban wastewater with a high drugs content in favorable conditions such as hydraulic retention time and operational temperature as is reflected in the review wrote by 14 due to the high resistance of granule s core under pharmaceutical s pressure moreover long term phcs accumulation on the biomass weaken the physico chemical performance causing severe issues in the biological technology such as loss of biomass but ags showed a notable resistance for long term stability 14 temperature is a key parameter for the biological treatment of wastewater many of the microorganisms in charge of biotransformation processes carry out their metabolic routes in mild temperatures as they occur in mediterranean countries such as greece spain italy or turkey among others however most of the biosphere is found at temperatures below 5 c such as northern regions or alaska 16 and other large parts of the earth s surface is in the tropics with thermal conditions that imply a notable increase in temperature 20 c 17 and these extreme conditions undoubtedly cause changes to the microbial dynamics 18 the exploration of microbial communities driving biological process under low and high operational temperatures becomes a fundamental step in the design and operation of ags technology in warm and cold climate regions temperature affects the structure and function of bacterial cells and consequently it affects the stability of degradation processes some studies have reported the success to cultivated aerobic granular sludge at different temperatures 9 19 21 describing high nutrients and organic matter removal rates and stability for granular sludge however it is unknown how the high concentration of pharmaceuticals in wastewater could affect ags systems implementation at low 7 c and high 26 c temperatures notwithstanding it is necessary to understand the effect of temperature and the impact to enable decisions on the most optimum conditions bioprocess to remove phcs using the aerobic granular sludge technology then the degradation of pollutants the physic and chemical performance and the total and active microbial community was studied and monitored in order to describe the consequence of the presence of phcs in wastewater in biological wastewater treatment technologies in several latitudes and seasons 2 material and methods 2 1 bioreactor design configuration and set up four aerobic granular biomass reactors were designed using a cylindrical column with a height of 45 cm and diameter of 9 cm the operational volume was 2 5 l and the hydraulic retention time was 6 h the bioreactors were configured to operate in sequential batch cycles in which 60 of operational volume was exchanged in each cycle the cycles consist of 10 min feeding period followed by 160 min of aeration then 3 min of settling and finally 7 min to wash out of treated water therefore the hydraulic retention time hrt was 6 h and the sludge retention time was srt was close to infinite because ags technology did not produce excess sludge except for specific moments such as reported 22 the feeding of bioreactors was pumped by peristaltic pumps watson marlow united kingdom from the top the air temperature was kept at 7 c and 26 c in cold and heated rooms the air was introduced by fine bubbles at the bottom using 4 5 l min 1 of flow in order to keep the circular motion and hydrodynamic shear and the dissolved oxygen was close to saturation in both reactors depending on the operational temperature the ph was monitored with values of 7 7 0 4 each bioreactor was inoculated using 500 ml of storage granular sludge proceeded from a pilot scale reactor operated in the water research institute granada spain the granular sludge was promoted by the pressure exerted by the settling time during the first 3 days the settling time was 10 min followed by 7 min during the next five days the stage was then set at 5 min for 3 more days until reaching the stable period of 3 min the bioreactors were fed with synthetic medium simulating urban wastewater for control bioreactors at low ltr c and high temperature htr c and supplemented with pharmaceutical phcs at low temperature ltr p and high temperature htr p the phcs chosen were the most concentrated and abundant ones found in the wastewater from san cecilio clinical university hospital andalusia spain as described by olicón hernández et al 23 in this sense the influent was compounded by 0 9 g ch3coona l 1 750 mg o2 l 1 0 25 g nh4 added as nh4cl l 1 0 1 g mgso4 7h2o l 1 0 04 g kcl l 1 0 085 g k2hpo4 l 1 and 0 03 g kh2po4

the 25 μm supposed a high phcs concentration for the biological treatment with the goal to monitored the biological technology under extreme conditions 2 2 physico chemical analysis chemical oxygen

chromatograph the mean size was measured using a scalimeter with a sample of 30 granules the settling velocity was analyzed employing a 1 m column and a chronometer 25 the dissolved oxygen and ph was monitored by a crison oximeter and inolab ph meter respectively mix liquor suspended solids mlss measurements were determined according to standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 24 2 3 extraction and determination of drugs the water samples containing drugs were analyzed first by adjusting the ph to 4 5 using hcl at 0 1 n columns for solid phase extraction spe were pre conditioned with an elution of 8 ml of ethanol following by 8 ml of hplc water then 100 ml of samples with drugs were passed through an extraction column in solid phase cartridge oasis milford usa next the cartridges were washed with milli q water and finally air dried 26 a total of 10 μl of samples were injected eluting with a mobile positive ionization phase composed of fractions of h2o formic acid 0 1 and acetonitrile and a mobile negative ionization phase composed of h2o nh3 0 1 and methanol the detection system was a triple quadruple xevo tq xs waters spectrometer milford ma usa the concentration of the candidate phcs was obtained by interpolation of standards curves 2 4 biomass collection and nucleic acid extraction the biological samples were collected at operational day 1 day 15 day 30 day 60 day 90 day 120 and day 180 for that 100 ml of samples were taken when reactors were in motion to capture the diversity of granules the biological samples were submerged in sterile saline solution at 0 9 sonicated for 10 min and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min at 4 c the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was kept at 80 c in addition the protocol was repeated using rna protect to keep the stability of the rna the pellet kept at 80 c was subjected to dna extraction using the fastdna spin kit for soil and the fastprep machine mp biomedicals usa following the protocol described by the manufacturer with slight modifications dna pools were suspended in 150 μl of deionized and sterile milliq water the rna extraction was done using the fastrna blue kit mp biomedical usa following the given protocol then turbo dna free kits ambion life technologies corporation usa were employed to digest the dna subsequently the samples were purified with rneasy mini kit qiagen finally the reverse transcription of rna to cdna was constructed using the superscript iii reverse transcriptase invitrogen following the protocol described by muñoz palazon et al 15 2 5 absolute quantification of target genes qpcr was performed using the quant studio 3 equipment with the primer set of 341f 534r for region v3 of bacterial 16s rrna gene amoa1 f amoa1 r for the determination of ammonia oxidizing bacteria 27 and nosz1840f nosz2090r for the completely denitrifying microorganisms with nosz gene 28 the reaction mixture was made from a total volume of 25 ml which contained 2 5 ml

curves were constructed with the plasmid standard using serial ten fold dilutions 102 108 copies μl 1 2 6 massive parallel sequencing procedure and post treatment of raw data the next generation sequencing ngs was done using illumina miseq equipment and illumina miseq reagent v3 samples of dna and cdna were amplified twice per sample for each pair of primers the pair of primers bacteria807f 5 ggattagatacccbrgtagtc 3 and bacteria1050r 5 tagytgdcgacrrccrtgca 3 were used for the amplification of v5 v6 hypervariable regions of 16s rrna in the bacteria the pcr conditions of the next generation sequencing process were as followed preheating for 2 min at 95 c 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 c 30 s at 57 c and 1 min at 72 c then 5 min of final elongation at 72 c adapters and barcodes were added in a second 10 cycled pcr the raw data from ngs was processed using the mothur software v 1 44 3 29 first forward and reverse samples were merged into a contigs with a quality scores of a mismatched base 0 the reads were subjected to a quality trimming to remove sequences with more than 8 homopolymers and any ambiguous base 30 next it was calculated the sequences unique which were aligned using needleman conditions against silva seed v132 database then the sequences that did not align in the correct forward and reverse position were removed the chimerical reads were detected using the vsearch algorithm using themselves as reference 31 the high quality reads were classified using the silva nr database through k nearest neighbor method with k mer size 8 bp then the remaining contigs were clustered into operational taxonomic units with a similarity cutoff of 97 2 7 statistical analyses similarity and diversity the similarities analyses were based on conventional and compositional statistics the conventional statistics allows us to calculate the similarity percentage analysis simper referred to as the contribution of operational taxonomic units otus that promote the dissimilarity between samples based on the temperature the presence or absence of drugs and total and active microbial community the simper analysis was calculated using the dominant otu table transformed to center logarithm trough bray curtis algorithm similarity using the software past v3 4 hierarchical clustering analysis of total and metabolically active bacteria communities were used to estimate the clustering by paired groups using the bray curtis algorithm with 999 bootstraps in the past v3 4 software in addition a non metric mds was calculated to understand the influence area for dna and cdna samples using the otu table transformed to center the logarithm ratio the compositional statistics allows us to capture all diversity of dna and cdna samples including the rare phylotypes first the otu tables were corrected to avoid zero values using zcomposition package s bayesian algorithm implemented in r project software then the corrected otu table was centered and log ratio transformed using codapack software finally the transformed otu distributions were used to calculate the singular decomposition values 32 the compositional statistics was employed to estimate the expected effect size ees and the principal component analysis pca to calculate the differential abundance of otus between the reactors at low and high temperature and the presence or absence the drugs the expected effect size was analyzed the α diversity and β diversity analysis were calculated for microbial community studied in dna and cdna using the software past v3 4 the α diversity indices were calculated to estimate the species richness diversity and evenness on the other hand the β diversity index valued the differences between pair of samples from the whittaker index 2 8 multivariate redundancy analysis multivariate redundancy analysis was calculated to estimate the relations linked between total and active microbial community and the key parameters for treatment process thus the data of the microbial community and physico chemical performances were transformed to centered log the selected total and active microbial community for the calculations were the otus with 1 50 of total relative abundance of each biological samples for physico chemical analysis were included the values of cod removal bod5 removal total nitrogen removal ammonium removal nitrate nitrite and ammonium concentration in the effluent and on the other hand the mlss settling velocity and mean size of granules the analyses were computed using 999 monte carlo simulations under a full permutation model running in the software canoco 4 5 for windows 68 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment performance of the reactors the chemical performance of aerobic granular reactors were evaluated by means of cod bod5 and inorganic nitrogen compounds in fig 1 it is shown the physic chemical performance of all bioreactors for cod reactors at high and low temperature treating phcs had slightly better removal efficiency until operational day 100 however it is important to mention that at high temperature the rate was almost similar to the control reactor from operational day 70 while at a low temperature the cod removal ratio was lower until operational day 140 this could be caused by the difficulties of the microbial community to removing the organic matter at low temperatures and in the presence of antimicrobial compounds this is likely because the bacteria community need more time to reach acclimatization ab halim et al 33 mentioned that operational temperatures affected the aerobic granular sludge reactors because they reach steady states at different stages during the cultivation period the cod trend showed regardless of operational temperature after 140 days of experimentation the removal ratio was similar for reactors operated at 7 c and 26 c 92 this fact pointed out microbial communities in granular sludge used as inoculum were acclimatized to higher or lower temperatures in this sense the results showed the success of inoculum adaption to mild temperatures for the start up of ags systems located in places ranging from 7 c to 26 c essentially following the premise described by ab halim et al 33 aerobic granular sludge indicates that the long term operation could take place keeping the excellent biological activity during the degradation process at different temperatures however it is common that the biological systems need longer time frames for the acclimatization stage when the environment presents substantial changes in comparison with the inoculum the bod5 determination was evaluated in the four bioreactors during the whole experiment no significant differences were found between reactors operated at low or high temperature for biodegradable organic matter but during the start up stage the reactors amended with phcs had slight detriment on bod5 from operational days 20 to 40 the ltr p reactor discarded effluent with higher bod5 at operational day 20 while the htr p showed this same trend at operational day 40 these results suggested that ltr p suffered more instability and difficulties to remove biodegradable organic matter than the reactor at high temperature largely due to the effect of phcs being less damping the nitrogen removal ratio was a key parameter for the operation of an aerobic granular sludge reactor given by the advantages of nitrification denitrification processes promoting the granular sludge the spherical morphology and high density allowed to reach excellent results for nitrogen removal ratio at low and high temperatures regardless of the fact that some authors have reported negative effects on nitrogen degradation at temperature below 10 c 34 certainly higher total nitrogen removal ratios were found in the reactor operated at 26 c with and without phcs reaching values higher than 90 of total nitrogen removal contrary the ltr reactors showed values close to 80 a trivial difference was determined in reactors treating phcs at this point it could be suggested that both temperature and the presence of drugs affected the nitrogen removal ratio of aerobic granular sludge technology however if these results are compared with other studies that used sludge previously adapted to temperature the results do not differ for example muñoz palazon et al 15 observed values in the range of 80 90 of nitrogen removal ratio in reactors operated at 15 c 3 2 physical determination of granular sludge the biomass was analyzed by the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids mean size and settling time of granular sludge particle size is an important feature of ags because it has a significant influence not only on its settle ability but also on the mass transfer behavior related to nutrients and oxygen transport along the granular structure 35 temperature in biological systems affects the biomass in the reactors this fact is well known in biological treatments and also in aerobic granular sludge reactors 9 20 21 the results of particle diameter showed that it did not produce the breakage of the granules at low and high temperature neither in the presence of drugs mixture during the whole operation in htr p and htr c the granular size increased from 1 00 mm of inoculum used to 1 70 2 22 mm at the end of experiment and granules were compact and robust fig 2 likewise in ltr p and ltr c the granular particles exhibited oscillations during operation during the first 60 days of operation the granules decreased in size after this period the size increased until having average values of 0 98 0 32 mm a fact shared by the reactors treating drugs was that the mean size of the granules was larger than in the reactors used as control wang et al 36 described an increase in the production of extracellular polymeric substances in the presence of these chemical compounds pointing out a greater aggregation of the particles and greater size the granular sludge settleability was improved gradually along the experiment presumably because the microorganisms that conformed the granules were accommodating to the new operational temperature the biomass belonging to low temperature reactors settled faster but ltrs had remarkable oscillations contrary the reactors operated at high temperature showed a progressive increase trend over operational time the results of settleability suggested that the selection of floc forming microorganisms adapted at low temperatures were more effective by the pressure exerted in these conditions this agrees with the previous research conducted by muñoz palazon et al 20 21 actually the settle ability was slightly slower in reactors amended with pharmaceutical compounds than in reactors treating wastewater without drugs for both low and high temperatures the settling velocity ranged between 100 m h 1 to 120 m h 1 the concentrations of mlss decreased sharply at the beginning due to the wash out of excess microorganisms and then increased gradually until it remained steady state the mlss concentration was higher in the reactor operated at 26 c even in reactor treating drugs with values around 2500 3000 mg mlss l 1 although the steady state in high temperature reactors treating pharmaceutical compounds need approximately 120 days to reach the stable concentration therefore the capacity of growing biomass was depleted under phcs presence related to the low temperature reactors the concentration at the end of the operation was almost 2500 mg mlss l 1 3 3 treatment of drugs by ags in sbr at 7 c and 26 c the trend analyzed in the effluent of the reactors htr p and ltr p were opposite fig 3 in general the reactor operated at 7 c showed serial oscillations in the concentration of phcs this tendency could be explained by the absorption desorption phenomenon which occurred mainly with the carbamazepine and naproxen this bio adsorption phenomenon had been described previously in ags by several authors 37 38 in fact it is still difficult to elucidate which is the biotransformation biodegradation or bioadsorption rate by granules taking into account the amount of phcs that are not discharged into the effluent based on removal efficiency although great efforts are being made to quantify the ratio for each of these processes in ags technology there are few gaps linked to the complexity of granular biofilm 39 40 the htr p gradually increased the removal capacity without instability period possibly due to the fact that phcs had higher solubility in the water and subsequently the drugs were available for the microorganism s consumption the phcs removal ratio in the reactor at 26 c was increasing during operation time especially remarkable for diclofenac trimethoprim and carbamazepine the most recalcitrant compound was the naproxen at both temperatures actually the naproxen usually has negative removal efficiencies 41 these negative values can be explained by deconjugation of glucuronidase or sulphated phcs and desorption from particles or hydrolysis of some compounds for example hydrolysis of acetylsalicylic acid to salicylic acid these effects have been observed in several phcs of different therapeutic classes in particular for diclofenac ibuprofen carbamazepine estrone and loperamide 42 44 related to trimethoprim the ags reactors had biodegraded bio transformed or and bio adsorbed in highly efficiency ways this fact could propose an important advantage of this technology against conventional activated sludge which could remove only 20 45 because trimethoprim was highly resistant to degradation in wastewater treatment plants 46 thus the compact biofilm of ags would promote longer contact of cells with trimethoprim keep in the external layer for a gradually degradation and increases the biotransformation of a number of phcs compared to as 47 48 mendes barros et al 49 described low capacities of ags systems to remove trimethoprim with an anoxic period implemented 1 5 h therefore it could be assumed that the aerobic conditions promote the reduction of trimethoprim in the effluent actually most of the technologies implemented to degrade trimethoprim are based on physio chemical processes 50 51 with the economical and energetic disadvantages that these methods present versus biological treatments 3 4 quantitative pcr study the absolute detection of target bacterial genes in the granular sludge is shown in fig 4 the storage granular sludge used as inoculum showed a magnitude order of 107 108 for 16s rrna bacterial gene on operational day 1 regardless of temperature and presence of phcs there were no significant changes in the microbial population for the first 24 h on the next sampling day a remarkable increase was detected for all bioreactors but the tendency was more pronounced in ltrs and even more in reactors supplemented with phcs moreover the qpcr showed this trend for all experimentation time because the ltr p reactor achieved 1012 copies per gram of granules followed by the ltr c with 1011 copies therefore the high temperature reactor tracked the same predisposition the ags treating phcs had a higher number of copies than the control reactor these results could suggest that the temperature and phcs exerted a pressure which increased the microorganism s concentration in grams of granules eps segregation could be scarcer in adverse conditions in comparison to ags operated at 26 c as kinetics models demonstrated 52 the ammonia oxidation bacteria were detected by the amoa gene and the trend was completely opposite to the total bacterial gene because the absence of phcs in the influent and the high temperature had a positive repercussion on the number of ammonia oxidizing bacteria 106 gene copies gram granule 1 while the smallest quantification was detected in ltr p with two magnitude order less the amoa gene had deep sensibility and affection by the phcs fact previously mentioned by muñoz palazon et al 20 additionally temperatures below 10 c supported a sturdy stress to nitrifiers bacteria and the nitrification process in wwtps such as reported gnida et al 34 this corroborates the results obtained by the amoa qpcr analysis the high temperature had a positive effect on the proliferation of denitrifying bacteria analyzed by the nosz i gene with respect to the inoculum the number of copies of nosz i were variable during operational time but in general the phcs did not have strong effects on the denitrifiers the number of nosz i genes copies in reactors at low temperatures ranged from 105 to 106 copies gram of granules 1 while ags reactors at high temperature had 108 to 109 copies gram 1 during the first 15 days in htrs the denitrifiers increased but from operational day 90 it was noticed a detriment in the reactor treating phcs because the number of copies decreased to 107 copies gram 1 these results suggest that high temperatures promote the denitrification process but are affected under the presence of phcs 3 5 total and metabolically active microbial community during the start up and stable phases of ags technology 3 5 1 taxonomic composition of total microbial communities the relative abundance of some otus were significantly influenced by the temperature on the first week of operation in this way the granular biomass of reactors ltr c and ltr p were quickly colonized by a otu belonging to the flavobacteriaceae family fig 5 this otu004 decreased over the operational time in the reactor fed with pharmaceutical compounds but the other flavobacteriaceae otu proliferated at operational day 120 in that sense otu004 kept the dominance of the low temperature control reactor with slight oscillations until operational day 120 in both low temperature reactors from operational day 120 the dominance in the system changed drastically because the ltr p promoted the genera that belonged to flavobacterium 41 and pedobacter 27 flavobacterium spp had developed numerous adaptation mechanisms which allowed it to survive in cold and extreme habitats 53 one of the adaptations found in this genus was the modification of fatty acid cell membranes 53 it had been described that flavobacterium species adapt to cold environments at low temperatures and produce more types of major fatty acids than other genera composing unsaturated and branched fatty acids 53 in addition changes in the membrane could be interconnected with the high extracellular polymeric substances eps production eps segregation is essential for stability of granules świątczak cydzik kwiatkowska 54 reported the key role of flavobacterium in the eps production and suggested the involvement on the granulation as structural microorganisms as well as eps protecting bacteria against toxic compounds 55 on the other hand cui et al 13 had described the increase of flavobacterium in terms of relative abundance in ags systems that treat antibiotics blunt et al 46 described the presence of antibiotic resistant genes and intrinsic resistance to pharmaceutical compounds 56 moreover the high eps production of this genus could promote the adsorption of phcs finally it is essential to mention the denitrifying and phosphorous accumulation ability of the flavobacteriaceae family 57 the second most abundant genus in the ltr p was pedobacter which is widely known for having antibiotic resistant genes and proliferation abilities under high toxic conditions 58 in fact pedobacter spp are considered environmental superbugs due to their resistance to four classes of antibiotics as well as having a large arsenal of antibiotic resistant genes 59 the acclimatization of this phylotype to this antibiotic at cold temperatures 7 c was observed in this study in the reactor operated at cold temperatures supplemented with phcs it was commonly observed the proliferation of flavobacterium and pedobacter because both have psychrophilic adaptation mechanisms this is not surprising because they have been reported in ultra cold environments in other studies 53 60 the bacterial dynamics in ltr c showed the proliferation of the cytophagaceae family as well as the acholeplasma genus the results suggested that the hypothesis of affection generated by the low temperature was more pronounced than the pressure exerted by the presence of phcs in the microbial communities however the maturation of the systems under different influent compositions modified the dominance and abundance of the most representative phylotypes at the start up stage the ags reactors that were operated at high temperatures followed a completely dissimilar trend to the ltr reactors the presence of phcs in the influent did not affect sharply to the microbial community at the end of operation because two otus taxonomically affiliated to leadbetterella were dominant in both systems thus it is relevant to point out that the selection of granular forming bacteria was influenced mainly by the temperature certainly during temperature adaption the microbial community followed different developments depending on influent composition in the influent supplemented with phcs proteiniphilum and flavobacterium genera acquired dominance in populations as it was mentioned before that there were several strains described with high multi resistance capacity 59 while in the htr c it was mainly controlled by several otus belonging to leadbetterella even so at the end of experimentation on htr c flavobacteriaceae chitinophagaceae families and parcubacteria genus were determinate with high relative abundance 5 00 3 5 2 dynamics of metabolically active microbial communities the total and metabolically active communities showed differences mainly in terms of relative abundance fig 6 the ltr c showed a community dominated by otu004 belonging to the flavobacteriaceae family during the first 60 days while acholeplasma genus and the cytophagaceae family increased in activity at the end of the operation major differences were found between the total and metabolically active community in the ltr p the flavobacteriaceae family was highly represented reaching 10 00 of relative abundance as the high diversity over the operational time was palpable by the proliferation of clostriadiales flavobacterium leadbetterella macellibacteroides cytophagaceae and acholeplasma the htr reactors reflected similar results to the total bacterial populations with the most representative genera being leadbetterella in both the control and supplemented with phcs in this way the study of both microbial communities allowed us to define more a more precise community that carried out the degradation process wang et al 36 described the role and abundance of leadbetterella in the presence of tetracycline and suggested the potential role of degradation to antibiotics in addition it is possible that the optimum adaptation of this phylotype to high temperatures while at low temperatures it could not compete against other species thus leadbetterella was probably related with granulation and resilience to shock loading and toxins under high temperature as corroborated by zhang et al 61 in biological system operated at 30 2 c 3 6 statistical analysis the calculated indices are summarized in table s1 for metabolically active bacterial communities and in table s2 for total bacterial communities for 16s rrna communities the average values of chao index for ltr p described low species diversity 115 to 539 while shannon evenness and simpson evidenced a medium high functional evenness of the bacterial community the ltr c showed higher species richness 226 to 1453 but the evenness and diversity reflected by the indices were lower than in drug presence this could be caused by the competition of bacteria population in the presence of phcs 62 on the other hand the reactors operated at high temperatures showed higher species richness values in general but in the reactor containing phcs it was even higher following the same route as ltr p in general the α diversity indices of the reactor amended with phcs showed a loss of species richness diversity and evenness in conclusion the species richness at low temperatures was lower than at high temperature but on the contrary low temperature promoted the diversity and evenness possibly caused by the competitions of phylotypes not well adapted however at high temperatures the phylotypes found a better niche to compete for the substrate additionally these results could be corroborated by the analysis of the metabolically active bacterial community described in section 3 5 2 the α diversity studies for the total bacterial communities reflected the same affinity although in general the species richness and diversity were higher than in active bacteria table s2 the β diversity index for total and metabolically active bacterial communities were shown in fig s2 no common patterns were found in the bioreactors during operational time however it was very interesting to estimate that the total microbial community showed a greater difference between the metabolically active community thus the results could be corroborated that not all phylotypes played a role in the degradation processes or granular stability and the rare phylotypes only related to the total bacterial communities the similarity percentage analysis simper was used to investigate the contribution to the dominant otus 1 00 of relative abundance between the groups of samples differentiated by the temperature and pressure exerted by phcs in influent fig s3 furthermore the analysis was calculated for total and metabolically active microbial communities for the reactors operated at low temperatures the bacterial communities of 16s rrna and 16s rdna were basically different by the contribution of otu003 otu004 otu011 otu013 and otu015 they were taxonomically affiliated with cytophagaceae flavobacteriaceae family and flavobacterium genus mainly due to these otus proliferated in the bioreactor treated with phcs while otu004 was dominant in the htr c during the whole operation furthermore the otu030 contributed more than 5 00 dissimilarity between these samples which belonged to the pedobacter genus achieving a 30 00 relative abundance in the 16s rdna study for ltr p the contribution to dissimilarities between the rest of samples htrp htrc ltrp htrp ltrc htrc followed a remarkable trend because otu001 and otu002 both were affiliated with the leadbetterella genus which was the genus most represented over the whole operational time at high temperatures within the high temperature reactors the operational taxonomic units were different more specifically the ltrs operating with and without drugs showed significant dissimilarities in otu004 otu005 otu007 and otu008 and were taxonomically affiliated with flavobacteriaceae parcubacteria proteiniphilum and acholeplasma respectively although these phylotypes had presence in both reactors the selection and proliferation followed different evolutions few remarkable tendencies were found for parcubacteria which was more representative in the reactor amended with phcs for the pair of sample reactors amended with drugs at high and low temperatures the most abundant otus previously mentioned otu001 otu002 otu003 otu004 otu00 and otu007 added more dissimilarities analysis indicated that the adaptation of microbial community to toxic compounds was strongly related to temperature the pcoa plot could be separated into two clusters 1 the ags reactors operated at high temperature and 2 the ags reactors operated at low temperature however there was a shorter distance marked by samples of reactors supplemented with phcs at low temperatures day 1 and day 180 and at high temperature day 15 which revealed certain similarities fig 7 the active microbiome samples followed the same trend even so these results made remarkable definitively the pressure exerted by the operational temperature on the microbial community as reported by muñoz palazon et al 20 21 the reactor operated at high temperatures showed relatively close samples at operational day 180 denoting the high similarities found on the microbiome once the system was steady state despite the presence of phcs nevertheless for low temperature reactors the trend was completely opposite the samples at operational day 180 showed larger distances between them thus the bacterial populations at low temperatures suffered deep changes when treated with wastewater containing high amounts of anti inflammatory antiepileptic and antibiotic compounds these results suggest that the spectrum of degraded organic matter nitrogen phosphorous or toxic compounds is more selective for bacteria populations at low temperatures 7 c than at high temperature 26 c which could be caused by the mechanisms to survive at cold temperatures 63 this statistical and phylogenetic analyses allowed to suggest that ags technology could be implemented for treating wastewater with high contain of phcs at higher temperatures than in extreme low environment due to the adaptation of microbial communities furthermore the non metric mds analysis based on bray curtis distance showed two big and clear clusters corroborating the data predicted by the pcoa fig s4 in addition more information provided by the non metric mds were the large distances found in the samples of the reactors treating pharmaceutical compounds over operational time 55 while shorter distance was observed in control reactors regardless of temperature thus these results suggested that temperature is a key parameter for degradation in the microbial community but the presence of phcs triggered drastic changes in the populations the compositional statistics allowed us to calculate the expected effect size ees which estimate the number of otus that contribute significantly to differences between the pair of samples with values higher than 1 or smaller than 1 the ees is shown in fig s5 which reflected that the biggest differences were detected in the systems operated at different temperatures supporting the hypothesis previously described by the pcoa and non metric mds analyses these results reported that the bacterial population of reactors were mostly conditioned by operational temperatures than the supplementation of phcs in the influent these results were described by the studies previously carried out by muñoz palazon et al 20 21 several multivariate redundancy analyses rdas plots showed the relationship between physic chemical performance and the total and metabolically active bacterial communities in the fig 8 the rda parameters studied on reactor ltr p showed an increased in the chemical performance and granular characterization that correlated positively with the operational days day 90 day 120 and day 180 for both total fig 8a and active metabolically bacteria fig 8b there was a negative correlation with the nitrate and nitrite production with the maximum performance and with the stability of the reactor the no3 and no2 were positively and strongly correlated with the biological samples of start up in this reactor otu013 and otu030 affiliated to flavobacterium and pedobacter were the only bacteria that were positively and closely linked with bod5 removal cod removal total nitrogen removal ammonium oxidation and mlss concentration pedobacter had been isolated from nitrifying sludge inoculum 64 and was suggested to play a role in the nitrification process on the other hand flavobacterium could remove nitrogen through simultaneously heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification 65 both bacteria are heterotrophic and have been identified in psychrophilic environments 53 66 the hypothesis is that otu013 and otu030 were psychrotolerant and multidrug resistant bacteria that were able to degrade the organic matter while also carrying out the simultaneous process of nitrification denitrification the results of the total and metabolically active bacteria showed similar patterns for biological samples performance and relationship with bacteria however for the active community only a few phylotypes were identified with positive linking roles to physic chemical performance being otu028 and otu069 taxonomically affiliated to porphyromonadaceae family and dyadobacter genus the rda linked the total bacteria with physic chemical performance and biological samples in the reactor lrt c showed high disparity in terms of correlations because almost each parameter was linked with a otu these results reflected despite the low temperature the bacterial community had more diversity in absence of chemical with antimicrobial activity it was of importance that a strong positive correlation existed between otu001 and otu034 and the bod5 rem granular size the second important linked was the otu003 and otu009 with the nitrogen removal cycles and the third was the otu006 linking with cod rem mlss and settleability the otu009 and otu006 belonged to cytophagaceae family which is widely known to be bacteria involved in nitrification and also such as nitrogen incorporating bacteria in wwtps 67 these patterns were not found in the rda with metabolically active bacterial community in this sense only the otu003 otu006 otu009 and otu034 were correlated positively and strongly with bod5 removal while the cod removal mlss granular properties and nitrogen removal were very weakly correlated the multivariate redundancy analysis was also calculated for the reactor at warm temperature amended with drugs fig 8e f and without drugs fig 8g h for the htr p the negative correlation of the total dominant otus with performance suggested that despite the high diversity with the presence of drugs the bacteria able to work in a stressful condition were the otu001 and otu006 belonging to leadbetterella and the cytophagaceae family reflected the rda linking the metabolically active bacteria with physico chemical performance it was mentioned before the well known role that the cytophagaceae family plays for nitrogen removal in wwtps the results suggested that despite the high diversity the bacteria were not able to degrade compounds in the presence of pharmaceuticals because they inhibited the microbial activity these results could be compared with the rda for reactor hrt c without drugs where each one was linked with some parameter that contributes to the correct functioning of the bioreactor actually the rda for total and metabolically active bacteria were similar the settle velocity and mean granular size were positively correlated with otu017 and negatively correlated with nitrite nitrate and ammonium concentration in the effluent these results corroborated that denser and bigger granules promote the nitrification and denitrification process on the other hand the otu014 was correlated with high nitrogen removal ratios these bacteria belonged to the ns9 marine group which had been described in ags 20 4 conclusions aerobic granular sludge technology is able to treat pharmaceuticals in an efficient way at high temperatures 26 c after an adaptation process while at low temperatures the oscillations in the values reflected the bioadsorption desorption process and then phcs were spread to the aquatic environment the microbial community within the granules were mainly determinate by the operational temperature and not so much for the presence of toxic compounds the treatment of phcs did not affect the optimum removal ratio in terms of bod5 and cod 90 and nitrogen removal 85 additionally the system could be implemented at different latitudes the absolute quantification showed higher concentration of target genes at low temperature possibly caused by the lower eps production in the same way it could be observed in the bigger granule size in reactors at high temperatures this corroborates the previous results leadbetterella was the most dominant bacteria at high temperature while flavobacterium represented the system at low temperatures credit authorship contribution statement b m p methodology software formal analysis investigation data curation writing

13014,four aerobic granular sludge reactors operated in sequential batch mode were implemented to understand the effect of low 7 c and high 26 c temperature in the removal of pharmaceuticals in the treated effluent the chemical oxygen demand and nitrogen removal ratio were affected during the startup period in reactors feeding with drugs but systems reached steady stability achieving similar values in terms of biodegradation processes pharmaceuticals were progressively being removed from the effluent at high temperature while at low temperature oscillations in results were obtained naproxen was the most recalcitrant compound and trimethoprim accomplished the better removal ratios for both temperatures the microbial community was completely dependent on operational temperature although the proliferation of specific otus flavobacterium and leadbetterella was detected in reactors amendment with drugs the metabolically active bacteria community showed lower diversity than total community the statistical analyses corroborated that the effect of the temperature on the microbial community was more decisive than the treatment of pharmaceuticals keywords pharmaceuticals aerobic granular sludge temperature active microbial community bacterial community 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags is an emerging biotechnological system which could replace the conventional activated sludge cas because it is able to remove organic matter and nutrients n and p of urban wastewaters in a single and compact reactor 1 2 in addition the technology has been tested for treating industrial wastewaters with high content of toxic compounds such as wastewater from paper agri food miner petrochemical piggery and chemical industries 3 8 this technology is mainly implemented in sequential batch cycles referred to filling aeration decantation and discharge periods to promote the wash out of floc forming microorganisms 9 ags is characterized by a compact granular structure conformed by biofilm without carrier material that improves the settleability and supports lower sludge volume index 10 the compact structure is composed by a high diversity of microbial communities and the extracellular polymeric substances eps segregated by themselves the eps are essential to conform the compact and dense granules and also promote the mass transfer behavior from the external to the inner layer allowing several metabolic pathways therefore the aerobic conditions on the outer layers favor the degradation of organic matter and the ammonium oxidation while on the interlayer and core the anoxic conditions promote the denitrification process and phosphate accumulation by anaerobic denitrifying and phosphate accumulating bacteria 2 pharmaceuticals phcs are extensively used for human population and animal health these pharmaceutical compounds are not fully metabolized by the body and thus excrete out in the wastewater stream for instance antibiotics are released ranging from 5 to 90 depending on chemical characteristics 11 generally phcs are persistent recalcitrant and ubiquitous compounds in several environmental niches nowadays it poses a worldwide concern because they produce undesired effects in non target organisms 12 the problem is that the excreted phcs are directed to the wastewater treatment plants wwtps as wwtp are able to remove fully the phcs are discharged to natural water bodies but actual water legislations do not yet contemplate the determination and analysis of the most dangerous and recalcitrant phcs found in effluent discharged from wwtp at that point wwtps could be a hot spot for the liberation of phcs to the aquatic environment additionally most of the hospitals in developed countries contribute to the higher load of phcs into the urban wastewater consequently technologies capable of degrading adsorbing or transforming these compounds should be implemented in wwtps so it does not present a potential drug concentration point ags technology has been postulated as a successful system for the treatment of water in the chemical industry and in the manufacture of drugs which is why the application of this type of system could represent an important advantage in terms of adsorption degradation or biotransformation of phcs 13 the high surface rate of granules allow larger contact of biomass with the raw wastewater and cells play the role of biotransforming and biodegrading are not isolated therefore the shock against chemicals is not dangerous than in single cells also the high eps segregation by microorganisms that conform granules promote the bioadsorption processes 14 the nature and composition of eps is extremely varied so the different surface charges allow to adsorb a great spectrum of phcs subsequently phcs attached to granules would not be available in the liquid phase which is one of the main challenges for treating emergent contaminant in this way ags technology is a robust biological treatment which allows to treat many wastewater of diverse nature with competitiveness against others biological treatments low cost and in a sustainable way for feasible implementation in small or medium areas with a need for high performance such as the case of a hospital effluent 15 ags systems have already been tested for the treatment of urban wastewater with a high drugs content in favorable conditions such as hydraulic retention time and operational temperature as is reflected in the review wrote by 14 due to the high resistance of granule s core under pharmaceutical s pressure moreover long term phcs accumulation on the biomass weaken the physico chemical performance causing severe issues in the biological technology such as loss of biomass but ags showed a notable resistance for long term stability 14 temperature is a key parameter for the biological treatment of wastewater many of the microorganisms in charge of biotransformation processes carry out their metabolic routes in mild temperatures as they occur in mediterranean countries such as greece spain italy or turkey among others however most of the biosphere is found at temperatures below 5 c such as northern regions or alaska 16 and other large parts of the earth s surface is in the tropics with thermal conditions that imply a notable increase in temperature 20 c 17 and these extreme conditions undoubtedly cause changes to the microbial dynamics 18 the exploration of microbial communities driving biological process under low and high operational temperatures becomes a fundamental step in the design and operation of ags technology in warm and cold climate regions temperature affects the structure and function of bacterial cells and consequently it affects the stability of degradation processes some studies have reported the success to cultivated aerobic granular sludge at different temperatures 9 19 21 describing high nutrients and organic matter removal rates and stability for granular sludge however it is unknown how the high concentration of pharmaceuticals in wastewater could affect ags systems implementation at low 7 c and high 26 c temperatures notwithstanding it is necessary to understand the effect of temperature and the impact to enable decisions on the most optimum conditions bioprocess to remove phcs using the aerobic granular sludge technology then the degradation of pollutants the physic and chemical performance and the total and active microbial community was studied and monitored in order to describe the consequence of the presence of phcs in wastewater in biological wastewater treatment technologies in several latitudes and seasons 2 material and methods 2 1 bioreactor design configuration and set up four aerobic granular biomass reactors were designed using a cylindrical column with a height of 45 cm and diameter of 9 cm the operational volume was 2 5 l and the hydraulic retention time was 6 h the bioreactors were configured to operate in sequential batch cycles in which 60 of operational volume was exchanged in each cycle the cycles consist of 10 min feeding period followed by 160 min of aeration then 3 min of settling and finally 7 min to wash out of treated water therefore the hydraulic retention time hrt was 6 h and the sludge retention time was srt was close to infinite because ags technology did not produce excess sludge except for specific moments such as reported 22 the feeding of bioreactors was pumped by peristaltic pumps watson marlow united kingdom from the top the air temperature was kept at 7 c and 26 c in cold and heated rooms the air was introduced by fine bubbles at the bottom using 4 5 l min 1 of flow in order to keep the circular motion and hydrodynamic shear and the dissolved oxygen was close to saturation in both reactors depending on the operational temperature the ph was monitored with values of 7 7 0 4 each bioreactor was inoculated using 500 ml of storage granular sludge proceeded from a pilot scale reactor operated in the water research institute granada spain the granular sludge was promoted by the pressure exerted by the settling time during the first 3 days the settling time was 10 min followed by 7 min during the next five days the stage was then set at 5 min for 3 more days until reaching the stable period of 3 min the bioreactors were fed with synthetic medium simulating urban wastewater for control bioreactors at low ltr c and high temperature htr c and supplemented with pharmaceutical phcs at low temperature ltr p and high temperature htr p the phcs chosen were the most concentrated and abundant ones found in the wastewater from san cecilio clinical university hospital andalusia spain as described by olicón hernández et al 23 in this sense the influent was compounded by 0 9 g ch3coona l 1 750 mg o2 l 1 0 25 g nh4 added as nh4cl l 1 0 1 g mgso4 7h2o l 1 0 04 g kcl l 1 0 085 g k2hpo4 l 1 and 0 03 g kh2po4

chromatograph the mean size was measured using a scalimeter with a sample of 30 granules the settling velocity was analyzed employing a 1 m column and a chronometer 25 the dissolved oxygen and ph was monitored by a crison oximeter and inolab ph meter respectively mix liquor suspended solids mlss measurements were determined according to standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 24 2 3 extraction and determination of drugs the water samples containing drugs were analyzed first by adjusting the ph to 4 5 using hcl at 0 1 n columns for solid phase extraction spe were pre conditioned with an elution of 8 ml of ethanol following by 8 ml of hplc water then 100 ml of samples with drugs were passed through an extraction column in solid phase cartridge oasis milford usa next the cartridges were washed with milli q water and finally air dried 26 a total of 10 μl of samples were injected eluting with a mobile positive ionization phase composed of fractions of h2o formic acid 0 1 and acetonitrile and a mobile negative ionization phase composed of h2o nh3 0 1 and methanol the detection system was a triple quadruple xevo tq xs waters spectrometer milford ma usa the concentration of the candidate phcs was obtained by interpolation of standards curves 2 4 biomass collection and nucleic acid extraction the biological samples were collected at operational day 1 day 15 day 30 day 60 day 90 day 120 and day 180 for that 100 ml of samples were taken when reactors were in motion to capture the diversity of granules the biological samples were submerged in sterile saline solution at 0 9 sonicated for 10 min and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min at 4 c the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was kept at 80 c in addition the protocol was repeated using rna protect to keep the stability of the rna the pellet kept at 80 c was subjected to dna extraction using the fastdna spin kit for soil and the fastprep machine mp biomedicals usa following the protocol described by the manufacturer with slight modifications dna pools were suspended in 150 μl of deionized and sterile milliq water the rna extraction was done using the fastrna blue kit mp biomedical

the reads were subjected to a quality trimming to remove sequences with more than 8 homopolymers and any ambiguous base 30 next it was calculated the sequences unique which were aligned using needleman conditions against silva seed v132 database then the sequences that did not align in the correct forward and reverse position were removed the chimerical reads were detected using the vsearch algorithm using themselves as reference 31 the high quality reads were classified using the silva nr database through k nearest neighbor method with k mer size 8 bp then the remaining contigs were clustered into operational taxonomic units with a similarity cutoff of 97 2 7 statistical analyses similarity and diversity the similarities analyses were based on conventional and compositional statistics the conventional statistics allows us to calculate the similarity percentage analysis simper referred to as the contribution of operational taxonomic units otus that promote the dissimilarity between samples based on the temperature the presence or absence of drugs and total and active microbial community the simper analysis was calculated using the dominant otu table transformed to center logarithm trough bray curtis algorithm similarity using the software past v3 4 hierarchical clustering analysis of total and metabolically active bacteria communities were used to estimate the clustering by paired groups using the bray curtis algorithm with 999 bootstraps in the past v3 4 software in addition a non metric mds was calculated to understand the influence area for dna and cdna samples using the otu table transformed to center the logarithm ratio the compositional statistics allows us to capture all diversity of dna and cdna samples including the rare phylotypes first the otu tables were corrected to avoid zero values using zcomposition package s bayesian algorithm implemented in r project software then the corrected otu table was centered and log ratio transformed using codapack software finally the transformed otu distributions were used to calculate the singular decomposition values 32 the compositional statistics was employed to estimate the expected effect size ees and the principal component analysis pca to calculate the differential abundance of otus between the reactors at low and high temperature and the presence or absence the drugs the expected effect size was analyzed the α diversity and β diversity analysis were calculated for microbial community studied in dna and cdna using the software past v3 4 the α diversity indices were calculated to estimate the species richness diversity and evenness on the other hand the β diversity index valued the differences between pair of samples from the whittaker index 2 8 multivariate redundancy analysis multivariate redundancy analysis was calculated to estimate the relations linked between total and active microbial community and the key parameters for treatment process thus the data of the microbial community and physico chemical performances were transformed to centered log the selected total and active microbial community for the calculations were the otus with 1 50 of total relative abundance of each biological samples for physico chemical analysis were included the values of cod removal bod5 removal total nitrogen removal ammonium removal nitrate nitrite and ammonium concentration in the effluent and on the other hand the mlss settling velocity and mean size of granules the analyses were computed using 999 monte carlo simulations under a full permutation model running in the software canoco 4 5 for windows 68 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment performance of the reactors the chemical performance of aerobic granular reactors were evaluated by means of cod bod5 and inorganic nitrogen compounds in fig 1 it is shown the physic chemical performance of all bioreactors for cod reactors at high and low temperature treating phcs had slightly better removal efficiency until operational day 100 however it is important to mention that at high temperature the rate was almost similar to the control reactor from operational day 70 while at a low temperature the cod removal ratio was lower until operational day 140 this could be caused by the difficulties of the microbial community to removing the organic matter at low temperatures and in the presence of antimicrobial compounds this is likely because the bacteria community need more time to reach acclimatization ab halim et al 33 mentioned that operational temperatures affected the aerobic granular sludge reactors because they reach steady states at different stages during the cultivation period the cod trend showed regardless of operational temperature after 140 days of experimentation the removal ratio was similar for reactors operated at 7 c and 26 c 92 this fact pointed out microbial communities in granular sludge used as inoculum were acclimatized to higher or lower temperatures in this sense the results showed the success of inoculum adaption to mild temperatures for the start up of ags systems located in places ranging from 7 c to 26 c essentially following the premise described by ab halim et al 33 aerobic granular sludge indicates that the long term operation could take place keeping the excellent biological activity during the degradation process at different temperatures however it is common that the biological systems need longer time frames for the acclimatization stage when the environment presents substantial changes in comparison with the inoculum the bod5 determination was evaluated in the four bioreactors during the whole experiment no significant differences were found between reactors operated at low or high temperature for biodegradable organic matter but during the start up stage the reactors amended with phcs had slight detriment on bod5 from operational days 20 to 40 the ltr p reactor discarded effluent with higher bod5 at operational day 20 while the htr p showed this same trend at operational day 40 these results suggested that ltr p suffered more instability and difficulties to remove biodegradable organic matter than the reactor at high temperature largely due to the effect of phcs being less damping the nitrogen removal ratio was a key parameter for the operation of an aerobic granular sludge reactor given by the advantages of nitrification denitrification processes promoting the granular sludge the spherical morphology and high density allowed to reach excellent results for nitrogen removal ratio at low and high temperatures regardless of the fact that some authors have reported negative effects on nitrogen degradation at temperature below 10 c 34 certainly higher total nitrogen removal ratios were found in the reactor operated at 26 c with and without phcs reaching values higher than 90 of total nitrogen removal contrary the ltr reactors showed values close to 80 a trivial difference was determined in reactors treating phcs at this point it could be suggested that both temperature and the presence of drugs affected the nitrogen removal ratio of aerobic granular sludge technology however if these results are compared with other studies that used sludge previously adapted to temperature the results do not differ for example muñoz palazon et al 15 observed values in the range of 80 90 of nitrogen removal ratio in reactors operated at 15 c 3 2 physical determination of granular sludge the biomass was analyzed by the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids mean size and settling time of granular sludge particle size is an important feature of ags because it has a significant influence not only on its settle ability but also on the mass transfer behavior related to nutrients and oxygen transport along the granular structure 35 temperature in biological systems affects the biomass in the reactors this fact is well known in biological treatments and also in aerobic granular sludge reactors 9 20 21 the results of particle diameter showed that it did not produce the breakage of the granules at low and high temperature neither in the presence of drugs mixture during the whole operation in htr p and htr c the granular size increased from 1 00 mm of inoculum used to 1 70 2 22 mm at the end of experiment and granules were compact and robust fig 2 likewise in ltr p and ltr c the granular particles exhibited oscillations during operation during the first 60 days of operation the granules decreased in size after this period the size increased until having average values of 0 98 0 32 mm a fact shared by the reactors treating drugs was that the mean size of the granules was larger than in the reactors used as control wang et al 36 described an increase in the production of extracellular polymeric substances in the presence of these chemical compounds pointing out a greater aggregation of the particles and greater size the granular sludge settleability was improved gradually along the experiment presumably because the microorganisms that conformed the granules were accommodating to the new operational temperature the biomass belonging to low temperature reactors settled faster but ltrs had remarkable oscillations contrary the reactors operated at high temperature showed a progressive increase trend over operational time the results of settleability suggested that the selection of floc forming microorganisms adapted at low temperatures were more effective by the pressure exerted in these conditions this agrees with the previous research conducted by muñoz palazon et al 20 21 actually the settle ability was slightly slower in reactors amended with pharmaceutical compounds than in reactors treating wastewater without drugs for both low and high temperatures the settling velocity ranged between 100 m h 1 to 120 m h 1 the concentrations of mlss decreased sharply at the beginning due to the wash out of excess microorganisms and then increased gradually until it remained steady state the mlss concentration was higher in the reactor operated at 26 c even in reactor treating drugs with values around 2500 3000 mg mlss l 1 although the steady state in high temperature reactors treating pharmaceutical compounds need approximately 120 days to reach the stable concentration therefore the capacity of growing biomass was depleted under phcs presence related to the low temperature reactors the concentration at the end of the operation was almost 2500 mg mlss l 1 3 3 treatment of drugs by ags in sbr at 7 c and 26 c the trend analyzed in the effluent of the reactors htr p and ltr p were opposite fig 3 in general the reactor operated at 7 c showed serial oscillations in the concentration of phcs this tendency could be explained by the absorption desorption phenomenon which occurred mainly with the carbamazepine and naproxen this bio adsorption phenomenon had been described previously in ags by several authors 37 38 in fact it is still difficult to elucidate which is the biotransformation biodegradation or bioadsorption rate by granules taking into account the amount of phcs that are not discharged into the effluent based on removal efficiency although great efforts are being made to quantify the ratio for each of these processes in ags technology there are few gaps linked to the complexity of granular biofilm 39 40 the htr p gradually increased the removal capacity without instability period possibly due to the fact that phcs had higher solubility in the water and subsequently the drugs were available for the microorganism s consumption the phcs removal ratio in the reactor at 26 c was increasing during operation time especially remarkable for diclofenac trimethoprim and carbamazepine the most recalcitrant compound was the naproxen at both temperatures actually the naproxen usually has negative removal efficiencies 41 these negative values can be explained by deconjugation of glucuronidase or sulphated phcs and desorption from particles or hydrolysis of some compounds for example hydrolysis of acetylsalicylic acid to salicylic acid these effects have been observed in several phcs of different therapeutic classes in particular for diclofenac ibuprofen carbamazepine estrone and loperamide 42 44 related to trimethoprim the ags reactors had biodegraded bio transformed or and bio adsorbed in highly efficiency ways this fact could propose an important advantage of this technology against conventional activated sludge which could remove only 20 45 because trimethoprim was highly resistant to degradation in wastewater treatment plants 46 thus the compact biofilm of ags would promote longer contact of cells with trimethoprim keep in the external layer for a gradually degradation and increases the biotransformation of a number of phcs compared to as 47 48 mendes barros et al 49 described low capacities of ags systems to remove trimethoprim with an anoxic period implemented 1 5 h therefore it could be assumed that the aerobic conditions promote the reduction of trimethoprim in the effluent actually most of the technologies implemented to degrade trimethoprim are based on physio chemical processes 50 51 with the economical and energetic disadvantages that these methods present versus biological treatments 3 4 quantitative pcr study the absolute detection of target bacterial genes in the granular sludge is shown in fig 4 the storage granular sludge used as inoculum showed a magnitude order of 107 108 for 16s rrna bacterial gene on operational day 1 regardless of temperature and presence of phcs there were no significant changes in the microbial population for the first 24 h on the next sampling day a remarkable increase was detected for all bioreactors but the tendency was more pronounced in ltrs and even more in reactors supplemented with phcs moreover the qpcr showed this trend for all experimentation time because the ltr p reactor achieved 1012 copies per gram of granules followed by the ltr c with 1011 copies therefore the high temperature reactor tracked the same predisposition the ags treating phcs had a higher number of copies than the control reactor these results could suggest that the temperature and phcs exerted a pressure which increased the microorganism s concentration in grams of granules eps segregation could be scarcer in adverse conditions in comparison to ags operated at 26 c as kinetics models demonstrated 52 the ammonia oxidation bacteria were detected by the amoa gene and the trend was completely opposite to the total bacterial gene because the absence of phcs in the influent and the high temperature had a positive repercussion on the number of ammonia oxidizing bacteria 106 gene copies gram granule 1 while the smallest quantification was detected in ltr p with two magnitude order less the amoa gene had deep sensibility and affection by the phcs fact previously mentioned by muñoz palazon et al 20 additionally temperatures below 10 c supported a sturdy stress to nitrifiers bacteria and the nitrification process in wwtps such as reported gnida et al 34 this corroborates the results obtained by the amoa qpcr analysis the high temperature had a positive effect on the proliferation of denitrifying bacteria analyzed by the nosz i gene with respect to the inoculum the number of copies of nosz i were variable during operational time but in general the phcs did not have strong effects on the denitrifiers the number of nosz i genes copies in reactors at low temperatures ranged from 105 to 106 copies gram of granules 1 while ags reactors at high temperature had 108 to 109 copies gram 1 during the first 15 days in htrs the denitrifiers increased but from operational day 90 it was noticed a detriment in the reactor treating phcs because the number of copies decreased to 107 copies gram 1 these results suggest that high temperatures promote the denitrification process but are affected under the presence of phcs 3 5 total and metabolically active microbial community during the start up and stable phases of ags technology 3 5 1 taxonomic composition of total microbial communities the relative abundance of some otus were significantly influenced by the temperature on the first week of operation in this way the granular biomass of reactors ltr c and ltr p were quickly colonized by a otu belonging to the flavobacteriaceae family fig 5 this otu004 decreased over the operational time in the reactor fed with pharmaceutical compounds but the other flavobacteriaceae otu proliferated at operational day 120 in that sense otu004 kept the dominance of the low temperature control reactor with slight oscillations until operational day 120 in both low temperature reactors from operational day 120 the dominance in the system changed drastically because the ltr p promoted the genera that belonged to flavobacterium 41 and pedobacter 27 flavobacterium spp had developed numerous adaptation mechanisms which allowed it to survive in cold and extreme habitats 53 one of the adaptations found in this genus was the modification of fatty acid cell membranes 53 it had been described that flavobacterium species adapt to cold environments at low temperatures and produce more types of major fatty acids than other genera composing unsaturated and branched fatty acids 53 in addition changes in the membrane could be interconnected with the high extracellular polymeric substances eps production eps segregation is essential for stability of granules świątczak cydzik kwiatkowska 54 reported the key role of flavobacterium in the eps production and suggested the involvement on the granulation as structural microorganisms as well as eps protecting bacteria against toxic compounds 55 on the other hand cui et al 13 had described the increase of flavobacterium in terms of relative abundance in ags systems that treat antibiotics blunt et al 46 described the presence of antibiotic resistant genes and intrinsic resistance to pharmaceutical compounds 56 moreover the high eps production of this genus could promote the adsorption of phcs finally it is essential to mention the denitrifying and phosphorous accumulation ability of the flavobacteriaceae family 57 the second most abundant genus in the ltr p was pedobacter which is widely known for having antibiotic resistant genes and proliferation abilities under high toxic conditions 58 in fact pedobacter spp are considered environmental superbugs due to their resistance to four classes of antibiotics as well as having a large arsenal of antibiotic resistant genes 59 the acclimatization of this phylotype to this antibiotic at cold temperatures 7 c was observed in this study in the reactor operated at cold temperatures supplemented with phcs it was commonly observed the proliferation of flavobacterium and pedobacter because both have psychrophilic adaptation mechanisms this is not surprising because they have been reported in ultra cold environments in other studies 53 60 the bacterial dynamics in ltr c showed the proliferation of the cytophagaceae family as well as the acholeplasma genus the results suggested that the hypothesis of affection generated by the low temperature was more pronounced than the pressure exerted by the presence of phcs in the microbial communities however the maturation of the systems under different influent compositions modified the dominance and abundance of the most representative phylotypes at the start up stage the ags reactors that were operated at high temperatures followed a completely dissimilar trend to the ltr reactors the presence of phcs in the influent did not affect sharply to the microbial community at the end of operation because two otus taxonomically affiliated to leadbetterella were dominant in both systems thus it is relevant to point out that the selection of granular forming bacteria was influenced mainly by the temperature certainly during temperature adaption the microbial community followed different developments depending on influent composition in the influent supplemented with phcs proteiniphilum and flavobacterium genera acquired dominance in populations as it was mentioned before that there were several strains described with high multi resistance capacity 59 while in the htr c it was mainly controlled by several otus belonging to leadbetterella even so at the end of experimentation on htr c flavobacteriaceae chitinophagaceae families and parcubacteria genus were determinate with high relative abundance 5 00 3 5 2 dynamics of metabolically active microbial communities the total and metabolically active communities showed differences mainly in terms of relative abundance fig 6 the ltr c showed a community dominated by otu004 belonging to the flavobacteriaceae family during the first 60 days while acholeplasma genus and the cytophagaceae family increased in activity at the end of the operation major differences were found between the total and metabolically active community in the ltr p the flavobacteriaceae family was highly represented reaching 10 00 of relative abundance as the high diversity over the operational time was palpable by the proliferation of clostriadiales flavobacterium leadbetterella macellibacteroides cytophagaceae and acholeplasma the htr reactors reflected similar results to the total bacterial populations with the most representative genera being leadbetterella in both the control and supplemented with phcs in this way the study of both microbial communities allowed us to define more a more precise community that carried out the degradation process wang et al 36 described the role and abundance of leadbetterella in the presence of tetracycline and suggested the potential role of degradation to antibiotics in addition it is possible that the optimum adaptation of this phylotype to high temperatures while at low temperatures it could not compete against other species thus leadbetterella was probably related with granulation and resilience to shock loading and toxins under high temperature as corroborated by zhang et al 61 in biological system operated at 30 2 c 3 6 statistical analysis the calculated indices are summarized in table s1 for metabolically active bacterial communities and in table s2 for total bacterial communities for 16s rrna communities the average values of chao index for ltr p described low species diversity 115 to 539 while shannon evenness and simpson evidenced a medium high functional evenness of the bacterial community the ltr c showed higher species richness 226 to 1453 but the evenness and diversity reflected by the indices were lower than in drug presence this could be caused by the competition of bacteria population in the presence of phcs 62 on the other hand the reactors operated at high temperatures showed higher species richness values in general but in the reactor containing phcs it was even higher following the same route as ltr p in general the α diversity indices of the reactor amended with phcs showed a loss of species richness diversity and evenness in conclusion the species richness at low temperatures was lower than at high temperature but on the contrary low temperature promoted the diversity and evenness possibly caused by the competitions of phylotypes not well adapted however at high temperatures the phylotypes found a better niche to compete for the substrate additionally these results could be corroborated by the analysis of the metabolically active bacterial community described in section 3 5 2 the α diversity studies for the total bacterial communities reflected the same affinity although in general the species richness and diversity were higher than in active bacteria table s2 the β diversity index for total and metabolically active bacterial communities were shown in fig s2 no common patterns were found in the bioreactors during operational time however it was very interesting to estimate that the total microbial community showed a greater difference between the metabolically active community thus the results could be corroborated that not all phylotypes played a role in the degradation processes or granular stability and the rare phylotypes only related to the total bacterial communities the similarity percentage analysis simper was used to investigate the contribution to the dominant otus 1 00 of relative abundance between the groups of samples differentiated by the temperature and pressure exerted by phcs in influent fig s3 furthermore the analysis was calculated for total and metabolically active microbial communities for the reactors operated at low temperatures the bacterial communities of 16s rrna and 16s rdna were basically different by the contribution of otu003 otu004 otu011 otu013 and otu015 they were taxonomically affiliated with cytophagaceae flavobacteriaceae family and flavobacterium genus mainly due to these otus proliferated in the bioreactor treated with phcs while otu004 was dominant in the htr c during the whole operation furthermore the otu030 contributed more than 5 00 dissimilarity between these samples which belonged to the pedobacter genus achieving a 30 00 relative abundance in the 16s rdna study for ltr p the contribution to dissimilarities between the rest of samples htrp htrc ltrp htrp ltrc htrc followed a remarkable trend because otu001 and otu002 both were affiliated with the leadbetterella genus which was the genus most represented over the whole operational time at high temperatures within the high temperature reactors the operational taxonomic units were different more specifically the ltrs operating with and without drugs showed significant dissimilarities in otu004 otu005 otu007 and otu008 and were taxonomically affiliated with flavobacteriaceae parcubacteria proteiniphilum and acholeplasma respectively although these phylotypes had presence in both reactors the selection and proliferation followed different evolutions few remarkable tendencies were found for parcubacteria which was more representative in the reactor amended with phcs for the pair of sample reactors amended with drugs at high and low temperatures the most abundant otus previously mentioned otu001 otu002 otu003 otu004 otu00 and otu007 added more dissimilarities analysis indicated that the adaptation of microbial community to toxic compounds was strongly related to temperature the pcoa plot could be separated into two clusters 1 the ags reactors operated at high temperature and 2 the ags reactors operated at low temperature however there was a shorter distance marked by samples of reactors supplemented with phcs at low temperatures day 1 and day 180 and at high temperature day 15 which revealed certain similarities fig 7 the active microbiome samples followed the same trend even so these results made remarkable definitively the pressure exerted by the operational temperature on the microbial community as reported by muñoz palazon et al 20 21 the reactor operated at high temperatures showed relatively close samples at operational day 180 denoting the high similarities found on the microbiome once the system was steady state despite the presence of phcs nevertheless for low temperature reactors the trend was completely opposite the samples at operational day 180 showed larger distances between them thus the bacterial populations at low temperatures suffered deep changes when treated with wastewater containing high amounts of anti inflammatory antiepileptic and antibiotic compounds these results suggest that the spectrum of degraded organic matter nitrogen phosphorous or toxic compounds is more selective for bacteria populations at low temperatures 7 c than at high temperature 26 c which could be caused by the mechanisms to survive at cold temperatures 63 this statistical and phylogenetic analyses allowed to suggest that ags technology could be implemented for treating wastewater with high contain of phcs at higher temperatures than in extreme low environment due to the adaptation of microbial communities furthermore the non metric mds analysis based on bray curtis distance showed two big and clear clusters corroborating the data predicted by the pcoa fig s4 in addition more information provided by the non metric mds were the large distances found in the samples of the reactors treating pharmaceutical compounds over operational time 55 while shorter distance was observed in control reactors regardless of temperature thus these results suggested that temperature is a key parameter for degradation in the microbial community but the presence of phcs triggered drastic changes in the populations the compositional statistics allowed us to calculate the expected effect size ees which estimate the number of otus that contribute significantly to differences between the pair of samples with values higher than 1 or smaller than 1 the ees is shown in fig s5 which reflected that the biggest differences were detected in the systems operated at different temperatures supporting the hypothesis previously described by the pcoa and non metric mds analyses these results reported that the bacterial population of reactors were mostly conditioned by operational temperatures than the supplementation of phcs in the influent these results were described by the studies previously carried out by muñoz palazon et al 20 21 several multivariate redundancy analyses rdas plots showed the relationship between physic chemical performance and the total and metabolically active bacterial communities in the fig 8 the rda parameters studied on reactor ltr p showed an increased in the chemical performance and granular characterization that correlated positively with the operational days day 90 day 120 and day 180 for both total fig 8a and active metabolically bacteria fig 8b there was a negative correlation with the nitrate and nitrite production with the maximum performance and with the stability of the reactor the no3 and no2 were positively and strongly correlated with the biological samples of start up in this reactor otu013 and otu030 affiliated to flavobacterium and pedobacter were the only bacteria that were positively and closely linked with bod5 removal cod removal total nitrogen removal ammonium oxidation and mlss concentration pedobacter had been isolated from nitrifying sludge inoculum 64 and was suggested to play a role in the nitrification process on the other hand flavobacterium could remove nitrogen through simultaneously heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification 65 both bacteria are heterotrophic and have been identified in psychrophilic environments 53 66 the hypothesis is that otu013 and otu030 were psychrotolerant and multidrug resistant bacteria that were able to degrade the organic matter while also carrying out the simultaneous process of nitrification denitrification the results of the total and metabolically active bacteria showed similar patterns for biological samples performance and relationship with bacteria however for the active community only a few phylotypes were identified with positive linking roles to physic chemical performance being otu028 and otu069 taxonomically affiliated to porphyromonadaceae family and dyadobacter genus the rda linked the total bacteria with physic chemical performance and biological samples in the reactor lrt c showed high disparity in terms of correlations because almost each parameter was linked with a otu these results reflected despite the low temperature the bacterial community had more diversity in absence of chemical with antimicrobial activity it was of importance that a strong positive correlation existed between otu001 and otu034 and the bod5 rem granular size the second important linked was the otu003 and otu009 with the nitrogen removal cycles and the third was the otu006 linking with cod rem mlss and settleability the otu009 and otu006 belonged to cytophagaceae family which is widely known to be bacteria involved in nitrification and also such as nitrogen incorporating bacteria in wwtps 67 these patterns were not found in the rda with metabolically active bacterial community in this sense only the otu003 otu006 otu009 and otu034 were correlated positively and strongly with bod5 removal while the cod removal mlss granular properties and nitrogen removal were very weakly correlated the multivariate redundancy analysis was also calculated for the reactor at warm temperature amended with drugs fig 8e f and without drugs fig 8g h for the htr p the negative correlation of the total dominant otus with performance suggested that despite the high diversity with the presence of drugs the bacteria able to work in a stressful condition were the otu001 and otu006 belonging to leadbetterella and the cytophagaceae family reflected the rda linking the metabolically active bacteria with physico chemical performance it was mentioned before the well known role that the cytophagaceae family plays for nitrogen removal in wwtps the results suggested that despite the high diversity the bacteria were not able to degrade compounds in the presence of pharmaceuticals because they inhibited the microbial activity these results could be compared with the rda for reactor hrt c without drugs where each one was linked with some parameter that contributes to the correct functioning of the bioreactor actually the rda for total and metabolically active bacteria were similar the settle velocity and mean granular size were positively correlated with otu017 and negatively correlated with nitrite nitrate and ammonium concentration in the effluent these results corroborated that denser and bigger granules promote the nitrification and denitrification process on the other hand the otu014 was correlated with high nitrogen removal ratios these bacteria belonged to the ns9 marine group which had been described in ags 20 4 conclusions aerobic granular sludge technology is able to treat pharmaceuticals in an efficient way at high temperatures 26 c after an adaptation process while at low temperatures the oscillations in the values reflected the bioadsorption desorption process and then phcs were spread to the aquatic environment the microbial community within the granules were mainly determinate by the operational temperature and not so much for the presence of toxic compounds the treatment of phcs did not affect the optimum removal ratio in terms of bod5 and cod 90 and nitrogen removal 85 additionally the system could be implemented at different latitudes the absolute quantification showed higher concentration of target genes at low temperature possibly caused by the lower eps production in the same way it could be observed in the bigger granule size in reactors at high temperatures this corroborates the previous results leadbetterella was the most dominant bacteria at high temperature while flavobacterium represented the system at low temperatures credit authorship contribution statement b m p methodology software formal analysis investigation data curation writing
