21425,the second order hydrodynamic force and response of an elastic body in bichromatic waves are studied by using higher order boundary element method hobem to solve the boundary value problem the free surface wave green function is adopted in the boundary integral equation and the discretization is conducted by quadratic shape function in the boundary condition the normal vector variation on the body surface is re defined to consider both rigid and elastic body motions it is invoked especially for the derivation of second order body boundary condition and several generalized forces in zero forward speed condition in the second order quantities the second order velocity potential force is obtained by using indirect formulation in the generalized mode and the contribution of each component is investigated the validation for the second order forces is first conducted by comparing with published data the excitation force on the rigid body motion of a hemisphere is calculated and showed a good agreement with other semi analytic and numerical results using simplified structural model several vertical bending modes of an elastic hemisphere are considered as a numerical test second order hydrodynamic force and response for the two node vertical bending are obtained and properties of second order quantities are confirmed keywords hydroelasticity quadratic transfer function qtf higher order boundary element method hobem generalized mode method perturbation method springing 1 introduction the investigation on the hydroelastic response of large vessels has been conducted by many organizations as the result it has been confirmed that the effect of high frequency vibration should be considered in the design of the hull girder of ships kaminisk and rigo 2018 slamming induced whipping and springing are representative phenomena among hydroelastic responses whipping is transient phenomenon induced by impact loads on the other hands the springing is a resonant vibration excited by harmonic incoming waves springing has been investigated due to the effect on the fatigue strength of a ship it could not only happen at natural frequency of vibration but also 1 n of it by non linear wave components several experiments have shown the existence of higher order springing in waves and it has been confirmed at various types of a ship e g storhaug 2007 miyake et al 2008 hong and kim 2014 the non linear fluid structure interaction should be considered for the analysis of non linear springing but the numerical method has not been fully developed and relatively less conducted numerical study on the springing of a ship has been one of classical topics in naval architecture bishop and price 1979 calculated linear hydrodynamic force and response of the elastic vessels by using strip theory and finite element method jensen and pedersen 1978 suggested quadratic strip theory which could consider several second order hydrodynamic forces non linear wave loads and responses are also calculated by using timoshenko beam theory using time domain simulation the strip theory is also applied to the analysis of several non linear phenomena e g wu and moan 1996 xia and wang 1997 wu and hermundstad 2002 in particular nonlinear froude krylov and hydrostatic restoring forces incorporated with the contribution from the instantaneous wetted surfaces have been considered recently various kinds of three dimensional codes have been developed and used for the analysis of hydroelastic response of a ship e g malenica et al 2003 iijima et al 2008 kim et al 2009 kashiwagi et al 2015 however these numerical studies are focusing on the linear quantities and non linear analysis has been carried out with some constraints and the hydrodynamic component generally has been ignored in the non linear analysis the non linear wave body interaction has been considered mainly for a stationary marine structure which has only rigid body motion without forward speed it has been commonly performed by two ways first is to use direct time domain simulation such as numerical wave tank nwt based on mixed eulerian lagrangian mel or semi lagrangian scheme e g cointe et al 1990 tanizawa 1995 ferrant 1998 kashiwagi et al 1998 wu and taylor 2003 koo and kim 2004 in numerical wave tank all forces and responses induced by incoming waves are obtained simultaneously at each time step the contribution of different frequency components is calculated by fourier transform after the simulation another way is the application of perturbation scheme in the perturbation theory the physical variables are divided into each order based on the wave slope in the analysis linear and other non linear quantities are separated and obtained by solving different boundary equations in both frequency and time domains in perturbation scheme it seems that the highest order of the analyzed variable is second order for a freely floating body e g kim and yue 1990 lee 1995 choi et al 2000 chen 2005 and third order for fixed body e g faltinsen et al 1995 malenica and molin 1995 teng and kato 2003 mainly due to mathematical and numerical difficulty second order quantities specifically have great importance in the design of off shore structures e g high frequency resonance in the tension leg platforms tlps or station keeping of moored vessels thus various kinds of method to consider second order hydrodynamic force and response have been developed nowadays they are established well in the industrial and academic societies using perturbation scheme based on weakly nonlinear assumption the second order external force of a deformable body has been analyzed in zero forward speed condition by some researchers for instance wu et al 1997 and chen et al 2003 calculated quadratic product forces of an elastic body by transforming the position and normal vectors at regular and irregular waves choi 2004 used generalized mode expansion method to consider the mean drift of an elastic barge and the same scheme is applied to the analysis of a fish cage which is composed of multiple elastic torus choi and yeo 2009 their studies are focusing on the non linear forces obtained from the linear quantities and second order boundary value problem is not considered very large floating structure vlfs is also one of structure which has mainly hydroelastic response its non linear force has been considered by several ways e g namba et al 1999 kashiwagi 2000 utsunomiya et al 2001 watanabe et al 2004 however the rigid body motion or the draft effect on the structure is generally ignored in the analysis recently second order hydrodynamic force which includes second order velocity potential component has been considered for an elastic body choi 2013 used eigen function expansion method to calculate all second order hydrodynamic forces and responses of an elastic bottom mounted vertical cylinder malenica et al 2018 also introduced the numerical scheme to consider second order boundary value problem of an elastic body based on computer code hydrostar although the analysis is focusing on relatively short waves shao and faltinsen 2014 calculated total second order excitation force of a rigid ship model with forward speed and showed that second order velocity potential force is pre dominant heo and kashiwagi 2019 suggested numerical method to calculate second order hydrodynamic force and response of an elastic ship in the monochromatic waves based on direct time domain rankine panel method in this study we address the numerical method to calculate second order hydrodynamic force and response of an elastic body in bichromatic waves several mathematical formulations are described in zero forward speed condition and the application for the numerical simulation is first validated by comparing with rigid body motion results obtained from published data next the flexibility effect on the second order force and response of an elastic body has been considered by using simple geometry and structural model as a numerical test 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 generalized mode method in the analysis of fluid structure interaction the generalized mode expansion method is one of classic ways to consider the hydroelastic response of an elastic body newman 1994 both rigid and elastic body motions could be calculated by extending the total number of response modes the modal function for the elastic response can be obtained by solving eigenvalue problems of several structure solvers such as the beam theory or finite element method fem with satisfied boundary conditions the total displacement is calculated by summation of the mode shape function multiplied by its modal amplitude it is as follows 1 τ i 1 n ξ i h i τ is total displacement ξ i is modal amplitude h i is mode shape n total number of modes 2 2 boundary value problem in the ideal fluid which has irrotational and inviscid properties the velocity potential could be obtained by solving boundary value problem based on the laplace equation provided that bottom and radiation conditions are automatically satisfied free surface and body boundary conditions are only considered in the analysis they are expressed by 2 2 φ t 2 g φ z 2 φ φ t 1 2 φ φ φ on s f 3 φ n n τ on s b in bichromatic waves the first and second order velocity potentials by perturbation scheme are defined in this form 4 φ 1 x t re j φ j 1 x e i ω j t where φ j 1 a j φ s i 1 k 1 n i ω j ξ k 1 φ r k 1 ω j wave frequency s scattering i incident wave r radiation 5 φ 2 re j l φ j l x e i ω j ω l t φ j l x e i ω j ω l t where φ j l sum frequency ω j ω l velocity potential φ j l difference frequency ω j ω l velocity potential for the analysis the second order velocity potential is generally divided into three components e g choi et al 2000 6 φ 2 φ i 2 φ s 2 φ r 2 the incident wave velocity potential could be obtained by analytic solution bowers 1976 and the radiation velocity potential contains generated waves induced by pure second order motions on the other hands the scattering velocity potential includes inhomogeneous component which is made by quadratic product of linear quantities the inhomogeneous term on free surface could be analyzed as the oscillatory added pressure and makes several properties of the second order velocity potential newman 1990 the free surface boundary condition of the scattering velocity potential is written in this form 7 2 φ s 2 t 2 g φ s 2 z q f q f i on z 0 where q f 2 φ 1 φ 1 t 1 g φ 1 t 3 φ 1 t 2 z g 2 φ 1 z 2 q f i non homogeneous component composed of incident wave velocity potentials the approximation of body boundary condition is considered in the generalized mode to apply for the wave body interaction of an elastic body huang and riggs 2000 expressed the normal vector variation of an elastic body by using the concept of continuum mechanics it is defined in this form 8 n d s j f 1 t n d s j is jacobian f is deformation gradient tensor n is initial normal vector n is deformed normal vector ds is deformed surface area and ds is initial surface area the normal vector is directed to fluid domain defined normal vector variation is expanded up to the second order components to invoke the second order body boundary condition it is as follows choi 2004 9 n d s s b o 1 s b 0 o ε s b 0 o ε 2 s b 0 10 o 1 n d s 11 o ε τ 1 n τ 1 t n d s 12 o ε 2 τ 2 γ 2 n τ 2 γ 2 t n τ 1 y τ 1 z τ 1 z τ 1 x τ 1 x τ 1 y n d s where γ 2 is the quadratic product of linear displacement and it becomes second order component of euler angle in case there is no elastic deformation the vector identity between classical and generalized mode forms on a rigid body could be confirmed in heo and kashiwagi 2019 using defined normal vector variation the second order body boundary condition could be obtained in this form 13 φ s 2 n φ i 2 n q b on s b 0 where q b n γ 2 n τ 1 φ 1 τ 1 n τ 1 t n τ 1 φ 1 for the constitution of second order physical variable all linear quantities should be first obtained the linear boundary value problem is solved by using boundary element method in the simulation the integral equation for the velocity potential is defined in this form 14 c p φ s r 1 p s t φ s r 1 q g p q n q d s q s t g p q φ s r 1 q n q d s q where c p solid angle p x y z field point q x y z source point s t entire domain in this equation the free surface wave green function is adopted this function could be originally written by the integral equation and it has several kinds of formulation using eigen function expansion method it could be expressed by the series expansion john 1950 it is as follows 15 g 1 π n 1 k n 2 v h k n 2 v 2 cos k n z h cos k n h cos k n z h cos k n h k 0 k n r i 2 k 0 2 v h k 0 2 v 2 cosh k 0 z h cosh k 0 h cosh k 0 z h cosh k 0 h h 0 k 0 r where k 0 and k n are wave number of propagating and local waves v deep water wave number of propagating wave and it satisfies dispersion relation h water depth k 0 modified bessel function of the second kind h 0 hankel function of the second kind for dispersion relation ω 2 g k 0 tanh k 0 h ω 2 g k n tan k n h n 1 and r x x 2 y y 2 it has been known that the wave green function could make irregular frequency problems thus several field points are distributed inside of the body at the still water level to prevent this problem for the analysis the surface element in the boundary integral is discretized and approximated by using quadratic shape function second order variables include several multiplications of linear variables and it is composed of sum and difference frequencies in bichromatic waves as same with second order velocity potential other all second order quantities are expressed in this form for instance 16 f i 2 q f q b re j l f i q f q b e i ω t f i q f q b e i ω t in this study we are only considering and calculating the sum frequency components for all cases 2 3 the equation of motion to obtain the hydroelastic response the equation of motion should be established in the generalized modes several generalized forces are re defined heo and kashiwagi 2019 there are mainly three generalized forces in the equation of motion and these second order forces are introduced at the following section 2 3 1 generalized hydrodynamic force in the generalized modes the hydrodynamic force at each response mode is defined in this form newman 1994 17 f i s b p h i n d s to calculate generalized hydrodynamic force the inner product between modal function and normal vector should be calculated huang and riggs 2000 calculated inner product up to first order component and derived linear hydrostatic stiffness of an elastic body choi 2004 applied taylor expansion on the mode shape and the second order inner product is obtained with normal vector variation defined in eqs 10 12 in this study the directional derivative for the modal function malenica et al 2003 is expanded up to the second order to derive inner product instead of taking taylor expansion the derived inner product could be expressed up to second order in this form heo and kashiwagi 2019 18 h i n d s s b o 1 s b 0 o ε s b 0 o ε 2 s

pressure on the body surface the second order hydrodynamic force could be approximated it is typically classified into three parts e g kim and yue 1990 22 f i f p s i r i f r e s i f q i the last is quadratic product force composed of only linear quantities it is defined in this form 23 f q i a j a l f q i j l f q i l j 2 24 f q i j l ρ g 2 w l ζ j 1 τ 3 j 1 ζ l 1 τ 3 l 1 h i n 1 n 3 2 d l ρ s b

τ l 1 z τ j 1 z τ l 1 x τ j 1 x τ l 1 y n d s on the other hands other forces are obtained by solving second order boundary value problem and each component means contribution of second order velocity potential and restoring force respectively in particular the second order velocity potential force at each mode is re defined by following generalized formulation 25 f p i i ρ ω s b 0 φ s i h i n d s in this study the second order velocity potential force is calculated by using so called indirect formulation molin 1979 instead of solving second order boundary value problem the new formulation is obtained by applying haskind relation to the second order boundary condition hence the second order velocity potential force is calculated by only linear quantities instead of obtaining eq 25 directly it is as follows 26 f p i i ρ ω s b 0 φ i h i n ψ i φ i n d s i ρ ω s b 0 ψ i q b d s i ρ ω g s f 0 q f q f i ψ i d s where ψ i is assistant velocity potential and it is physically similar with radiation velocity potential this indirect formulation should evaluate both body and free surface integrations which include several inhomogeneous components it can be divided by following two components kim and yue 1990 27 f b b i i ρ ω s b 0 ψ i q b d s 28 f p i f b b i i ρ ω s b 0 h i n φ i ψ i φ i n d s i ρ ω g s f 0 q f q f i ψ i d s in the analysis both integrations have different numerical difficulties respectively at first the body surface integration with inhomogeneous term includes second derivative of unsteady velocity potential it could be directly calculated by using shape function in the higher order boundary element method hobem however in case the geometry of a body is rather complex the accuracy of numerical treatment might be reduced thus the stokes theorem on body surface is used to remove the second derivative term it is as follows 29 s b 0 n ψ i τ j 1 φ l 1 d s s b 0 ψ i τ j 1 φ l 1 n d s s b 0 ψ i φ l 1 τ j 1 n d s s b 0 ψ i φ l 1 τ j 1 n d s w l ψ i φ l 1 τ j 1 t d l where t is tangential vector on the waterline next it is well known that the evaluation of free surface integration is one of the most complex problems in this analysis several methods to evaluate this integration have been suggested in the process of free surface integration there are two common treatments between several researches the first is division of the free surface integration region at a certain distance r s by the existence of local wave components see fig 1 the second is that the integration is conducted analytically provided the physical variable is expressed by the mathematical formulation in this study the near field free surface region is integrated numerically in the free surface boundary condition there is also a second derivative of unsteady velocity potential using 2 dimensional gauss theorem on the free surface as used in kim 1991 second derivative term is removed easily it is as follows 30 s f i n φ j 1 2 φ l 1 z 2 ψ i d s w l r s φ j 1 φ l 1 x n x φ l 1 y n y ψ i d l s f i n φ j 1 x φ l 1 x φ j 1 y φ l 1 y ψ i φ j 1 φ l 1 x ψ i x φ l 1 y ψ i y d s for the integration of free surface far field region we almost followed the process suggested in newman 1991 in the far field region linear velocity potentials are first approximated by using fourier bessel expansion and generalized kochin function b c which is obtained from the velocity potential on the body surface asymptotic formulation of each velocity potential is summarized in this form 31 φ i 1 i g a ω cosh k 0 z h cosh k 0 h n 0 j n k 0 r a n c cos n θ a n s sin n

4 π φ 1 n φ 1 n and σ i 1 4 π ψ i n ψ i n r x 2 y 2 θ tan 1 y x in the far field free surface region the integration region is again divided into two parts i e azimuthal and radial directions as we can see in the asymptotic formulation the velocity potential has only trigonometric functions in azimuthal direction thus the azimuthal direction is integrated by analytic way based on the orthogonal property of trigonometric function newman 1991 the remaining integration which includes triple products of hankel functions for radial direction should be conducted for infinite interval since this integral has oscillating and slowly decaying properties the integrand exists at the very far region from the body thus it is very difficult to evaluate the integration accurately by using numerical method instead of using numerical integral several efficient ways are suggested by some researchers for instance newman 1991 malenica et al 2018 used complex analysis and conducted numerical integration with exponential function obtained in complex region kim and yue 1989 used series expansion based on recurrence relation of fresnel integral chau and eatock taylor 1992 suggested similar approximation method using series expansion which could make minimum error in the analysis choi et al 2000 developed new analytic solution for radial direction after stationary phase approximation for integration of azimuthal direction in this study we also used same series expansion of chau and eatock taylor 1992 at first the hankel function of the second kind is approximated by asymptotic formulation it is as follows 34 h m x 2 π x e i x χ m p 0 i p c m p x p where χ m π 2 m 1 2 and c m 0 1 and c m p 4 m 2 2 p 1 2 8 p c m p 1 using above asymptotic formulation integration which includes triple product of hankel function could be expressed as follows chau and eatock taylor 1992 35 u l m n 2 π k j 2 π k l 2 π k i e i χ l χ m χ n p 0 n l q 0 n m s 0 n n i p q s c l p k 0 j p c

is used as a maximum number and the approximation is conducted on hankel function of the second kind the remained integral is evaluated as follows chau and eatock taylor 1992 choi 2013 36 r s e i k 0 j k 0 l k 0 i r r n 1 2 d r m 1 n γ n m 1 2 γ n 1 2 1 i k 0 j k 0 l k 0 i m e i k 0 j k 0 l k 0 i r s r s n m 1 2 e n where γ is gamma function e n is a truncation error and it is known that the great number n has maximum within k 0 j k 0 l k 0 i r s n if the argument of hankel function is less than bessel order it could have large imaginary value in the integration thus asymptotic form could make an error in this study we did integration numerically by using clenshaw curtis integration until argument of the function is larger than bessel order as a validation test the evaluation of eq 35 the test is conducted on hankel function of the first kind using asymptotic formulation and clenshaw curtis integration is conducted the result is denoted in the table 1 where the integration interval is from 10 to 11 and all wave numbers are 1 0 this table shows that asymptotic expansion has little difference with other results at large bessel order and clenshaw curtis integration has a good agreement in all bessel orders 2 3 2 generalized inertial force the inertial force shows the relation between motion response and body mass in the generalized mode these inertial forces can be re defined as follows heo and kashiwagi 2019 37 f r i v b ρ s h t i τ d v where ρ s structure density h t i is the transformed modal vector for which each position is described at inertial coordinates as same with other forces the non linear inertial force could also be approximated by using perturbation series it is written in the following form 38 f r i v b ρ s h t i 0 h t i 1 τ 1 τ 2 γ 2 d v after collecting all terms the first and second order inertial forces are expressed as follows 39 f r i 1 v b ρ s h t i 0 τ 1 d v 40 f r i 2 v b ρ s h t i 0 τ 2 γ 2 h t i 1 τ 1 d v the linear force and the first term in second order inertial force becomes linear and second order modal mass respectively last two terms in second order force are inhomogeneous components they become cross product of inertia and angular velocity for the rotational motions ogilvie 1983 in the rigid body assumption the vector identity for rotational motion of a rigid body between classical form and generalized mode could be confirmed at heo and kashiwagi 2019 2 3 3 generalized gravity restoring force if a floating body has a rotational motion the gravity performs as a restoring moment thus the body could have the gravity restoring force in case the mode shape has some variations this force could be written in the generalized mode as follows malenica et al 2003 41 f m i g v b ρ s δ h i k d v this can also be expressed up to second order by using perturbation series and the results are written by 42 f m i f m i 1 f m i 2 g v b ρ s δ h i 1 δ h i 2 k d v 43 f m i 1 g v b ρ s h i τ 1 k d v 44 f m i 2 g v b ρ s h i τ 2 h i γ 2 k d v in the linear wave body interaction problem the gravity restoring force is proportional to the displacement and thus it could be included in the restoring stiffness of both rigid and elastic bodies senjanović et al 2008 in the second order gravity restoring force the first term means the force by pure second order displacement and it is also included in the second order hydrostatic restoring coefficient and another term becomes inhomogeneous restoring force 2 3 4 equation of motion in the generalized mode from the newton s equations equation of motion in the generalized mode with structural stiffness due to elastic response could be derived by considering all generalized forces which are described in the previous section the linear and second order equations of motion for the i th response mode are expressed in this form heo and kashiwagi 2019 45 k 1 n m i k 2 t 2 k i k c i k ξ i 1 f i 1 46 k 1 n m i k 2 t 2 k i k c i k ξ i 2 f i 2 v b ρ s 2 t 2 h i γ 2 h t i 1 τ 1 g h i γ 2 k d v where m is modal mass and k is modal stiffness c is hydrostatic restoring coefficient 3 numerical results 3 1 validation test to validate the developed numerical code and formulation in the generalized mode numerical test is conducted for the rigid body motion whose numerical results are obtained by substituting translational mode into modal vector as a numerical model a freely floating hemisphere is adopted the result is compared with semi analytic solution of kim and yue 1990 and another frequency domain solver mlinhydh which is based on free surface green function hobem in the classical formulation choi et al 2000 following mode shape is used to invoke the rigid body motion in generalized mode 47 h 1 i h 2 j h 3 k h 4 i x h 5 j x h 6 k x in this simulation radius of the hemisphere is 1 0 m and boundary radius r s for the division of free surface integration is 10 m at all frequencies the fig 2 shows surge direction second order hydrodynamic forces the f bb is the body surface integration with inhomogeneous term as written in eq 27 and shows the contribution of the body non linearity in the second order velocity potential force f q is the quadratic product of linear quantities described in eq 24 this model has linear heave resonance frequency near va 1 0 the left figure shows that both forces are influenced by the linear heave motion considerably the right figure shows the total second order hydrodynamic force and f p f bb since the contribution of non linear incident wave velocity potential is relatively very small in this result f p f bb means the non linear contribution of the free surface integration in second order velocity potential force this force has relatively large value at high frequency region and a little difference is confirmed with semi analytic solution due to erruptly changing surge velocity potential on free surface as mentioned in choi et al 2000 fig 3 shows same kinds of second order hydrodynamic force for heave direction similar tendency with previous result could be confirmed and overall results show a good agreement each other the second order hydrodynamic force is also calculated in bichromatic waves and it is expressed as quadratic transfer functions qtf fig 4 and fig 5 show quadratic product force f q and body nonlinear component f bb in second order velocity potential force in bichromaitc waves as mentioned before it is shown that the body motion influences body nonlinearity and quadratic product of linear quantities thus these forces are large near resonance frequency region fig 6 is the non linear contribution of the free surface integration f p f bb in the second order velocity potential force it shows that it has relatively large value at high frequency regions we can also confirm that the result at same frequency components are mostly larger than that of different frequencies newman 1990 showed that far field integration of free surface non homogeneous component could make second order velocity potential be slowly attenuated for the depth direction and double frequency components strongly have this property than other sum frequency components in bichromatic waves on the other hands it is known that the difference frequency second order force has totally opposite tendency with sum frequency force the contribution of the free surface integration is very small provided the difference between wave frequencies is not so large considering this property in irregular waves several approximations without free surface integration have been suggested for the calculation of slowly varying hydrodynamic force hauteclocque et al 2012 3 2 numerical test for an elastic body we conducted numerical test for second order force and response of an elastic body using simplified structural model the calculation of hydroelastic response is carried out the freely floating hemisphere is again used as a numerical model and elastic response at different flexural rigidity ei is added on the body motion 3 2 1 structural model euler bernoulli beam equation is used for the analysis of an elastic response from the beam equation the mode shape of the body model is obtained by solving the eigen value problem the homogeneous solution of euler bernoulli beam equation can be readily obtained by assuming the free free end condition and the time harmonic oscillation the final symmetric and anti symmetric mode shapes and their spatial derivatives can be expressed as follows 48 w 2 j 1 2 cos κ 2 j x 2 a cos κ 2 j cosh κ 2

value equation newman 1994 50 1 j tan κ j tanh κ j 0 using derived mode shape from the beam model we used following modal function 51 h 3 j w j h 1 j z w j x h 3 j x w j x the modal mass and stiffness matrices can be obtained from the integration of sectional mass m s in this study the sectional mass and flexural rigidity are assumed constant along the body s length for the simplicity in this case the modal mass and stiffness matrices are expressed in the following form 52 m i j m s a a w i x w j x d x m s a 2 δ i j k i j e i a a 2 w i x x 2 2 w j x x 2 d x e i 2 a 3 κ j 5 4 δ i j for i j 7 in the calculation of second order motion responses three different elastic modes two three four node vertical bendings are considered and inhomogeneous components obtained by hydroelastic response in the right hand sides of eq 46 are not included due to complexity of calculation 3 2 2 second order force and response for two node vertical bending as performed in the previous section we confirmed each component in second order hydrodynamic forces in the elastic model we mainly calculated the hydrodynamic external force for the two node vertical bending mode to conduct numerical test three different values for the flexural rigidity ei are considered the value of flexural rigidity for the model are 1000 1500 2000 nm2 they are artificially determined to confirm the effect of an elastic motion and each case has natural frequency at 1 9 2 6 3 2 rad s for two node vertical bending mode the quadratic product of linear quantities f q and body nonlinear contribution f bb in second order velocity potential force for two node vertical bending are shown in the fig 7 in the low frequency region the resonance of a rigid body motion quite influences to the amplitude of quadratic product force f q on the other hands the body nonlinear contribution f bb in second order velocity potential force has large value near the high frequency resonance region by two node vertical bending mode the left figure in fig 8 shows second order velocity potential force f p for two node vertical bending mode it is almost same with body nonlinear contribution f bb shown in fig 7 it was confirmed that the force for two node vertical bending from the free surface integration f p f bb is relatively quite small in this model in the right figure the total second order hydrodynamic force is finally denoted compared to each quadratic and second order velocity potential force the total second order hydrodynamic force f is decreased at low frequency region and increased at high frequency resonance region due to out of phase and in phase respectively the linear and second order two node vertical bending responses are shown at fig 9 the linear response in the left figure shows different resonance frequency due to changed flexural rigidity and this vibration effect on second order force is confirmed at previous figures in the right figure second order two node vertical bending response shows that it has rather large value at the linear resonance frequency of heave motion as the flexural rigidity increases the second order natural frequency increases and it approaches to 0 8 non dimensional wave number thus the second order response dramatically increases near the second order resonance frequency the same kinds of second order force and response are calculated in bichromatic waves fig 10 shows the quadratic product of linear quantities f q for the two node vertical bending mode as shown in the monochromatic waves the quadratic product force f q has large value near the resonance frequency of rigid body motion rather than resonance of vibration region since this force is influenced by rigid body motion it has relatively large value at the low frequency regions specifically diagonal term in qtf on the other hands the second order velocity potential force f p in fig 11 shows that it is large near high frequency vibration region thus the force is quite changed by the flexural rigidity of a body model since the free surface non linearity part f p f bb is small for two node vertical bending mode of this model the second order velocity potential force follows the tendency of body nonlinear contribution f bb the total second order hydrodynamic force for two node vertical bending f which includes both f q and f p forces is shown in fig 12 it shows that the force has large value near all resonance frequencies as shown in monochromatic wave condition it also seems that f q and f p forces are out of phase at low frequency and in phase at high frequency regions at diagonal term and the total force which has different frequency components is slightly increased compared to each hydrodynamic force as a final result the second order response in bichromatic waves is shown in fig 13 the value is also relatively large near the linear resonance frequency however the effect of the second order resonance of vibration is predominant it is confirmed that the amplitude of second order resonance is extremely large without structural damping near the second order resonance frequency in this numerical model 4 conclusions using higher order boundary element method hobem and perturbation scheme the linear and second order hydrodynamic force and response of an elastic body are calculated for the fluid structure interaction of an elastic body the generalized mode method is adopted in bichromatic wave condition several physical variables such as hydrodynamic force and boundary condition are re defined in the generalized mode among several hydrodynamic forces the generalized second order velocity potential force is calculated by using indirect method and each contribution of body and free surface non linearities is also confirmed using a freely floating hemisphere several kinds of second order force for the rigid body motion is first confirmed as a validation process the result is compared with semi analytic and numerical results obtained from the published data the generalized formulation result shows a good agreement with other classical results the property of second order force for rigid body motion at bichromatic waves is also confirmed as a numerical test of an elastic body simple calculation for the hydroelastic response is conducted using a freely floating elastic hemisphere and simplified euler bernoulli beam model second order force and response for the two node vertical bending mode are calculated as a result the quadratic product force f q has large value near the heave resonance frequency on the other hands second order velocity potential force f p is relatively large at resonance frequencies of elastic body motions unlike rigid body motion result the contribution of free surface non linearity f p f bb in second order velocity potential force is very small for the vertical bending mode in this model thus total second order hydrodynamic force f is relatively large near resonance frequencies of several modes quadratic product force f q and second order velocity potential force f p are generally out of phase at low frequency region and in phase at high frequency regions the second order response is also calculated and it is confirmed that the second order resonance is predominant for the response amplitude credit authorship contribution statement kyeonguk heo writing original draft

21425,the second order hydrodynamic force and response of an elastic body in bichromatic waves are studied by using higher order boundary element method hobem to solve the boundary value problem the free surface wave green function is adopted in the boundary integral equation and the discretization is conducted by quadratic shape function in the boundary condition the normal vector variation on the body surface is re defined to consider both rigid and elastic body motions it is invoked especially for the derivation of second order body boundary condition and several generalized forces in zero forward speed condition in the second order quantities the second order velocity potential force is obtained by using indirect formulation in the generalized mode and the contribution of each component is investigated the validation for the second order forces is first conducted by comparing with published data the excitation force on the rigid body motion of a hemisphere is calculated and showed a good agreement with other semi analytic and numerical results using simplified structural model several vertical bending modes of an elastic hemisphere are considered as a numerical test second order hydrodynamic force and response for the two node vertical bending are obtained and properties of second order quantities are confirmed keywords hydroelasticity quadratic transfer function qtf higher order boundary element method hobem generalized mode method perturbation method springing 1 introduction the investigation on the hydroelastic response of large vessels has been conducted by many organizations as the result it has been confirmed that the effect of high frequency vibration should be considered in the design of the hull girder of ships kaminisk and rigo 2018 slamming induced whipping and springing are representative phenomena among hydroelastic responses whipping is transient phenomenon induced by impact loads on the other hands the springing is a resonant vibration excited by harmonic incoming waves springing has been investigated due to the effect on the fatigue strength of a ship it could not only happen at natural frequency of vibration but also 1 n of it by non linear wave components several experiments have shown the existence of higher order springing in waves and it has been confirmed at various types of a ship e g storhaug 2007 miyake et al 2008 hong and kim 2014 the non linear fluid structure interaction should be considered for the analysis of non linear springing but the numerical method has not been fully developed and relatively less conducted numerical study on the springing of a ship has been one of classical topics in naval architecture bishop and price 1979 calculated linear hydrodynamic force and response of the elastic vessels by using strip theory and finite element method jensen and pedersen 1978 suggested quadratic strip theory which could consider several second order hydrodynamic forces non linear wave loads and responses are also calculated by using timoshenko beam theory using time domain simulation the strip theory is also applied to the analysis of several non linear phenomena e g wu and moan 1996 xia and wang 1997 wu and hermundstad 2002 in particular nonlinear froude krylov and hydrostatic restoring forces incorporated with the contribution from the instantaneous wetted surfaces have been considered recently various kinds of three dimensional codes have been developed and used for the analysis of hydroelastic response of a ship e g malenica et al 2003 iijima et al 2008 kim et al 2009 kashiwagi et al 2015 however these numerical studies are focusing on the linear quantities and non linear analysis has been carried out with some constraints and the hydrodynamic component generally has been ignored in the non linear analysis the non linear wave body interaction has been considered mainly for a stationary marine structure which has only rigid body motion without forward speed it has been commonly performed by two ways first is to use direct time domain simulation such as numerical wave tank nwt based on mixed eulerian lagrangian mel or semi lagrangian scheme e g cointe et al 1990 tanizawa 1995 ferrant 1998 kashiwagi et al 1998 wu and taylor 2003 koo and kim 2004 in numerical wave tank all forces and responses induced by incoming waves are obtained simultaneously at each time step the contribution of different frequency components is calculated by fourier transform after the simulation another way is the application of perturbation scheme in the perturbation theory the physical variables are divided into each order based on the wave slope in the analysis linear and other non linear quantities are separated and obtained by solving different boundary equations in both frequency and time domains in perturbation scheme it seems that the highest order of the analyzed variable is second order for a freely floating body e g kim and yue 1990 lee 1995 choi et al 2000 chen 2005 and third order for fixed body e g faltinsen et al 1995 malenica and molin 1995 teng and kato 2003 mainly due to mathematical and numerical difficulty second order quantities specifically have great importance in the design of off shore structures e g high frequency resonance in the tension leg platforms tlps or station keeping of moored vessels thus various kinds of method to consider second order hydrodynamic force and response have been developed nowadays they are established well in the industrial and academic societies using perturbation scheme based on weakly nonlinear assumption the second order external force of a deformable body has been analyzed in zero forward speed condition by some researchers for instance wu et al 1997 and chen et al 2003 calculated quadratic product forces of an elastic body by transforming the position and normal vectors at regular and irregular waves choi 2004 used generalized mode expansion method to consider the mean drift of an elastic barge and the same scheme is applied to the analysis of a fish cage which is composed of multiple elastic torus choi and yeo 2009 their studies are focusing on the non linear forces obtained from the linear quantities and second order boundary value problem is not considered very large floating structure vlfs is also one of structure which has mainly hydroelastic response its non linear force has been considered by several ways e g namba et al 1999 kashiwagi 2000 utsunomiya et al 2001 watanabe et al 2004 however the rigid body motion or the draft effect on the structure is generally ignored in the analysis recently second order hydrodynamic force which includes second order velocity potential component has been considered for an elastic body choi 2013 used eigen function expansion method to calculate all second order hydrodynamic forces and responses of an elastic bottom mounted vertical cylinder malenica et al 2018 also introduced the numerical scheme to consider second order boundary value problem of an elastic body based on computer code hydrostar although the analysis is focusing on relatively short waves shao and faltinsen 2014 calculated total second order excitation force of a rigid ship model with forward speed and showed that second order velocity potential force is pre dominant heo and kashiwagi 2019 suggested numerical method to calculate second order hydrodynamic force and response of an elastic ship in the monochromatic waves based on direct time domain rankine panel method in this study we address the numerical method to calculate second order hydrodynamic force and response of an elastic body in bichromatic waves several mathematical formulations are described in zero forward speed condition and the application for the numerical simulation is first validated by comparing with rigid body motion results obtained from published data next the flexibility effect on the second order force and response of an elastic body has been considered by using simple geometry and structural model as a numerical test 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 generalized mode method in the analysis of fluid structure interaction the generalized mode expansion method is one of classic ways to consider the hydroelastic response of an elastic body newman 1994 both rigid and elastic body motions could be calculated by extending the total number of response modes the modal function for the elastic response can be obtained by solving eigenvalue problems of several structure solvers such as the beam theory or finite element method fem with satisfied boundary conditions the total displacement is calculated by summation of the mode shape function multiplied by its modal amplitude it is as follows 1 τ i 1 n ξ i h i τ is total displacement ξ i is modal amplitude h i is mode shape n total number of modes 2 2 boundary value problem in the ideal fluid which has irrotational and inviscid properties the velocity potential could be obtained by solving boundary value problem based on the laplace equation provided that bottom and radiation conditions are automatically satisfied free surface and body boundary conditions are only considered in the analysis they are expressed by 2 2 φ t 2 g φ z 2 φ φ t 1 2 φ φ φ on s f 3 φ n n τ on s b in bichromatic waves the first and second order velocity potentials by perturbation scheme are defined in this form 4 φ 1 x t re j φ j 1 x e i ω j t where φ j 1 a j φ s i 1 k 1 n i ω j ξ k 1 φ r k 1 ω j wave frequency s scattering i incident wave r radiation 5 φ 2 re j l φ j l x e i ω j ω l

divided into three components e g choi et al 2000 6 φ 2 φ i 2 φ s 2 φ r 2 the incident wave velocity potential could be obtained by analytic solution bowers 1976 and the radiation velocity potential contains generated waves induced by pure second order motions on the other hands the scattering velocity potential includes inhomogeneous component which is made by quadratic product of linear quantities the inhomogeneous term on free surface could be analyzed as the oscillatory added pressure and makes several properties of the second order velocity potential newman 1990 the free surface boundary condition of the scattering velocity potential is written in this form 7 2 φ s 2 t 2 g φ s 2 z q f q f i on z 0 where q f 2 φ 1 φ 1 t 1 g φ 1 t 3 φ 1 t 2 z g 2 φ 1 z 2 q f i non homogeneous component composed of incident wave velocity potentials the approximation of body boundary condition is considered in the generalized mode to apply for the wave body interaction of an elastic body huang and riggs 2000 expressed the normal vector variation of an elastic body by using the concept of continuum mechanics it is defined in this form 8 n d s j f 1 t n d s j is jacobian f is deformation gradient tensor n is initial normal vector n is deformed normal vector ds is deformed surface area and ds is initial surface area the normal vector is directed to fluid domain defined normal vector variation is expanded up to the second order components to invoke the second order body boundary condition it is as follows choi 2004 9 n d s s b o 1 s b 0 o ε s b 0 o ε 2 s b 0 10 o 1 n

euler angle in case there is no elastic deformation the vector identity between classical and generalized mode forms on a rigid body could be confirmed in heo and kashiwagi 2019 using defined normal vector variation the second order body boundary condition could be obtained in this form 13 φ s 2 n φ i 2 n q b on s b 0 where q b n γ 2 n τ 1 φ 1 τ 1 n τ 1 t n τ 1 φ 1 for the constitution of second order physical variable all linear quantities should be first obtained the linear boundary value problem is solved by using boundary element method in the simulation the integral equation for the velocity potential is defined in this form 14 c p φ s r 1 p s t φ s r 1 q g p q n q d s q s t g p q φ s r 1 q n q d s q where c p solid angle p x y z field point q x y z source point s t entire domain in this equation the free surface wave green function is adopted this function could be originally written by the integral equation and it has several kinds of formulation using eigen function expansion method it could be expressed by the series expansion john 1950 it is as follows 15 g 1 π n 1 k n 2 v h k n 2 v 2 cos k n z h cos k n h cos k n z h cos k n h k 0 k n r i 2 k 0 2 v h k 0 2 v 2 cosh k 0 z h cosh k 0 h cosh k 0 z h cosh k 0 h h 0 k 0 r where k 0 and k n are wave number of propagating and local waves v deep water wave number of propagating wave and it satisfies dispersion

has been known that the wave green function could make irregular frequency problems thus several field points are distributed inside of the body at the still water level to prevent this problem for the analysis the surface element in the boundary integral is discretized and approximated by using quadratic shape function second order variables include several multiplications of linear variables and it is composed of sum and difference frequencies in bichromatic waves as same with second order velocity potential other all second order quantities are expressed in this form for instance 16 f i 2 q f q b re j l f i q f q b e i ω t f i q f q b e i ω t in this study we are only considering and calculating the sum frequency components for all cases 2 3 the equation of motion to obtain the hydroelastic response the equation of motion should be established in the generalized modes several generalized forces are re defined heo and kashiwagi 2019 there are mainly three generalized forces in the equation of motion and these second order forces are introduced at the following section 2 3 1 generalized hydrodynamic force in the generalized modes the hydrodynamic force at each response mode is defined in this form newman 1994 17 f i s b p h i n d s to calculate generalized hydrodynamic force the inner product between modal function and normal vector should be calculated huang and riggs 2000 calculated inner product up to first order component and derived linear hydrostatic stiffness of an elastic body choi 2004 applied taylor expansion on the mode shape and the second order inner product is obtained with normal vector variation defined in eqs 10 12 in this study the directional derivative for the modal function malenica et al 2003 is expanded up to the second order to derive inner product instead of taking taylor expansion the derived inner product could be expressed up to second order in this form heo and kashiwagi 2019 18 h i n d s s b o 1 s b 0 o ε s b 0 o ε 2 s

pressure on the body surface the second order hydrodynamic force could be approximated it is typically classified into three parts e g kim and yue 1990 22 f i f p s i r i f r e s i f q i the last is quadratic product force composed of only linear quantities it is defined in this form 23 f q i a j a l f q i j l f q i l j 2 24 f q i j l ρ g 2 w l ζ j 1 τ 3 j 1 ζ l 1 τ 3 l 1 h i n 1 n 3 2 d l ρ s b

τ l 1 z τ j 1 z τ l 1 x τ j 1 x τ l 1 y n d s on the other hands other forces are obtained by solving second order boundary value problem and each component means contribution of second order velocity potential and restoring force respectively in particular the second order velocity potential force at each mode is re defined by following generalized formulation 25 f p i i ρ ω s b 0 φ s i h i n d s in this study the second order velocity potential force is calculated by using so called indirect formulation molin 1979 instead of solving second order boundary value problem the new formulation is obtained by applying haskind relation to the second order boundary condition hence the second order velocity potential force is calculated by only linear quantities instead of obtaining eq 25 directly it is as follows 26 f p i i ρ ω s b 0 φ i h i n ψ i φ i n d s i ρ ω s b 0 ψ i q b d s i ρ ω g s f 0 q f q f i ψ i d s where ψ i is assistant velocity potential and it is physically similar with radiation velocity potential this indirect formulation should evaluate both body and free surface integrations which include several inhomogeneous components it can be divided by following two components kim and yue 1990 27 f b b i i ρ ω s b 0 ψ i q b d s 28 f p i f b b i i ρ ω s b 0 h i n φ i ψ i φ i n d s i ρ ω g s f 0 q f q f i ψ i d s in the analysis both integrations have different numerical difficulties respectively at first the body surface integration with inhomogeneous term includes second derivative of unsteady velocity potential it could be directly calculated by using shape function in the higher order boundary element method hobem however in case the geometry of a body is rather complex the accuracy of numerical treatment might be reduced thus the stokes theorem on body surface is used to remove the second derivative term it is as follows 29 s b 0 n ψ i τ j 1 φ l 1 d s s b 0 ψ i τ j 1 φ l 1 n d s s b 0 ψ i φ l 1 τ j 1 n d s s b 0 ψ i φ l 1 τ j 1 n d s w l ψ i φ l 1 τ j 1 t d l where t is tangential vector on the waterline next it is well known that the evaluation of free surface integration is one of the most complex problems in this analysis several methods to evaluate this integration have been suggested in the process of free surface integration there are two common treatments between several researches the first is division of the free surface integration region at a certain distance r s by the existence of local wave components see fig 1 the second is that the integration is conducted analytically provided the physical variable is expressed by the mathematical formulation in this study the near field free surface region is integrated numerically in the free surface boundary condition there is also a second derivative of unsteady velocity potential using 2 dimensional gauss theorem on the free surface as used in kim 1991 second derivative term is removed easily it is as follows 30 s f i n φ j 1 2 φ l 1 z 2 ψ i d s w l r s φ j 1 φ l 1 x n x φ l 1 y n y ψ i d l s f i n φ j 1 x φ l 1 x φ j 1 y φ l 1 y ψ i φ j 1 φ l 1 x ψ i x φ l 1 y ψ i y d s for the integration of free surface far field region we almost followed the process suggested in newman 1991 in the far field region linear velocity potentials are first approximated by using fourier bessel expansion and generalized kochin function b c which is obtained from the velocity potential on the body surface asymptotic formulation of each velocity potential is summarized in this form 31 φ i 1 i g a ω cosh k 0 z h cosh k 0 h n 0 j n k 0 r a n c cos n θ a n s sin n

4 π φ 1 n φ 1 n and σ i 1 4 π ψ i n ψ i n r x 2 y 2 θ tan 1 y x in the far field free surface region the integration region is again divided into two parts i e azimuthal and radial directions as we can see in the asymptotic formulation the velocity potential has only trigonometric functions in azimuthal direction thus the azimuthal direction is integrated by analytic way based on the orthogonal property of trigonometric function newman 1991 the remaining integration which includes triple products of hankel functions for radial direction should be conducted for infinite interval since this integral has oscillating and slowly decaying properties the integrand exists at the very far region from the body thus it is very difficult to evaluate the integration accurately by using numerical method instead of using numerical integral several efficient ways are suggested by some researchers for instance newman 1991 malenica et al 2018 used complex analysis and conducted numerical integration with exponential function obtained in complex region kim and yue 1989 used series expansion based on recurrence relation of fresnel integral chau and eatock taylor 1992 suggested similar approximation method using series expansion which could make minimum error in the analysis choi et al 2000 developed new analytic solution for radial direction after stationary phase approximation for integration of azimuthal direction in this study we also used same series expansion of chau and eatock taylor 1992 at first the hankel function of the second kind is approximated by asymptotic formulation it is as follows 34 h m x 2 π x e i x χ m p 0 i p c m p x p where χ m π 2 m 1 2 and c m 0 1 and c m p 4 m 2 2 p 1 2 8 p c m p 1 using above asymptotic formulation integration which includes triple product of hankel function could be expressed as follows chau and eatock taylor 1992 35 u l m n 2 π k j 2 π k l 2 π k i e i χ l χ m χ n p 0 n l q 0 n m s 0 n n i p q s c l p k 0 j p c

is used as a maximum number and the approximation is conducted on hankel function of the second kind the remained integral is evaluated as follows chau and eatock taylor 1992 choi 2013 36 r s e i k 0 j k 0 l k 0 i r r n 1 2 d r m 1 n γ n m 1 2 γ n 1 2 1 i k 0 j k 0 l k 0 i m e i k 0 j k 0 l k 0 i r s r s n m 1 2 e n where γ is gamma function e n is a truncation error and it is known that the great number n has maximum within k 0 j k 0 l k 0 i r s n if the argument of hankel function is less than bessel order it could have large imaginary value in the integration thus asymptotic form could make an error in this study we did integration numerically by using clenshaw curtis integration until argument of the function is larger than bessel order as a validation test the evaluation of eq 35 the test is conducted on hankel function of the first kind using asymptotic formulation and clenshaw curtis integration is conducted the result is denoted in the table 1 where the integration interval is from 10 to 11 and all wave numbers are 1 0 this table shows that asymptotic expansion has little difference with other results at large bessel order and clenshaw curtis integration has a good agreement in all bessel orders 2 3 2 generalized inertial force the inertial force shows the relation between motion response and body mass in the generalized mode these inertial forces can be re defined as follows heo and kashiwagi 2019 37 f r i v b ρ s h t i τ d v where ρ s structure density h t i is the transformed modal vector for which each position is described at inertial coordinates as same with other forces the non linear inertial force could also be approximated by using perturbation series it is written in the following form 38 f r i v b ρ s h t i 0 h t i 1 τ 1 τ 2 γ 2 d v after collecting all terms the first and second order inertial forces are expressed as follows 39 f r i 1 v b ρ s h t i 0 τ 1 d v 40 f r i 2 v b ρ s h t i 0 τ 2 γ 2 h t i 1 τ 1 d v the linear force and the first term in second order inertial force becomes linear and second order modal mass respectively last two terms in second order force are inhomogeneous components they become cross product of inertia and angular velocity for the rotational motions ogilvie 1983 in the rigid body assumption the vector identity for rotational motion of a rigid body between classical form and generalized mode could be confirmed at heo and kashiwagi 2019 2 3 3 generalized gravity restoring force if a floating body has a rotational motion the gravity performs as a restoring moment thus the body could have the gravity restoring force in case the mode shape has some variations this force could be written in the generalized mode as follows malenica et al 2003 41 f m i g v b ρ s δ h i k d v this can also be expressed up to second order by using perturbation series and the results are written by 42 f m i f m i 1 f m i 2 g v b ρ s δ h i 1 δ h i 2 k d v 43 f m i 1 g v b ρ s h i τ 1 k d v 44 f m i 2 g v b ρ s h i τ 2 h i γ 2 k d v in the linear wave body interaction problem the gravity restoring force is proportional to the displacement and thus it could be included in the restoring stiffness of both rigid and elastic bodies senjanović et al 2008 in the second order gravity restoring force the first term means the force by pure second order displacement and it is also included in the second order hydrostatic restoring coefficient and another term becomes inhomogeneous restoring force 2 3 4 equation of motion in the generalized mode from the newton s equations equation of motion in the generalized mode with structural stiffness due to elastic response could be derived by considering all generalized forces which are described in the previous section the linear and second order equations of motion for the i th response mode are expressed in this form heo and kashiwagi 2019 45 k 1 n m i k 2 t 2 k i k c i k ξ i 1 f i 1 46 k 1 n m i k 2 t 2 k i k c i k ξ i 2 f i 2 v b ρ s 2 t 2 h i γ 2 h t i 1 τ 1 g h i γ 2 k d v where m is modal mass and k is modal stiffness c is hydrostatic restoring coefficient 3 numerical results 3 1 validation test to validate the developed numerical code and formulation in the generalized mode numerical test is conducted for the rigid body motion whose numerical results are obtained by substituting translational mode into modal vector as a numerical model a freely floating hemisphere is adopted the result is compared with semi analytic solution of kim and yue 1990 and another frequency domain solver mlinhydh which is based on free surface green function hobem in the classical formulation choi et al 2000 following mode shape is used to invoke the rigid body motion in generalized mode 47 h 1 i h 2 j h 3 k h 4 i x h 5 j x h 6 k x in this simulation radius of the hemisphere is 1 0 m and boundary radius r s for the division of free surface integration is 10 m at all frequencies the fig 2 shows surge direction second order hydrodynamic forces the f bb is the body surface integration with inhomogeneous term as written in eq 27 and shows the contribution of the body non linearity in the second order velocity potential force f q is the quadratic product of linear quantities described in eq 24 this model has linear heave resonance frequency near va 1 0 the left figure shows that both forces are influenced by the linear heave motion considerably the right figure shows the total second order hydrodynamic force and f p f bb since the contribution of non linear incident wave velocity potential is relatively very small in this result f p f bb means the non linear contribution of the free surface integration in second order velocity potential force this force has relatively large value at high frequency region and a little difference is confirmed with semi analytic solution due to erruptly changing surge velocity potential on free surface as mentioned in choi et al 2000 fig 3 shows same kinds of second order hydrodynamic force for heave direction similar tendency with previous result could be confirmed and overall results show a good agreement each other the second order hydrodynamic force is also calculated in bichromatic waves and it is expressed as quadratic transfer functions qtf fig 4 and fig 5 show quadratic product force f q and body nonlinear component f bb in second order velocity potential force in bichromaitc waves as mentioned before it is shown that the body motion influences body nonlinearity and quadratic product of linear quantities thus these forces are large near resonance frequency region fig 6 is the non linear contribution of the free surface integration f p f bb in the second order velocity potential force it shows that it has relatively large value at high frequency regions we can also confirm that the result at same frequency components are mostly larger than that of different frequencies newman 1990 showed that far field integration of free surface non homogeneous component could make second order velocity potential be slowly attenuated for the depth direction and double frequency components strongly have this property than other sum frequency components in bichromatic waves on the other hands it is known that the difference frequency second order force has totally opposite tendency with sum frequency force the contribution of the free surface integration is very small provided the difference between wave frequencies is not so large considering this property in irregular waves several approximations without free surface integration have been suggested for the calculation of slowly varying hydrodynamic force hauteclocque et al 2012 3 2 numerical test for an elastic body we conducted numerical test for second order force and response of an elastic body using simplified structural model the calculation of hydroelastic response is carried out the freely floating hemisphere is again used as a numerical model and elastic response at different flexural rigidity ei is added on the body motion 3 2 1 structural model euler bernoulli beam equation is used for the analysis of an elastic response from the beam equation the mode shape of the body model is obtained by solving the eigen value problem the homogeneous solution of euler bernoulli beam equation can be readily obtained by assuming the free free end condition and the time harmonic oscillation the final symmetric and anti symmetric mode shapes and their spatial derivatives can be expressed as follows 48 w 2 j 1 2 cos κ 2 j x 2 a cos κ 2 j cosh κ 2

value equation newman 1994 50 1 j tan κ j tanh κ j 0 using derived mode shape from the beam model we used following modal function 51 h 3 j w j h 1 j z w j x h 3 j x w j x the modal mass and stiffness matrices can be obtained from the integration of sectional mass m s in this study the sectional mass and flexural rigidity are assumed constant along the body s length for the simplicity in this case the modal mass and stiffness matrices are expressed in the following form 52 m i j m s a a w i x w j x d x m s a 2 δ i j k i j e i a a 2 w i x x 2 2 w j x x 2 d x e i 2 a 3 κ j 5 4 δ i j for i j 7 in the calculation of second order motion responses three different elastic modes two three four node vertical bendings are considered and inhomogeneous components obtained by hydroelastic response in the right hand sides of eq 46 are not included due to complexity of calculation 3 2 2 second order force and response for two node vertical bending as performed in the previous section we confirmed each component in second order hydrodynamic forces in the elastic model we mainly calculated the hydrodynamic external force for the two node vertical bending mode to conduct numerical test three different values for the flexural rigidity ei are considered the value of flexural rigidity for the model are 1000 1500 2000 nm2 they are artificially determined to confirm the effect of an elastic motion and each case has natural frequency at 1 9 2 6 3 2 rad s for two node vertical bending mode the quadratic product of linear quantities f q and body nonlinear contribution f bb in second order velocity potential force for two node vertical bending are shown in the fig 7 in the low frequency region the resonance of a rigid body motion quite influences to the amplitude of quadratic product force f q on the other hands the body nonlinear contribution f bb in second order velocity potential force has large value near the high frequency resonance region by two node vertical bending mode the left figure in fig 8 shows second order velocity potential force f p for two node vertical bending mode it is almost same with body nonlinear contribution f bb shown in fig 7 it was confirmed that the force for two node vertical bending from the free surface integration f p f bb is relatively quite small in this model in the right figure the total second order hydrodynamic force is finally denoted compared to each quadratic and second order velocity potential force the total second order hydrodynamic force f is decreased at low frequency region and increased at high frequency resonance region due to out of phase and in phase respectively the linear and second order two node vertical bending responses are shown at fig 9 the linear response in the left figure shows different resonance frequency due to changed flexural rigidity and this vibration effect on second order force is confirmed at previous figures in the right figure second order two node vertical bending response shows that it has rather large value at the linear resonance frequency of heave motion as the flexural rigidity increases the second order natural frequency increases and it approaches to 0 8 non dimensional wave number thus the second order response dramatically increases near the second order resonance frequency the same kinds of second order force and response are calculated in bichromatic waves fig 10 shows the quadratic product of linear quantities f q for the two node vertical bending mode as shown in the monochromatic waves the quadratic product force f q has large value near the resonance frequency of rigid body motion rather than resonance of vibration region since this force is influenced by rigid body motion it has relatively large value at the low frequency regions specifically diagonal term in qtf on the other hands the second order velocity potential force f p in fig 11 shows that it is large near high frequency vibration region thus the force is quite changed by the flexural rigidity of a body model since the free surface non linearity part f p f bb is small for two node vertical bending mode of this model the second order velocity potential force follows the tendency of body nonlinear contribution f bb the total second order hydrodynamic force for two node vertical bending f which includes both f q and f p forces is shown in fig 12 it shows that the force has large value near all resonance frequencies as shown in monochromatic wave condition it also seems that f q and f p forces are out of phase at low frequency and in phase at high frequency regions at diagonal term and the total force which has different frequency components is slightly increased compared to each hydrodynamic force as a final result the second order response in bichromatic waves is shown in fig 13 the value is also relatively large near the linear resonance frequency however the effect of the second order resonance of vibration is predominant it is confirmed that the amplitude of second order resonance is extremely large without structural damping near the second order resonance frequency in this numerical model 4 conclusions using higher order boundary element method hobem and perturbation scheme the linear and second order hydrodynamic force and response of an elastic body are calculated for the fluid structure interaction of an elastic body the generalized mode method is adopted in bichromatic wave condition several physical variables such as hydrodynamic force and boundary condition are re defined in the generalized mode among several hydrodynamic forces the generalized second order velocity potential force is calculated by using indirect method and each contribution of body and free surface non linearities is also confirmed using a freely floating hemisphere several kinds of second order force for the rigid body motion is first confirmed as a validation process the result is compared with semi analytic and numerical results obtained from the published data the generalized formulation result shows a good agreement with other classical results the property of second order force for rigid body motion at bichromatic waves is also confirmed as a numerical test of an elastic body simple calculation for the hydroelastic response is conducted using a freely floating elastic hemisphere and simplified euler bernoulli beam model second order force and response for the two node vertical bending mode are calculated as a result the quadratic product force f q has large value near the heave resonance frequency on the other hands second order velocity potential force f p is relatively large at resonance frequencies of elastic body motions unlike rigid body motion result the contribution of free surface non linearity f p f bb in second order velocity potential force is very small for the vertical bending mode in this model thus total second order hydrodynamic force f is relatively large near resonance frequencies of several modes quadratic product force f q and second order velocity potential force f p are generally out of phase at low frequency region and in phase at high frequency regions the second order response is also calculated and it is confirmed that the second order resonance is predominant for the response amplitude credit authorship contribution statement kyeonguk heo writing original draft

21426,a floating wind turbine concept named as spic is composed of the dtu 10mw reference wind turbine and a newly designed semi submersible platform featured with three partially inclined side columns the dynamic responses of the spic concept considering an intermediate water depth of 60 m are investigated through the basin model test approach after calibrating the wind and wave conditions and identifying the model wind turbine system the operational and short term extreme responses of the floating wind turbine concept were studied this innovative concept meets reasonable natural period requirements and achieves great stability under design environmental conditions for operational responses low frequency turbulent wind increases the surge resonance response but provides aerodynamic damping to reduce pitch resonance and tower vibration the wind also excites the responses at 1p 2p and 3p frequencies but the current slightly suppress these responses the extreme surge mooring line tension and nacelle acceleration occur under extreme environments while the extreme pitch tower top shear force and tower base bending moment should be examined under operational conditions with rated wind as well these extreme responses are proved to be smaller than the limited values recommended by standards demonstrating the reasonability of the spic concept in intermediate water depth keywords floating wind turbine new concept basin model test operational responses extreme responses 1 introduction offshore floating wind turbines see significant advantages in wind resources service time construction scale and public acceptance liu et al 2016 however the development of the offshore wind industry is currently facing the challenges of high cost in the wind turbine fabrication installation and transportation aspects willis et al 2018 one of the most promising solutions is to achieve higher generating efficiency through upscaling the wind turbines from 5 mw 8 mw to 10 mw and then 12 mw to harness more wind resources igwemezie et al 2019 for example the technical university of denmark dtu developed a 10 mw reference wind turbine bak et al 2013 by upscaling the nrel 5mw wind turbine the dtu 10mw wind turbine has been widely studied another way to reduce the cost is to minimize the distance between the offshore floating wind turbine and the coastline on the basis of ensuring great quality wind field in order to reduce the power transmission cost dai et al 2018 however in some china s sea areas the change of water depth is not obvious as the distance from the coastline increases in such sea areas limited by the transmission distance the water depth of wind turbine installation site is no more than 60 m sahu 2018 these intermediate waters are usually associated with complex wind and wave conditions accordingly the floating support platform usually has higher requirements on stability structural integrity and dynamic behavior for a floating wind turbine concept with a larger turbine size yang et al 2019 therefore it is of great importance to develop novel wind turbine concepts which is suitable for intermediate waters the commonly studied supporting platforms for floating wind turbines consist of spar tension leg platform tlp semi submersible and barge among them tlp semi submersible and barge are feasible for intermediate waters the construction installation and commissioning of a semi submersible wind turbine are more convenient and cost effective than spar and tlp type wind turbines liu et al 2016 therefore a series of semi submersible platforms are designed to support the wind turbine in intermediate waters in 2002 a floating foundation named dutch tri floater was proposed to work in the intermediate water area 50 m bulder et al 2002 it used three hollow columns to provide buoyance and three plates to increase the system damping in 2009 another three legged platform named windfloat designed byroddier et al 2009 was used to carry the 2 mw wind turbine in the water area with depth ranging from 30 m to 50 m one of the three columns was utilized to support the wind turbine and active water ballast system was installed at the bottom of the columns to ensure stability another project named winflo introduced an innovative platform with three inclined columns to carry a two blade wind turbine which can generate 1 mw electric power this platform was planned to be installed at a water depth of 50 m and it does not belong to the commercial wind turbine due to the special marine conditions bossler 2013 these wind turbine concepts were considered to be capable of operating in moderate waters roddier et al 2009 leboulluec et al 2013 koo et al 2014 but the scale of the wind turbine they carry is small which means low power generation in this study a new concept of semi submersible platform with partially inclined columns spic was designed to support the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine the platform features three partially inclined side columns that can provide good stability performance with a relatively small displacement the experimental approach i e model test in a basin is usually carried out to validate the design and to study dynamic performance of a new concept of floating wind turbine in 2010 the 1 105 scaled windfloat model was used in the basin test with an actuator disk to replicate the thrust loads and a spinning mass to simulate gyroscopic loads roddier et al 2010 however only the regular wave condition and 100 year wave condition were chosen in the test in 2011 a series of experiments of the deepcwind semi submersible platform designed in the oc4 project was conducted in marin under different conditions with a water depth of 200 m goupee et al 2012 including free decay irregular wave and wind only conditions in 2014 a braceless semi submersible platform at the depth of 200 m named concrete star wind floater was tested in ecn with a ducked fan replacing the full rotor to simulate wind force azcona et al 2014 the real time platform motion and relative wind speed were measured and transformed into the software fast and the calculated aerodynamic force was realized through the feedback controlled ducted fan this approach described as software in the loop sil could take the effect of the wind turbine control into account but it severely depended on the accuracy of numerical simulation similarly the test method was also implemented on the 5 mw csc platform through the novel actuator and numerical software in marintek at a depth of 6 66 m which corresponds to a prototype depth of 200 m bachynski et al 2016 another basin test of deepcwind was conducted in deepwater offshore basin at shanghai jiao tong university in 2015 the froude scaled blades and performance scaled blades were both used in the test and the dynamic responses were compared bychen et al 2018 the triple spar which was designed for innwind eu project carried the 10 mw reference wind turbine in the water area with depth of 180 m in 2017 a model test at a 1 60 scale was conducted under simultaneous wind and wave loads in dhi denmark with the active blade pitch control for the first time bredmose et al 2017 these model tests simulated the dynamic responses of the deep water floating wind turbines but there are few model tests designed and conducted for floating wind turbines in intermediate waters to validate the design and to investigate the dynamic responses of the spic concept in intermediate water depth a basin model test was conducted in the deepwater offshore basin shanghai jiao tong university in the test the performance scaled blades were used to obtain the physically modeled aerodynamic loads a flexible tower with scaled stiffness was used to mimic the dominant eigen modes of the tower the rotor speed was controlled by an electric motor installed in the nacelle the pitch angle of each blade was adjusted manually and individually for above rated wind speeds a catenary mooring system was adopted to keep the platform in position this study briefly describes the spic floating wind turbine concept and the experimental apparatus in the basin model test responses under selected wind wave and current conditions and yaw error case are also analyzed various extreme responses were evaluated and compared with the limited values recommended by standards to validate the feasibility of spic concept in intermediate water depth 2 description of the spic concept and environmental condition 2 1 spic concept a new concept of floating wind turbine named as spic is addressed in this study this concept as depicted in fig 1 is composed of the dtu 10mw reference wind turbine and a newly designed semi submersible platform featured with three partially inclined side columns it is a complex multibody system including the turbine tower floating platform mooring system etc the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine bak et al 2013 is a three blade upwind horizontal axis turbine with key parameters given in table1 the tower was modified by shortening the dtu 10 mw tower the designed tower has a height of 92 6 m and the outer diameter varying linearly from 7 74 m at the bottom to 5 50 m at the top the tower bottom which connects with the central column of the platform is 23 0 m above the waterline the newly designed semi submersible platform for the spic concept is made up of three partially inclined side columns a central column a submerged pontoon and three circular bracings the configuration is illustrated in fig 2 and the specific parameters are introduced in detail in section3 3 the side column consists of a lower part which is tilted outwards and a connected upper part which stands upright compared with the traditional straight upward side column this innovative design of the outward inclined side column can increase the distance to the central column without changing the displacement so as to ensure more stability although the similar effect can be achieved by increasing the displacement volume or the water line area this innovative structure can achieve great stability and reasonable natural frequency requirements at lower cost the inclined side column is changed to a vertical condition below the water plane so that the wave acting on the vertical column will not cause significant wave run up the conjunction is below the water plane in which case the area of the section at water surface remains invariable in heave motion and the inertia moment of water plane is fixed the submerged pontoon consisting of a hexagonal central pontoon and three divergent rectangular side pontoons connects the bottom end of tilted side columns with the central column the pontoon height is set as 7 m to provide sufficient buoyancy and ensure adequate space for ballast the more detailed configuration has been introduced in the cao et al 2020 a six line catenary mooring system is designed to constrain the platform s motions the layout and properties of the mooring system are illustrated in fig 3 and table2 respectively the mooring lines are divided into three groups which spread 120 degree symmetrically about the center of the platform each group consists of two chains spaced 5 degrees apart the fairleads are located 15 m above the water plane the anchors are fixed on the seabed with a depth of 60 m and radius of 830 m 2 2 environmental condition the spic concept wind turbine system was designed to operate in an intermediate water depth of 60 m this study aims for future possible applications in the south china sea therefore sea conditions of the coast of guangdong province china were selected and studied in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the new concept the parameters of five environmental conditions applied to the wind turbine system are given in table3 the wind wave and current loads were all considered in the design operational and survival sea states two irregular waves follow the jonswap spectrum dnv 2014 significant wave height hs peak wave period tp and peakedness factor γ are listed in the table the rated wind speed is 11 4 m s and an over rated wind speed of 30 0 m s is also employed two different current speeds of 0 5 m s and 1 0 m s were chosen corresponding to the operational and survival sea states respectively for basin test research the effect of current was realized using a mechanical device to exert specified forces acting on the platform the current loads in the model test were seemed as constant values and the loads were simulated through two weights which can provide the applied forces of 549 8 kn and 1099 4 kn respectively the point where the forces were applied is 11 97 m above the baseline of the platform it should be noted that the wind wave and current considered in this study are directionally aligned in the positive x direction according to the coordinate system shown in fig 1 the yaw error condition was considered in ec5 by positively rotating the rotor plane of wind turbine 10 deg around the z axis this case simulated the situation that the rotor of the wind turbine is not perpendicular to the wind direction due to the fault of the control system 3 physical models and experimental apparatus the model test of the spic concept as shown in fig 4 was conducted in the deepwater offshore basin in shanghai jiao tong university at a froude scale of 1 64 the main scale of the basin is 50 m 40 m 10 m two groups of multi unit wave generators were installed in the adjacent side of the basin the basin water depth was set as 0 9375 m corresponding to a full scale water depth of 60 m in this section the physical models and the experimental apparatus used in the basin model test are briefly described including the rotor and nacelle model tower model floater model mooring system model instruments etc 3 1 rotor and nacelle models the basin model test of floating wind turbine is commonly conducted based on froude scaling to satisfy the similarity of the hydrodynamic performance meanwhile a performance matched blade model wen et al 2019 which can realize the thrust and torque similarity at low re numbers was designed to replace the geometry matched blades the airfoil of blade was changed from ffa w3 to sd2030 which has smaller thickness to achieve greater lift and drag coefficients the chord length of each section was increased and the twist angle was optimized on this basis to ensure similar aerodynamic performance for the performance matched rotor the thrust coefficient can well match with that of the prototype for tsr between 7 and 8 wen et al 2019 the condition with rated wind speed was mainly modeled in the test which corresponds to a tsr of 7 6 during the model test the wind speed seen by the rotor varies due to the platform motion leading to a slight change of tsr however the increases and decreases of the relative wind speeds generally do not cause the tsr varying beyond the range between 7 and 8 the span wise load distribution of the performance matched rotor under low re number was compared with that of the full scaled rotor under high re number as shown in fig 5 tsr 7 6 wen et al 2019 it illustrates that the normal forces of the designed rotor match well with those of the full scaled rotor but the tangential forces are less performed therefore the modeling of thrust was considered to be consistently accurate under the rated wind speed condition compared with geometry matched blade performance matched blade model has larger surface area in order to make the length and weight meet the froude scaling law the model blade adopted two carbon fiber layers to form a hollow structure which can be seen in fig 6 the control system of prototypical floating wind turbine consists of a generator torque controller and a collective blade pitch controller in the model test an electric motor which can be seen in fig 7 was installed in the nacelle to control the rotor speed for maximizing thrust and power under below rated wind speed under over rated wind speed the pitch angle of each blade was adjusted manually beforehand individually and the rotor speed was made to remain constant by motor when it was above the cut out wind speed the wind turbine shut down and the blade pitch angle was adjusted to 90 deg 3 2 tower model the tower connects the rotor nacelle structure and the floating platform because the tower plays a role of transmitting aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loads its vibration has a great influence on the dynamic response of the nacelle and platform if the tower is geometrically scaled the rigidity of the structure is too large so as to make the tower a rigid body therefore it is more reasonable to scale the bending stiffness of each model section to simulate the natural frequencies and dominant eigen modes in fore aft and side by side directions correctly the natural frequency of a euler bernoulli beam is given bymartin 2011 in eq 1 1 ω β n l e i l 3 m where β n depends on the boundary condition of tower bottom l denotes the tower height i means the inertia moment of cross section and m symbols the tower mass it was unprocurable to obtain a froude scale stiffness by only scaling the material young modulus the combination of the tower material and geometry were tuned together according to eq 2 zhao et al 2018 2 e i m 1 λ 5 e p i p where λ means the scale ratio the subscript m and p represent model scale and prototype scale respectively the tower length was directly scaled from the full scale length and the boundary condition was maintained similarly the material was chosen as al6063 tube which has the advantages of low density high strength and low elastic modulus the tube is divided into eight cylindric sections the inertia moment of each section should be tuned as well to achieve the target stiffness of the tower model considering the convenience for processing the inner diameter of the tower model is consistent as 20mm the outer diameter of each section is calculated through eq 2 the main parameters of the prototype tower and model tower are listed in table4 3 3 model of semi submersible platform the supporting platform model presented in fig 8 is processed according to the main particulars given in table5 the floater model is made of fiberglass and wood and the connection with the sensor at the bottom of the tower is a flange made of aluminum alloy the total mass the center of gravity and the radius of inertia of the floating wind turbine system are achieved by adjusting the ballast within the side columns and the submerged pontoons the total mass the center of gravity and the radius of inertia of the floating wind turbine system are achieved by adjusting the ballast within the side columns and the submerged pontoons the measured values in prototype were compared with the design parameters in table6 the errors are acceptable which lays the basis for the physical experiments to reproduce the full prototype behaviors properly 3 4 mooring system model the layout of the mooring system in model test was scaled from fig 3 the properties of mooring lines are listed in table7 in the experiment the weight of mooring line was simulated by iron chain and lead wire and the stiffness of mooring line was imitated through spring the experiment did not mimic accurately the outer diameter of each line for the catenary mooring system the restoring force of the mooring system is mainly realized through the weight of suspended sections the ea of the prototype mooring line was scaled to the model scale first in the model test the chain is regarded as inextensible because of its short length so the axial stiffness of mooring lines was imitated through the spring with targeted spring constant k e a l where l is the line length to verify whether the spring position during the physical experiments anchor or fairlead affects the fairlead tension three cases were simulated through numerical modeling case1 model scaled mooring line with spring placed at the anchor case2 model scaled mooring line with spring placed at the fairlead case3 full scaled mooring line and the fairlead tensions of six lines were recorded under ten different offsets the relationships between offsets and fairlead tensions under three different cases are illustrated in fig 9 the results of case2 are close to the results of case3 with the mean relative differences smaller than 1 the results of case1 are slightly larger than those of case3 and the mean relative differences are around 2 this indicates that the spring position during the physical experiments has a slight influence on the fairlead tension and the results obtained when the spring is located at the fairlead are closer to the full scaled results therefore the spring was located at the fairlead of the mooring line in the model test 3 5 instrument a series of sensors were arranged in the model test to accurately measure the motions and forces of the floating wind turbine system in fig 7 a six component force sensor was installed between the nacelle and the tower top to measure the force and moment an accelerometer was located under the nacelle to capture the accelerations of the nacelle in three directions there were also a series of sensors arranged on the floating platform which can be seen in fig 10 another six component force sensor was arranged under the tower base the fairlead tension of each mooring line could be measured through the single component load cell the non contact optical motion capture system was used to acquire the motion of floating wind turbine system in six degrees of freedom 6dofs in addition the wave gauges and hot wire anemometers were used to measure the wave elevation and inflow wind speed respectively the manufacturer and type for each measurement instrument can be referred to in table8 the layout of the physical experiments is depicted in fig 11 the positions of wave generators wave absorbing beaches wind generator wind turbine model and wave gauges are all illustrated in the basin plant view among them wave gauge 1 was used in the wave calibration stage while wave gauge 2 was used in both wave calibration stage and model test stage the coordinate systems used in the model test is presented in fig 12 the global x axis is positive towards the downwind direction of the wind turbine and the global z axis is positive upward the origin is located at the center of the waterplane the definition of wind and wave directions is also given in fig 12 the positive direction of 6dof forces and moments for the tower top and tower base load cells as well as 3 dof accelerations are also shown in the diagram 4 system calibration and identification for the model test before carrying out the basin model test of the spic concept calibration of the environmental conditions and identification of the floating wind turbine system are required and conducted in order to simulate the environment and to capture the dynamic response characteristics properly 4 1 wind field calibration the purpose built wind generating system was adopted in this experiment as shown in fig 13 the system was composed of twenty variable frequency axial fans arranged in four rows and five columns with an effective wind generation area of 4 0 m 3 2 m and a wind speed variation range of 0 15m s in order to increase the uniformity of wind speed a honeycomb network was installed in the front of the wind generation system for rectification the wind speed measurement was realized by multi channel hot wire anemometers arranged perpendicular to the incoming flow direction of the wind field the sampling frequency was set to 1000hz and the acquisition time was three minutes the origin of the coordinate system o xyz referred to by the measurement points is at the hub height the positive x axis is along the wind direction and the positive directions of y axis and z axis are defined in fig 13 the wind field quality is critical to obtaining reliable measurements and to determining the proper location of models taking the target model scaled wind speed of 1 4 m s as an example the mean value and turbulence intensity of wind speed in xoz plane is shown in fig 14 in model scale the horizontal x axis of the graph represents the distance between the wind measurement points and the wind generating system and the vertical axis means the measuring position relative to the hub height and the red dash line represents the range of the wind field covered by the rotor according to the measurement results the wind field non uniformity was serious near the wind generating system the wind speed at the central axis of each fan was large and the wind speed at the junction of the two rows of fans was small in addition the wind speed decreased and the turbulence intensity increased at the upper and lower boundary of the wind field which was caused by the open flow space however the average wind speed and turbulence intensity had a good uniformity when the measurement points were at the area 4 m or farer away from the wind generating system the district 4 m 5 5 m away from the wind generation system was the optimal wind field area according to the structural characteristics of the tank bottom x 4 6 m was then selected to further explore the wind field characteristics 49 measurement points were evenly distributed in a square area with side length of 3 2 m taking the target wind speed of 1 4 m s for instance the wind speed distribution of the section is obtained as shown in fig 15 the red circle in the figure is the outline of the rotor in this area the wind speed and turbulence intensity were uniform at approximately 1 4 m s and 11 respectively after determining the selected plane for spacing wind turbine system five probes were arranged around and in the center of the rotor coverage area to calibrate the corresponding relationship between the wind speed um and the rotating speed n of the axial flow fan the relevant characteristics of the wind field are shown in fig 16 it can be observed that the output wind speed was in linear relationship with the rotating speed of the axial flow fan so the output wind speed could be controlled after the wind calibration in the rotor plane the rotor thrusts caused by different wind speeds should be measured and compared with the theoretical thrust to ensure the aerodynamic performance of the blade model the rotor plane was installed at x 4 6 m and the hub position was set as y 0 m z 0 m the steady winds with different speeds were generated in turn by the wind generating system and applied to the rotor different from the experimental model used in the basin test a rigid tower made of steel was used to replace the flexible tower the rigid tower was fixed on land and connected to the nacelle through a force sensor as shown in fig 17 the six component force sensor on the tower top can measure the tower top shear force in the x direction a fixed rigid tower can ensure that the rotor did not tilt so that the measured tower top shear force did not have the gravity component due to the nacelle and rotor in this study the main focus was on the rated wind speed the aerodynamic thrust under the rated wind speed was measured and proved to be accurate through the on land calibration test 4 2 wave calibration at the deepwater offshore basin in shanghai jiao tong university two adjacent rows of wave generators generate the target waves and the wave absorbing beaches are installed on the opposite sides to eliminate the reflected waves as shown in fig 11 waves propagate into the wave absorbing beach and then outward the outlet boundary smoothly without any evident reflection zhao et al 2017 verified that the performance of the wave absorbing beach at this basin in suppressing reflected waves was satisfactory prior to mounting the floating wind turbine model in the basin wave calibration was conducted first the wave elevation was measured through the wave gauge 1 at the center of model to be installed and the wave elevation at the position three meters away from the wind turbine model was measured by wave gauge 2 as shown in fig 10 during the model test only the wave gauge 2 was utilized to monitor the wave the measured values of wave gauge 1 in wave calibration and measured values of wave gauge 2 in model test are compared with the targeted values of h s and t p as listed in table9 in full scale both two irregular waves show small differences in hs and tp between the target and measured the measured wave spectra of two irregular waves are compared with the target spectra in fig 18 it shows a great agreement between the theoretical and measured wave spectra and the existence of the wind turbine model shows little effect on the generated waves 4 3 hammer test the natural frequencies of the tower model in the fore aft and side to side directions should be properly modeled this can be validated by conducting the hammer tests to check whether the dominant eigen modes of the tower are captured in the model in the hammer test an accelerometer was used to measure the vibration acceleration of the model tower duan et al 2016 the tower was connected to the land via a load cell the rotor model nacelle model and other sensors were included in the hammer test configuration the impulse excitation acted on the tower top in fore aft and side side directions respectively the time series of the vibration induced accelerations were recorded and scaled to the prototype the power spectral density psd of tower vibration acceleration was then obtained and the frequency corresponding to the spectral peak represented the natural frequency of the tower the first order natural frequencies of the tower in the two directions are measured as about 2 0 rad s and 2 1 rad s respectively the designed tower is obtained by shortening 23 meters of the dtu 10mw tower from the tower base and the theoretical value of the first order natural frequency is about 2 0 rad s this implies that the tower vibration modes are correctly modeled in the model test 4 4 horizontal restoring stiffness surge offset test was conducted to identify the horizontal restoring stiffness of the mooring system model a series of initial offsets in the positive surge direction was applied to the wind turbine model through a line tied to the platform and the surge restoring forces were measured and recorded through a load sensor between the line and the platform a horizontal restoring stiffness curve can thus be derived from the measured force displacement relationship the derived horizontal restoring stiffness curve was then transformed to the full scale and compared with the target curve as shown in fig 19 the targeted relationship between the horizontal restoring force and offset was obtained through numerical simulations in orcaflex orcina 2015 the measurement results are in good agreement with the target it can be found that the force offset relationship is fairly linear when the offset is less than 15 m and becomes slightly non linear for the offset larger than 15 m the tension shows a nonlinear behavior for large x offsets which is a typical characteristic for the catenary mooring system and it is more obvious for shallower water depth xu et al 2018 4 5 free decay test free decay tests were conducted to identify the natural periods of the 6dof motions of the system the target natural periods were calculated by numerical decay simulations in orcaflex orcina 2015 in both numerical simulations and model tests an initial displacement was applied to the floating wind turbine model for each dof the time series of the surge sway heave pitch roll and yaw motions were acquired the number of zero crossing periods of the time history curve is m and each zero up crossing period is denoted as t i the mean zero up crossing period t 0 is expressed as i 1 m t i m the measured and target natural periods of the 6dofs motions of the spic concept wind turbine are listed in table10 dnvgl recommended practice dnv 2019 gives the typical ranges of natural periods for semi submersible floating foundation of wind turbine as also shown in table10 the natural periods of 6dof motions are all simulated accurately and belong to the reasonable ranges which means they are all away from the wave period ranges the non dimensional damping coefficient of free decay motion can be obtained through 3 μ 1 2 π l n φ a i φ a i 1 where φ a i and φ a i 1 are the i th and i 1 th peak or valley values of the decay curve according to the measured free decay curves the dimensionless damping of the spic concept wind turbine in 6dofs are obtained which are also given in table10 5 results and discussions the basin model test cases included wave only combined wind wave and combined wind wave current conditions to examine the operational responses and extreme responses of spic concept wind turbine in intermediate water depth each test case lasts for approximately 25min which corresponds to three hours in full scale the first 90s of recorded data of each test was removed to eliminate the transient effect the sampling frequency was set to 50hz all the results below are given in full scale 5 1 response amplitude operator rao in order to investigate the dynamic responses of the spic concept floating wind turbine under different wave periods in intermediate water depth the white noise wave test was conducted the significant wave height was determined as 5 m and the wave period ranged from 5 s to 20 s the response amplitude operators raos can be obtained through the calculation of measured motion spectra and wave spectra the raos of pitch surge and heave motions are shown in fig 20 there is no peak in the wave frequency range of pitch and surge raos only the heave response is slightly excited in the wave frequency range pitch surge and heave raos all exhibit significant low frequency performance the raos of these three motions show obvious peaks at their respective natural frequencies which correspond to the results of free decay tests the surge motion has an obvious influence on the pitch motion which explains the obvious spectral peak at the surge resonance frequency in the pitch rao 5 2 operational response analysis three operational conditions i e ec1 ec2 and ec3 were chosen to investigate the dynamic response characteristics of the spic concept wind turbine in intermediate water depth ec1 is operational wave only case to examine the effect of wave loads in intermediate water ec2 with rated wind speed and operational wave was compared with ec1 to obtain the effect of the wind loads on the wind turbine system on the basis of combined wind wave test ec3 with the collinear current can reflect the effect of current loads the mean values and standard deviations std of the dynamic responses under these three operational conditions are listed in table11 5 2 1 platform motions since the configuration of the spic concept is symmetric and the wind wave and current are along the positive x direction the surge and pitch motions of the floater are thus most significant among the 6dof motions the time series of the surge and pitch motions under ec1 ec3 are illustrated in figs 21 a and 22 a it should be noted that these time series are presented here in a short period i e from 500 s to 800 s but full time series are used for statistical and spectral analyses under ec1 the mean pitch motion is basically zero the mean surge motion is slightly greater than zero due to the effect of mean drift force when the wind load is added the mean values of surge and pitch motion increase to approximately 7 70 m and 3 69 deg respectively this indicates that the effect of wind loads on the mean values of the surge and pitch responses are relatively significant compared with the effect of wave loads when the current load is further applied on the wind turbine the mean surge reaches 11 95 m this current load plays an important role in the mean surge position of the floating wind turbine however the mean pitch position decreases to 2 54 deg compared with the ec2 this is because of the opposite direction of the moment applied by current and wind loads on the wind turbine significant fluctuations occur in the surge and pitch time series under ec1 and ec2 because the involvement of varying wave loads and the fluctuations of the time history curves are nearly identical under ec1 and ec2 when the current is involved in the variation of surge motion is significantly reduced and the fluctuation of pitch motion is slightly smoother in order to illustrate the fluctuation of the dynamic responses in detail the power spectrum densities psd were investigated by the fast fourier transform fft method the psd of surge and pitch motions are shown in figs 21 b and 22 b for indicating the contribution of different frequency components to the variations of surge and pitch motions for platform surge motion the low frequency component dominates obviously there is an obvious peak appearing in the low frequency range under either ec1 or ec2 this response appears at the natural frequency of surge motion actually this surge resonant responses are induced by second order difference frequency wave loads and or low frequency turbulent wind loads moreover the surge resonant response under ec2 is slightly larger than that under ec1 this is mainly caused by the turbulence of inflow wind there is a low frequency variation in the wind velocity produced by the wind generation system a turbulence intensity exists under the mean wind speed of 11 4 m s under the action of low frequency wind load more powers are stimulated at the extremely low natural frequency of surge motion when the current load is applied the low frequency spectral peak is significantly suppressed the possible reason is that the damping of the floating wind turbine system in the low frequency range is very small and the current load provides additional damping during the model test the current load is modeled by a mechanical device by exerting a steady force externally under ec3 the current load is about 549 8 kn under the actions of wind and waves this current load mainly provides damping force which contributes to the decrease of the surge resonant responses at the low frequency under ec3 as a result the low frequency spectral peak is significantly suppressed for power spectra of pitch motions shown in fig 22 b three obvious peaks are observed under ec1 the spectral peaks appear at surge resonant frequency pitch resonant frequency and wave frequency range respectively this implies that the surge and pitch motion are strongly coupled and the pitch motion is affected by the surge for ec2 these three spectral peaks also exist in the power spectrum a slightly larger wave frequency response is observed under ec2 and ec3 compared to that under ec1 theoretically the presence of wind does not change the platform motion response in wave frequency cao et al 2019 however in model test the wind field had an impact on the wave generation to demonstrate that the difference in responses was caused by the existence of wind the wave spectra for ec1 ec2 and ec3 are compared in fig 23 it can be seen that the spectral peaks under ec2 and ec3 are identical and they are both a little higher than the peak under ec1 the significant wave height increases by approximately 3 2 when the wind is applied the wind made the waves slightly higher which resulted in slightly larger pitch motion within the wave frequency range ec2 gives a slightly larger surge resonant response than the ec1 due to the contribution from low frequency turbulent wind on the contrary the pitch resonant response is restrained significantly when wind loads are considered mainly due to the aerodynamic damping for ec3 the spectral peaks at surge and pitch natural frequencies are both suppressed significantly current loads can effectively reduce the power of low frequency motion of floating wind turbine in addition a fourth peak can be seen under ec2 and ec3 at about 1 rad s which is the rotating frequency 1p of rotor because the wind field is not completely uniform the blades do not experience exactly the same wind load everywhere during the rotation therefore the rotor rotation shows an influence on the pitch motion and the current load also has a slight suppression of the power at 1p 5 2 2 tower top shear force and tower base bending moment the tower top bears aerodynamic force induced by inflow wind inertia force caused by the acceleration of the rotor and nacelle and hydrodynamic force transmitted from platform etc the tower top shear force tfx which is aligned with wind wave and current loads is of great importance the tower base bears the force transformed from the tower top through the tower structure and the hydrodynamic force acted on the floating platform the tower base bending moment bmy caused by the environmental loads in x direction is addressed here as well in table11 the mean values of tower top shear force and tower base bending moment are both around zero when only wave load acts on the floating wind turbine under the operational wave and rated wind speed the mean values of tfx and bmy rise to 1 69e3 kn and 1 78e5 kn m due to the increasing aerodynamic force when current load is further applied the mean values decrease slightly compared with those under ec1 the stds of tfx and bmy are larger under the other two conditions the power spectra of tfx and bmy are shown in fig 24 and fig 25 respectively in both figures the wave frequency response is dominant when irregular waves are considered in the low frequency range the turbulent wind induced low frequency responses are also observed but its contribution to the total variation of tower top shear force and tower base bending moment is much smaller than the wave frequency response besides notable peaks at approximately 1 rad s and 3 rad s are excited under ec2 and ec3 these two frequencies correspond to the 1p and 3p frequencies respectively the 3p response excited also attributes to the dissymmetry of blade rotation in model test in addition the non uniform and unsteady aerodynamic loads on each blade during the rotation might cause very small 2p fluctuations at a frequency of about 2 rad s it is due to the imperfect installation of blades when assembling the blades and the rotating hub this gives rise to the differences in blade pitch angles for these three blades when the control strategy with fixed blade pitch angles was used in the experiments the spectral peaks of tfx and bmy at the 2p frequency and 3p frequency are both relatively lower when current loads are involved in the wave excitation induces the 6dof motions of the platform and accordingly gives rise to the unsteady wind inflow for the blades during one rotation each blade experiences different wind inflow and suffers varying aerodynamic loads however the existence of current load mitigates this effect on the basis of wave excitation as a result the 2p and 3p fluctuations are mitigated both due to the current induced suppression of platform motions an additional spectral peak can be seen at 2 6 rad s under wave only condition which is indicated to be the natural frequency of tower in hammer test the bottom of the tower has a rigid and fixed boundary condition it changes to an elastic boundary when connecting to the platform which moves in the waves this results in a change in the natural frequency of the tower vibration from 2 rad s to 2 6 rad s when wind loads are added under ec2 and ec3 the spectral peak is suppressed obviously due to the aerodynamic damping 5 2 3 nacelle acceleration the acceleration of the mechanical facilities installed in the nacelle is of concern and should below a limited value in order to ensure the safe operation of the facilities because the external environmental loads acting on the wind turbine are in the x direction the acceleration of the nacelle in the x direction in the local coordinate system nacaccx is mainly analyzed under the individual excitation of wave loads it can be observed from table11 that the mean value of nacelle acceleration in x direction is zero as predicted and the mean values are still zero when wind loads and current loads are applied under ec2 and ec3 the gravitational component caused by the wind induced and current induced pitch moments are excluded from the measured data so the mean value of zero is reasonable besides the stds of nacaccx are significant for all three environments the power spectra of nacaccx are illustrated in fig 26 for parked condition with individual wave load the power within the range of wave frequency dominates the nacaccx spectrum which is induced by the linear wave force when wind and current loads are added the response of nacelle fore aft acceleration does not show any variation in wave frequency the power excited at pitch natural frequency and tower vibration frequency is suppressed due to the aerodynamic damping while the power excited at surge natural frequency is more obvious attributing to the low frequency variation of turbulent wind speed in addition an obvious spectral peak can be seen at 3p frequency when wind load is applied and the power of nacelle acceleration in x direction at 3p frequency is suppressed under the influence of current load however almost no power is excited at 1p and 2p frequencies it is because the 1p and 2p frequencies are close to the wave frequency range the peaks at 1p and 2p frequencies of the power spectrum of the nacelle acceleration are alleviated or even damped out by potential damping 5 2 4 mooring line tension the mooring lines distributed in front of the wind turbine line3 line6 sustain the tension caused by the environmental loads the statistics in table11 shows that the mean tensions of these four mooring lines increase with the surge motion conversely the mean forces of line1 and line2 distributed at the rear of the platform are reduced the maximum loads occurred at the line4 and line5 due to the orientation of the platform and the direction of the environmental loads the fairlead tension of line4 was investigated in detail as an example fig 27 a shows the time history of the mooring line tension of line4 under three operational conditions under ec1 the mean value of fairlead tension is about 625 02 kn the time history curve of fairlead tension shows a similar period of fluctuation to that of surge motion under ec2 and ec3 the mean value increases to 1040 33 kn and 1266 78 kn respectively when the pretension is deducted the mean mooring line tensions under ec1 ec3 present a good linear relationship with the mean surge motions under ec1 ec3 it proves that the fairlead tension of mooring line is directly related to the hydrodynamic force in surge direction in addition the mooring line tensions under ec2 and ec3 fluctuate more violently and complicatedly compared with the variation of surge motion under these two conditions in order to analyze the power distribution of mooring line tension fluctuation under three different conditions the psd curves are given in fig 27 b it can be seen that the spectral peak of fairlead tension appears at the surge natural frequency and presents largest value under ec2 which is the same as the spectral characteristics of surge motion besides under ec2 and ec3 the power is excited in all the frequency range uniformly this phenomenon is caused by the wind load which also has power distributions in other frequencies outside the low frequencies 5 3 extreme response analysis 5 3 1 short term extreme value estimation method the extreme responses of floating wind turbine including extreme motion responses and extreme structural responses are of great concern the short term extreme values of these dynamic responses are considered based on the mean up crossing rate naess and moan 2013 which is an important parameter for reliability assessment in an arbitrary time interval t if the dynamic response is not narrow banded the up crossing is statistically independent at high levels under this condition it can be assumed that the random number of the up crossing is approximately independent on poisson distribution the extreme value of random process y t in the interval t is expressed as m t then the extreme value distribution of m t is described as 4 p m t y exp 0 t v y t d t where v y t indicates the up crossing rate corresponding to level y which means the average frequency of the positive slope crossing of the level y the probability of m t exceeding the defined level y is then expressed as 5 p m t y 1 exp v y t where v can be obtained through 6 v y 1 t 0 t v y t d t the mean up crossing rate can be estimated through the time series of dynamic responses during the time interval t the number of up crossing of level y is defined as n y t then for k time series of interval t the sample mean up crossing rate is 7 v ˆ y 1 k t j 1 k n j y t where n j y t means the number of up crossing of level y by the j th of k time series the 95 confidence interval c i of the series number k is 8 c i y v ˆ y 1 96 s ˆ y k s ˆ y 2 1 k 1 j 1 k n j y t t v ˆ y 2 on the basis of describing the mean up crossing rate by direct numerical simulations an extrapolation technical proposed bynaess and gaidai 2008 is utilized to estimate the extreme values in the tail region corresponding to extremely high levels y y 0 9 v y q y exp a y b c y y 0 where q y is slowly varying and a b c are all constant values the levenberg marquardt least squares optimization method is utilized to choose the optimal a b c and q which are introduced innaess et al 2007 andnaess and gaidai 2008 in detail 5 3 2 extreme motion and structural responses for floating wind turbines extreme responses may occur under rated wind conditions or extreme wind conditions i e ec2 ec5 extreme responses under these two wind conditions are evaluated for the floating wind turbine concept in this section four ecs are considered here ec2 ec3 and ec5 are operational condition associated with rated wind and operational wave condition ec4 is extreme condition with extreme sea state and the turbine is parked in this study the extreme structural and motion responses of floating wind turbine were estimated three independent test realizations with a duration of one hour were considered the up crossing rates of 10 4 is chosen and used to estimate the extreme responses this up crossing level corresponds to the probability of exceedance of approximately 30 according to eq 5 fig 28 presents the mean up crossing rate with ci and the extrapolation at extremely low levels of the tower base fore aft bending moment under ec2 as an example it shows that the extrapolation of the mean up crossing rate v y becomes unstable in the tail region therefore the fitted up crossing rate v f i t y is used to estimate the extreme response at the level of 10 4 in order to clearly show the mean up crossing rate and its extrapolation value of the response under four ecs the bending moment is taken as an example for comparison in fig 29 it can be seen that the mean up crossing rate decreases with the increase of tower base bending moment among which the value under ec3 decreases the fastest while the value under ec4 decreases the slowest since ec2 ec3 and ec5 are operational conditions the mean up crossing rate curves are very close at the level of 10 4 ec2 produces the most dangerous positive bending moment around the y axis followed by ec5 and ec3 and under the extreme condition ec4 the extreme response appears relatively smaller in this way the extreme response among different environmental conditions can be compared by using the mean up crossing rate fig 30 shows the extreme responses of the spic concept wind turbine calculated by the mean up crossing rate method the extreme response means the value corresponding to the probability of exceedance of approximately 30 in the figure the red and black bars represent the maximums and minimums respectively dynamic responses such as tower base bending moment tower top shear force acceleration of nacelle and pitch motion present both positive and negative values during the time interval the negative values represent the responses in the opposite direction which is of equal importance the maximum and minimum are used to evaluate the extreme response in positive and negative directions respectively the extreme responses under ec2 ec5 are compared to examine the effect of environmental loads and yaw error the maximal value of pitch motion under ec2 and ec5 reaches approximately 4 5 deg and 4 1 deg respectively the involvement of current load in ec3 decreases the value to 3 2 deg under ec4 when the turbine is parked the aerodynamic loads decreases greatly under the action of significantly large current load and small aerodynamic load the maximum is only 0 6 deg while the minimum arrives at 4 3 deg recommended practice dnv 2019 stipulates that the limited value of pitch motion in operational conditions and extreme conditions shall not exceed 10 deg and 15 deg respectively the extreme pitch motion of spic is much less than the limited value under each condition the maximum tower base fore aft bending moments present similar values under ec2 ec3 and ec5 which are induced by the same wind condition under extreme condition the maximal value of bmy even reduces to approximately half of the maximum under operational conditions due to the reducing aerodynamic loads under operational conditions the minimums of bmy are all positive however under ec4 although the aerodynamic force acting on blades is significantly reduced the inertial forces of the blades nacelle and tower are all transmitted to the tower base resulting in a minimal bmy value of 1 87e5 kn m comparing the absolute values the largest extreme fore aft bending moment at tower base appears under ec2 for nacelle acceleration in x direction the absolute values of the maximum and minimum are almost equal under each condition when the component of gravity acceleration is removed for operational conditions the most significant maximum 1 64 m s 2 and minimum 1 63 m s 2 both occur under ec2 and their absolute values are far away from the limited value of 0 3 g m s 2 under operational conditions dnv 2019 for extreme conditions ec4 shows the most significant maximal and minimal values of 2 09 m s 2 and 1 97 m s 2 respectively the extreme values are both below the limited value of 0 6 g m s 2 under extreme conditions dnv 2019 for the responses such as pitch bmy and nacelle acceleration which are greatly affected by both aerodynamic loads and structural inertia forces the extreme values are highly probable to occur under ec2 and ec4 when checking the reasonability of these physical quantities these two conditions are particularly worthy of attentions for the tower top shear force tfx the most remarkable minimum occurs under the extreme condition as well the existence of the current load varies the platform motion and shows influence on the relative wind speed therefore different from the bmy and nacaccx the maximal values of tfx under ec2 and ec3 are similar therefore the extreme tfx should be carefully checked under the environment with large wind force and current load the maximal and minimal values of the platform surge motions and mooring line tensions under various environmental conditions are all positive so only the maximums are considered fig 30 e and f show that the maximal surge motion and mooring line tension both appear under ec4 for the surge motion and the mooring line tension the large current and wave loads contribute more to the extreme responses than the large wind load so the extreme responses tend to appear under the extreme environmental condition it is worth noting that the pitch motion tower base bending moment nacelle acceleration tower top shear force platform surge motion and the mooring line tension all show slightly smaller extreme values in the presence of yaw error which is consistent with the phenomenon in the theory li et al 2020 when the yaw error exists the windward area of the rotor decreases which obtains smaller aerodynamic thrust in addition fig 30 show that the fluctuation ranges of all measurements are smaller when yaw error exists which is attributed to the larger aerodynamic damping in summary the extreme surge motion nacelle acceleration and mooring line tension are more likely to occur under the most extreme environmental condition while the extreme values of other measurements are seen in the operational conditions it indicates that the performance of floating wind turbine should be investigated and verified under both extreme condition and operational conditions with rated wind speed in addition the extreme values of some essential measurements in the case of yaw error is significant as well so it is also necessary to pay attention to this special condition 6 conclusions a new concept of semi submersible platform with partially inclined side columns was proposed to support the dtu 10 mw wind turbine in the intermediate water depth the dynamic responses of this floating wind turbine concept spic was investigated through the wave basin model test a series of calibration and identification tests were conducted to validate the environmental and model systems the dynamic behaviors including surge motion pitch motion tower top shear force tower base bending moment nacelle acceleration and mooring line tension were examined and compared under various operational and extreme conditions the extreme responses were obtained and compared by applying the mean up crossing method at an up crossing level of 10 4 the natural frequencies of the motions in 6dofs are all away from the wave frequency ranges which makes the spic concept avoid resonating at wave frequencies the mean values of platform surge and pitch motions are mainly dominated by wind loads and current loads the surge variation is dominated by the surge resonant response while the pitch variation is mainly affected by the surge resonant response pitch resonant response and wave frequency response the majority of surge resonant motion is excited by the low frequency wind loads while the pitch resonant motion is mainly caused by the second order difference frequency wave force and can be significantly suppressed by aerodynamic damping the involvement of the current loads can provide additional damping to reduce the surge and pitch responses in low frequency ranges the tower top shear force tower base bending moment and nacelle acceleration are mainly wind induced when wind loads are involved 1p 2p and 3p responses play an important role in the variation of tower top shear force and tower base bending moment the current induced platform motions help to intensify the 1p fluctuation while mitigate the 3p fluctuation the mooring line tension is directly affected by the surge motion which makes the mean value maximal under combined wind wave current condition and the fluctuation maximal under combined wind wave condition in consideration of the extreme responses the maximal pitch motion and tower base bending moment both appear under combined wind wave operational condition and the maximal tower top shear force does not decrease obviously when current is involved the minimums which represent the opposite direction are also essential and they all appear under the extreme condition when checking the reasonability of these responses both extreme condition and operational conditions with rated wind speed are particularly worthy of attentions the extreme values of pitch motion and nacelle acceleration under both operational and extreme conditions do not exceed the limited values recommended in the standard which indicates the reasonability of the spic concept in intermediate water depth the extreme surge motion nacelle acceleration and mooring line tension are most significant under the extreme condition the existence of yaw error slightly decreases the extreme values of all measurements and the fluctuation ranges of these responses in general this study deals with an experimental study on the wind wave and current induced operational response characteristics and extreme response characteristics of the spic concept in intermediate water depth the dynamic behavior of the spic concept is to be further comprehensively studied by using

21426,a floating wind turbine concept named as spic is composed of the dtu 10mw reference wind turbine and a newly designed semi submersible platform featured with three partially inclined side columns the dynamic responses of the spic concept considering an intermediate water depth of 60 m are investigated through the basin model test approach after calibrating the wind and wave conditions and identifying the model wind turbine system the operational and short term extreme responses of the floating wind turbine concept were studied this innovative concept meets reasonable natural period requirements and achieves great stability under design environmental conditions for operational responses low frequency turbulent wind increases the surge resonance response but provides aerodynamic damping to reduce pitch resonance and tower vibration the wind also excites the responses at 1p 2p and 3p frequencies but the current slightly suppress these responses the extreme surge mooring line tension and nacelle acceleration occur under extreme environments while the extreme pitch tower top shear force and tower base bending moment should be examined under operational conditions with rated wind as well these extreme responses are proved to be smaller than the limited values recommended by standards demonstrating the reasonability of the spic concept in intermediate water depth keywords floating wind turbine new concept basin model test operational responses extreme responses 1 introduction offshore floating wind turbines see significant advantages in wind resources service time construction scale and public acceptance liu et al 2016 however the development of the offshore wind industry is currently facing the challenges of high cost in the wind turbine fabrication installation and transportation aspects willis et al 2018 one of the most promising solutions is to achieve higher generating efficiency through upscaling the wind turbines from 5 mw 8 mw to 10 mw and then 12 mw to harness more wind resources igwemezie et al 2019 for example the technical university of denmark dtu developed a 10 mw reference wind turbine bak et al 2013 by upscaling the nrel 5mw wind turbine the dtu 10mw wind turbine has been widely studied another way to reduce the cost is to minimize the distance between the offshore floating wind turbine and the coastline on the basis of ensuring great quality wind field in order to reduce the power transmission cost dai et al 2018 however in some china s sea areas the change of water depth is not obvious as the distance from the coastline increases in such sea areas limited by the transmission distance the water depth of wind turbine installation site is no more than 60 m sahu 2018 these intermediate waters are usually associated with complex wind and wave conditions accordingly the floating support platform usually has higher requirements on stability structural integrity and dynamic behavior for a floating wind turbine concept with a larger turbine size yang et al 2019 therefore it is of great importance to develop novel wind turbine concepts which is suitable for intermediate waters the commonly studied supporting platforms for floating wind turbines consist of spar tension leg platform tlp semi submersible and barge among them tlp semi submersible and barge are feasible for intermediate waters the construction installation and commissioning of a semi submersible wind turbine are more convenient and cost effective than spar and tlp type wind turbines liu et al 2016 therefore a series of semi submersible platforms are designed to support the wind turbine in intermediate waters in 2002 a floating foundation named dutch tri floater was proposed to work in the intermediate water area 50 m bulder et al 2002 it used three hollow columns to provide buoyance and three plates to increase the system damping in 2009 another three legged platform named windfloat designed byroddier et al 2009 was used to carry the 2 mw wind turbine in the water area with depth ranging from 30 m to 50 m one of the three columns was utilized to support the wind turbine and active water ballast system was installed at the bottom of the columns to ensure stability another project named winflo introduced an innovative platform with three inclined columns to carry a two blade wind turbine which can generate 1 mw electric power this platform was planned to be installed at a water depth of 50 m and it does not belong to the commercial wind turbine due to the special marine conditions bossler 2013 these wind turbine concepts were considered to be capable of operating in moderate waters roddier et al 2009 leboulluec et al 2013 koo et al 2014 but the scale of the wind turbine they carry is small which means low power generation in this study a new concept of semi submersible platform with partially inclined columns spic was designed to support the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine the platform features three partially inclined side columns that can provide good stability performance with a relatively small displacement the experimental approach i e model test in a basin is usually carried out to validate the design and to study dynamic performance of a new concept of floating wind turbine in 2010 the 1 105 scaled windfloat model was used in the basin test with an actuator disk to replicate the thrust loads and a spinning mass to simulate gyroscopic loads roddier et al 2010 however only the regular wave condition and 100 year wave condition were chosen in the test in 2011 a series of experiments of the deepcwind semi submersible platform designed in the oc4 project was conducted in marin under different conditions with a water depth of 200 m goupee et al 2012 including free decay irregular wave and wind only conditions in 2014 a braceless semi submersible platform at the depth of 200 m named concrete star wind floater was tested in ecn with a ducked fan replacing the full rotor to simulate wind force azcona et al 2014 the real time platform motion and relative wind speed were measured and transformed into the software fast and the calculated aerodynamic force was realized through the feedback controlled ducted fan this approach described as software in the loop sil could take the effect of the wind turbine control into account but it severely depended on the accuracy of numerical simulation similarly the test method was also implemented on the 5 mw csc platform through the novel actuator and numerical software in marintek at a depth of 6 66 m which corresponds to a prototype depth of 200 m bachynski et al 2016 another basin test of deepcwind was conducted in deepwater offshore basin at shanghai jiao tong university in 2015 the froude scaled blades and performance scaled blades were both used in the test and the dynamic responses were compared bychen et al 2018 the triple spar which was designed for innwind eu project carried the 10 mw reference wind turbine in the water area with depth of 180 m in 2017 a model test at a 1 60 scale was conducted under simultaneous wind and wave loads in dhi denmark with the active blade pitch control for the first time bredmose et al 2017 these model tests simulated the dynamic responses of the deep water floating wind turbines but there are few model tests designed and conducted for floating wind turbines in intermediate waters to validate the design and to investigate the dynamic responses of the spic concept in intermediate water depth a basin model test was conducted in the deepwater offshore basin shanghai jiao tong university in the test the performance scaled blades were used to obtain the physically modeled aerodynamic loads a flexible tower with scaled stiffness was used to mimic the dominant eigen modes of the tower the rotor speed was controlled by an electric motor installed in the nacelle the pitch angle of each blade was adjusted manually and individually for above rated wind speeds a catenary mooring system was adopted to keep the platform in position this study briefly describes the spic floating wind turbine concept and the experimental apparatus in the basin model test responses under selected wind wave and current conditions and yaw error case are also analyzed various extreme responses were evaluated and compared with the limited values recommended by standards to validate the feasibility of spic concept in intermediate water depth 2 description of the spic concept and environmental condition 2 1 spic concept a new concept of floating wind turbine named as spic is addressed in this study this concept as depicted in fig 1 is composed of the dtu 10mw reference wind turbine and a newly designed semi submersible platform featured with three partially inclined side columns it is a complex multibody system including the turbine tower floating platform mooring system etc the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine bak et al 2013 is a three blade upwind horizontal axis turbine with key parameters given in table1 the tower was modified by shortening the dtu 10 mw tower the designed tower has a height of 92 6 m and the outer diameter varying linearly from 7 74 m at the bottom to 5 50 m at the top the tower bottom which connects with the central column of the platform is 23 0 m above the waterline the newly designed semi submersible platform for the spic concept is made up of three partially inclined side columns a central column a submerged pontoon and three circular bracings the configuration is illustrated in fig 2 and the specific parameters are introduced in detail in section3 3 the side column consists of a lower part which is tilted outwards and a connected upper part which stands upright compared with the traditional straight upward side column this innovative design of the outward inclined side column can increase the distance to the central column without changing the displacement so as to ensure more stability although the similar effect can be achieved by increasing the displacement volume or the water line area this innovative structure can achieve great stability and reasonable natural frequency requirements at lower cost the inclined side column is changed to a vertical condition below the water plane so that the wave acting on the vertical column will not cause significant wave run up the conjunction is below the water plane in which case the area of the section at water surface remains invariable in heave motion and the inertia moment of water plane is fixed the submerged pontoon consisting of a hexagonal central pontoon and three divergent rectangular side pontoons connects the bottom end of tilted side columns with the central column the pontoon height is set as 7 m to provide sufficient buoyancy and ensure adequate space for ballast the more detailed configuration has been introduced in the cao et al 2020 a six line catenary mooring system is designed to constrain the platform s motions the layout and properties of the mooring system are illustrated in fig 3 and table2 respectively the mooring lines are divided into three groups which spread 120 degree symmetrically about the center of the platform each group consists of two chains spaced 5 degrees apart the fairleads are located 15 m above the water plane the anchors are fixed on the seabed with a depth of 60 m and radius of 830 m 2 2 environmental condition the spic concept wind turbine system was designed to operate in an intermediate water depth of 60 m this study aims for future possible applications in the south china sea therefore sea conditions of the coast of guangdong province china were selected and studied in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the new concept the parameters of five environmental conditions applied to the wind turbine system are given in table3 the wind wave and current loads were all considered in the design operational and survival sea states two irregular waves follow the jonswap spectrum dnv 2014 significant wave height hs peak wave period tp and peakedness factor γ are listed in the table the rated wind speed is 11 4 m s and an over rated wind speed of 30 0 m s is also employed two different current speeds of 0 5 m s and 1 0 m s were chosen corresponding to the operational and survival sea states respectively for basin test research the effect of current was realized using a mechanical device to exert specified forces acting on the platform the current loads in the model test were seemed as constant values and the loads were simulated through two weights which can provide the applied forces of 549 8 kn and 1099 4 kn respectively the point where the forces were applied is 11 97 m above the baseline of the platform it should be noted that the wind wave and current considered in this study are directionally aligned in the positive x direction according to the coordinate system shown in fig 1 the yaw error condition was considered in ec5 by positively rotating the rotor plane of wind turbine 10 deg around the z axis this case simulated the situation that the rotor of the wind turbine is not perpendicular to the wind direction due to the fault of the control system 3 physical models and experimental apparatus the model test of the spic concept as shown in fig 4 was conducted in the deepwater offshore basin in shanghai jiao tong university at a froude scale of 1 64 the main scale of the basin is 50 m 40 m 10 m two groups of multi unit wave generators were installed in the adjacent side of the basin the basin water depth was set as 0 9375 m corresponding to a full scale water depth of 60 m in this section the physical models and the experimental apparatus used in the basin model test are briefly described including the rotor and nacelle model tower model floater model mooring system model instruments etc 3 1 rotor and nacelle models the basin model test of floating wind turbine is commonly conducted based on froude scaling to satisfy the similarity of the hydrodynamic performance meanwhile a performance matched blade model wen et al 2019 which can realize the thrust and torque similarity at low re numbers was designed to replace the geometry matched blades the airfoil of blade was changed from ffa w3 to sd2030 which has smaller thickness to achieve greater lift and drag coefficients the chord length of each section was increased and the twist angle was optimized on this basis to ensure similar aerodynamic performance for the performance matched rotor the thrust coefficient can well match with that of the prototype for tsr between 7 and 8 wen et al 2019 the condition with rated wind speed was mainly modeled in the test which corresponds to a tsr of 7 6 during the model test the wind speed seen by the rotor varies due to the platform motion leading to a slight change of tsr however the increases and decreases of the relative wind speeds generally do not cause the tsr varying beyond the range between 7 and 8 the span wise load distribution of the performance matched rotor under low re number was compared with that of the full scaled rotor under high re number as shown in fig 5 tsr 7 6 wen et al 2019 it illustrates that the normal forces of the designed rotor match well with those of the full scaled rotor but the tangential forces are less performed therefore the modeling of thrust was considered to be consistently accurate under the rated wind speed condition compared with geometry matched blade performance matched blade model has larger surface area in order to make the length and weight meet the froude scaling law the model blade adopted two carbon fiber layers to form a hollow structure which can be seen in fig 6 the control system of prototypical floating wind turbine consists of a generator torque controller and a collective blade pitch controller in the model test an electric motor which can be seen in fig 7 was installed in the nacelle to control the rotor speed for maximizing thrust and power under below rated wind speed under over rated wind speed the pitch angle of each blade was adjusted manually beforehand individually and the rotor speed was made to remain constant by motor when it was above the cut out wind speed the wind turbine shut down and the blade pitch angle was adjusted to 90 deg 3 2 tower model the tower connects the rotor nacelle structure and the floating platform because the tower plays a role of transmitting aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loads its vibration has a great influence on the dynamic response of the nacelle and platform if the tower is geometrically scaled the rigidity of the structure is too large so as to make the tower a rigid body therefore it is more reasonable to scale the bending stiffness of each model section to simulate the natural frequencies and dominant eigen modes in fore aft and side by side directions correctly the natural frequency of a euler bernoulli beam is given bymartin 2011 in eq 1 1 ω β n l e i l 3 m where β n depends on the boundary condition of tower bottom l denotes the tower height i means the inertia moment of cross section and m symbols the tower mass it was unprocurable to obtain a froude scale stiffness by only scaling the material young modulus the combination of the tower material and geometry were tuned together according to eq 2 zhao et al 2018 2 e i m 1 λ 5 e p i p where λ means the scale ratio the subscript m and p represent model scale and prototype scale respectively the tower length was directly scaled from the full scale length and the boundary condition was maintained similarly the material was chosen as al6063 tube which has the advantages of low density high strength and low elastic modulus the tube is divided into eight cylindric sections the inertia moment of each section should be tuned as well to achieve the target stiffness of the tower model considering the convenience for processing the inner diameter of the tower model is consistent as 20mm the outer diameter of each section is calculated through eq 2 the main parameters of the prototype tower and model tower are listed in table4 3 3 model of semi submersible platform the supporting platform model presented in fig 8 is processed according to the main particulars given in table5 the floater model is made of fiberglass and wood and the connection with the sensor at the bottom of the tower is a flange made of aluminum alloy the total mass the center of gravity and the radius of inertia of the floating wind turbine system are achieved by adjusting the ballast within the side columns and the submerged pontoons the total mass the center of gravity and the radius of inertia of the floating wind turbine system are achieved by adjusting the ballast within the side columns and the submerged pontoons the measured values in prototype were compared with the design parameters in table6 the errors are acceptable which lays the basis for the physical experiments to reproduce the full prototype behaviors properly 3 4 mooring system model the layout of the mooring system in model test was scaled from fig 3 the properties of mooring lines are listed in table7 in the experiment the weight of mooring line was simulated by iron chain and lead wire and the stiffness of mooring line was imitated through spring the experiment did not mimic accurately the outer diameter of each line for the catenary mooring system the restoring force of the mooring system is mainly realized through the weight of suspended sections the ea of the prototype mooring line was scaled to the model scale first in the model test the chain is regarded as inextensible because of its short length so the axial stiffness of mooring lines was imitated through the spring with targeted spring constant k e a l where l is the line length to verify whether the spring position during the physical experiments anchor or fairlead affects the fairlead tension three cases were simulated through numerical modeling case1 model scaled mooring line with spring placed at the anchor case2 model scaled mooring line with spring placed at the fairlead case3 full scaled mooring line and the fairlead tensions of six lines were recorded under ten different offsets the relationships between offsets and fairlead tensions under three different cases are illustrated in fig 9 the results of case2 are close to the results of case3 with the mean relative differences smaller than 1 the results of case1 are slightly larger than those of case3 and the mean relative differences are around 2 this indicates that the spring position during the physical experiments has a slight influence on the fairlead tension and the results obtained when the spring is located at the fairlead are closer to the full scaled results therefore the spring was located at the fairlead of the mooring line in the model test 3 5 instrument a series of sensors were arranged in the model test to accurately measure the motions and forces of the floating wind turbine system in fig 7 a six component force sensor was installed between the nacelle and the tower top to measure the force and moment an accelerometer was located under the nacelle to capture the accelerations of the nacelle in three directions there were also a series of sensors arranged on the floating platform which can be seen in fig 10 another six component force sensor was arranged under the tower base the fairlead tension of each mooring line could be measured through the single component load cell the non contact optical motion capture system was used to acquire the motion of floating wind turbine system in six degrees of freedom 6dofs in addition the wave gauges and hot wire anemometers were used to measure the wave elevation and inflow wind speed respectively the manufacturer and type for each measurement instrument can be referred to in table8 the layout of the physical experiments is depicted in fig 11 the positions of wave generators wave absorbing beaches wind generator wind turbine model and wave gauges are all illustrated in the basin plant view among them wave gauge 1 was used in the wave calibration stage while wave gauge 2 was used in both wave calibration stage and model test stage the coordinate systems used in the model test is presented in fig 12 the global x axis is positive towards the downwind direction of the wind turbine and the global z axis is positive upward the origin is located at the center of the waterplane the definition of wind and wave directions is also given in fig 12 the positive direction of 6dof forces and moments for the tower top and tower base load cells as well as 3 dof accelerations are also shown in the diagram 4 system calibration and identification for the model test before carrying out the basin model test of the spic concept calibration of the environmental conditions and identification of the floating wind turbine system are required and conducted in order to simulate the environment and to capture the dynamic response characteristics properly 4 1 wind field calibration the purpose built wind generating system was adopted in this experiment as shown in fig 13 the system was composed of twenty variable frequency axial fans arranged in four rows and five columns with an effective wind generation area of 4 0 m 3 2 m and a wind speed variation range of 0 15m s in order to increase the uniformity of wind speed a honeycomb network was installed in the front of the wind generation system for rectification the wind speed measurement was realized by multi channel hot wire anemometers arranged perpendicular to the incoming flow direction of the wind field the sampling frequency was set to 1000hz and the acquisition time was three minutes the origin of the coordinate system o xyz referred to by the measurement points is at the hub height the positive x axis is along the wind direction and the positive directions of y axis and z axis are defined in fig 13 the wind field quality is critical to obtaining reliable measurements and to determining the proper location of models taking the target model scaled wind speed of 1 4 m s as an example the mean value and turbulence intensity of wind speed in xoz plane is shown in fig 14 in model scale the horizontal x axis of the graph represents the distance between the wind measurement points and the wind generating system and the vertical axis means the measuring position relative to the hub height and the red dash line represents the range of the wind field covered by the rotor according to the measurement results the wind field non uniformity was serious near the wind generating system the wind speed at the central axis of each fan was large and the wind speed at the junction of the two rows of fans was small in addition the wind speed decreased and the turbulence intensity increased at the upper and lower boundary of the wind field which was caused by the open flow space however the average wind speed and turbulence intensity had a good uniformity when the measurement points were at the area 4 m or farer away from the wind generating system the district 4 m 5 5 m away from the wind generation system was the optimal wind field area according to the structural characteristics of the tank bottom x 4 6 m was then selected to further explore the wind field characteristics 49 measurement points were evenly distributed in a square area with side length of 3 2 m taking the target wind speed of 1 4 m s for instance the wind speed distribution of the section is obtained as shown in fig 15 the red circle in the figure is the outline of the rotor in this area the wind speed and turbulence intensity were uniform at approximately 1 4 m s and 11 respectively after determining the selected plane for spacing wind turbine system five probes were arranged around and in the center of the rotor coverage area to calibrate the corresponding relationship between the wind speed um and the rotating speed n of the axial flow fan the relevant characteristics of the wind field are shown in fig 16 it can be observed that the output wind speed was in linear relationship with the rotating speed of the axial flow fan so the output wind speed could be controlled after the wind calibration in the rotor plane the rotor thrusts caused by different wind speeds should be measured and compared with the theoretical thrust to ensure the aerodynamic performance of the blade model the rotor plane was installed at x 4 6 m and the hub position was set as y 0 m z 0 m the steady winds with different speeds were generated in turn by the wind generating system and applied to the rotor different from the experimental model used in the basin test a rigid tower made of steel was used to replace the flexible tower the rigid tower was fixed on land and connected to the nacelle through a force sensor as shown in fig 17 the six component force sensor on the tower top can measure the tower top shear force in the x direction a fixed rigid tower can ensure that the rotor did not tilt so that the measured tower top shear force did not have the gravity component due to the nacelle and rotor in this study the main focus was on the rated wind speed the aerodynamic thrust under the rated wind speed was measured and proved to be accurate through the on land calibration test 4 2 wave calibration at the deepwater offshore basin in shanghai jiao tong university two adjacent rows of wave generators generate the target waves and the wave absorbing beaches are installed on the opposite sides to eliminate the reflected waves as shown in fig 11 waves propagate into the wave absorbing beach and then outward the outlet boundary smoothly without any evident reflection zhao et al 2017 verified that the performance of the wave absorbing beach at this basin in suppressing reflected waves was satisfactory prior to mounting the floating wind turbine model in the basin wave calibration was conducted first the wave elevation was measured through the wave gauge 1 at the center of model to be installed and the wave elevation at the position three meters away from the wind turbine model was measured by wave gauge 2 as shown in fig 10 during the model test only the wave gauge 2 was utilized to monitor the wave the measured values of wave gauge 1 in wave calibration and measured values of wave gauge 2 in model test are compared with the targeted values of h s and t p as listed in table9 in full scale both two irregular waves show small differences in hs and tp between the target and measured the measured wave spectra of two irregular waves are compared with the target spectra in fig 18 it shows a great agreement between the theoretical and measured wave spectra and the existence of the wind turbine model shows little effect on the generated waves 4 3 hammer test the natural frequencies of the tower model in the fore aft and side to side directions should be properly modeled this can be validated by conducting the hammer tests to check whether the dominant eigen modes of the tower are captured in the model in the hammer test an accelerometer was used to measure the vibration acceleration of the model tower duan et al 2016 the tower was connected to the land via a load cell the rotor model nacelle model and other sensors were included in the hammer test configuration the impulse excitation acted on the tower top in fore aft and side side directions respectively the time series of the vibration induced accelerations were recorded and scaled to the prototype the power spectral density psd of tower vibration acceleration was then obtained and the frequency corresponding to the spectral peak represented the natural frequency of the tower the first order natural frequencies of the tower in the two directions are measured as about 2 0 rad s and 2 1 rad s respectively the designed tower is obtained by shortening 23 meters of the dtu 10mw tower from the tower base and the theoretical value of the first order natural frequency is about 2 0 rad s this implies that the tower vibration modes are correctly modeled in the model test 4 4 horizontal restoring stiffness surge offset test was conducted to identify the horizontal restoring stiffness of the mooring system model a series of initial offsets in the positive surge direction was applied to the wind turbine model through a line tied to the platform and the surge restoring forces were measured and recorded through a load sensor between the line and the platform a horizontal restoring stiffness curve can thus be derived from the measured force displacement relationship the derived horizontal restoring stiffness curve was then transformed to the full scale and compared with the target curve as shown in fig 19 the targeted relationship between the horizontal restoring force and offset was obtained through numerical simulations in orcaflex orcina 2015 the measurement results are in good agreement with the target it can be found that the force offset relationship is fairly linear when the offset is less than 15 m and becomes slightly non linear for the offset larger than 15 m the tension shows a nonlinear behavior for large x offsets which is a typical characteristic for the catenary mooring system and it is more obvious for shallower water depth xu et al 2018 4 5 free decay test free decay tests were conducted to identify the natural periods of the 6dof motions of the system the target natural periods were calculated by numerical decay simulations in orcaflex orcina 2015 in both numerical simulations and model tests an initial displacement was applied to the floating wind turbine model for each dof the time series of the surge sway heave pitch roll and yaw motions were acquired the number of zero crossing periods of the time history curve is m and each zero up crossing period is denoted as t i the mean zero up crossing period t 0 is expressed as i 1 m t i m the measured and target natural periods of the 6dofs motions of the spic concept wind turbine are listed in table10 dnvgl recommended practice dnv 2019 gives the typical ranges of natural periods for semi submersible floating foundation of wind turbine as also shown in table10 the natural periods of 6dof motions are all simulated accurately and belong to the reasonable ranges which means they are all away from the wave period ranges the non dimensional damping coefficient of free decay motion can be obtained through 3 μ 1 2 π l n φ a i φ a i 1 where φ a i and φ a i 1 are the i th and i 1 th peak or valley values of the decay curve according to the measured free decay curves the dimensionless damping of the spic concept wind turbine in 6dofs are obtained which are also given in table10 5 results and discussions the basin model test cases included wave only combined wind wave and combined wind wave current conditions to examine the operational responses and extreme responses of spic concept wind turbine in intermediate water depth each test case lasts for approximately 25min which corresponds to three hours in full scale the first 90s of recorded data of each test was removed to eliminate the transient effect the sampling frequency was set to 50hz all the results below are given in full scale 5 1 response amplitude operator rao in order to investigate the dynamic responses of the spic concept floating wind turbine under different wave periods in intermediate water depth the white noise wave test was conducted the significant wave height was determined as 5 m and the wave period ranged from 5 s to 20 s the response amplitude operators raos can be obtained through the calculation of measured motion spectra and wave spectra the raos of pitch surge and heave motions are shown in fig 20 there is no peak in the wave frequency range of pitch and surge raos only the heave response is slightly excited in the wave frequency range pitch surge and heave raos all exhibit significant low frequency performance the raos of these three motions show obvious peaks at their respective natural frequencies which correspond to the results of free decay tests the surge motion has an obvious influence on the pitch motion which explains the obvious spectral peak at the surge resonance frequency in the pitch rao 5 2 operational response analysis three operational conditions i e ec1 ec2 and ec3 were chosen to investigate the dynamic response characteristics of the spic concept wind turbine in intermediate water depth ec1 is operational wave only case to examine the effect of wave loads in intermediate water ec2 with rated wind speed and operational wave was compared with ec1 to obtain the effect of the wind loads on the wind turbine system on the basis of combined wind wave test ec3 with the collinear current can reflect the effect of current loads the mean values and standard deviations std of the dynamic responses under these three operational conditions are listed in table11 5 2 1 platform motions since the configuration of the spic concept is symmetric and the wind wave and current are along the positive x direction the surge and pitch motions of the floater are thus most significant among the 6dof motions the time series of the surge and pitch motions under ec1 ec3 are illustrated in figs 21 a and 22 a it should be noted that these time series are presented here in a short period i e from 500 s to 800 s but full time series are used for statistical and spectral analyses under ec1 the mean pitch motion is basically zero the mean surge motion is slightly greater than zero due to the effect of mean drift force when the wind load is added the mean values of surge and pitch motion increase to approximately 7 70 m and 3 69 deg respectively this indicates that the effect of wind loads on the mean values of the surge and pitch responses are relatively significant compared with the effect of wave loads when the current load is further applied on the wind turbine the mean surge reaches 11 95 m this current load plays an important role in the mean surge position of the floating wind turbine however the mean pitch position decreases to 2 54 deg compared with the ec2 this is because of the opposite direction of the moment applied by current and wind loads on the wind turbine significant fluctuations occur in the surge and pitch time series under ec1 and ec2 because the involvement of varying wave loads and the fluctuations of the time history curves are nearly identical under ec1 and ec2 when the current is involved in the variation of surge motion is significantly reduced and the fluctuation of pitch motion is slightly smoother in order to illustrate the fluctuation of the dynamic responses in detail the power spectrum densities psd were investigated by the fast fourier transform fft method the psd of surge and pitch motions are shown in figs 21 b and 22 b for indicating the contribution of different frequency components to the variations of surge and pitch motions for platform surge motion the low frequency component dominates obviously there is an obvious peak appearing in the low frequency range under either ec1 or ec2 this response appears at the natural frequency of surge motion actually this surge resonant responses are induced by second order difference frequency wave loads and or low frequency turbulent wind loads moreover the surge resonant response under ec2 is slightly larger than that under ec1 this is mainly caused by the turbulence of inflow wind there is a low frequency variation in the wind velocity produced by the wind generation system a turbulence intensity exists under the mean wind speed of 11 4 m s under the action of low frequency wind load more powers are stimulated at the extremely low natural frequency of surge motion when the current load is applied the low frequency spectral peak is significantly suppressed the possible reason is that the damping of the floating wind turbine system in the low frequency range is very small and the current load provides additional damping during the model test the current load is modeled by a mechanical device by exerting a steady force externally under ec3 the current load is about 549 8 kn under the actions of wind and waves this current load mainly provides damping force which contributes to the decrease of the surge resonant responses at the low frequency under ec3 as a result the low frequency spectral peak is significantly suppressed for power spectra of pitch motions shown in fig 22 b three obvious peaks are observed under ec1 the spectral peaks appear at surge resonant frequency pitch resonant frequency and wave frequency range respectively this implies that the surge and pitch motion are strongly coupled and the pitch motion is affected by the surge for ec2 these three spectral peaks also exist in the power spectrum a slightly larger wave frequency response is observed under ec2 and ec3 compared to that under ec1 theoretically the presence of wind does not change the platform motion response in wave frequency cao et al 2019 however in model test the wind field had an impact on the wave generation to demonstrate that the difference in responses was caused by the existence of wind the wave spectra for ec1 ec2 and ec3 are compared in fig 23 it can be seen that the spectral peaks under ec2 and ec3 are identical and they are both a little higher than the peak under ec1 the significant wave height increases by approximately 3 2 when the wind is applied the wind made the waves slightly higher which resulted in slightly larger pitch motion within the wave frequency range ec2 gives a slightly larger surge resonant response than the ec1 due to the contribution from low frequency turbulent wind on the contrary the pitch resonant response is restrained significantly when wind loads are considered mainly due to the aerodynamic damping for ec3 the spectral peaks at surge and pitch natural frequencies are both suppressed significantly current loads can effectively reduce the power of low frequency motion of floating wind turbine in addition a fourth peak can be seen under ec2 and ec3 at about 1 rad s which is the rotating frequency 1p of rotor because the wind field is not completely uniform the blades do not experience exactly the same wind load everywhere during the rotation therefore the rotor rotation shows an influence on the pitch motion and the current load also has a slight suppression of the power at 1p 5 2 2 tower top shear force and tower base bending moment the tower top bears aerodynamic force induced by inflow wind inertia force caused by the acceleration of the rotor and nacelle and hydrodynamic force transmitted from platform etc the tower top shear force tfx which is aligned with wind wave and current loads is of great importance the tower base bears the force transformed from the tower top through the tower structure and the hydrodynamic force acted on the floating platform the tower base bending moment bmy caused by the environmental loads in x direction is addressed here as well in table11 the mean values of tower top shear force and tower base bending moment are both around zero when only wave load acts on the floating wind turbine under the operational wave and rated wind speed the mean values of tfx and bmy rise to 1 69e3 kn and 1 78e5 kn m due to the increasing aerodynamic force when current load is further applied the mean values decrease slightly compared with those under ec1 the stds of tfx and bmy are larger under the other two conditions the power spectra of tfx and bmy are shown in fig 24 and fig 25 respectively in both figures the wave frequency response is dominant when irregular waves are considered in the low frequency range the turbulent wind induced low frequency responses are also observed but its contribution to the total variation of tower top shear force and tower base bending moment is much smaller than the wave frequency response besides notable peaks at approximately 1 rad s and 3 rad s are excited under ec2 and ec3 these two frequencies correspond to the 1p and 3p frequencies respectively the 3p response excited also attributes to the dissymmetry of blade rotation in model test in addition the non uniform and unsteady aerodynamic loads on each blade during the rotation might cause very small 2p fluctuations at a frequency of about 2 rad s it is due to the imperfect installation of blades when assembling the blades and the rotating hub this gives rise to the differences in blade pitch angles for these three blades when the control strategy with fixed blade pitch angles was used in the experiments the spectral peaks of tfx and bmy at the 2p frequency and 3p frequency are both relatively lower when current loads are involved in the wave excitation induces the 6dof motions of the platform and accordingly gives rise to the unsteady wind inflow for the blades during one rotation each blade experiences different wind inflow and suffers varying aerodynamic loads however the existence of current load mitigates this effect on the basis of wave excitation as a result the 2p and 3p fluctuations are mitigated both due to the current induced suppression of platform motions an additional spectral peak can be seen at 2 6 rad s under wave only condition which is indicated to be the natural frequency of tower in hammer test the bottom of the tower has a rigid and fixed boundary condition it changes to an elastic boundary when connecting to the platform which moves in the waves this results in a change in the natural frequency of the tower vibration from 2 rad s to 2 6 rad s when wind loads are added under ec2 and ec3 the spectral peak is suppressed obviously due to the aerodynamic damping 5 2 3 nacelle acceleration the acceleration of the mechanical facilities installed in the nacelle is of concern and should below a limited value in order to ensure the safe operation of the facilities because the external environmental loads acting on the wind turbine are in the x direction the acceleration of the nacelle in the x direction in the local coordinate system nacaccx is mainly analyzed under the individual excitation of wave loads it can be observed from table11 that the mean value of nacelle acceleration in x direction is zero as predicted and the mean values are still zero when wind loads and current loads are applied under ec2 and ec3 the gravitational component caused by the wind induced and current induced pitch moments are excluded from the measured data so the mean value of zero is reasonable besides the stds of nacaccx are significant for all three environments the power spectra of nacaccx are illustrated in fig 26 for parked condition with individual wave load the power within the range of wave frequency dominates the nacaccx spectrum which is induced by the linear wave force when wind and current loads are added the response of nacelle fore aft acceleration does not show any variation in wave frequency the power excited at pitch natural frequency and tower vibration frequency is suppressed due to the aerodynamic damping while the power excited at surge natural frequency is more obvious attributing to the low frequency variation of turbulent wind speed in addition an obvious spectral peak can be seen at 3p frequency when wind load is applied and the power of nacelle acceleration in x direction at 3p frequency is suppressed under the influence of current load however almost no power is excited at 1p and 2p frequencies it is because the 1p and 2p frequencies are close to the wave frequency range the peaks at 1p and 2p frequencies of the power spectrum of the nacelle acceleration are alleviated or even damped out by potential damping 5 2 4 mooring line tension the mooring lines distributed in front of the wind turbine line3 line6 sustain the tension caused by the environmental loads the statistics in table11 shows that the mean tensions of these four mooring lines increase with the surge motion conversely the mean forces of line1 and line2 distributed at the rear of the platform are reduced the maximum loads occurred at the line4 and line5 due to the orientation of the platform and the direction of the environmental loads the fairlead tension of line4 was investigated in detail as an example fig 27 a shows the time history of the mooring line tension of line4 under three operational conditions under ec1 the mean value of fairlead tension is about 625 02 kn the time history curve of fairlead tension shows a similar period of fluctuation to that of surge motion under ec2 and ec3 the mean value increases to 1040 33 kn and 1266 78 kn respectively when the pretension is deducted the mean mooring line tensions under ec1 ec3 present a good linear relationship with the mean surge motions under ec1 ec3 it proves that the fairlead tension of mooring line is directly related to the hydrodynamic force in surge direction in addition the mooring line tensions under ec2 and ec3 fluctuate more violently and complicatedly compared with the variation of surge motion under these two conditions in order to analyze the power distribution of mooring line tension fluctuation under three different conditions the psd curves are given in fig 27 b it can be seen that the spectral peak of fairlead tension appears at the surge natural frequency and presents largest value under ec2 which is the same as the spectral characteristics of surge motion besides under ec2 and ec3 the power is excited in all the frequency range uniformly this phenomenon is caused by the wind load which also has power distributions in other frequencies outside the low frequencies 5 3 extreme response analysis 5 3 1 short term extreme value estimation method the extreme responses of floating wind turbine including extreme motion responses and extreme structural responses are of great concern the short term extreme values of these dynamic responses are considered based on the mean up crossing rate naess and moan 2013 which is an important parameter for reliability assessment in an arbitrary time interval t if the dynamic response is not narrow banded the up crossing is statistically independent at high levels under this condition it can be assumed that the random number of the up crossing is approximately independent on poisson distribution the extreme value of random process y t in the interval t is expressed as m t then the extreme value distribution of m t is described as 4 p m t y exp 0 t v y t d t where v y t indicates the up crossing rate corresponding to level y which means the average frequency of the positive slope crossing of the level y the probability of m t exceeding the defined level y is then expressed as 5 p m t y 1 exp v y t where v can be obtained through 6 v y 1 t 0 t v y t d t the mean up crossing rate can be estimated through the time series of dynamic responses during the time interval t the number of up crossing of level y is defined as n y t then for k time series of interval t the sample mean up crossing rate is 7 v ˆ

for floating wind turbines extreme responses may occur under rated wind conditions or extreme wind conditions i e ec2 ec5 extreme responses under these two wind conditions are evaluated for the floating wind turbine concept in this section four ecs are considered here ec2 ec3 and ec5 are operational condition associated with rated wind and operational wave condition ec4 is extreme condition with extreme sea state and the turbine is parked in this study the extreme structural and motion responses of floating wind turbine were estimated three independent test realizations with a duration of one hour were considered the up crossing rates of 10 4 is chosen and used to estimate the extreme responses this up crossing level corresponds to the probability of exceedance of approximately 30 according to eq 5 fig 28 presents the mean up crossing rate with ci and the extrapolation at extremely low levels of the tower base fore aft bending moment under ec2 as an example it shows that the extrapolation of the mean up crossing rate v y becomes unstable in the tail region therefore the fitted up crossing rate v f i t y is used to estimate the extreme response at the level of 10 4 in order to clearly show the mean up crossing rate and its extrapolation value of the response under four ecs the bending moment is taken as an example for comparison in fig 29 it can be seen that the mean up crossing rate decreases with the increase of tower base bending moment among which the value under ec3 decreases the fastest while the value under ec4 decreases the slowest since ec2 ec3 and ec5 are operational conditions the mean up crossing rate curves are very close at the level of 10 4 ec2 produces the most dangerous positive bending moment around the y axis followed by ec5 and ec3 and under the extreme condition ec4 the extreme response appears relatively smaller in this way the extreme response among different environmental conditions can be compared by using the mean up crossing rate fig 30 shows the extreme responses of the spic concept wind turbine calculated by the mean up crossing rate method the extreme response means the value corresponding to the probability of exceedance of approximately 30 in the figure the red and black bars represent the maximums and minimums respectively dynamic responses such as tower base bending moment tower top shear force acceleration of nacelle and pitch motion present both positive and negative values during the time interval the negative values represent the responses in the opposite direction which is of equal importance the maximum and minimum are used to evaluate the extreme response in positive and negative directions respectively the extreme responses under ec2 ec5 are compared to examine the effect of environmental loads and yaw error the maximal value of pitch motion under ec2 and ec5 reaches approximately 4 5 deg and 4 1 deg respectively the involvement of current load in ec3 decreases the value to 3 2 deg under ec4 when the turbine is parked the aerodynamic loads decreases greatly under the action of significantly large current load and small aerodynamic load the maximum is only 0 6 deg while the minimum arrives at 4 3 deg recommended practice dnv 2019 stipulates that the limited value of pitch motion in operational conditions and extreme conditions shall not exceed 10 deg and 15 deg respectively the extreme pitch motion of spic is much less than the limited value under each condition the maximum tower base fore aft bending moments present similar values under ec2 ec3 and ec5 which are induced by the same wind condition under extreme condition the maximal value of bmy even reduces to approximately half of the maximum under operational conditions due to the reducing aerodynamic loads under operational conditions the minimums of bmy are all positive however under ec4 although the aerodynamic force acting on blades is significantly reduced the inertial forces of the blades nacelle and tower are all transmitted to the tower base resulting in a minimal bmy value of 1 87e5 kn m comparing the absolute values the largest extreme fore aft bending moment at tower base appears under ec2 for nacelle acceleration in x direction the absolute values of the maximum and minimum are almost equal under each condition when the component of gravity acceleration is removed for operational conditions the most significant maximum 1 64 m s 2 and minimum 1 63 m s 2 both occur under ec2 and their absolute values are far away from the limited value of 0 3 g m s 2 under operational conditions dnv 2019 for extreme conditions ec4 shows the most significant maximal and minimal values of 2 09 m s 2 and 1 97 m s 2 respectively the extreme values are both below the limited value of 0 6 g m s 2 under extreme conditions dnv 2019 for the responses such as pitch bmy and nacelle acceleration which are greatly affected by both aerodynamic loads and structural inertia forces the extreme values are highly probable to occur under ec2 and ec4 when checking the reasonability of these physical quantities these two conditions are particularly worthy of attentions for the tower top shear force tfx the most remarkable minimum occurs under the extreme condition as well the existence of the current load varies the platform motion and shows influence on the relative wind speed therefore different from the bmy and nacaccx the maximal values of tfx under ec2 and ec3 are similar therefore the extreme tfx should be carefully checked under the environment with large wind force and current load the maximal and minimal values of the platform surge motions and mooring line tensions under various environmental conditions are all positive so only the maximums are considered fig 30 e and f show that the maximal surge motion and mooring line tension both appear under ec4 for the surge motion and the mooring line tension the large current and wave loads contribute more to the extreme responses than the large wind load so the extreme responses tend to appear under the extreme environmental condition it is worth noting that the pitch motion tower base bending moment nacelle acceleration tower top shear force platform surge motion and the mooring line tension all show slightly smaller extreme values in the presence of yaw error which is consistent with the phenomenon in the theory li et al 2020 when the yaw error exists the windward area of the rotor decreases which obtains smaller aerodynamic thrust in addition fig 30 show that the fluctuation ranges of all measurements are smaller when yaw error exists which is attributed to the larger aerodynamic damping in summary the extreme surge motion nacelle acceleration and mooring line tension are more likely to occur under the most extreme environmental condition while the extreme values of other measurements are seen in the operational conditions it indicates that the performance of floating wind turbine should be investigated and verified under both extreme condition and operational conditions with rated wind speed in addition the extreme values of some essential measurements in the case of yaw error is significant as well so it is also necessary to pay attention to this special condition 6 conclusions a new concept of semi submersible platform with partially inclined side columns was proposed to support the dtu 10 mw wind turbine in the intermediate water depth the dynamic responses of this floating wind turbine concept spic was investigated through the wave basin model test a series of calibration and identification tests were conducted to validate the environmental and model systems the dynamic behaviors including surge motion pitch motion tower top shear force tower base bending moment nacelle acceleration and mooring line tension were examined and compared under various operational and extreme conditions the extreme responses were obtained and compared by applying the mean up crossing method at an up crossing level of 10 4 the natural frequencies of the motions in 6dofs are all away from the wave frequency ranges which makes the spic concept avoid resonating at wave frequencies the mean values of platform surge and pitch motions are mainly dominated by wind loads and current loads the surge variation is dominated by the surge resonant response while the pitch variation is mainly affected by the surge resonant response pitch resonant response and wave frequency response the majority of surge resonant motion is excited by the low frequency wind loads while the pitch resonant motion is mainly caused by the second order difference frequency wave force and can be significantly suppressed by aerodynamic damping the involvement of the current loads can provide additional damping to reduce the surge and pitch responses in low frequency ranges the tower top shear force tower base bending moment and nacelle acceleration are mainly wind induced when wind loads are involved 1p 2p and 3p responses play an important role in the variation of tower top shear force and tower base bending moment the current induced platform motions help to intensify the 1p fluctuation while mitigate the 3p fluctuation the mooring line tension is directly affected by the surge motion which makes the mean value maximal under combined wind wave current condition and the fluctuation maximal under combined wind wave condition in consideration of the extreme responses the maximal pitch motion and tower base bending moment both appear under combined wind wave operational condition and the maximal tower top shear force does not decrease obviously when current is involved the minimums which represent the opposite direction are also essential and they all appear under the extreme condition when checking the reasonability of these responses both extreme condition and operational conditions with rated wind speed are particularly worthy of attentions the extreme values of pitch motion and nacelle acceleration under both operational and extreme conditions do not exceed the limited values recommended in the standard which indicates the reasonability of the spic concept in intermediate water depth the extreme surge motion nacelle acceleration and mooring line tension are most significant under the extreme condition the existence of yaw error slightly decreases the extreme values of all measurements and the fluctuation ranges of these responses in general this study deals with an experimental study on the wind wave and current induced operational response characteristics and extreme response characteristics of the spic concept in intermediate water depth the dynamic behavior of the spic concept is to be further comprehensively studied by using

21427,this paper designs a novel double closed loop three dimensional 3 d trajectory tracking method based on model predictive control mpc for an autonomous underwater vehicle auv under external disturbances different from the conventional model predictive control the designed double closed loop control can be divided into two stages 1 the outer loop controller generates the desired speed instruction and passes it to the inner loop speed controller 2 the inner loop speed controller generates the available control inputs to ensure the whole closed loop trajectory tracking in the controller design stage the actual constraints on system inputs and state are effectively considered in order to ensure the smooth operation of auv the double closed loop controller takes the control increments as the control inputs in addition the stability analysis based on lyapunov method proves the nominal stability of the controller finally simulation experiments are designed to verify the tracking performance of the auv under external disturbances the results show the effectiveness of the controller keywords autonomous underwater vehicle fully actuated system model predictive control trajectory tracking 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicle auv is an important tool for human exploration and observation of the ocean in the past two decades auv is widely used in deep sea exploration zhang et al 2015 natural hydrothermal vent observation sato et al 2014 and oil spill monitoring choyekh et al 2015 auv improves the ability of human exploration while reducing the risks that human beings originally need to face in order to ensure that the auv can complete various special underwater tasks efficiently and accurately it is necessary to carry out further research on the 3 d space motion control technology yu et al 2019 however auv is a typical nonlinear strongly coupled system since parameters such as hydrodynamic parameters are difficult to be accurately solved and the working environment is complex the motion of auv is greatly affected by the uncertainty of model parameters and external interference the control of auv has always been a research hotspot in the field of control trajectory tracking is the basis and premise for auv to perform various tasks the controller is designed to drive the auv to accurately track the time varying trajectory from the initial state that is the spatial position error and velocity error converge to zero it emphasizes the simultaneous satisfaction in the relationship between time and space and has strong time constraints on the task state up to now scholars from all over the world have done a lot of research on the auv trajectory tracking and many classical control methods have been promoted for example lyapunov direct method backstepping control model predictive control mpc sliding mode control neural network and robust adaptive control etc since auv is a multi input and multi output system the lyapunov function is constructed through iterative recursion by using backstepping control which can simplify the design of complex control system step by step by combining lyapunov method with backstepping control the velocity estimation of the vehicle is realized and the problem of output feedback control which auv speed feedback unfeasible is solved liu et al 2009 du et al 2011 xia et al 2015 in 2014 sun et al 2014 proposed a filtering backstepping control method based on the biological inspired model which not only avoids the frequent derivation of virtual control variables but also avoids the phenomenon of jumping in the vehicle s speed response even if there is a large initial position tracking error unfortunately the backstepping control itself does not have the ability to solve the uncertainty of system parameters and external disturbances other robust adaptive technologies are integrated to ensure the effectiveness of the controller in the uncertainty of the system the advantage of sliding mode control is that the state of the system can reach and slide along the sliding mode surface in a finite time by switching the control variables and it is invariant under parameter perturbation and external environment disturbance cheng et al 2007 in 2015 kim et al 2015 proposed an anti saturation integral sliding mode controller to solve the modeling error and unknown environmental disturbance of uuv the equivalent control law and the switching control law are integrated to ensure the exponential stability of the trajectory tracking control system in 2019 qiao and zhang 2019 designed the non singular terminal sliding mode controller and further utilized the respective advantages of integral sliding mode and terminal sliding mode on the basis of the original controller and proposed the double closed loop integral terminal sliding mode control to improve the convergence and ensure the control accuracy however the sliding mode control method may cause a kind of undesirable high frequency oscillation called chattering on the sliding mode surface resulting in low control precision and high energy consumption hammad et al 2017 the introduction of fuzzy function and neural network can improve the adaptive learning ability of the system wang and er 2016 and hassanein et al 2016 respectively designed direct adaptive and model based fuzzy controllers in 2016 sun and ge 2014 and zhao et al 2014 respectively adopted neural network adaptive control in 2014 to solve the 3 dof uuv horizontal trajectory tracking since then the learning ability of neural networks has also been fully explored for example dai et al 2014 2016 designed adaptive neural network output feedback controllers in 2014 and 2016 in 2017 cui et al 2017 considered the problem of control input nonlinearity and proposed neural network control with enhanced learning however the fuzzy logic and the performance of neural network adaptive controller depend heavily on fuzzy rules and the number of neural network nodes resulting in a large amount of system computation which is not conducive to the practical application of engineering robust adaptive technology can modify and maintain the performance of the controller for system parameter perturbation and disturbance dynamics and it is also widely used in auv trajectory tracking control in 2016 sarhadi et al 2016 integrated the anti saturation compensator into the adaptive control design to solve the problem of uuv model uncertainty and propeller saturation and proposed the model reference adaptive pid controller in 2018 verma et al 2018 proposed a discrete adaptive controller to minimize the uncertainty of online parameter estimation due to the difficulty in accurately obtaining the uuv hydrodynamic coefficient in a time varying marine environment in addition zhao and guo 2018 constructed a novel extended state observer based on non smooth function in 2018 to estimate the system uncertainties and the state information of the vehicle its adaptive control performance is significantly better than the existing linear extended state observer scheme however in practical applications the external disturbances suffered by auv are usually time varying and the system parameters cannot be accurately obtained with the difference of motion state tasks model predictive control can be optimized by predicting the future system state and output processing real time interference in time ensuring the tracking performance and closed loop system stability in 2017 shen et al 2017 proposed a novel receding horizon control rhc scheme to solve the problem of planning and tracking the planar trajectory of uuv and gave the stability condition of uuv trajectory tracking control based on mpc for the first time in 2018 fan et al 2018 proposed to use mpc to correct the vehicle s motion state and system output online in the process of autonomous underwater recovery of uuv and combined with kalman filter navigation guidance algorithm to estimate and compensate ocean currents in real time in 2019 zhang et al 2019 proposed a model prediction controller with the speed increment as the control input taking into account the input constraint and state constraint at the same time and conducted simulation verification under various interferences the author uses kinematics as a framework to design a controller that inversely seeks control forces through velocity on the one hand the control force is not conducive to acting on the thrusters on the other hand this controller design lacks proof of stability in this paper the trajectory tracking problem of auv is analyzed and a novel double closed loop controller based on mpc is designed in order to provide robustness and adaptability the designed double closed loop mpc controller consisting of position loop and speed loop ensures accurate tracking of time varying trajectories to ensure the smooth operation of the auv the control increment is taken as the input of the inner loop and the outer loop the actual constraints of system input and state are fully considered in the design of the controller and the trajectory tracking problem is transformed into a standard quadratic programming problem with constraints that can be calculated online when the auv moves to a new position the optimal input for the next moment is recalculated according to the current state and expectations therefore the auv can still complete the target tracking task well under the complex ocean environments to prove the effectiveness of the controller the tracking simulation results are given the simulation results prove the effectiveness of the designed controller the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 gives the mathematical model for fully actuated auv section 3 presents the control block diagram of double closed loop mpc and designs the mpc controller in detail section 4 demonstrates the stability of the controller simulation results and conclusions are given in section 5 and 6 respectively 2 auv model 2 1 kinematic model to study the motion model of underwater robot the motion of underwater robot is approximated to the general motion of rigid body in fluid according to the origin of the coordinate system the coordinate system is divided into fixed coordinate system e ξ η ζ and motion coordinate system o x y z the former is defined as a fixed point on the earth while the latter is defined as auv the coordinate system satisfies the right hand cartesian rectangular coordinate system the positive direction is north east and down as shown in fig 1 the fixed coordinate system e ξ η ζ describes the auv s spatial position and attitude η ξ η

r is defined in a motion coordinate system where u v w are the longitudinal transverse vertical speeds respectively p q r respectively represent the roll angle speed pitch angle speed and heading angular speed to avoid the singular problem of euler angle the trim angle θ is bounded which satisfying π 2 θ π 2 in practice the trim angle θ cannot approach π 2 due to metacentric restoring force do and pan 2009 in general the roll motion is regarded as self stable and the roll amplitude is very small which can be regarded as the heel angle ϕ 0 and heel angular velocity p 0 the relationship

trajectory tracking in complex ocean environments the main control objective is to ensure that all dynamic characteristics of auv keep consistent with position and speed with the change of time the whole closed loop system control design includes inner and outer loops the outer loop position control uses the system output feedback to design the expected speed so as to ensure the convergence of auv position tracking error the inner loop speed control uses the system actual control input to realize that the driving speed of the auv gradually converges to the desired speed command that is to ensure the convergence of auv speed tracking error considering the corresponding constraints when designing each controller could find the optimal solution in the control set more efficiently the control design block diagram of the whole closed loop system is shown in fig 2 3 1 mpc based outer loop controller it is assumed that the 3 d trajectory is given in advance and is smooth and bounded the desired trajectory can be described as follows 8 y d ξ d η d ζ d θ d ψ d t in this section the control task is to design the desired speed to drive the auv by inputting position error the kinematic model is discretized with a sampling period t s the discrete model is obtained as follows 9 η k 1 η k j k ν k t s in order to make the speed change of auv stable the velocity increment is

model mismatch and external disturbances zhang et al 2019 the rolling optimization process is iterated until the auv trajectory tracking task is completed it can be seen that mpc can reduce the impact of model uncertainty this article focuses on practical engineering applications and therefore focuses on the impact of external perturbations on auv trajectory tracking 4 stability analysis in this

the marine environment ocean wave disturbance ocean current disturbance and random disturbance because this paper focuses on trajectory tracking in deep ocean environment ocean wave disturbance is not considered both types of disturbances are defined in fixed coordinate system e ξ η ζ the ocean current disturbance is defined as follows 61 u c 0 15 m s v c 0 15 m s the random disturbance is defined as follows 62 u r d 0 2 r a n d 1 m s v r d 0 2 r a n d 1 m s where r a n d 1 is a normal distribution noise signal with 0 mean and 1 variance the desired trajectory of the simulation is a spiral

based on model predictive control firstly the 5 dof model of a fully actuated auv is established according to kinematics and dynamics methods then the auv outer loop position controller and inner loop speed controller are designed respectively the outer loop controller generates the desired speed instruction and passes it to the inner loop speed controller while the inner loop speed controller generates the available control inputs to ensure the whole closed loop trajectory tracking next the outer loop controller introduces velocity increment as input and the inner loop controller introduces forces and moments increment as input at the same time the constraints of system input and state are explicitly considered which improves the stable operation capability of auv the receding horizon implementation enables the optimal control inputs to be recalculated at each sampling moment which can compensate for the system uncertainty caused by model mismatch and external disturbance finally simulation experiments are designed and the results show the effectiveness of the controller in our follow up research we not only consider the impact of external disturbances but also consider other issues in many aspects and that includes the uncertainty of model parameters under auv high speed motion the output feedback control problem of auv under the condition of unmeasurable

21427,this paper designs a novel double closed loop three dimensional 3 d trajectory tracking method based on model predictive control mpc for an autonomous underwater vehicle auv under external disturbances different from the conventional model predictive control the designed double closed loop control can be divided into two stages 1 the outer loop controller generates the desired speed instruction and passes it to the inner loop speed controller 2 the inner loop speed controller generates the available control inputs to ensure the whole closed loop trajectory tracking in the controller design stage the actual constraints on system inputs and state are effectively considered in order to ensure the smooth operation of auv the double closed loop controller takes the control increments as the control inputs in addition the stability analysis based on lyapunov method proves the nominal stability of the controller finally simulation experiments are designed to verify the tracking performance of the auv under external disturbances the results show the effectiveness of the controller keywords autonomous underwater vehicle fully actuated system model predictive control trajectory tracking 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicle auv is an important tool for human exploration and observation of the ocean in the past two decades auv is widely used in deep sea exploration zhang et al 2015 natural hydrothermal vent observation sato et al 2014 and oil spill monitoring choyekh et al 2015 auv improves the ability of human exploration while reducing the risks that human beings originally need to face in order to ensure that the auv can complete various special underwater tasks efficiently and accurately it is necessary to carry out further research on the 3 d space motion control technology yu et al 2019 however auv is a typical nonlinear strongly coupled system since parameters such as hydrodynamic parameters are difficult to be accurately solved and the working environment is complex the motion of auv is greatly affected by the uncertainty of model parameters and external interference the control of auv has always been a research hotspot in the field of control trajectory tracking is the basis and premise for auv to perform various tasks the controller is designed to drive the auv to accurately track the time varying trajectory from the initial state that is the spatial position error and velocity error converge to zero it emphasizes the simultaneous satisfaction in the relationship between time and space and has strong time constraints on the task state up to now scholars from all over the world have done a lot of research on the auv trajectory tracking and many classical control methods have been promoted for example lyapunov direct method backstepping control model predictive control mpc sliding mode control neural network and robust adaptive control etc since auv is a multi input and multi output system the lyapunov function is constructed through iterative recursion by using backstepping control which can simplify the design of complex control system step by step by combining lyapunov method with backstepping control the velocity estimation of the vehicle is realized and the problem of output feedback control which auv speed feedback unfeasible is solved liu et al 2009 du et al 2011 xia et al 2015 in 2014 sun et al 2014 proposed a filtering backstepping control method based on the biological inspired model which not only avoids the frequent derivation of virtual control variables but also avoids the phenomenon of jumping in the vehicle s speed response even if there is a large initial position tracking error unfortunately the backstepping control itself does not have the ability to solve the uncertainty of system parameters and external disturbances other robust adaptive technologies are integrated to ensure the effectiveness of the controller in the uncertainty of the system the advantage of sliding mode control is that the state of the system can reach and slide along the sliding mode surface in a finite time by switching the control variables and it is invariant under parameter perturbation and external environment disturbance cheng et al 2007 in 2015 kim et al 2015 proposed an anti saturation integral sliding mode controller to solve the modeling error and unknown environmental disturbance of uuv the equivalent control law and the switching control law are integrated to ensure the exponential stability of the trajectory tracking control system in 2019 qiao and zhang 2019 designed the non singular terminal sliding mode controller and further utilized the respective advantages of integral sliding mode and terminal sliding mode on the basis of the original controller and proposed the double closed loop integral terminal sliding mode control to improve the convergence and ensure the control accuracy however the sliding mode control method may cause a kind of undesirable high frequency oscillation called chattering on the sliding mode surface resulting in low control precision and high energy consumption hammad et al 2017 the introduction of fuzzy function and neural network can improve the adaptive learning ability of the system wang and er 2016 and hassanein et al 2016 respectively designed direct adaptive and model based fuzzy controllers in 2016 sun and ge 2014 and zhao et al 2014 respectively adopted neural network adaptive control in 2014 to solve the 3 dof uuv horizontal trajectory tracking since then the learning ability of neural networks has also been fully explored for example dai et al 2014 2016 designed adaptive neural network output feedback controllers in 2014 and 2016 in 2017 cui et al 2017 considered the problem of control input nonlinearity and proposed neural network control with enhanced learning however the fuzzy logic and the performance of neural network adaptive controller depend heavily on fuzzy rules and the number of neural network nodes resulting in a large amount of system computation which is not conducive to the practical application of engineering robust adaptive technology can modify and maintain the performance of the controller for system parameter perturbation and disturbance dynamics and it is also widely used in auv trajectory tracking control in 2016 sarhadi et al 2016 integrated the anti saturation compensator into the adaptive control design to solve the problem of uuv model uncertainty and propeller saturation and proposed the model reference adaptive pid controller in 2018 verma et al 2018 proposed a discrete adaptive controller to minimize the uncertainty of online parameter estimation due to the difficulty in accurately obtaining the uuv hydrodynamic coefficient in a time varying marine environment in addition zhao and guo 2018 constructed a novel extended state observer based on non smooth function in 2018 to estimate the system uncertainties and the state information of the vehicle its adaptive control performance is significantly better than the existing linear extended state observer scheme however in practical applications the external disturbances suffered by auv are usually time varying and the system parameters cannot be accurately obtained with the difference of motion state tasks model predictive control can be optimized by predicting the future system state and output processing real time interference in time ensuring the tracking performance and closed loop system stability in 2017 shen et al 2017 proposed a novel receding horizon control rhc scheme to solve the problem of planning and tracking the planar trajectory of uuv and gave the stability condition of uuv trajectory tracking control based on mpc for the first time in 2018 fan et al 2018 proposed to use mpc to correct the vehicle s motion state and system output online in the process of autonomous underwater recovery of uuv and combined with kalman filter navigation guidance algorithm to estimate and compensate ocean currents in real time in 2019 zhang et al 2019 proposed a model prediction controller with the speed increment as the control input taking into account the input constraint and state constraint at the same time and conducted simulation verification under various interferences the author uses kinematics as a framework to design a controller that inversely seeks control forces through velocity on the one hand the control force is not conducive to acting on the thrusters on the other hand this controller design lacks proof of stability in this paper the trajectory tracking problem of auv is analyzed and a novel double closed loop controller based on mpc is designed in order to provide robustness and adaptability the designed double closed loop mpc controller consisting of position loop and speed loop ensures accurate tracking of time varying trajectories to ensure the smooth operation of the auv the control increment is taken as the input of the inner loop and the outer loop the actual constraints of system input and state are fully considered in the design of the controller and the trajectory tracking problem is transformed into a standard quadratic programming problem with constraints that can be calculated online when the auv moves to a new position the optimal input for the next moment is recalculated according to the current state and expectations therefore the auv can still complete the target tracking task well under the complex ocean environments to prove the effectiveness of the controller the tracking simulation results are given the simulation results prove the effectiveness of the designed controller the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 gives the mathematical model for fully actuated auv section 3 presents the control block diagram of double closed loop mpc and designs the mpc controller in detail section 4 demonstrates the stability of the controller simulation results and conclusions are given in section 5 and 6 respectively 2 auv model 2 1 kinematic model to study the motion model of underwater robot the motion of underwater robot is approximated to the general motion of rigid body in fluid according to the origin of the coordinate system the coordinate system is divided into fixed coordinate system e ξ η ζ and motion coordinate system o x y z the former is defined as a fixed point on the earth while the latter is defined as auv the coordinate system satisfies the right hand cartesian rectangular coordinate system the positive direction is north east and down as shown in fig 1 the fixed coordinate system e ξ η ζ describes the auv s spatial position and attitude η ξ η

angular speed to avoid the singular problem of euler angle the trim angle θ is bounded which satisfying π 2 θ π 2 in practice the trim angle θ cannot approach π 2 due to metacentric restoring force do and pan 2009 in general the roll motion is regarded as self stable and the roll amplitude is very small which can be regarded as the heel angle ϕ 0 and heel angular velocity p 0 the relationship

trajectory tracking in complex ocean environments the main control objective is to ensure that all dynamic characteristics of auv keep consistent with position and speed with the change of time the whole closed loop system control design includes inner and outer loops the outer loop position control uses the system output feedback to design the expected speed so as to ensure the convergence of auv position tracking error the inner loop speed control uses the system actual control input to realize that the driving speed of the auv gradually converges to the desired speed command that is to ensure the convergence of auv speed tracking error considering the corresponding constraints when designing each controller could find the optimal solution in the control set more efficiently the control design block diagram of the whole closed loop system is shown in fig 2 3 1 mpc based outer loop controller it is assumed that the 3 d trajectory is given in advance and is smooth and bounded

model mismatch and external disturbances zhang et al 2019 the rolling optimization process is iterated until the auv trajectory tracking task is completed it can be seen that mpc can reduce the impact of model uncertainty this article focuses on practical engineering applications and therefore focuses on the impact of external perturbations on auv trajectory tracking 4 stability analysis in this

the marine environment ocean wave disturbance ocean current disturbance and random disturbance because this paper focuses on trajectory tracking in deep ocean environment ocean wave disturbance is not considered both types of disturbances are defined in fixed coordinate system e ξ η ζ the ocean current disturbance is defined as follows 61 u c 0 15 m s v c 0 15 m s the random disturbance is defined as follows 62 u r d 0 2 r a n d 1 m s v r d 0 2 r a n d 1 m s where r a n d 1 is a normal distribution noise signal with 0 mean and 1 variance the desired trajectory of the simulation is a spiral diving trajectory as shown in 62 the initial state of auv is 0 5 0 0 0 t 63 x d 10 sin 0 03 t y d 10 cos 0 03 t z d 0 05 t fig 3 shows the trajectories tracking results of the three methods without disturbance in 3 d space the black curve is the desired trajectory the red curve is the tracking result using designed mpc method the light blue curve is the tracking result using conventional mpc method and the purple curve shows the tracking result using terminal sliding mode control tsmc it can be seen from the figure that all three methods are well tracked on the desired trajectory the tracking performance in the three directions and position tracking error of auv are shown in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively in general the auv tracking control has a better tracking effect under different control methods position tracking errors are bounded for further comparison the position error measurement values after 20 s are indicated in table 2 it can be seen from the table that the designed mpc method without disturbance has the best tracking results compared to the other two methods the value of the position tracking error of the auv without disturbance is very small about 0 0253 m the control inputs of the auv are shown in fig 6 the control inputs without disturbance are stable and change slowly the trajectories tracking results of the three methods with ocean current in 3 d space are displayed in fig 7 fig 8 and fig 9 are the tracking performance in the three directions and position tracking error of auv respectively it can be seen from the figure that the designed mpc method is superior to the other two methods position tracking errors are also bounded for clarity of comparison the position error measurement values after 20 s are displayed in table 3 the value of the position tracking error of the auv without disturbance is about 0 2201 m fig 10 shows the control inputs of the auv the trajectories tracking results of the three methods with random disturbance are displayed in fig 11 the tracking performance in the three directions and position tracking error of auv are shown in fig 12 and fig 13 respectively position tracking errors are bounded for further comparison the position error measurement values after 20 s are indicated in table 4 it can be seen from the table that the designed mpc method with random disturbance has a better tracking effect compared to the other two methods the value of the position tracking error of the auv without disturbance is very small about 0 1398m the control inputs of the auv are displayed in fig 14 the simulation results with random disturbance further demonstrate the robustness of the designed mpc method 6 conclusion this paper designs a double closed loop trajectory tracking method for auv based on model predictive control firstly the 5 dof model of a fully actuated auv is established according to kinematics and dynamics methods then the auv outer loop position controller and inner loop speed controller are designed respectively the outer loop controller generates the desired speed instruction and passes it to the inner loop speed controller while the inner loop speed controller generates the available control inputs to ensure the whole closed loop trajectory tracking next the outer loop controller introduces velocity increment as input and the inner loop controller introduces forces and moments increment as input at the same time the constraints of system input and state are explicitly considered which improves the stable operation capability of auv the receding horizon implementation enables the optimal control inputs to be recalculated at each sampling moment which can compensate for the system uncertainty caused by model mismatch and external disturbance finally simulation experiments are designed and the results show the effectiveness of the controller in our follow up research we not only consider the impact of external disturbances but also consider other issues in many aspects and that includes the uncertainty of model parameters under auv high speed motion the output feedback control problem of auv under the condition of unmeasurable

stator optimum shape that achieves the maximum rotor power coefficient value a 2d numerical model was employed using ansys fluent 18 1 the dominant parameters that affect the aerodynamic performance of the turbine were demonstrated according to the examined conditions the results revealed that the maximum power coefficient for the rotor with optimum stator configuration achieved a value of 6 times greater than that of the bare rotor it was concluded from this parametric study that the main effective element in the turbine stator is the stator obstacle this study may be an important issue

y vertical offset of stator obstacle starting point from the rotor m 1 introduction numerous experimental and theoretical investigations have been carried out to improve the performance of wind turbines to increase the power generation from wind energy moreover many efforts were exerted to study the effect of different geometrical parameters on the performance of the savonius wind turbine for instance fujisawa 1996 compared their numerical calculations with the experimental measurements for savonius rotating and stationary rotors the flow field inside and downstream of the rotors was poorly predicted for a stationary rotor but much improved compared with a rotating rotor also menet 2004 designed and built a savonius rotor as a complete electromechanical system for the local production of electricity moreover saha et al saha and rajkumar 2006 saha et al 2008 and kamoji et al 2009a used twisted blades instead of conventional semicircular blades they found that the savonius turbine achieved higher efficiency with smoother running and higher capability of self starting besides the influences of different performance parameters have been studied intensively by many investigators kamoji et al 2009b tong and dietmar 2013 modi and fernando 1989 such parameters were reynolds number overlap ratio aspect ratio and blade arc angle their results proved that a higher power coefficient can be obtained at zero overlap ratio an aspect ratio of 0 7 a blade shape factor of 0 2 and a blade arc angle of 124 on the other hand biswas et al 2007 investigated experimentally the effects of overlap and blockage on three bucket savonius rotors they proved that a high power coefficient was achieved at an optimum overlap ratio of 0 2 moreover several numerical studies have been performed to analyze the performance of a two bladed savonius water turbine with a deflector to optimize the position of the deflector basumatary and biswas 2016 biswas et al 2016 ramadan et al 2020 evaluated the performance of a drag hydro kinetic turbine for rivers current energy extraction for rural and domestic applications in order to predict savonius wind turbine performance an artificial neural network approach and neuro fuzzy inference system have been employed by sargolzaei and kianifar 2009 2010 unsteady flow fields as well as aerodynamics of the interaction between savonius rotors and the complex flow field have been simulated through the development of several numerical and computational models afungchui et al 2010 d alessandro et al 2010 dobrev and massouh 2011 in addition mohamed et al mohamed et al 2010 mohamed et al 2011 mahmoud et al 2012 and kumbernuss et al 2012 performed many investigations in order to improve the performance and operation parameters through enhancement of the obstacle shielding the returning blade and the blade geometry golecha et al kailash et al 2012 studied experimentally the effect of the deflector plate as an obstacle on the performance of the modified savonius turbine immersed in water besides the same authors identified the optimum position of the two deflector plates placed upstream of the modified savonius turbine immersed in water golecha et al 2011 wang and zhan 2013 and kacprzak et al 2013 used 2d and 3d cfd analyses to simulate and analyze the performance of different shapes of the savonius turbine damak et al 2013 investigated experimentally the effect of reynolds number and the overlap ratio on the aerodynamic behavior of helical savonius rotor with a twist of 180 in an open jet wind tunnel turbulent flow around a small incurved savonius wind rotor has been also validated numerically and experimentally driss et al 2014 intensive reviews on savonius wind turbines have been introduced akwa et al 2012 bhutta et al 2012 roy and saha 2013 such reviews collected related information about design techniques various configurations and proper computational methodology such collections were utilized to enhance significantly both the performance and efficiency of the savonius rotor jeon jeon et al 2015 studied experimentally the aerodynamic performance of helical savonius wind turbines equipped with endplates using various shapes and sizes their experiments were carried out using a subsonic open circuit type wind tunnel moreover a conventional turbine was immersed in an open water channel to study its performance both experimental and cfd studies were used to understand the significance of savonius design in water applications sarma et al 2014 the effect of the blockage correction on vertical axis wind turbines tested in both closed and open types low speed wind tunnel has been also investigated ross and altman 2011 roy and saha 2014 roy and saha 2015 tested a novel shape of a savonius wind turbine in an open type wind tunnel the performance of the turbine was compared with other standard blade types the obtained data were inclusive of wind tunnel blockage corrections to enhance the performance at high wind speed and harvest energy at low wind speed a cfd study has been performed to analyze the effect of wind boosters on power generation of vertical axis wind turbines korprasertsak and leephakpreeda 2015 2016 shigetomi et al 2011 shaheen et al 2015 and el baz et al 2016 proved that the interactions between savonius wind turbines in a cluster increased the output power of an individual rotor a guide box tunnel was also employed to prevent the rotor from strong wind disaster irabu and roy 2007 performance improvement was achieved when employing a guide box tunnel compared to the bare rotor besides altan et al alta and atılgan 2008 altan et al 2008 altan and atılgan 2010 designed a curtain and performed experimentally and numerically analyses to increase the performance of the savonius wind rotor another new curtain system with innovative airfoil shaped blades has been introduced by tartuferi et al 2015 leading to a remarkable enhancement in the aerodynamic performance of the savonius wind rotor el askary et al 2015 studied numerically three designs for controlling the wind direction to improve the performance of the savonius rotor by eliminating the negative torque and increasing the exerted positive torque promdee and photong 2016 studied the effects of wind angles and wind speeds on the performance of the savonius wind turbine etemadeasl et al 2019 investigated numerically a v shaped shield installed with two counter rotating savonius rotors cp and cm were increased by 80 and 82 respectively in a related paper we performed a numerical study to investigate the effect of four different types of stators on the savonius bach type rotor maximum enhancement achieved was 10 16 by stator 4 at tsr 0 5 and maximum cp achieved was 0 208 at tsr 0 75 saad el deen et al 2018 hashem and mohamed 2018 examined computationally the use of wind lens stators with darrieus turbine to enhance its aerodynamic performance different stators were used and proved a significant increase in the power coefficient from the previous works it can be seen that all developments have been focused on rotor shape optimization and the improvements of the obstacle to improve savonius turbine performance also many numerical and computational models have been developed to describe the nature of the interaction between the incoming wind energy and the rotor blades however the present paper aims to enhance significantly the savonius bach type rotor without changing the rotor shape this is achieved by adding a new stator the used bach rotor profile has a diameter dr 230 mm blade shape factor p q 0 2 blade arc angle ψ 124 and without overlap or gap as optimized by kamoji et al 2009b as shown in fig 1 the investigated new stator consists of three parts guide plate shield and obstacle eight geometrical parameters fully defined the stator were studied one factor at a time to obtain the maximum value of cp the obstacle has four parameters and both the shield and the guide plate have only two parameters each the power coefficient cp of the turbine was calculated based on the rotor frontal area not stator to obtain comparable results with other researchers however calculating cp based on the stator frontal area is more reasonable than calculating it based on the rotor frontal area heikal et al 2018 the stator makes the savonius turbine sensitive to the wind direction which loses its advantage as vawts but this problem can be overridden in real life by adding an orientation control system able to sense the wind direction such as a tail fin or a control circuit with an actuator like servo motor that can direct the stator to the wind direction 2 modeling and validation 2 1 geometry modeling bach type savonius rotor was used to investigate the new stator effect on its performance as shown in fig 1 many researchers like kamoji et al 2009b optimized the rotor dimensions the relation between rotor geometrical parameters is as follows 1 q d r 8 4 p q 2 8 1 p q 2 cos ψ cos 1 1 1 p q 2 as shown in fig 2 the stator covered in the present study has consisted of three parts obstacle shield and guide plate eight geometrical parameters were set to describe the stator shape these eight parameters were α θ1 l1 tc l2 θ2 x and y where α is the shield angle θ1 is the guide plate inclination angle l1 is the guide plate length tc is the tip clearance between rotor and stator shield l2 is the obstacle length θ2 is the obstacle angle x is the distance from the obstacle to the rotor vertical centerline and y is the distance from the obstacle to the rotor horizontal centerline these parameters were varied and investigated one factor at a time by the same order as mentioned previously α θ1 l1 tc l2 θ2 x and y to achieve maximum cp the length parameters were studied relative to the rotor radius rr to be dimensionless all simulations performed were at tsr 0 75 which is the most common value where maximum cp probably exists for a savonius type drag based turbine also this tsr value has the best agreement between the numerical model and the experimental results after determining the optimum geometry of the stator the complete characteristic curve was obtained by several runs at several values of tsrs a e 0 2 0 3 0 5 0 75 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 and 1 6 2 2 cfd modeling the domain used in the present study was separated into blocks using the design modeler this method provided more flexibility to control the mesh number of cells and mesh quality the domain was separated into two parts rotating region and stationary region with an interface circular edge between them domain dimensions upstream downstream width and inlet width were set as a function of reference dimensions as shown in fig 3 lmax is the reference for upstream and downstream and wmax is the reference for width and inlet width as shown in fig 4 however in the case of the bare rotor reference dimensions are lmax wmax dr as shown in fig 4 the inlet b c was set to velocity inlet by a magnitude of 9 m s and the two lines beside it were set as openings with atmospheric pressure as well as the outlet to validate the numerical model the same dimensions and boundary conditions were used as in the experiment of kamoji et al 2009b and following the same concept used by sharma sonu and rajesh 2016 2017 the sides of the b c were set to symmetry the rotor edges as well as stator edges were set to no slip wall ansys meshing was used to make the domain mesh the rotating region was made as one surface with structured quadrilateral cells around the rotor edges with inflation to obtain the required value of y equal 1 as shown in fig 5 the stationary region was separated into 9 surfaces all of them with structured quadrilateral cells except the part around the rotating zone as shown in figs 6 and 7 to avoid interpolation error resulting from non conformal mesh where the cells edges are not aligned with each other s at the interface a conformal mesh at the interface between rotating and stationary zones was made by dividing the interface edge into equal divisions as a function of the time step angle therefore for a time step equivalent to 0 5 of rotor rotation the interface edge was separated into 720 equal divisions as shown in fig 5 in this way the mesh at the interface was maintained conformal while rotor rotating the inflation zone created on the rotor blades has the following information for rotor the first layer height growth factor and the number of layers values are 0 02 mm 1 1 and 20 respectively and for stator those values are 0 01 mm 1 1 and 37 respectively 2 3 mesh independence study three independent studies were performed in series to get the optimum numerical model 1 domain size independence study 2 time step size independence study 3 number of cells independence study these three numerical model parameters do not need an exact experimental solution to be validated with where they can be obtained relatively in other words a bigger domain size more mesh cells and smaller time step size surely lead to a more accurate solution and longer time to get the solution so getting proper values leads to the best compromise between the solving time and the accuracy of the results 2 3 1 domain size independence study eight domain sizes were investigated four domain sizes were applied for domain downstream length labeled by 1 in table 1 and the other four were applied for domain width labeled by 2 in table 1 the domain upstream was maintained at 3 dr similar to the work of kamoji et al 2009b the time step used was equivalent to 1 of rotor rotation as an initial value before making the time step independence study in the next step as shown in table 1 the best domain size is 40 dr downstream and 10 dr width that produces an acceptable relative difference and good solving rate not too long solving time for the run these domain dimensions were used in all the upcoming studied cases in this work in the case of the stator the dimensions of the domain size were 40 lmax downstream and 10 wmax width this is achieved in such a manner to keep the same relative dimensions of the domain used in the case of the bare rotor in the case of downstream length independence study it was noticed that the solving rate increases with larger domain size before 50 dr this is because the flow becomes fully developed which enhances the numerical model ability to reach the converged solution in fewer iterations for each time step 2 3 2 time step size independence study the time step size in all cases was set as a function of rotor rotational speed to adjust it exactly equivalent to time step angle where 2 ω 2 tsr v d r rad s 3 time step size π time step angle 180 ω s four models were investigated with different time step angles as shown in table 2 it can be seen that model 3 with a time step angle of 0 5 is the best achieving the criteria of relative difference to be less than 3 therefore it was used in all upcoming simulations 2 3 3 number of cells independence study three models were investigated with a different number of cells all of them were with the domain size and time step obtained from the previous independence studies as shown in table 3 model 2 with the number of cells 125 761 is the best as it achieves the criteria to get a relative difference of less than 3 this model was used to obtain the other tsrs to obtain the rotor characteristic curve which will be used later to investigate the effect of adding stator to the bach type rotor 2 4 turbulence model selecting the appropriate turbulence model is essentially based on the flow details in addition to the available computing resources herein for quasi steady data the well established reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations were sufficiently chosen in the present study as in ansys fluent theory fluent theory guide 2013 in reynolds averaging the solution variables in the instantaneous exact navier stokes equations are decomposed into the mean ensemble averaged or time averaged and fluctuating components for the velocity components 4 u i u i u i where u i and u i are the mean and fluctuating velocity components i 1 2 3 substituting expressions of this form to the flow variables into the instantaneous continuity and momentum equations and taking a time or ensemble average and dropping the over bar on the mean velocity yields the ensemble averaged momentum equations they could be written in the cartesian tensor form for incompressible flow as 5 u i x i 0 6 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i 1 ρ x j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j u l x l x j u i u j where i 1 2 3 is the running index u i is the mean velocity component x i is the cartesian coordinate the turbulence model used in this work is realizable k ε enhanced wall treatment which also has been used by zhou and rempfer tong and dietmar 2013 and mohamed et al mohamed et al 2010 for incompressible flow the realizable k ε model transport equations are 7 k t k u j x j 1 ρ x j μ μ t σ k k x j g k g b ρ ε y m s k 8 ε t ε u j x j 1 ρ x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j c 1 s ε c 2 ε 2 k ν ε c 1 ε ε ρ k c 3 ε g b s ε ρ where 9 c 1 m a x 0 43 η η 5 10 η s k ε 11 s 2 s i j s i j g k represents the generation of turbulence kinetic energy due to mean velocity gradients g b is the generation of turbulence kinetic energy due to buoyancy y m represents the contribution of the fluctuating dilatation incompressible turbulence to the overall dissipation rate both c 2 and c 1 ε are constants σ k and σ ε are the turbulent prandtl numbers for k and ε respectively s k and s ε are user defined source terms μ t is eddy viscosity and s i j is the rate of strain ansys fluent calculated moment from the integral pressure values calculated at cells adjacent to the rotor surface then each force value integral pressure was multiplied in its moment arm length at that time to get cm moment coefficient the moment value was divided by the theoretical torque value which is 1 2 arv 2 for each run the instant values of cm generated from ansys fluent were inserted into a spreadsheet to determine the final value of cm which was calculated as the average of cm instant values over the last cycle of the rotor theoretically the cycle of a two bladed rotor is a half revolution but actually it was different from a case to another the cycle was captured only after the solution becomes periodic before that the values of the cm curve could not be taken into consideration fluent user s guide 2013 the criterion used to stop the solution manually was an increment value of less than 0 001 between the last two values of cm of the last two rotor cycles two examples are shown in fig 8 for two different runs configurations in the first case shown in fig 8 a the rotor rotation cycle was a half revolution and only 5 6 s were required equivalent to 52 4 revolutions to achieve the criteria then stop the solution on the other hand the second example shown in fig 8 b the rotor cycle was 11 revolutions and it needed 14 9 s equivalent to 138 9 revolutions to achieve the criteria then stop the solution the final value of cp then was calculated from cm where c p tsr c m the curvature correction option was enabled to make the model more sensitive to the rotor rotation and curvature fluent user s guide 2013 the pressure velocity coupling scheme used was coupled to improve the rate of solution convergence spatial discretization of the gradient was set to least squares cell based and for pressure was set to second order which provided improved accuracy over the standard and linear scheme luent user s guide 2013 for momentum turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent dissipation rate the spatial discretization was set to second order upwind the transient formulation was set to second order implicit the option high order term relaxation was enabled to improve the startup and the general solution behavior of flow simulation fluent user s guide 2013 solution under relaxation factors was kept to their default values the sliding mesh model smm which is a transient model was used to solve all cases but the moving reference frame model is a steady model used to initialize the solution before starting the smm solution this solving procedure decreases the solving time where the cm curve could reach the periodicity steady state in fewer time steps than solving directly by smm wind speed used was 9 m s and re equal to 150 000 based on dr similar to the method used by kamoji et al 2009b 2 5 validation cfd modeling technique is considered one of the commonly trusted analytical tools it provides a clear understanding of the effect of different wind turbine configurations on its performance besides the flow field prediction around the turbine configuration enables us to declare its aerodynamic behavior however previously published experimental results should be used to validate the performed model as mentioned before the geometry employed was identical to that previously investigated by kamoji et al 2009b but without the new stator the final characteristic curve of the bach type rotor was obtained by using different values of tsr as shown in fig 9 the maximum cp achieved was 0 1932 at tsr 0 75 such a power coefficient was calculated using the following equation 12 c p t ω 1 2 ρ a v 3 t s r c m 13 c m t 1 2 ρ a r v 2 the deviation was calculated from the obtained characteristic curve and was found to be 0 2 at tsr 0 75 most common value where the maximum cp exists which believed to be in a good agreement with the previous experimental work 3 results and discussion as stated earlier eight geometrical parameters of the stator were investigated one factor at a time the baseline configuration of the stator parameters used is presented in table 4 the stator includes mainly three elements obstacle shield and guide plate the obstacle has four parameters which are l2 rr θ2 x rr and y rr the shield has only two parameters α and tc rr finally the guide plate has also two parameters θ1 and l1 rr throughout the study the value of each parameter was changed while maintaining the other parameters fixed and cp was recorded the same procedure was repeated with the next parameter until obtaining the optimum stator design 3 1 effect of geometrical parameters on average cp macroscopic study as shown in fig 10 the shield angle α was the first studied parameter values from 0 to 90 were tested the zero angle means that there is no shield the other parameters were maintained at their baseline values as mentioned in table 1 higher values of α deteriorate the rotor performance because the shield extends to the downstream region of the advancing blade which constrains the flow to be streamed through the stator the highest cp obtained was at α 15 therefore this shield angle will be fixed for the upcoming parameter studies the guide plate inclination angle θ1 was the second parameter studied it is the responsible parameter for directing wind to the advancing blade which generates the stagnation pressure on its concave side to produce positive work as θ1 increases cp increases as shown in fig 10 the maximum enhancement in cp takes place at θ1 55 beyond this optimum value of θ1 cp decreases besides the length of the guide plate relative to the rotor radius l1 rr was then investigated as the third parameter as shown in fig 12 the optimum value of l1 rr 4 was recorded for maximum cp the fourth parameter studied was the tip clearance between the rotor and stator shield relative to the rotor radius tc rr as shown in fig 11 it is one of the most effective parameters which influences the rotor performance maximum cp was achieved at an optimum value of tc rr 0 75 higher values of tc rr makes the shield and the guide plate of the stator apart enough from the rotor which reduces their effect on its performance on the other side lower values of tc rr than the optimum value constrains wind from streaming through the stator leading to a reduction in rotor cp the fifth parameter studied was the obstacle length relative to the rotor radius l2 rr the obstacle angle θ2 was kept at its baseline value which equals to 45 with the vertical axis maximum cp was obtained at l2 rr 1 5 the more the obstacle length the more decrease in cp value as shown in fig 12 it was noticed that the effect of the fifth parameter l2 rr on the enhancement of cp was greater than that of the third parameter l1 rr the effect of the obstacle angle θ2 as the sixth parameter on cp was analyzed and presented in fig 10 with the obtained optimum length parameter value l2 rr which equals 1 5 the maximum cp was obtained at θ2 65 see fig 10 the results presented in fig 11 showed that cp increased when moving the obstacle away from the rotor vertical centerline seventh parameter until x rr 0 7 as a result the inlet width of the stator increased consequently a more mass flow rate of air passed through the stator which in turn improved cp through the range of x rr 0 7 1 the obstacle started to lose its role where it prevented the wind from striking the returning blade to avoid negative torque therefore cp was slightly decreased cp increased again through the narrow range of x rr 1 1 1 the air stream started to find a pass relatively far from the returning blade which reduced the stagnation pressure on it and accordingly reduced the negative torque the optimum value of x rr 1 1 was achieved as shown in fig 11 similarly cp increased when moving the obstacle away from the rotor horizontal centerline eighth parameter until an optimum value of y rr 0 3 generally the dominant parameters that affect the aerodynamic performance of the turbine are θ2 x rr y rr and l2 rr see figs 10 12 respectively however it can be concluded from this parametric study that the main effective element in the turbine stator is the obstacle 3 2 effect of geometrical parameters on instantaneous cp microscopic study the cp cycle of the optimum configuration of each parameter was also investigated in addition to the case of the bare rotor the cycle of some cases was one rotor revolution 360 while in other cases the cycle was more than one revolution e g 13 revolutions therefore in these cases an equivalent cycle was determined and then the closest revolution to the equivalent cycle was taken as the final cp cycle of the case maximum and minimum values of cp for all geometrical parameters of the stator were achieved in the rotor angles range of 50 60 and 115 130 respectively as shown in table 4 and fig 13 static pressure contours and velocity streamlines were generated for the bare rotor and the rosc rotor with optimum stator configuration at two different rotor angles the first angle 52 and 232 is the angle where the maximum cp is achieved by the rosc as shown in figs 14 and 15 respectively on the other hand the second angle 176 and 356 is the angle of the bare rotor where maximum c p takes place as shown in figs 16 and 17 respectively these figures demonstrate microscopically the flow field of the bare rotor and the rosc at certain instants rotor positions to understand its aerodynamic performance moreover these results help us to elaborate and realize the features and advantages of the new stator configuration in fig 14 a a small low pressure zone was formed near the tip of the advanced blade of the bare rotor nevertheless a large low pressure zone was created behind the advanced blade of the rosc as shown in fig 14 b besides a high pressure zone upstream of the rotor was produced because of the stator design these variations in the pressure zones between the bare rotor and the rosc are the key features of the enhancement of the power generated due to the optimum stator design the obstacle of the stator plays a vital role in the enhancement of the turbine performance the obstacle entrains more streamlines away from striking the returning blade besides the stator directs more streamlines into the advanced blade of the rotor to enhance the positive torque generated on it see fig 15 fig 16 a b illustrates the comparison of the static pressure distribution between the bare rotor and the rotor with rosc the stator slightly increased the static pressure upstream of the rotor in this position 176 356 the bare rotor produced maximum cp however the rotor with the rosc still generates a larger amount of cp the velocity streamlines explain the variations of the flow field between the bare rotor and the rotor with rosc as shown in fig 17 the rosc still has the privilege over the bare rotor 3 3 optimum configuration of the stator the obtained results revealed that the values of the optimum configuration parameters of the stator that achieves the maximum cp at tsr 0 75 are α 15 θ1 55 l1 rr 4 tc rr 0 75 l2 rr 1 5 θ2 65 x rr 1 1 and y rr 0 3 fig 18 illustrates the performance curve of the rosc in comparison with the bare rotor performance curve the stator has a great effect on rotor performance at tsr 0 75 the bare rotor achieved a cp value of 0 1932 its maximum cp value while rosc achieved a cp value of 0 557 this means that for the same tsr the cp of rosc was raised to 2 88 times its value at the bare rotor furthermore the maximum cp of rosc increased remarkably and achieved 0 668 at tsr 1 2 compared with 0 112 for the bare rotor thus the new stator provides a maximum cp value of about 6 times greater than that of the bare rotor it can be also observed that the operating range of such a turbine is increased up to tsr 1 6 compared with the bare rotor turbine also a comparison was performed between rosc savonius cylindrical blade with an obstacle mohamed et al 2010 savonius optimal blade shape with obstacle mohamed et al 2011 savonius immersed in water with one deflector kailash et al 2012 and two deflectors golecha et al 2011 such a comparison proved that the optimum stator configuration has the privilege over the obstacle in the enhancement of the power coefficient of the savonius turbine 4 conclusions to enhance a bach type savonius rotor performance a new stator of three parts composed of shield obstacle and guide plate was utilized eight geometrical parameters describing the stator configuration were investigated accordingly the following conclusions may be drawn 1 the optimum values of each configuration parameters that achieves maximum cp are α 15 θ1 55 l1 rr 4 tc rr 0 75 l2 rr 1 5 θ2 65 x rr 1 1 and y rr 0 3 2 at tsr 0 75 the cp of rosc is raised to 2 88 times its value at the bare rotor 3 the maximum cp of the rotor with rosc reaches a value of 6 times that of the bare rotor at tip speed ratio equals 1 2 4 the dominant parameters that affect the aerodynamic performance of the turbine are θ2 x rr y rr and l2 rr for future works it is recommended to re study this stator with a factorial approach to take into consideration the interaction between geometrical parameters also it is recommended to perform another optimization study to these eight geometrical parameters but

of the turbine were demonstrated according to the examined conditions the results revealed that the maximum power coefficient for the rotor with optimum stator configuration achieved a value of 6 times greater than that of the bare rotor it was concluded from this parametric study that the main effective element in the turbine stator is the stator obstacle this study may be an important issue

turbines to increase the power generation from wind energy moreover many efforts were exerted to study the effect of different geometrical parameters on the performance of the savonius wind turbine for instance fujisawa 1996 compared their numerical calculations with the experimental measurements for savonius rotating and stationary rotors the flow field inside and downstream of the rotors was poorly predicted for a stationary rotor but much improved compared with a rotating rotor also menet 2004 designed and built a savonius rotor as a complete electromechanical system for the local production of electricity moreover saha et al saha and rajkumar 2006 saha et al 2008 and kamoji et al 2009a used twisted blades instead of conventional semicircular blades they found that the savonius turbine achieved higher efficiency with smoother running and higher capability of self starting besides the influences of different performance parameters have been studied intensively by many investigators kamoji et al 2009b tong and dietmar 2013 modi and fernando 1989 such parameters were reynolds number overlap ratio aspect ratio and blade arc angle their results proved that a higher power coefficient can be obtained at zero overlap ratio an aspect ratio of 0 7 a blade shape factor of 0 2 and a blade arc angle of 124 on the other hand biswas et al 2007 investigated experimentally the effects of overlap and blockage on three bucket savonius rotors they proved that a high power coefficient was achieved at an optimum overlap ratio of 0 2 moreover several numerical studies have been performed to analyze the performance of a two bladed savonius water turbine with a deflector to optimize the position of the deflector basumatary and biswas 2016 biswas et al 2016 ramadan et al 2020 evaluated the performance of a drag hydro kinetic turbine for rivers current energy extraction for rural and domestic applications in order to predict savonius wind turbine performance an artificial neural network approach and neuro fuzzy inference system have been employed by sargolzaei and kianifar 2009 2010 unsteady flow fields as well as aerodynamics of the interaction between savonius rotors and the complex flow field have been simulated through the development of several numerical and computational models afungchui et al 2010 d alessandro et al 2010 dobrev and massouh 2011 in addition mohamed et al mohamed et al 2010 mohamed et al 2011 mahmoud et al 2012 and kumbernuss et al 2012 performed many investigations in order to improve the performance and operation parameters through enhancement of the obstacle shielding the returning blade and the blade geometry golecha et al kailash et al 2012 studied experimentally the effect of the deflector plate as an obstacle on the performance of the modified savonius turbine immersed in water besides the same authors identified the optimum position of the two deflector plates placed upstream of the modified savonius turbine immersed in water golecha et al 2011 wang and zhan 2013 and kacprzak et al 2013 used 2d and 3d cfd analyses to simulate and analyze the performance of different shapes of the savonius turbine damak et al 2013 investigated experimentally the effect of reynolds number and the overlap ratio on the aerodynamic behavior of helical savonius rotor with a twist of 180 in an open jet wind tunnel turbulent flow around a small incurved savonius wind rotor has been also validated numerically and experimentally driss et al 2014 intensive reviews on savonius wind turbines have been introduced akwa et al 2012 bhutta et al 2012 roy and saha 2013 such reviews collected related information about design techniques various configurations and proper computational methodology such collections were utilized to enhance significantly both the performance and efficiency of the savonius rotor jeon jeon et al 2015 studied experimentally the aerodynamic performance of helical savonius wind turbines equipped with endplates using various shapes and sizes their experiments were carried out using a subsonic open circuit type wind tunnel moreover a conventional turbine was immersed in an open water channel to study its performance both experimental and cfd studies were used to understand the significance of savonius design in water applications sarma et al 2014 the effect of the blockage correction on vertical axis wind turbines tested in both closed and open types low speed wind tunnel has been also investigated ross and altman 2011 roy and saha 2014 roy and saha 2015 tested a novel shape of a savonius wind turbine in an open type wind tunnel the performance of the turbine was compared with other standard blade types the obtained data were inclusive of wind tunnel blockage corrections to enhance the performance at high wind speed and harvest energy at low wind speed a cfd study has been performed to analyze the effect of wind boosters on power generation of vertical axis wind turbines korprasertsak and leephakpreeda 2015 2016 shigetomi et al 2011 shaheen et al 2015 and el baz et al 2016 proved that the interactions between savonius wind turbines in a cluster increased the output power of an individual rotor a guide box tunnel was also employed to prevent the rotor from strong wind disaster irabu and roy 2007 performance improvement was achieved when employing a guide box tunnel compared to the bare rotor besides altan et al alta and atılgan 2008 altan et al 2008 altan and atılgan 2010 designed a curtain and performed experimentally and numerically analyses to increase the performance of the savonius wind rotor another new curtain system with innovative airfoil shaped blades has been introduced by tartuferi et al 2015 leading to a remarkable enhancement in the aerodynamic performance of the savonius wind rotor el askary et al 2015 studied numerically three designs for controlling the wind direction to improve the performance of the savonius rotor by eliminating the negative torque and increasing the exerted positive torque promdee and photong 2016 studied the effects of wind angles and wind speeds on the performance of the savonius wind turbine etemadeasl et al 2019 investigated numerically a v shaped shield installed with two counter rotating savonius rotors cp and cm were increased by 80 and 82 respectively in a related paper we performed a numerical study to investigate the effect of four different types of stators on the savonius bach type rotor maximum enhancement achieved was 10 16 by stator 4 at tsr 0 5 and maximum cp achieved was 0 208 at tsr 0 75 saad el deen et al 2018 hashem and mohamed 2018 examined computationally the use of wind lens stators with darrieus turbine to enhance its aerodynamic performance different stators were used and proved a significant increase in the power coefficient from the previous works it can be seen that all developments have been focused on rotor shape optimization and the improvements of the obstacle to improve savonius turbine performance also many numerical and computational models have been developed to describe the nature of the interaction between the incoming wind energy and the rotor blades however the present paper aims to enhance significantly the savonius bach type rotor without changing the rotor shape this is achieved by adding a new stator the used bach rotor profile has a diameter dr 230 mm blade shape factor p q 0 2 blade arc angle ψ 124 and without overlap or gap as optimized by kamoji et al 2009b as shown in fig 1 the investigated new stator consists of three parts guide plate shield and obstacle eight geometrical parameters fully defined the stator were studied one factor at a time to obtain the maximum value of cp the obstacle has four parameters and both the shield and the guide plate have only two parameters each the power coefficient cp of the turbine was calculated based on the rotor frontal area not stator to obtain comparable results with other researchers however calculating cp based on the stator frontal area is more reasonable than calculating it based on the rotor frontal area heikal et al 2018 the stator makes the savonius turbine sensitive to the wind direction which loses its advantage as vawts but this problem can be overridden in real life by adding an orientation control system able to sense the wind direction such as a tail fin or a control circuit with an actuator like servo motor that can direct the stator to the wind direction 2 modeling and validation 2 1 geometry modeling bach type savonius rotor was used to investigate the new stator effect on its performance as shown in fig 1 many researchers like kamoji et al 2009b optimized the rotor dimensions the relation between rotor geometrical parameters is as follows 1 q d r 8 4 p q 2 8 1 p q 2 cos ψ cos 1 1 1 p q 2 as shown in fig 2 the stator covered in the present study has consisted of three parts obstacle shield and guide plate eight geometrical parameters were set to describe the stator shape these eight parameters were α θ1 l1 tc l2 θ2 x and y where α is the shield angle θ1 is the guide plate inclination angle l1 is the guide plate length tc is the tip clearance between rotor and stator shield l2 is the obstacle length θ2 is the obstacle angle x is the distance from the obstacle to the rotor vertical centerline and y is the distance from the obstacle to the rotor horizontal centerline these parameters were varied and investigated one factor at a time by the same order as mentioned previously α θ1 l1 tc l2 θ2 x and y to achieve maximum cp the length parameters were studied relative to the rotor radius rr to be dimensionless all simulations performed were at tsr 0 75 which is the most common value where maximum cp probably exists for a savonius type drag based turbine also this tsr value has the best agreement between the numerical model and the experimental results after determining the optimum geometry of the stator the complete characteristic curve was obtained by several runs at several values of tsrs a e 0 2 0 3 0 5 0 75 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 and 1 6 2 2 cfd modeling the domain used in the present study was separated into blocks using the design modeler this method provided more flexibility to control the mesh number of cells and mesh quality the domain was separated into two parts rotating region and stationary region with an interface circular edge between them domain dimensions upstream downstream width and inlet width were set as a function of reference dimensions as shown in fig 3 lmax is the reference for upstream and downstream and wmax is the reference for width and inlet width as shown in fig 4 however in the case of the bare rotor reference dimensions are lmax wmax dr as shown in fig 4 the inlet b c was set to velocity inlet by a magnitude of 9 m s and the two lines beside it were set as openings with atmospheric pressure as well as the outlet to validate the numerical model the same dimensions and boundary conditions were used as in the experiment of kamoji et al 2009b and following the same concept used by sharma sonu and rajesh 2016 2017 the sides of the b c were set to symmetry the rotor edges as well as stator edges were set to no slip wall ansys meshing was used to make the domain mesh the rotating region was made as one surface with structured quadrilateral cells around the rotor edges with inflation to obtain the required value of y equal 1 as shown in fig 5 the stationary region was separated into 9 surfaces all of them with structured quadrilateral cells except the part around the rotating zone as shown in figs 6 and 7 to avoid interpolation error resulting from non conformal mesh where the cells edges are not aligned with each other s at the interface a conformal mesh at the interface between rotating and stationary zones was made by dividing the interface edge into equal divisions as a function of the time step angle therefore for a time step equivalent to 0 5 of rotor rotation the interface edge was separated into 720 equal divisions as shown in fig 5 in this way the mesh at the interface was maintained conformal while rotor rotating the inflation zone created on the rotor blades has the following information for rotor the first layer height growth factor and the number of layers values are 0 02 mm 1 1 and 20 respectively and for stator those values are 0 01 mm 1 1 and 37 respectively 2 3 mesh independence study three independent studies were performed in series to get the optimum numerical model 1 domain size independence study 2 time step size independence study 3 number of cells independence study these three numerical model parameters do not need an exact experimental solution to be validated with where they can be obtained relatively in other words a bigger domain size more mesh cells and smaller time step size surely lead to a more accurate solution and longer time to get the solution so getting proper values leads to the best compromise between the solving time and the accuracy of the results 2 3 1 domain size independence study eight domain sizes were investigated four domain sizes were applied for domain downstream length labeled by 1 in table 1 and the other four were applied for domain width labeled by 2 in table 1 the domain upstream was maintained at 3 dr similar to the work of kamoji et al 2009b the time step used was equivalent to 1 of rotor rotation as an initial value before making the time step independence study in the next step as shown in table 1 the best domain size is 40 dr downstream and 10 dr width that produces an acceptable relative difference and good solving rate not too long solving time for the run these domain dimensions were used in all the upcoming studied cases in this work in the case of the stator the dimensions of the domain size were 40 lmax downstream and 10 wmax width this is achieved in such a manner to keep the same relative dimensions of the domain used in the case of the bare rotor in the case of downstream length independence study it was noticed that the solving rate increases with larger domain size before 50 dr this is because the flow becomes fully developed which enhances the numerical model ability to reach the converged solution in fewer iterations for each time step 2 3 2 time step size independence study the time step size in all cases was set as a function of rotor rotational speed to adjust it exactly equivalent to time step angle where 2 ω 2 tsr v d r rad s 3 time step size π time step angle 180 ω s four models were investigated with different time step angles as shown in table 2 it can be seen that model 3 with a time step angle of 0 5 is the best achieving the criteria of relative difference to be less than 3 therefore it was used in all upcoming simulations 2 3 3 number of cells independence study three models were investigated with a different number of cells all of them were with the domain size and time step obtained from the previous independence studies as shown in table 3 model 2 with the number of cells 125 761 is the best as it achieves the criteria to get a relative difference of less than 3 this model was used to obtain the other tsrs to obtain the rotor characteristic curve which will be used later to investigate the effect of adding stator to the bach type rotor 2 4 turbulence model selecting the appropriate turbulence model is essentially based on the flow details in addition to the available computing resources herein for quasi steady data the well established reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations were sufficiently chosen in the present study as in ansys fluent theory fluent theory guide 2013 in reynolds averaging the solution variables in the instantaneous exact navier stokes equations are decomposed into the mean ensemble averaged or time averaged and fluctuating components for the velocity components 4 u i u i u i where u i and u i are the mean and fluctuating velocity components i 1 2 3 substituting expressions of this form to the flow variables into the instantaneous continuity and momentum equations and taking a time or ensemble average and dropping the over bar on the mean velocity yields the ensemble averaged momentum equations they could be written in the cartesian tensor form for incompressible flow as 5 u i x i 0 6 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i 1 ρ x j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j u l x l x j u i u j where i 1 2 3 is the running index u i is the mean velocity component x i is the cartesian coordinate the turbulence model used in this work is realizable k ε enhanced wall treatment which also has been used by zhou and rempfer tong and dietmar 2013 and mohamed et al mohamed et al 2010 for incompressible flow the realizable k ε model transport equations are 7 k t k u j x j 1 ρ x j μ μ t σ k k x j g k g b ρ ε y m s k 8 ε t ε u j x j 1 ρ x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j c 1 s ε c 2 ε 2 k ν ε c 1 ε ε ρ k c 3 ε g b s ε ρ where 9 c 1 m a x 0 43 η η 5 10 η s k ε 11 s 2 s i j s i j g k represents the generation of turbulence kinetic energy due to mean velocity gradients g b is the generation of turbulence kinetic energy due to buoyancy y m represents the contribution of the fluctuating dilatation incompressible turbulence to the overall dissipation rate both c 2 and c 1 ε are constants σ k and σ ε are the turbulent prandtl numbers for k and ε respectively s k and s ε are user defined source terms μ t is eddy viscosity and s i j is the rate of strain ansys fluent calculated moment from the integral pressure values calculated at cells adjacent to the rotor surface then each force value integral pressure was multiplied in its moment arm length at that time to get cm moment coefficient the moment value was divided by the theoretical torque value which is 1 2 arv 2 for each run the instant values of cm generated from ansys fluent were inserted into a spreadsheet to determine the final value of cm which was calculated as the average of cm instant values over the last cycle of the rotor theoretically the cycle of a two bladed rotor is a half revolution but actually it was different from a case to another the cycle was captured only after the solution becomes periodic before that the values of the cm curve could not be taken into consideration fluent user s guide 2013 the criterion used to stop the solution manually was an increment value of less than 0 001 between the last two values of cm of the last two rotor cycles two examples are shown in fig 8 for two different runs configurations in the first case shown in fig 8 a the rotor rotation cycle was a half revolution and only 5 6 s were required equivalent to 52 4 revolutions to achieve the criteria then stop the solution on the other hand the second example shown in fig 8 b the rotor cycle was 11 revolutions and it needed 14 9 s equivalent to 138 9 revolutions to achieve the criteria then stop the solution the final value of cp then was calculated from cm where c p tsr c m the curvature correction option was enabled to make the model more sensitive to the rotor rotation and curvature fluent user s guide 2013 the pressure velocity coupling scheme used was coupled to improve the rate of solution convergence spatial discretization of the gradient was set to least squares cell based and for pressure was set to second order which provided improved accuracy over the standard and linear scheme luent user s guide 2013 for momentum turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent dissipation rate the spatial discretization was set to second order upwind the transient formulation was set to second order implicit the option high order term relaxation was enabled to improve the startup and the general solution behavior of flow simulation fluent user s guide 2013 solution under relaxation factors was kept to their default values the sliding mesh model smm which is a transient model was used to solve all cases but the moving reference frame model is a steady model used to initialize the solution before starting the smm solution this solving procedure decreases the solving time where the cm curve could reach the periodicity steady state in fewer time steps than solving directly by smm wind speed used was 9 m s and re equal to 150 000 based on dr similar to the method used by kamoji et al 2009b 2 5 validation cfd modeling technique is considered one of the commonly trusted analytical tools it provides a clear understanding of the effect of different wind turbine configurations on its performance besides the flow field prediction around the turbine configuration enables us to declare its aerodynamic behavior however previously published experimental results should be used to validate the performed model as mentioned before the geometry employed was identical to that previously investigated by kamoji et al 2009b but without the new stator the final characteristic curve of the bach type rotor was obtained by using different values of tsr as shown in fig 9 the maximum cp achieved was 0 1932 at tsr 0 75 such a power coefficient was calculated using the following equation 12 c p t ω 1 2 ρ a v 3 t s r c m 13 c m t 1 2 ρ a r v 2 the deviation was calculated from the obtained characteristic curve and was found to be 0 2 at tsr 0 75 most common value where the maximum cp exists which believed to be in a good agreement with the previous experimental work 3 results and discussion as stated earlier eight geometrical parameters of the stator were investigated one factor at a time the baseline configuration of the stator parameters used is presented in table 4 the stator includes mainly three elements obstacle shield and guide plate the obstacle has four parameters which are l2 rr θ2 x rr and y rr the shield has only two parameters α and tc rr finally the guide plate has also two parameters θ1 and l1 rr throughout the study the value of each parameter was changed while maintaining the other parameters fixed and cp was recorded the same procedure was repeated with the next parameter until obtaining the optimum stator design 3 1 effect of geometrical parameters on average cp macroscopic study as shown in fig 10 the shield angle α was the first studied parameter values from 0 to 90 were tested the zero angle means that there is no shield the other parameters were maintained at their baseline values as mentioned in table 1 higher values of α deteriorate the rotor performance because the shield extends to the downstream region of the advancing blade which constrains the flow to be streamed through the stator the highest cp obtained was at α 15 therefore this shield angle will be fixed for the upcoming parameter studies the guide plate inclination angle θ1 was the second parameter studied it is the responsible parameter for directing wind to the advancing blade which generates the stagnation pressure on its concave side to produce positive work as θ1 increases cp increases as shown in fig 10 the maximum enhancement in cp takes place at θ1 55 beyond this optimum value of θ1 cp decreases besides the length of the guide plate relative to the rotor radius l1 rr was then investigated as the third parameter as shown in fig 12 the optimum value of l1 rr 4 was recorded for maximum cp the fourth parameter studied was the tip clearance between the rotor and stator shield relative to the rotor radius tc rr as shown in fig 11 it is one of the most effective parameters which influences the rotor performance maximum cp was achieved at an optimum value of tc rr 0 75 higher values of tc rr makes the shield and the guide plate of the stator apart enough from the rotor which reduces their effect on its performance on the other side lower values of tc rr than the optimum value constrains wind from streaming through the stator leading to a reduction in rotor cp the fifth parameter studied was the obstacle length relative to the rotor radius l2 rr the obstacle angle θ2 was kept at its baseline value which equals to 45 with the vertical axis maximum cp was obtained at l2 rr 1 5 the more the obstacle length the more decrease in cp value as shown in fig 12 it was noticed that the effect of the fifth parameter l2 rr on the enhancement of cp was greater than that of the third parameter l1 rr the effect of the obstacle angle θ2 as the sixth parameter on cp was analyzed and presented in fig 10 with the obtained optimum length parameter value l2 rr which equals 1 5 the maximum cp was obtained at θ2 65 see fig 10 the results presented in fig 11 showed that cp increased when moving the obstacle away from the rotor vertical centerline seventh parameter until x rr 0 7 as a result the inlet width of the stator increased consequently a more mass flow rate of air passed through the stator which in turn improved cp through the range of x rr 0 7 1 the obstacle started to lose its role where it prevented the wind from striking the returning blade to avoid negative torque therefore cp was slightly decreased cp increased again through the narrow range of x rr 1 1 1 the air stream started to find a pass relatively far from the returning blade which reduced the stagnation pressure on it and accordingly reduced the negative torque the optimum value of x rr 1 1 was achieved as shown in fig 11 similarly cp increased when moving the obstacle away from the rotor horizontal centerline eighth parameter until an optimum value of y rr 0 3 generally the dominant parameters that affect the aerodynamic performance of the turbine are θ2 x rr y rr and l2 rr see figs 10 12 respectively however it can be concluded from this parametric study that the main effective element in the turbine stator is the obstacle 3 2 effect of geometrical parameters on instantaneous cp microscopic study the cp cycle of the optimum configuration of each parameter was also investigated in addition to the case of the bare rotor the cycle of some cases was one rotor revolution 360 while in other cases the cycle was more than one revolution e g 13 revolutions therefore in these cases an equivalent cycle was determined and then the closest revolution to the equivalent cycle was taken as the final cp cycle of the case maximum and minimum values of cp for all geometrical parameters of the stator were achieved in the rotor angles range of 50 60 and 115 130 respectively as shown in table 4 and fig 13 static pressure contours and velocity streamlines were generated for the bare rotor and the rosc rotor with optimum stator configuration at two different rotor angles the first angle 52 and 232 is the angle where the maximum cp is achieved by the rosc as shown in figs 14 and 15 respectively on the other hand the second angle 176 and 356 is the angle of the bare rotor where maximum c p takes place as shown in figs 16 and 17 respectively these figures demonstrate microscopically the flow field of the bare rotor and the rosc at certain instants rotor positions to understand its aerodynamic performance moreover these results help us to elaborate and realize the features and advantages of the new stator configuration in fig 14 a a small low pressure zone was formed near the tip of the advanced blade of the bare rotor nevertheless a large low pressure zone was created behind the advanced blade of the rosc as shown in fig 14 b besides a high pressure zone upstream of the rotor was produced because of the stator design these variations in the pressure zones between the bare rotor and the rosc are the key features of the enhancement of the power generated due to the optimum stator design the obstacle of the stator plays a vital role in the enhancement of the turbine performance the obstacle entrains more streamlines away from striking the returning blade besides the stator directs more streamlines into the advanced blade of the rotor to enhance the positive torque generated on it see fig 15 fig 16 a b illustrates the comparison of the static pressure distribution between the bare rotor and the rotor with rosc the stator slightly increased the static pressure upstream of the rotor in this position 176 356 the bare rotor produced maximum cp however the rotor with the rosc still generates a larger amount of cp the velocity streamlines explain the variations of the flow field between the bare rotor and the rotor with rosc as shown in fig 17 the rosc still has the privilege over the bare rotor 3 3 optimum configuration of the stator the obtained results revealed that the values of the optimum configuration parameters of the stator that achieves the maximum cp at tsr 0 75 are α 15 θ1 55 l1 rr 4 tc rr 0 75 l2 rr 1 5 θ2 65 x rr 1 1 and y rr 0 3 fig 18 illustrates the performance curve of the rosc in comparison with the bare rotor performance curve the stator has a great effect on rotor performance at tsr 0 75 the bare rotor achieved a cp value of 0 1932 its maximum cp value while rosc achieved a cp value of 0 557 this means that for the same tsr the cp of rosc was raised to 2 88 times its value at the bare rotor furthermore the maximum cp of rosc increased remarkably and achieved 0 668 at tsr 1 2 compared with 0 112 for the bare rotor thus the new stator provides a maximum cp value of about 6 times greater than that of the bare rotor it can be also observed that the operating range of such a turbine is increased up to tsr 1 6 compared with the bare rotor turbine also a comparison was performed between rosc savonius cylindrical blade with an obstacle mohamed et al 2010 savonius optimal blade shape with obstacle mohamed et al 2011 savonius immersed in water with one deflector kailash et al 2012 and two deflectors golecha et al 2011 such a comparison proved that the optimum stator configuration has the privilege over the obstacle in the enhancement of the power coefficient of the savonius turbine 4 conclusions to enhance a bach type savonius rotor performance a new stator of three parts composed of shield obstacle and guide plate was utilized eight geometrical parameters describing the stator configuration were investigated accordingly the following conclusions may be drawn 1 the optimum values of each configuration parameters that achieves maximum cp are α 15 θ1 55 l1 rr 4 tc rr 0 75 l2 rr 1 5 θ2 65 x rr 1 1 and y rr 0 3 2 at tsr 0 75 the cp of rosc is raised to 2 88 times its value at the bare rotor 3 the maximum cp of the rotor with rosc reaches a value of 6 times that of the bare rotor at tip speed ratio equals 1 2 4 the dominant parameters that affect the aerodynamic performance of the turbine are θ2 x rr y rr and l2 rr for future works it is recommended to re study this stator with a factorial approach to take into consideration the interaction between geometrical parameters also it is recommended to perform another optimization study to these eight geometrical parameters but

21429,coastal erosion of beaches has been a common problem around the world one of the eco friendly control measures for coastal erosion is to dissipate the energy of waves impinging on the shores by constructing offshore breakwater pile breakwater is one such type of offshore breakwater that consists of a number of closely spaced piles construction of piles at closer spacing is highly challenging and expensive this problem can be addressed by reducing the number of piles and modifying the pile with an enlarged head in the vicinity of the water surface where wave energy is concentrated in the present study an experimental investigation on the hydraulic performance of enlarged pile head breakwater is conducted in a wave flume the concept breakwater is subjected to monochromatic waves of varying wave heights wave periods and water depth the experimental results show that the least value of transmission coefficient is 0 62 and reflection coefficient is 0 123 with the highest value of dissipation coefficient of 0 77 for the structural configuration of b d ratio of 0 2 d hmax of 0 6 and y hmax of 1 0 at a water depth of 0 3 m observed results are encouraging and are in line with the similar type of pile breakwaters in a single row the present experimental data is also validated with the available theoretical solutions since the results from the compared theoretical solution are not in good agreement a hybrid theoretical model is reconstructed based on experimental results of pile head breakwater the proposed modified version of the hybrid equation predicts encouragingly better transmission reflection and dissipation coefficient than the existing solutions moreover the results predicted by the proposed hybrid equation are in good agreement with that of other similar pile breakwater models keywords coastal protection pile breakwater enlarged pile head wave transmission wave reflection energy dissipation 1 introduction coastal erosion in any region needs to be addressed judiciously if not that can threaten settlements and economic interests of the region construction of conventional breakwaters to control the erosion are effective for the region concerned but may cause severe erosion or accretion as they are prone to block the littoral drift for small recreational harbours or fisheries harbours and at locations where large littoral drift or onshore offshore sediment movement exist unconventional types of breakwaters like floating breakwater or piled breakwaters can be constructed mani and jayakumar 1995 rao et al 1999 suh et al 2011 pile breakwaters are the type of breakwaters constructed using piles of uniform diameter at closer spacing and are also called conventional or regular pile breakwaters pile breakwaters are constructed and

breakwater neelamani and rajendran 2002 and integration of pile supported or floating breakwater with wave energy convertor zhao and ning 2018 zhao et al 2019 were invented all these types of breakwaters utilise the concept of dissipating or extracting wave energy to achieve the function of coastal protection in the present concept to dissipate waves energy at the surface the diameter of the pile near the free surface is increased the increased portion is termed as a pile head and pile trunk is the portion below the head the hydraulic performance of enlarged pile head breakwater is investigated through physical experiments and theoretical investigations as there are no such studies conducted in the present study wave transmission reflection and energy dissipation by the enlarged pile head breakwater are examined experimentally in 1 30 scaled wave flume at the national institute of technology karnataka nitk surathkal the experimental models are subjected to regular waves of

investigation has been carried out 1 to investigate wave transmission reflection and energy dissipation characteristics of enlarged pile head breakwater under monochromatic waves 2 to investigate the effective relative clear spacing and configuration of pile head w r t maximum wave height 3 to develop and compare the theoretical solution with the measured wave transmission reflection and energy dissipation characteristics wave transmission reflection and energy dissipation due to the enlarged pile head breakwater are the important parameters to understand the hydraulic performance of the new concept breakwater wave transmission capability of the new concept breakwater is the key factors in deciding the appropriate structural configurations the wave reflection characteristics are necessary to understand the wave climate at the seaside of the structure the study on energy dissipation characteristics is essential to understand the efficiency of the structure as a breakwater a breakwater can be considered to be performing well if the energy dissipation capability is high with the least transmission and reflection 2 experimental setup and data acquisition experiments are conducted in monochromatic wave flume available in the marine structures laboratory of applied mechanics and hydraulics department nitk surathkal the two dimensional wave flume has dimensions of 50 m 0 71 m 1 1 m

diagram of the experimental setup 2 1 enlarged pile head structure enlarged pile head breakwater is modeled with a 1 30 scale using froude s similitude criteria the investigation is conducted for different water depths h and by varying the wave heights h and wave periods t the pile structure consists of pile head and trunk whose dimensions are listed in table 1 and the configurations of the pile head are shown in fig 2 the trunk portion of the pile structure is solid and made of pvc pipes of 40 mm diameter infilled with concrete the head portion of the structure is made of wood and is open at the top with 0 01 m wall thickness for the present study the height y and diameter d of the piles are varied from 0 080 m to 0 160 m and 0 064 m 0 096 m respectively 2 2 experimental procedure experiments are conducted on a single row of pile groups before conducting the experiments wave flume was calibrated for the considered combinations of wave heights and wave periods capacitance type wave probes are installed to measure the water surface elevation the probes are also calibrated every time before starting the experiment wave height measurement with three probes method as suggested by isaacson 1991 is used for calculating the wave reflection three probes are installed before the model in the seaward side to measure the incident and reflected wave heights the spacing between the probes in the seaward side is adjusted to one third of the wavelength to ensure accuracy of wave reflections goda and suzuki 1976 isaacson 1991 transmitted wave heights ht are recorded from a probe which is placed at a distance l from the model towards lee side in the current investigation experiments are conducted for 0 3 m 0 4 m and 0 5 m water depths for all considered water depths the pile head is fixed in such a manner that the water level is at the centre of the pile head the schematic arrangement of the pile head breakwater for different water depth is shown in fig 3 the height of the pile head pile diameter and pile trunk are varied with respect to the maximum wave height hmax for the current study maximum wave height of 4 8 m is considered table 2 shows the list of

study a hybrid solution developed by suh et al 2011 is improved by reconstructing the empirical coefficient and validating the same based on the current experimental data the potential of the modified

by suh et al 2011 for the current experimental data are investigated as a part of the present research attempts have been made to derive an independent solution by modifying the empirically calculated γ parameter as defined by suh et al 2011 the empirically reformed γ equation using the current set of experimental data and is given by 30 γ 1 569 h i h f y 2 h 0 433 for regular pile breakwater eq 30 is modified by considering the value of y 2 h 1 then eq 30 for regular pile breakwater becomes 31 γ 1 569 h i h f 0 433 3 results and discussion the experimental results are presented in graphical form by considering the non dimensional parameters the results are analysed by considering various parameters like incident wave steepness hi gt2 relative spacing between the piles water depth diameter and height of pile head on wave transmission kt reflection kr and energy dissipation kd as observed from the scatter plots figs 5 10 the wave structure interaction is not consistent enough to exhibit a perfect correlation with wave parameters therefore best fit lines are shown for better visualisations 3 1 effect of incident wave steepness the transmission coefficient is plotted against the incident wave steepness hi gt2 as shown in figs 5 7 for the different relative spacing between piles and varying water depth it is observed that irrespective of the water depth or relative pile spacing transmission coefficient decreases with the increasing incident wave steepness this behaviour is because steeper waves are more likely to break and dissipate energy and hence the transmission reduces this type of behaviour is similar to the findings of other types of pile breakwaters as reported by koraim et al 2014 mani and jayakumar 1995 rao and rao 2001 1999 and van weele and herbich 1972 3 2 effect of relative pile spacing b d on kt to know the influence of b d on kt graphs are plotted for kt versus hi gt2 with b d as a third variable figs 5 7 show that as the b d decreases from 1 2 to 0 2 the transmission coefficient decreases for all the wave steepness considered in the present study from fig 5 a 6 a and 7 a for pile head of diameter 0 0640 m d hmax 0 4 and head height 0 08 m y hmax 0 5 with b d decreasing from 1 2 to 0 2 value of kt decreases from 0 975 to 0 8375 14 1 and 0 91 to 0 79 13 18 at lower wave steepness 0 0015 and higher wave steepness 0 0062 respectively from fig 5 b 6 b and 7 b for diameter of pile head 0 0640 m d hmax 0 4 and height 0 16 m y hmax 1 0 with decreasing b d from 1 2 to 0 2 kt value decreases to 0 825 from 0 97 14 94 and 0 76 from 0 9 15 55 at lower wave steepness 0 0015 and higher wave steepness 0 0062 respectively above analysis shows that b d 0 2 is the optimum relative spacing for the enlarged pile breakwater 3 3 pile head characteristics the geometry of the enlarged pile head breakwater is an important parameter in wave transmission the effect of increasing the area of pile head by varying its height and diameter against the initial parameter of maximum wave height is investigated the height of pile head y is increased from 0 5 times the hmax i e 0 08 m to 1 0 times the hmax i e 0 16 m and diameter d from 0 4hmax i e 0 064 m to 0 6hmax i e 0 096 m as evident from section 4 2 the relative pile spacing of 0 2 is optimum hence while analysing the effect of pile head characteristics the spacing between the pile b d is fixed as 0 2 the graphs are plotted by considering kt kr and kd versus hi gt2 are as shown in fig 8 to fig 10 for three water depths in figs 8 10 best fit lines are considered for better visualisation in the analysis of results the effect of pile head characteristics is discussed comprehensively in the following sections 3 3 1 effect of pile head diameter on transmission influence of diameter of pile head is examined by varying the d hmax from 0 4 to 0 6 i e 0 064 m 0 096 m at three water depths for 0 3 m water depth refer fig 8 when y hmax 0 5 kt decreases by 2 8 i e 0 836 to 0 812 at lower wave steepness 0 0020 and 11 0 798 0 710 at higher wave steepness 0 0055 for the same case when y hmax is 1 0 kt decreases by 3 8 i e 0 81 to 0 779 at lower wave steepness and 12 8 0 741 0 646 at higher wave steepness referring to fig 9 for 0 4 m water depth when y hmax is 0 5 kt decreases by 0 22 and 5 95 at the lower and higher wave steepness respectively however when y hmax is 1 0 kt decreases by 0 94 at lower wave steepness and 7 61 at higher wave steepness for the case of 0 5 m water depth as per fig 10 the value of kt decreases by 5 20 at lower wave steepness and 7 50 at higher wave steepness for y hmax is 0 5 when y hmax is increased to 1 0 from 0 5 kt decreases by 2 63 and 5 09 at lower and higher wave steepness respectively the above analysis concludes that when the ratio of d hmax increases from 0 4 to 0 6 irrespective of water depth the performance of enlarged pile head breakwater increases the same can also be visualised from figs 8 10 where the least value of kt is obtained for the case of d hmax 0 6 for all considered water depths the probable reason for the increased performance of breakwater with increasing d hmax ratio is mainly due to the increased projected surface area of the pile for wave structure interaction 3 3 2 effect of pile head height on transmission the effect of pile head height on the transmission is studied by fixing d hmax to 0 6 and varying y hmax from 0 5 to 1 0 for all the considered water depths as per fig 8 when the pile head height is varied from y hmax of 0 5 1 0 the transmission coefficient changes from 0 813 to 0 779 i e 4 04 reduction at lower wave steepness of 0 0021 and from 0 710 to 0 646 i e 8 92 reduction at higher wave steepness of 0 0052 for the water depth of 0 4 m refer fig 9 the percentage reduction of kt is 4 4 and 6 33 at lower and higher wave steepness respectively for 0 5 m water depth refer fig 10 percentage reduction of kt is 0 822 at lower wave steepness and 2 44 at higher wave steepness the above analysis indicates that for all the water depths considered the efficiency of the enlarged pile head breakwater increases with the increase in pile head height the least value of kt is obtained for the case when y hmax 1 0 the reason for the same is due to the increased projected area opposing the wave 3 3 3 effect of pile head diameter and height on wave reflection and dissipations fig 8 b fig 9 b and fig 10 b indicate that in general as the wave steepness increases reflection increases it is also envisaged from fig 8 b fig 9 b and fig 10 b that the reflection coefficient follows reverse order to that of transmission coefficient for d hmax 0 4 to 0 6 and y hmax 0 5 to 1 0 reflection decreases with increase in water depth the pile head configuration of d hmax 0 6 with y hmax 1 0 shows higher reflection than d hmax 0 4 with y hmax 0 5 and 1 0 from fig 8 c figure 9 c and figure 10 c it can be envisaged that with the increase in wave steepness wave energy dissipated by the structure increases higher dissipation is observed when d hmax 0 6 and y hmax 1 0 similarly lower dissipation is observed when d hmax 0 4 and y hmax 0 5 percentage increase in wave energy dissipation when d hmax increases from 0 4 to 0 6 and y hmax from 0 5 to 1 0 at 0 3 m water depth is 10 0 at lower wave steepness and 19 0 at higher wave steepness for 0 4 m water depth dissipation increases to 13 18 and 20 76 at lower and higher wave steepness respectively for water depth of 0 5 m dissipation increases to 26 15 at lower wave steepness and 16 10 higher wave steepness the above analysis indicates that the wave energy dissipated by the structure decreases with increasing water depth 3 4 effect of relative submergence of pile head and depth of water for 0 3 m water depth when the pile head submergence is increased by 100 i e 13 333 26 667 the percentage decrease in transmission coefficient is 4 04 at lower wave steepness and 9 57 at higher wave steepness as illustrated in fig 11 for the same case of pile head submergence when the water depth is 0 4 m kt decreases by 4 39 and 6 50 at lower and higher wave steepness respectively however when the water depth is 0 5 m a marginal decrease in kt 0 822 at lower wave steepness and 2 7 at higher wave steepness are observed in general with the decrease in water depth the transmission coefficient is also decreased hence enlarged pile head breakwater is more effective at lower water depths with relative submergence of 26 667 pile head as shown in fig 11 b and c reflection and wave energy dissipated by the pile head of size d hmax 0 6 and y hmax 1 0 at 0 3 m water depth is more than any other case or type analysed in the present study hence it can be said that if the enlarged pile breakwaters are installed near the shore approximate water depth of 9 0 m it is more effective in reducing the wave energy approaching the shore the reason for the increased efficiency of the structure with decreasing water depth is mainly due to the increase in the projected surface area of the pile head which may block the entire wave and thus increasing wave attenuation this behaviour can be explained by considering the case of d hmax 0 6 and y hmax 1 0 the calculated percentage overall blockage area for 0 5 m 0 4 m and 0 3 m water depths are 41 374 43 267 and 46 422 respectively hence with decreasing water depth the blockage for wave increases and the velocity of the wave approaching also decreases resulting in increased efficiency 3 5 comparison with other research works the hydraulic performance of the present concept model as obtained by the physical model test is compared with the available data wherever possible as provided by the authors huang 2007 rao and rao 2001 1999 mani and jayakumar 1995 and mani 1989 the transmission coefficient of enlarged pile head breakwater at gentle waves is higher than 3 68 mani 1989 8 36 mani and jayakumar 1995 4 21 rao and rao 2001 1999 and 4 95 huang 2007 for higher wave steepness the transmission coefficient is more than 12 5 rao and rao 2001 1999 and 15 13 huang 2007 and less than 0 74 mani 1989 0 44 mani and jayakumar 1995 fig 12 b indicates less reflection for the enlarged pile head breakwater than the compared breakwaters in terms of the dissipation coefficient the proposed breakwater is better than rao and rao 2001 1999 by 4 43 at lower wave steepness and 16 32 at higher wave steepness when compared with huang 2007 it is more than by 36 9 at lower wave steepness and 25 06 at higher wave steepness therefore by considering the above results it can be stated that the hydraulic performance of enlarged pile head breakwater with the ratios d hmax 0 6 and y hmax 1 0 is better than the other types of breakwaters 3 6 experimental phenomena an idea of introducing enlarged head over the regular pile breakwater is effective in increasing the hydraulic performance of the regular pile breakwater as described in section 4 5 the enhanced performance of the enlarged pile head breakwater is because of unique and increased wave structure interactions due to the hollow pile head causing increased turbulence and hence larger wave energy dissipation as visible in the photographs shown fig 13 3 7 comparison of experimental and theoretical studies the present experimental results are compared with the mei 1989 kriebel 1992 and suh et al 2011 theoretical equations as quoted by suh et al 2011 mei 1989 obtained the transmission and reflection equations by the equations of continuity and motion of small amplitude waves in shallow water mei 1989 derived equations as 32 k t u 0 g k h i 2 h 33 k r 1 ω u 0 g k h i 2 where u 0 h i 2 h g k 1 2 α 1 α α 4 3 π f h i 2 h f is given by eq 15 kriebel 1992 equation is similar to the mei 1989 solution and is as follows 34 k t 1 4 t t 1 2 t t 35 k r 1 1 4 t t 1 2 t t where t t f 6 h i 2 π k s i n h 2 k h 2 k h s i n h 2 k h is the transmission function suh et al 2011 hybrid solution is given in eqs 15 29 about 560 experimental test cases were compared to check the validity of the theoretical equations coefficients like kt kr and kd as obtained by the theoretical equations are compared with the experimental results in fig 14 the equations developed by mei 1989 and kriebel 1992 predict the transmission coefficient for pile head breakwater with a variation coefficient r2 of 0 5865 as shown in fig 14 a and b both the equations underpredict the transmission coefficient and dissipation coefficient but over predicted the reflection coefficient suh et al 2011 hybrid solution over predicts the transmission coefficient whereas reflections and dissipations are underpredicted as shown in fig 14 c the transmission coefficient obtained by using the hybrid solution developed by suh et al 2011 has given an r2 of 0 4804 fig 14 d shows the value of kt kr and kd predicted by the present modified hybrid equation the r2 value for the transmission coefficient for the present hybrid solution is 0 8953 hence it is evident from fig 14 a d that for the enlarged pile head breakwater the present hybrid equation predicts the better value of kt kr and kd than the other compared equations the present hybrid equation predicts better values of coefficient due to the empirically improved γ parameter 3 8 validation of present hybrid equation for conventional circular pile breakwater the present hybrid equation is validated for the regular circular pile breakwater using eq 31 for the present study rao 1999 experimental data on non perforated circular pile breakwater is used details of the experimental data are shown in table 3 transmission reflection and dissipation coefficient as obtained by rao et al 1999 are also compared with the equation proposed by mei 1989 kriebel 1992 and suh et al 2011 fig 15 shows the comparison of predicted values of kt kr and kd with the rao 1999 experimental data the variation coefficient obtained for the case kt kr and kd are shown in table 4 4 conclusions from the experimental studies conducted on the enlarged pile head breakwater the following conclusions are drawn in general with an increase in wave steepness the transmission coefficient decreases reflection increases and the energy dissipation coefficient increases the structural parameters relative spacing between the pile the diameter of pile head and the height of pile head wave parameters wave period and wavelength and depth of water are the important parameters influencing the wave transmission reflection and energy dissipations with the decrease in relative spacing between the piles from 0 9 to 0 2 a maximum of 19 75 reduction in kt is obtained for the case of d hmax 0 6 with y hmax 1 0 at 0 3 m water depth for the enlarged pile head breakwater existing theoretical equations have not performed better the present modified version of the hybrid equation in line with suh et al 2011 hybrid solution has given better results the validation of the present hybrid equation for the regular circular pile breakwater shows promisingly encouraging values of hydraulic coefficients as compared with the experimental results the proposed hybrid equation predicts more desirable values of coefficients of kt kr and kd for the case of regular circular and enlarged pile head breakwater than compared with the exiting equations hence the proposed hybrid solution can be used for predicting the hydraulic characteristics of pile breakwaters subjected to monochromatic waves an average increase in the dissipation coefficient of about 20 is obtained for the compared huang 2007 mani and jayakumar 1995 mani 1989 rao and rao 2001 1999 breakwater therefore enlarged pile breakwater structure with the structural configuration of b d 0 2 with a

21429,coastal erosion of beaches has been a common problem around the world one of the eco friendly control measures for coastal erosion is to dissipate the energy of waves impinging on the shores by constructing offshore breakwater pile breakwater is one such type of offshore breakwater that consists of a number of closely spaced piles construction of piles at closer spacing is highly challenging and expensive this problem can be addressed by reducing the number of piles and modifying the pile with an enlarged head in the vicinity of the water surface where wave energy is concentrated in the present study an experimental investigation on the hydraulic performance of enlarged pile head breakwater is conducted in a wave flume the concept breakwater is subjected to monochromatic waves of varying wave heights wave periods and water depth the experimental results show that the least value of transmission coefficient is 0 62 and reflection coefficient is 0 123 with the highest value of dissipation coefficient of 0 77 for the structural configuration of b d ratio of 0 2 d hmax of 0 6 and y hmax of 1 0 at a water depth of 0 3 m observed results are encouraging and are in line with the similar type of pile breakwaters in a single row the present experimental data is also validated with the available theoretical solutions since the results from the compared theoretical solution are not in good agreement a hybrid theoretical model is reconstructed based on experimental results of pile head breakwater the proposed modified version of the hybrid equation predicts encouragingly better transmission reflection and dissipation coefficient than the existing solutions moreover the results predicted by the proposed hybrid equation are in good agreement with that of other similar pile breakwater models keywords coastal protection pile breakwater enlarged pile head wave transmission wave reflection energy dissipation 1 introduction coastal erosion in any region needs to be addressed judiciously if not that can threaten settlements and economic interests of the region construction of conventional breakwaters to control the erosion are effective for the region concerned but may cause severe erosion or accretion as they are prone to block the littoral drift for small recreational harbours or fisheries harbours and at locations where large littoral drift or onshore offshore sediment movement exist unconventional types of breakwaters like floating breakwater or piled breakwaters can be constructed mani and jayakumar 1995 rao et al 1999 suh et al 2011 pile breakwaters are the type of breakwaters constructed using piles of uniform diameter at closer spacing and are also called conventional or regular pile breakwaters pile breakwaters are constructed and

breakwaters utilise the concept of dissipating or extracting wave energy to achieve the function of coastal protection in the present concept to dissipate waves energy at the surface the diameter of the pile near the free surface is increased the increased portion is termed as a pile head and pile trunk is the portion below the head the hydraulic performance of enlarged pile head breakwater is investigated through physical experiments and theoretical investigations as there are no such studies conducted in the present study wave transmission reflection and energy dissipation by the enlarged pile head breakwater are examined experimentally in 1 30 scaled wave flume at the national institute of technology karnataka nitk surathkal the experimental models are subjected to regular waves of

investigation has been carried out 1 to investigate wave transmission reflection and energy dissipation characteristics of enlarged pile head breakwater under monochromatic waves 2 to investigate the effective relative clear spacing and configuration of pile head w r t maximum wave height 3 to develop and compare the theoretical solution with the measured wave transmission reflection and energy dissipation characteristics wave transmission reflection and energy dissipation due to the enlarged pile head breakwater are the important parameters to understand the hydraulic performance of the new concept breakwater wave transmission capability of the new concept breakwater is the key factors in deciding the appropriate structural configurations the wave reflection characteristics are necessary to understand the wave climate at the seaside of the structure the study on energy dissipation characteristics is essential to understand the efficiency of the structure as a breakwater a breakwater can be considered to be performing well if the energy dissipation capability is high with the least transmission and reflection 2 experimental setup and data acquisition experiments are conducted in monochromatic wave flume available in the marine structures laboratory of applied mechanics and hydraulics department nitk surathkal the two dimensional wave flume has dimensions of 50 m 0 71 m 1 1 m

open at the top with 0 01 m wall thickness for the present study the height y and diameter d of the piles are varied from 0 080 m to 0 160 m and 0 064 m 0 096 m respectively 2 2 experimental procedure experiments are conducted on a single row of pile groups before conducting the experiments wave flume was calibrated for the considered combinations of wave heights and wave periods capacitance type wave probes are installed to measure the water surface elevation the probes are also calibrated every time before starting the experiment wave height measurement with three probes method as suggested by isaacson 1991 is used for calculating the wave reflection three probes are installed before the model in the seaward side to measure the incident and reflected wave heights the spacing between the probes in the seaward side is adjusted to one third of the wavelength to ensure accuracy of wave reflections goda and suzuki 1976 isaacson 1991 transmitted wave heights ht are recorded from a probe which is placed at a distance l from the model towards lee side in the current investigation experiments are conducted for 0 3 m 0 4 m and 0 5 m water depths for all considered water depths the pile

study a hybrid solution developed by suh et al 2011 is improved by reconstructing the empirical coefficient and validating the same based on the current experimental data the potential of the modified hybrid solution for conventional pile breakwater is also verified by using rao 1999 experimental data 2 5 theoretical background the typical arrangement of enlarged pile head breakwater is shown in

by suh et al 2011 for the current experimental data are investigated as a part of the present research attempts have been made to derive an independent solution by modifying the empirically calculated γ parameter as defined by suh et al 2011 the empirically reformed γ equation using the current set of experimental data and is given by 30 γ 1 569 h i h f y 2 h 0 433 for regular pile breakwater eq 30 is modified by considering the value of y 2 h 1 then eq 30 for regular pile breakwater becomes 31 γ 1 569 h i h f 0 433 3 results and discussion the experimental results are presented in graphical form by considering the non dimensional parameters the results are analysed by considering various parameters like incident wave steepness hi gt2 relative spacing between the piles water depth diameter and height of pile head on wave transmission kt reflection kr and energy dissipation kd as observed from the scatter plots figs 5 10 the wave structure interaction is not consistent enough to exhibit a perfect correlation with wave parameters therefore best fit lines are shown for better visualisations 3 1 effect of incident wave steepness the transmission coefficient is plotted against the incident wave steepness hi gt2 as shown in figs 5 7 for the different relative spacing between piles and varying water depth it is observed that irrespective of the water depth or relative pile spacing transmission coefficient decreases with the increasing incident wave steepness this behaviour is because steeper waves are more likely to break and dissipate energy and hence the transmission reduces this type of behaviour is similar to the findings of other types of pile breakwaters as reported by koraim et al 2014 mani and jayakumar 1995 rao and rao 2001 1999 and van weele and herbich 1972 3 2 effect of relative pile spacing b d on kt to know the influence of b d on kt graphs are plotted for kt versus hi gt2 with b d as a third variable figs 5 7 show that as the b d decreases from 1 2 to 0 2 the transmission coefficient decreases for all the wave steepness considered in the present study from fig 5 a 6 a and 7 a for pile head of diameter 0 0640 m d hmax 0 4 and head height 0 08 m y hmax 0 5 with b d decreasing from 1 2 to 0 2 value of kt decreases from 0 975 to 0 8375 14 1 and 0 91 to 0 79 13 18 at lower wave steepness 0 0015 and higher wave steepness 0 0062 respectively from fig 5 b 6 b and 7 b for diameter of pile head 0 0640 m d hmax 0 4 and height 0 16 m y hmax 1 0 with decreasing b d from 1 2 to 0 2 kt value decreases to 0 825 from 0 97 14 94 and 0 76 from 0 9 15 55 at lower wave steepness 0 0015 and higher wave steepness 0 0062 respectively above analysis shows that b d 0 2 is the optimum relative spacing for the enlarged pile breakwater 3 3 pile head characteristics the geometry of the enlarged pile head breakwater is an important parameter in wave transmission the effect of increasing the area of pile head by varying its height and diameter against the initial parameter of maximum wave height is investigated the height of pile head y is increased from 0 5 times the hmax i e 0 08 m to 1 0 times the hmax i e 0 16 m and diameter d from 0 4hmax i e 0 064 m to 0 6hmax i e 0 096 m as evident from section 4 2 the relative pile spacing of 0 2 is optimum hence while analysing the effect of pile head characteristics the spacing between the pile b d is fixed as 0 2 the graphs are plotted by considering kt kr and kd versus hi gt2 are as shown in fig 8 to fig 10 for three water depths in figs 8 10 best fit lines are considered for better visualisation in the analysis of results the effect of pile head characteristics is discussed comprehensively in the following sections 3 3 1 effect of pile head diameter on transmission influence of diameter of pile head is examined by varying the d hmax from 0 4 to 0 6 i e 0 064 m 0 096 m at three water depths for 0 3 m water depth refer fig 8 when y hmax 0 5 kt decreases by 2 8 i e 0 836 to 0 812 at lower wave steepness 0 0020 and 11 0 798 0 710 at higher wave steepness 0 0055 for the same case when y hmax is 1 0 kt decreases by 3 8 i e 0 81 to 0 779 at lower wave steepness and 12 8 0 741 0 646 at higher wave steepness referring to fig 9 for 0 4 m water depth when y hmax is 0 5 kt decreases by 0 22 and 5 95 at the lower and higher wave steepness respectively however when y hmax is 1 0 kt decreases by 0 94 at lower wave steepness and 7 61 at higher wave steepness for the case of 0 5 m water depth as per fig 10 the value of kt decreases by 5 20 at lower wave steepness and 7 50 at higher wave steepness for y hmax is 0 5 when y hmax is increased to 1 0 from 0 5 kt decreases by 2 63 and 5 09 at lower and higher wave steepness respectively the above analysis concludes that when the ratio of d hmax increases from 0 4 to 0 6 irrespective of water depth the performance of enlarged pile head breakwater increases the same can also be visualised from figs 8 10 where the least value of kt is obtained for the case of d hmax 0 6 for all considered water depths the probable reason for the increased performance of breakwater with increasing d hmax ratio is mainly due to the increased projected surface area of the pile for wave structure interaction 3 3 2 effect of pile head height on transmission the effect of pile head height on the transmission is studied by fixing d hmax to 0 6 and varying y hmax from 0 5 to 1 0 for all the considered water depths as per fig 8 when the pile head height is varied from y hmax of 0 5 1 0 the transmission coefficient changes from 0 813 to 0 779 i e 4 04 reduction at lower wave steepness of 0 0021 and from 0 710 to 0 646 i e 8 92 reduction at higher wave steepness of 0 0052 for the water depth of 0 4 m refer fig 9 the percentage reduction of kt is 4 4 and 6 33 at lower and higher wave steepness respectively for 0 5 m water depth refer fig 10 percentage reduction of kt is 0 822 at lower wave steepness and 2 44 at higher wave steepness the above analysis indicates that for all the water depths considered the efficiency of the enlarged pile head breakwater increases with the increase in pile head height the least value of kt is obtained for the case when y hmax 1 0 the reason for the same is due to the increased projected area opposing the wave 3 3 3 effect of pile head diameter and height on wave reflection and dissipations fig 8 b fig 9 b and fig 10 b indicate that in general as the wave steepness increases reflection increases it is also envisaged from fig 8 b fig 9 b and fig 10 b that the reflection coefficient follows reverse order to that of transmission coefficient for d hmax 0 4 to 0 6 and y hmax 0 5 to 1 0 reflection decreases with increase in water depth the pile head configuration of d hmax 0 6 with y hmax 1 0 shows higher reflection than d hmax 0 4 with y hmax 0 5 and 1 0 from fig 8 c figure 9 c and figure 10 c it can be envisaged that with the increase in wave steepness wave energy dissipated by the structure increases higher dissipation is observed when d hmax 0 6 and y hmax 1 0 similarly lower dissipation is observed when d hmax 0 4 and y hmax 0 5 percentage increase in wave energy dissipation when d hmax increases from 0 4 to 0 6 and y hmax from 0 5 to 1 0 at 0 3 m water depth is 10 0 at lower wave steepness and 19 0 at higher wave steepness for 0 4 m water depth dissipation increases to 13 18 and 20 76 at lower and higher wave steepness respectively for water depth of 0 5 m dissipation increases to 26 15 at lower wave steepness and 16 10 higher wave steepness the above analysis indicates that the wave energy dissipated by the structure decreases with increasing water depth 3 4 effect of relative submergence of pile head and depth of water for 0 3 m water depth when the pile head submergence is increased by 100 i e 13 333 26 667 the percentage decrease in transmission coefficient is 4 04 at lower wave steepness and 9 57 at higher wave steepness as illustrated in fig 11 for the same case of pile head submergence when the water depth is 0 4 m kt decreases by 4 39 and 6 50 at lower and higher wave steepness respectively however when the water depth is 0 5 m a marginal decrease in kt 0 822 at lower wave steepness and 2 7 at higher wave steepness are observed in general with the decrease in water depth the transmission coefficient is also decreased hence enlarged pile head breakwater is more effective at lower water depths with relative submergence of 26 667 pile head as shown in fig 11 b and c reflection and wave energy dissipated by the pile head of size d hmax 0 6 and y hmax 1 0 at 0 3 m water depth is more than any other case or type analysed in the present study hence it can be said that if the enlarged pile breakwaters are installed near the shore approximate water depth of 9 0 m it is more effective in reducing the wave energy approaching the shore the reason for the increased efficiency of the structure with decreasing water depth is mainly due to the increase in the projected surface area of the pile head which may block the entire wave and thus increasing wave attenuation this behaviour can be explained by considering the case of d hmax 0 6 and y hmax 1 0 the calculated percentage overall blockage area for 0 5 m 0 4 m and 0 3 m water depths are 41 374 43 267 and 46 422 respectively hence with decreasing water depth the blockage for wave increases and the velocity of the wave approaching also decreases resulting in increased efficiency 3 5 comparison with other research works the hydraulic performance of the present concept model as obtained by the physical model test is compared with the available data wherever possible as provided by the authors huang 2007 rao and rao 2001 1999 mani and jayakumar 1995 and mani 1989 the transmission coefficient of enlarged pile head breakwater at gentle waves is higher than 3 68 mani 1989 8 36 mani and jayakumar 1995 4 21 rao and rao 2001 1999 and 4 95 huang 2007 for higher wave steepness the transmission coefficient is more than 12 5 rao and rao 2001 1999 and 15 13 huang 2007 and less than 0 74 mani 1989 0 44 mani and jayakumar 1995 fig 12 b indicates less reflection for the enlarged pile head breakwater than the compared breakwaters in terms of the dissipation coefficient the proposed breakwater is better than rao and rao 2001 1999 by 4 43 at lower wave steepness and 16 32 at higher wave steepness when compared with huang 2007 it is more than by 36 9 at lower wave steepness and 25 06 at higher wave steepness therefore by considering the above results it can be stated that the hydraulic performance of enlarged pile head breakwater with the ratios d hmax 0 6 and y hmax 1 0 is better than the other types of breakwaters 3 6 experimental phenomena an idea of introducing enlarged head over the regular pile breakwater is effective in increasing the hydraulic performance of the regular pile breakwater as described in section 4 5 the enhanced performance of the enlarged pile head breakwater is because of unique and increased wave structure interactions due to the hollow pile head causing increased turbulence and hence larger wave energy dissipation as visible in the photographs shown fig 13 3 7 comparison of experimental and theoretical studies the present experimental results are compared with the mei 1989 kriebel 1992 and suh et al 2011 theoretical equations as quoted by suh et al 2011 mei 1989 obtained the transmission and reflection equations by the equations of continuity and motion of small amplitude waves in shallow water mei 1989 derived equations as 32 k t u 0 g k h i 2 h 33 k r 1 ω u 0 g k h i 2 where u 0 h i 2 h g k 1 2 α 1 α α 4 3 π f h i 2 h f is given by eq 15 kriebel 1992 equation is similar to the mei 1989 solution and is as follows 34 k t 1 4 t t 1 2 t t 35 k r 1 1 4 t t 1 2 t t where t t f 6 h i 2 π k s i n h 2 k h 2 k h s i n h 2 k h is the transmission function suh et al 2011 hybrid solution is given in eqs 15 29 about 560 experimental test cases were compared to check the validity of the theoretical equations coefficients like kt kr and kd as obtained by the theoretical equations are compared with the experimental results in fig 14 the equations developed by mei 1989 and kriebel 1992 predict the transmission coefficient for pile head breakwater with a variation coefficient r2 of 0 5865 as shown in fig 14 a and b both the equations underpredict the transmission coefficient and dissipation coefficient but over predicted the reflection coefficient suh et al 2011 hybrid solution over predicts the transmission coefficient whereas reflections and dissipations are underpredicted as shown in fig 14 c the transmission coefficient obtained by using the hybrid solution developed by suh et al 2011 has given an r2 of 0 4804 fig 14 d shows the value of kt kr and kd predicted by the present modified hybrid equation the r2 value for the transmission coefficient for the present hybrid solution is 0 8953 hence it is evident from fig 14 a d that for the enlarged pile head breakwater the present hybrid equation predicts the better value of kt kr and kd than the other compared equations the present hybrid equation predicts better values of coefficient due to the empirically improved γ parameter 3 8 validation of present hybrid equation for conventional circular pile breakwater the present hybrid equation is validated for the regular circular pile breakwater using eq 31 for the present study rao 1999 experimental data on non perforated circular pile breakwater is used details of the experimental data are shown in table 3 transmission reflection and dissipation coefficient as obtained by rao et al 1999 are also compared with the equation proposed by mei 1989 kriebel 1992 and suh et al 2011 fig 15 shows the comparison of predicted values of kt kr and kd with the rao 1999 experimental data the variation coefficient obtained for the case kt kr and kd are shown in table 4 4 conclusions from the experimental studies conducted on the enlarged pile head breakwater the following conclusions are drawn in general with an increase in wave steepness the transmission coefficient decreases reflection increases and the energy dissipation coefficient increases the structural parameters relative spacing between the pile the diameter of pile head and the height of pile head wave parameters wave period and wavelength and depth of water are the important parameters influencing the wave transmission reflection and energy dissipations with the decrease in relative spacing between the piles from 0 9 to 0 2 a maximum of 19 75 reduction in kt is obtained for the case of d hmax 0 6 with y hmax 1 0 at 0 3 m water depth for the enlarged pile head breakwater existing theoretical equations have not performed better the present modified version of the hybrid equation in line with suh et al 2011 hybrid solution has given better results the validation of the present hybrid equation for the regular circular pile breakwater shows promisingly encouraging values of hydraulic coefficients as compared with the experimental results the proposed hybrid equation predicts more desirable values of coefficients of kt kr and kd for the case of regular circular and enlarged pile head breakwater than compared with the exiting equations hence the proposed hybrid solution can be used for predicting the hydraulic characteristics of pile breakwaters subjected to monochromatic waves an average increase in the dissipation coefficient of about 20 is obtained for the compared huang 2007 mani and jayakumar 1995 mani 1989 rao and rao 2001 1999 breakwater therefore enlarged pile breakwater structure with the structural configuration of b d 0 2 with a combination of d hmax 0 6 and y hmax 1 0 has least value of kt 0 62 may be considered as a solution for the protection of coast against erosion depending on the site conditions credit authorship
