4690,flocculation of suspended particles in tidal estuaries exhibits large spatiotemporal variability due to an interplay of various physical and biogeochemical drivers salinity s is known to promote flocculation of fine grained suspended particulate matter spm however the influence of salinity and salinity induced stratification on flocculation has not been sufficiently investigated yet this study aims to understand how these two factors interactively with turbulent shear g and spm concentration c control the vertical variation of floc size and flocculation process in different depth layers in a typical tide dominated estuarine environment analysis of field observation data shows that flocculi diameter 20 μm are mainly affected by c and originate primarily from local resuspension macroflocs 200 μm are mainly controlled by stratification that greatly improves aggregate collision efficiency microflocs 20 200 μm as a transition group between flocculi and macroflocs are affected by dynamics of both sides they are influenced jointly by c g and stratification besides the fresh water dominated surface layer is dominated by small particles flocculi and microflocs confined in a relatively narrow particle size range between ο 100 and ο 101 as a result of the low level of both c 13 20 mg l and s 2 practical salinity units below the surface layer floc size increases drastically along with an increased salinity induced density gradient and achieves maximum particle size ο 102 within the stratified layer because of its high efficiency in promoting flocculation and formation of macroflocs the stratified layer around the halocline can be regarded as an optimal flocculation zone the benthic layer is characterized by high c 30 mg l gentle g 5 s and periodic stratification which result in a wide size range between ο 101 and ο 102 with microflocs as the dominant group finally we found that the accuracy of flocculation modeling can be significantly improved by integrating a

fine grained suspended particulate matters spm often aggregate to form larger and porous flocs in estuaries resulting in a constant change of their properties such as size density and settling velocity during their transport droppo 2001 shen et al 2018 on the other hand estuaries are often characterized by highly variable hydrodynamic and biogeochemical environments that are modulated by tides and or waves the high sensitivity of spm dynamics flocculation deflocculation to change of hydrodynamic e g turbulent shear g and the stratification induced by salinity and or temperature gradient and biogeochemical e g organic inorganic content ionic strength and extracellular polymeric substances conditions impedes a comprehensive understanding of spm dynamics and floc size distribution at both temporal and spatial scales guo et al 2017 lai et al 2018 mietta et al 2009a once flocculated the size of flocs can vary over several orders of magnitude namely from 100 to 103 μm thomas et al 1999 and accordingly flocs can be classified into three size groups namely flocculi 20 μm microflocs 20 200 μm and macroflocs 200 μm fettweis et al 2012 fettweis and lee 2017 lee et al 2012 2014 compact flocculi are regarded as the basic building blocks of aggregates because they mainly consist of strongly bound clay minerals leussen 1994 flocculi flocculate rapidly to form microflocs with a regular shape and smooth surface when favorable conditions for flocculation are met he et al 2012 elongated and highly porous macroflocs are ultimately formed from flocculi and microflocs during low turbulence periods winterwerp and kesteren 2004 each particle group has unique physicochemical properties and a corresponding flocculation mechanism based on the fractal theory an inverse relationship exists between floc size and excess density of flocs ρf e with reference to water density ρw mikkelsen et al 2006 verney et al 2011 the ρf e of the three groups differs significantly it varies between 70 and 1000 kg m3 for flocculi between 20 and 200 kg m3 for microflocs and normally less than 20 kg m3 for macroflocs respectively maggi 2007 manning and dyer 1999 with low ρf e values macroflocs normally contribute the least amount of the total spm mass weight in coastal waters whilst the proportions of microflocs and flocculi are in ascending order lee et al 2016 the strength of flocs is also highly correlated to their size jarvis et al 2005 son 2009 regardless of biological factors macroflocs are most sensitive to change in turbulent shear g i e they are more likely to be destroyed by strong g e g 12 s and conversely promoted by gentle g lee et al 2011 2012 he et al 2012 mikkelsen et al 2006 the impact of spm concentration c on flocculation is not straightforward the classic aggregation theory assumes that an increase of c would enhance flocculation by increasing the collision frequency cross et al 2013 hill 1998 however other studies have revealed that this assumption can only be satisfied in quiescent water and or at low c and the enhancement would cease when c reaches above a certain level e g 280 mg l dyer 1989 leussen 2011 oles 1992 zhang et al 2020 as for the effect of vertical gradient of c it enhances settling velocity of flocs usually under low shear conditions e g g 0 72 s and is negligible in an estuarine environment cuthbertson et al 2010 the influence of salinity s and salinity induced stratification on flocculation are less understood compared to that of c and g the impact of s is twofold it affects flocculation in both chemical particles surface charge and physical stratification ways in a chemical way salinity can change electrokinetic properties and zeta potential of particles thereby affecting collision efficiency ka between particles three modes of flocculation response to salinity can be drawn from literature 1 mode 1 corresponds to a constantly positive correlation between ka and s 2 mode 2 refers to an initial positive correlation between ka and s until s reaches a critical salinity s and then ka remains steady along with a further increase of s and 3 mode 3 represents a range of optimum salinity within which ka reaches peak value and drops outside the range the proper mode in estuary however depends on clay mineral and seawater compositions mietta et al 2009b quezada et al 2018 2020 shen and maa 2016 the physical impact of s on flocculation through stratification is to hinder the exchange of spm across the halocline thereby trapping particles and resulting in increased frequency of aggregate collision and attachment lee et al 2016 ren and wu 2014 xia et al 2004 hence it can be concluded that the role of s lies in a change of ka between particles however a quantitative dependency of ka on s is missing in either way besides s has yet to be considered in the flocculation model although its importance has been well recognized lai et al 2018 liu et al 2018 winterwerp 1998 because the particle settling velocity is dependent on the floc size vertical distribution of floc size is crucial to evaluate the settling flux of particles however this issue is puzzled by the complexity of physical and biogeochemical environmental factors in situ sherwood et al 2018 strom and keyvani 2016 contradictory results have been derived concerning the change in floc size associated with water depth based on in situ observations eisma et al 1994 fugate and friedrichs 2003 papenmeier et al 2014 sahin 2014 because of hydrological factors that adjust with tidal flows in tide dominated estuaries vertical variability of particles has been classified based on tidal phases figueroa et al 2019 guo et al 2017 manning et al 2006 floc size has been reported to coarsen downward during the stratified ebb or slack waters and be homogenous during the well mixed flood or peak flows figueroa et al 2019 guo et al 2017 however opposite case i e larger particles in the upper river plume has also been observed lee et al 2016 li et al 2017 these results suggest that stratification plays an important role in controlling spm dispersal and floc size distribution on the vertical plane although a quantitative relationship between the floc size and stratification is missing further flocculation in and around the benthic layer show even higher complexity because of the unique hydrodynamic structure and active processes of settling and resuspension there eisma 2012 for instance nepheloid layers characterized by high turbidity and larger flocculated particles have been found in the benthic layer li et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 furthermore the importance of numerical models to predict the transport and fate of cohesive sediments has been widely recognized jeldres et al 2018 thomas et al 1999 in general there are three types of flocculation models including the extended lattice boltzmann model zhang et al 2013 population balance model lee et al 2011 maggi et al 2007 shen et al 2018 and winterwerp flocculation model winterwerp 1998 the winterwerp model is used to predict a single and dynamic characteristic floc size with a consideration of the impacts of g c and inherent floc properties winterwerp 1998 it has been widely used because of its high computational efficiency and easy integration into hydrodynamics models kuprenas et al 2018 winterwerp and kesteren 2004 based on in situ measurements in the pearl river estuary we aim to address the knowledge gap in understanding how s and s induced stratification interactively with turbulent shear g and spm concentration c control the vertical variation of floc size and flocculation process in different depth layers in a typical tide dominated estuarine environment based on the observations we propose a simple relationship between particle collision and s to improve existing flocculation models 2 materials and methods 2 1 regional setting and field measurements the pearl river delta is presented by a complicated river network that delivers 1 0 107 t a of sediment load into the south china sea through eight main outlets fig 1 a and 1b see also http www mwr gov cn sj tjgb hydrodynamics of this study area is characterized by irregular semidiurnal tides with apparent salinity current velocity and turbidity cycles two sites with contrasting salinity conditions namely h1 113 38 288 e 22 29 345 n and m1 113 28 016 e 22 04 529 n located in hengmen and modaomen outlets respectively were selected to investigate the flocculation process both sites are characterized by shallow water having a similar averaged depth of 6 5 m site h1 is mainly controlled by freshwater and affected by diluted water in a well mixed state during low tide periods tidal amplitude 1 38 m on the contrary site m1 is featured by stable halocline due to strong river discharge and weak tidal mixing tidal amplitude 0 8 m fig 2 fieldwork for recording particle size distributions psds current turbidity and salinity was conducted continuously covering four complete semi diurnal tides between august 18 20 2019 and august 21 23 2019 at the two sites respectively three instrument packages were employed including a shipboard downward looking 1 mhz nortek acoustic doppler profiler adp cell size 30 cm a on board steel frame fig 1c and a benthic quadrupod fig 1d specifically a sequoia laser in situ scattering and transmissiometry lisst 200x and an optical backscatterance sensor obs 3a were tied together in the steel frame they were lowered through the water column in a steady speed of 0 1 m s at an hourly interval sampling at 1 hz with the aim to record high resolution vertical data of psds turbidity and salinity meanwhile water samples were collected and filtered by pre weighed filters for calibration of turbidity and spm concentration the measuring instruments on the quadrupod included a lisst 200x sampling frequency 1 hz mounted at 1 35 m above the bed mab an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv for measuring turbulence 32 hz 0 5 mab an obs 3a 2 hz 0 55 mab for high temporal resolution observation and an upward looking adp cell size 30 cm mounted at 2 1 mab and a downward looking high resolution adp 5 cm 1 75 mab together with the shipboard adp were all configured to provide average values for every 10 min interval with the aim to provide a detailed vertical structure of currents the lisst 200x was able to record psds in 36 logarithmically spaced size groups over the range 1 500 μm agrawal and pottsmith 2000 however its performance is affected by high turbidity conditions guo et al 2017 to overcome this problem the path reduction module which reduces the optical path from 25 mm to 5 mm and thereby increasing the maximum concentration by a factor of 5 sequoiasci com was equipped with the lisst on quadrupod therefore high frequency and stable measurements of benthic flocculation can be satisfied 2 2 data processing 2 2 1 turbulent shear turbulent shear rate g is defined as 1 g v η 2 v s where v is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid η is the kolmogorov microscale and is the turbulent energy dissipation rate the values of can be obtained from the turbulence kinetic energy tke spectra guerra and thomson 2017 which is transformed from the fluctuated velocity recorded by adv 32 hz the tke spectra method is based on the kolmogorov hypothesis i e energy transfer is determined solely by in the inertial subrange kolmogorov 1941 pope 2000 however the quality of the adv data is affected by the occasional disturbance caused by doppler noise high spm concentration or weak doppler signal during slack waters goring and nikora 2002 wu et al 2011 which obscure the inertial subrange in tke spectra and impede the validity of g solving to derive continuous time series of g a three step procedure was applied in this study firstly tke spectra were estimated from the high frequency velocity 32 hz and then the inertial subrange was determined through an automated searching technique zhang et al 2020 secondly data quality was controlled by the slope of the spectra in the presence of inertial subrange according to the kolmogorov hypothesis the slope should be around 5 3 in this study a slope within a range of 5 3 20 was considered to indicate good quality data data beyond this range was regarded unusable the final step was to establish a relationship between g and the corresponding mean flow velocity u for every 10 min interval it is assumed that a proportional relationship exists between and cube of friction velocity u eq 2 nakagawa and nezu 1993 and between u and u eq 3 kuprenas et al 2018 combining the definition of g the relationship can be derived eq 4 2 u 3 3 u u 4 g k u 3 ν where k is a constant based on measured u and valid g from adv data the value of k 0 0502 0 0316 with correlation coefficient r 0 84 0 82 for site h1 m1 was obtained the value is of the same order of 0 075 proposed by kuprenas et al 2018 thereafter continuous values of g in the bottom layer could be estimated from u averaged from the adv 2 2 2 floc properties the lisst based raw data need to be pre processed before deriving psds for details see zhang et al 2020 to eliminate the influence caused by turbulence bursting in the benthic layer such as short term vertical sediment transport and variations of psds mikkelsen and pejrup 2001 a local outlier factor detection breunig et al 2000 was applied two methods were adopted to obtain the volumetric concentration vc of the three floc size groups i e flocculi microflocs and macroflocs the first method is to separate psds directly by the empirically critical diameter values dsp mikkelsen et al 2006 values of dsp between flocculi and microflocs and between microflocs and macroflocs were selected as 20 and 200 μm respectively lee et al 2012 winterwerp and kesteren 2004 the second method assumes that the psds in coastal waters can be decomposed into lognormal size classes it has the advantage of providing more detailed information e g the representative size and standard deviations σ about the unimodal psds of each group than the first method fettweis et al 2012 lee et al 2012 but this approach is much more expensive in terms of computational cost in our study the second method was performed only when analyzing detailed psds in the selected vertical profiles see section 3 4 and the first was applied in other cases it is worth to note that the vc of each group resolved from the two methods have similar trends despite the slight differences in the exact values e g r 0 89 and rmsd 14 for benthic macroflocs at site h1 therefore the choice of method does not affect the overall validity of the results the mean diameter of flocs can be expressed in various ways shen 2016 such as d 32 area weighted diameter d 43 volume weighted diameter d 60 hydrodynamic mean size and d 50 median size among these parameters d 32 is concerned with surface area and has been adopted by lisst 25 instrument agrawal and mikkelsen 2009 filippa et al 2012 considering the impact of salinity is associated with particle surface properties e g charge and cohesiveness d 32 was selected to be the representative diameter in this study 2 2 3 definition of three depth layers to help interpret the data the whole water column is divided into three vertical layers in our analysis based on observation the surface layer is defined as s 2 practical salinity units psu and water density gradient dρw dz 2 kg m4 here the suffix psu equivalent to units of parts per thousand is used to indicate salinity values of electrical conductivity measurements lewis and perkin 1978 the stratified layer is defined as dρw dz 2 kg m4 the benthic layer is defined as the water beneath the stratified layer note that the three defined layers were not always persistent at the two sites due to the change of mixing states by tides e g the benthic layer was taken over by the stratified layer during ebb tides at m1 while the water column was completely occupied by the surface layer during ebb tides at h1 2 3 numerical modelling of flocculation assuming nf 2 in this work which is commonly used in the literature maggi et al 2007 winterwerp 1998 in the modified winterwerp model proposed by kuprenas et al 2018 referred to k18 hereafter the rate equation for mean diameter of flocs d can be simply expressed as 5 dd d t 1 2 k a g c d 2 ρ p d p k b d g d d p μ g d 2 f y q d p where dp is the size of primary particles μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid fy is the floc yield strength and kb is breakup efficiency of flocs coefficients of ka and kb are related to the physicochemical properties of particles and water leussen 1994 winterwerp 1998 since quantitative information about the two coefficients is unavailable they are normally treated as fitting parameters in the model leussen 1994 2011 shen et al 2018 the coefficient q is given by 6 q c 1 c 2 d η where c 1 and c 2 are constant coefficients defined as 0 5 and 1 5 respectively the setting of c 1 and c 2 is to limit the size of the floc to kolmogorov microscale thereby improving the modelling performance across a wide range of concentrations kuprenas et al 2018 the key state variables in the k18 model include the particle size the mass spm concentration and the turbulent shear the impact of salinity and stratification is implicitly incorporated into the value of ka in this study we propose a simple parameterization of ka by including its explicit dependence on s and stratification time series of the state variables including s derived from the field measurements were fed into the model to evaluate the flocculation process 3 results 3 1 hydrodynamic conditions the mean spm concentrations measured from the survey were 31 and 22 5 mg l at site h1 and m1 respectively fig 2c and 2g these two sites were also similar in current strength such as fluctuation range between 1 12 and 0 8 m s at h1 and between 1 14 and 0 64 m s at m1 and maximum vertical averaged velocity 0 83 and 0 89 m s at h1 and m1 respectively fig 2d and 2h however the salinity condition differed significantly between the two sites site h1 was characterized by a weak halocline 0 34 psu m on bulk average that was periodically disturbed by tides fig 2b freshwater dominated during low tide periods and brackish water intruded this site in a partly mixed state following flood tides with maximum s 9 psu at high water level fig 2a in contrast to the weak and unstable stratification at h1 site m1 showed a persistent highly stratified state with a distinct band shaped halocline throughout the observation periods fig 2f the surface and benthic layers were occupied by freshwater 2 psu and saline water 13 psu respectively fig 2e in between was the stratified layer distributed within the range of s 2 13 psu fig 2e and 2f in this stratified layer ds dz 4 1 psu m and dρw dz 3 kg m4 and in other parts of the water column ds dz 1 4 psu m and dρw dz 1 kg m4 the stratified layer fluctuated vertically with the water level r 0 87 with an average depth of 3 2 m at its center and occupied 35 of the whole water column with an average thickness of 2 27 m resuspension of seafloor sediment occurred at both sites but in different forms fig 2c and 2g the vertical diffusion of resuspended sediment at site h1 was featured by a uniform c in the vertical plane fig 2c but at m1 it was confined below the stratified layer e g c is reduced to less than 30 mg l above 3 mab fig 2g regarding the vertical velocity structure fig 2d and 2h current strength was more uniform at site h1 σ 0 1 m s than that at m1 σ 0 17 m s in contrast to a vertically uniform flow structure at h1 site m1 was featured by baroclinic flows with the highest flow velocity appearing in the mid water depth the duration of ebb and flood in the benthic layer was approximately the same at both sites whereas ebb flows dominated in the surface layer accounting for 78 length of time at m1 meteorological forcing winds and waves for the monitoring period was monitored but proved to be negligible for our analysis because they are too weak to influence hydrodynamics and flocculation significant wave heights measured at 1 7 mab were persistently smaller than 0 12 m at both two sites the winds were also weak with averaged speed of 1 5 and 2 2 m s at site h1 and m1 respectively 3 2 flocculation zone at site h1 intensified flocculation with large particle size and vc occurred at the interface between freshwater and brackish water at high water slacks where s 2 psu fig 3 a and 3b particle vc in the region of s 2 psu accounted for 70 of the total particle vc and was characterized by a larger average diameter d 38 μm than that in freshwater d 28 μm when freshwater occupied the water column at low water levels flocs were almost smaller than 40 μm and a mild downward coarsening trend was seen in the particle size distribution particles in the low water level periods were more homogeneously distributed d 27 11 μm in the vertical plane than that during the high water d 37 32 μm fig 3a and 3b at site m1 intensive flocculation appeared in the stratified layer particles in this layer also accounted for 70 of the total vc on the other hand they were more than twice larger d 90 μm but much lighter ρf e 93 2 kg m3 than those in the surface and benthic layers d 41 μm and ρf e 196 7 kg m3 fig 3c and 3d in contrast to the periodic formation and destruction at h1 large flocs at m1 were persistently observed throughout the tidal cycles the region of s 2 psu and the stratified layer at the two sites appeared to provide the optimal condition for flocculation large flocs are scattered in these flocculation zones a critical value of s 2 psu referring to mode 2 for flocculation can also be concluded which was in agreement with experiment results e g s 5 psu zhang et al 2019 on the other hand the size of flocs d 90 μm and their vc 357 μl l in the stratified layer at site m1 were much larger than those in the region of s 2 psu at h1 d 38 μm and vc 205 μl l which indicates the importance of stratification on flocculation 3 3 distribution of floc size to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of floc size vc of the three size groups namely flocculi 20 μm microflocs 20 200 μm and macroflocs 200 μm was calculated respectively fig 4 results indicate that the vc of flocculi was closely correlated with c r 0 74 at both sites fig 4a and 4d compared to a more vertically uniform distribution at site h1 flocculi at m1 were mostly confined below the stratified layer the average vc of flocculi at m1 above 3 mab was 13 μl l which is merely 28 of that in the benthic layer microflocs at site h1 also showed a strong correlation with c r 0 71 with higher values of vc appearing near the benthic fig 4b however at site m1 42 of microflocs were scattered within the flocculation zone i e the stratified layer whereas 47 were confined in the benthic layer and correlated with c fig 4e large portions of macroflocs were concentrated in the flocculation zone at both sites accounting for 30 h1 and 64 m1 of total vc in the water column respectively fig 4c and 4f the relationships between each size group and environmental factors suggest that flocculi are mainly determined by c that primarily originates from local resuspension whereas macroflocs are largely controlled by stratification and promoted by salinity microflocs as a transition group between flocculi and macroflocs are affected by both sides they are influenced by not only c but also strong stratification 3 4 impact of stratification on flocculation with a favorable condition for flocculation see section 3 2 vertical profiles at site m1 around high slack tides t 15 h were analyzed in further detail results show that the stratified layer was featured by large particles with a wide size range fig 5 a the mean and standard deviation values of particle size in the stratified layer were 150 and 102 μm respectively notably larger than those d 22 μm and σ 8 μm in other parts i e the surface and benthic layers of the water column vc of particles in the stratified layer was 1077 μl l being more than 10 times of the value in the benthic layer 103 μl l and 80 times of that in the surface layer 13 μl l on the other hand ρf e in the stratified layer 73 8 kg m3 was less than a quarter of that outside the stratified layer 308 kg m3 psds at three heights h 1 8 5 and 6 5 mab respectively representing each depth layer were calculated to investigate the general patterns in the three layers results showed that both the surface and benthic layers exhibited a bimodal structure while the stratified layer presented a unimodal distribution fig 5b the bimodal structure in the psd of the surface layer was characterized by a similar distribution of flocculi and microflocs with diameters of 6 7 and 28 μm respectively whereas macroflocs were absent the stratified layer was occupied by macroflocs with a diameter of 334 μm accounting for as high as 90 of the total vc of particles particles were dominated by flocculi and microflocs again in the benthic layer accounting for 36 and 64 of the total vc of particles with diameters of 18 7 and 130 μm respectively compared to the wide range of psd of each size group σ 1 93 in the surface and benthic layers psd was confined within a narrow range in the stratified layer with σ 1 13 these significant differences between the stratified layer and its outside reveal that stratification greatly promotes flocculation resulting in concentrated psd dominated by larger particles with higher vc and lower ρf e than that in the unstratified water column 3 5 flocculation modelling based on our analysis of field data a simple parameterization scheme of collision efficiency of particles ka by including its explicit dependence on s referring to mode 2 and stratification dρw dz was applied in the k18 model which is expressed as 7 k a min k 1 f s f d ρ w dz 1 8 f s k 2 s i f s s k 2 s i f s s 9 f d ρ w dz k 3 d ρ w dz where maximum of ka 1 is adopted to meet its physical definition kuprenas et al 2018 winterwerp 1998 zhang et al 2020 parameters of k 1 k 2 and k 3 are positive constants which are derived from the minimum error between the simulated and measured diameter here s 2 psu in both two sites based on observation see section 3 2 and the data collected on the quadrupod with high stability and time resolution were tested for site h1 values of k 1 0 1 k 2 0 k 3 0 15 and kb 1e 6 were obtained with r 0 55 and rmsd 54 44 μm before 37 h fig 6 a and 7a and for site m1 values of k 1 0 k 2 0 k 3 0 65 and kb 7e 6 were derived with r 0 67 and rmsd 37 5 μm before 44 h fig 6g and 7b besides the measured particle size lagged simulated value by 0 6 h at site h1 which is partly attributed to inconsistent locations of instruments i e lisst 200x h 1 35 mab was above obs 3a and adv h 0 5 mab as it takes a certain time for resuspended sediment to transport to upper layer fettweis et al 2006 regarding to the original parameterization scheme i e without dependence of ka on s and stratification during same period for site h1 values of ka 0 15 and kb 1e 6 were obtained with r 0 42 and rmsd 56 14 μm fig 6a and 7a and for site m1 values of ka 0 05 and kb 1e 6 were derived with r 0 08 and rmsd 58 7 μm fig 6g and 7b compared to the original parameterization scheme our new parameterization of collision efficiency ka proves to be significant and robust fig 7 values of the coefficients ka and kb fall within the range derived in previous research i e ka 0 1 1 and kb ο 10 6 ο 10 5 kuprenas et al 2018 winterwerp 1998 zhang et al 2020 the advantage of our parameterization compared to empirical values derived from fitting is the introduction of a physically based prediction scheme of ka through an explicit dependency of particle collision on s and stratification so that the formula eq 7 9 can be applied broadly to estuarine environments 4 discussion 4 1 importance of salinity on flocculation in an earlier study zhang et al 2020 we have investigated the impact of c and g on flocculation at another two monitoring sites in the pearl river estuary results from the current study further prove the findings from the previous study that evolutions of flocs with different initial sizes synchronize gradually to adapt to the local hydrological environment in each depth layer and the trends of floc size evolution and absolute net flocculation rates are similar among diverse tidal shear cycles the impact of stratification was also explored in the previous study but to a less extent than the current study in the previous study we found that the halocline increases vertical variation of flocs size and divides the water column into two vertical zones with distinct flocculation dynamics flocculation within the stratified layer across the halocline was not investigated due to insufficient data one site was completely dominated by freshwater whilst the other was dominated by saline water with only a thin and unstable stratified layer near the surface in this study the newly derived observation data from site m1 which was featured by a persistent stratified layer allow a further investigation of flocculation dynamics in this layer our new observation suggests that the chemical impact of salinity in the form of surface charge is much smaller than that of stratification in stratified states site m1 the poor performance of modelling without considering stratification e g r 0 08 and 0 67 for the original and new scheme respectively fig 7b confirms that salinity induced stratification is an essential driver for flocculation especially for the formation of macroflocs see also section 3 3 it is worth noting that salinity is also highly correlated to the mixing degree of the river and sea born materials that is it can be treated as an indicator of physico chemical proporties of sediment e g mineralogy electrophoretic mobility cation exchange capacity and specific surface area leussen 1994 that suggests the necessity of continuous sampling and component analysis of suspended sediment in future studies 4 2 interplay of major influencing factors to illustrate flocculation pattern in surface layer data collected at site m1 was analyzed flocs size on the surface was quite small in general d 50 16 5 μm macroflocs from flocculation zone were dispersed into surface layer which coincided with high water level i e t 13 25 and 39 h in weak current environments e g u 0 2 m s fig 8 the brief peaks of floc were soon be deflocculated into flocculi and microflocs by subsequent ebb peak flows e g u 0 5 m s afterward the portion of microflocs increased slowly by the transformation of flocculi fig 8b the maximum values of spm concentration were in correspondence to the ebb peak flows r 0 71 fig 8c indicating that the surface layer was controlled by upstream freshwater the weak flocculation in the surface can be attributed to several aspects quite small values and fluctuation range of spm concentration 13 20 mg l resulting in insufficient particles limit flocculation in surface hill 1998 besides the negative charges on flocs surface as a result of low salinity can lead to electrostatic repulsion between particles which impedes their interaction and bonding parsons et al 2016 quezada et al 2018 in the stratified layer c was higher than that in the surface layer because of input from the benthic layer however its time series does not exhibit a significant correlation with floc size r 0 45 suggesting that c is not a main controlling factor for flocculation in this layer figs 2 and 3 c in the benthic layer was persistently larger than that in the upper layers due to resuspension during peak tidal flows with average values of 40 7 and 33 7 mg l at h1 and m1 respectively fig 6d and 6j the elevated c together with mild shear g 5 s fig 6c and 6i promoted flocculation in the benthic layer fig 6b and 6h although being less intensive compared to that in the stratified layer note that the benthic layer was taken over by the stratified layer during ebb tides at m1 it is also worth noting that volumetric concentration vc is not the same as mass concentration c vc reflects the flocculation status in terms of floc diameter d the relationship between vc and d is 10 vc n π 6 d 3 where n represents the number of particles the cube root of vc was positively correlated to d at site m1 r 0 78 fig 9 it is quite interesting and worth to note that n differs slightly between the surface and stratified layers while is significantly larger in the bottom layer where mass concentration c is much higher besides tidal cycle of hydrodynamic conditions can lead to both highly variability and periodicity of flocculation as for site h1 in a partly mixed state flocs size in the bottom layer was symmetrical around the moment of the strongest stratification at t 23 h fig 6a and 6f with skewness coefficient as low as 0 1 in detrending conditions the diameters of flocs showed quarter diurnal periodicity and a negative correlation with g r 0 65 fig 6a and 6c for site m1 controlled by stratification flocs decreased increased during flood ebb periods and exhibited semidiurnal periodicity of flocculation fig 6g and 6i 5 conclusions based on in situ observations and modelling this study investigated how salinity and salinity induced stratification interactively with turbulent shear g and spm concentration c control the vertical variation of floc size and the flocculation process in different depth layers in a typical tide dominated estuarine environment according to the results the following conclusions are drawn 1 flocculi are mainly affected by spm concentration and originate primarily from local resuspension whereas macroflocs are largely controlled by stratification microflocs as a transition group between flocculi and macroflocs are affected by dynamics of both sides they are controlled jointly by spm concentration shear rate and stratification 2 compared to bimodal psds in the surface and benthic layers dominated by small particles i e flocculi and microflocs the unimodal psd in the stratified layer is narrow and dominated by macroflocs with high vc and low ρf e 3 because of a high efficiency in promoting flocculation and formation of macroflocs the stratified layer around the halocline can be regarded as an optimal flocculation zone 4 flocculation modelling should consider an explicit dependency of particle collision on stratification credit authorship contribution statement ying zhang

4690,flocculation of suspended particles in tidal estuaries exhibits large spatiotemporal variability due to an interplay of various physical and biogeochemical drivers salinity s is known to promote flocculation of fine grained suspended particulate matter spm however the influence of salinity and salinity induced stratification on flocculation has not been sufficiently investigated yet this study aims to understand how these two factors interactively with turbulent shear g and spm concentration c control the vertical variation of floc size and flocculation process in different depth layers in a typical tide dominated estuarine environment analysis of field observation data shows that flocculi diameter 20 μm are mainly affected by c and originate primarily from local resuspension macroflocs 200 μm are mainly controlled by stratification that greatly improves aggregate collision efficiency microflocs 20 200 μm as a transition group between flocculi and macroflocs are affected by dynamics of both sides they are influenced jointly by c g and stratification besides the fresh water dominated surface layer is dominated by small particles flocculi and microflocs confined in a relatively narrow particle size range between ο 100 and ο 101 as a result of the low level of both c 13 20 mg l and s 2 practical salinity units below the surface layer floc size increases drastically along with an increased salinity induced density gradient and achieves maximum particle size ο 102 within the stratified layer because of its high efficiency in promoting flocculation and formation of macroflocs the stratified layer around the halocline can be regarded as an optimal flocculation zone the benthic layer is characterized by high c 30 mg l gentle g 5 s and periodic stratification which result in a wide size range between ο 101 and ο 102 with microflocs as the dominant group finally we found that the accuracy of flocculation modeling can be significantly improved by integrating a

fine grained suspended particulate matters spm often aggregate to form larger and porous flocs in estuaries resulting in a constant change of their properties such as size density and settling velocity during their transport droppo 2001 shen et al 2018 on the other hand estuaries are often characterized by highly variable hydrodynamic and biogeochemical environments that are modulated by tides and or waves the high sensitivity of spm dynamics flocculation deflocculation to change of hydrodynamic e g turbulent shear g and the stratification induced by salinity and or temperature gradient and biogeochemical e g organic inorganic content ionic strength and extracellular polymeric substances conditions impedes a comprehensive understanding of spm dynamics and floc size distribution at both temporal and spatial scales guo et al 2017 lai et al 2018 mietta et al 2009a once flocculated the size of flocs can vary over several orders of magnitude namely from 100 to 103 μm thomas et al 1999 and accordingly flocs can be classified into three size groups namely flocculi 20 μm microflocs 20 200 μm and macroflocs 200 μm fettweis et al 2012 fettweis and lee 2017 lee et al 2012 2014 compact flocculi are regarded as the basic building blocks of aggregates because they mainly consist of strongly bound clay minerals leussen 1994 flocculi flocculate rapidly to form microflocs with a regular shape and smooth surface when favorable conditions for flocculation are met he et al 2012 elongated and highly porous macroflocs are ultimately formed from flocculi and microflocs during low turbulence periods winterwerp and kesteren 2004 each particle group has unique physicochemical properties and a corresponding flocculation mechanism based on the fractal theory an inverse relationship exists between floc size and excess density of flocs ρf e with reference to water density ρw mikkelsen et al 2006 verney et al 2011 the ρf e of the three groups differs significantly it varies between 70 and 1000 kg m3 for flocculi between 20 and 200 kg m3 for microflocs and normally less than 20 kg m3 for macroflocs respectively maggi 2007 manning and dyer 1999 with low ρf e values macroflocs normally contribute the least amount of the total spm mass weight in coastal waters whilst the proportions of microflocs and flocculi are in ascending order lee et al 2016 the strength of flocs is also highly correlated to their size jarvis et al 2005 son 2009 regardless of biological factors macroflocs are most sensitive to change in turbulent shear g i e they are more likely to be destroyed by strong g e g 12 s and conversely promoted by gentle g lee et al 2011 2012 he et al 2012 mikkelsen et al 2006 the impact of spm concentration c on flocculation is not straightforward the classic aggregation theory assumes that an increase of c would enhance flocculation by increasing the collision frequency cross et al 2013 hill 1998 however other studies have revealed that this assumption can only be satisfied in quiescent water and or at low c and the enhancement would cease when c reaches above a certain level e g 280 mg l dyer 1989 leussen 2011 oles 1992 zhang et al 2020 as for the effect of vertical gradient of c it enhances settling velocity of flocs usually under low shear conditions e g g 0 72 s and is negligible in an estuarine environment cuthbertson et al 2010 the influence of salinity s and salinity induced stratification on flocculation are less understood compared to that of c and g the impact of s is twofold it affects flocculation in both chemical particles surface charge and physical stratification ways in a chemical way salinity can change electrokinetic properties and zeta potential of particles thereby affecting collision efficiency ka between particles three modes of flocculation response to salinity can be drawn from literature 1 mode 1 corresponds to a constantly positive correlation between ka and s 2 mode 2 refers to an initial positive correlation between ka and s until s reaches a critical salinity s and then ka remains steady along with a further increase of s and 3 mode 3 represents a range of optimum salinity within which ka reaches peak value and drops outside the range the proper mode in estuary however depends on clay mineral and seawater compositions mietta et al 2009b quezada et al 2018 2020 shen and maa 2016 the physical impact of s on flocculation through stratification is to hinder the exchange of spm across the halocline thereby trapping particles and resulting in increased frequency of aggregate collision and attachment lee et al 2016 ren and wu 2014 xia et al 2004 hence it can be concluded that the role of s lies in a change of ka between particles however a quantitative dependency of ka on s is missing in either way besides s has yet to be considered in the flocculation model although its importance has been well recognized lai et al 2018 liu et al 2018 winterwerp 1998 because the particle settling velocity is dependent on the floc size vertical distribution of floc size is crucial to evaluate the settling flux of particles however this issue is puzzled by the complexity of physical and biogeochemical environmental factors in situ sherwood et al 2018 strom and keyvani 2016 contradictory results have been derived concerning the change in floc size associated with water depth based on in situ observations eisma et al 1994 fugate and friedrichs 2003 papenmeier et al 2014 sahin 2014 because of hydrological factors that adjust with tidal flows in tide dominated estuaries vertical variability of particles has been classified based on tidal phases figueroa et al 2019 guo et al 2017 manning et al 2006 floc size has been reported to coarsen downward during the stratified ebb or slack waters and be homogenous during the well mixed flood or peak flows figueroa et al 2019 guo et al 2017 however opposite case i e larger particles in the upper river plume has also been observed lee et al 2016 li et al 2017 these results suggest that stratification plays an important role in controlling spm dispersal and floc size distribution on the vertical plane although a quantitative relationship between the floc size and stratification is missing further flocculation in and around the benthic layer show even higher complexity because of the unique hydrodynamic structure and active processes of settling and resuspension there eisma 2012 for instance nepheloid layers characterized by high turbidity and larger flocculated particles have been found in the benthic layer li et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 furthermore the importance of numerical models to predict the transport and fate of cohesive sediments has been widely recognized jeldres et al 2018 thomas et al 1999 in general there are three types of flocculation models including the extended lattice boltzmann model zhang et al 2013 population balance model lee et al 2011 maggi et al 2007 shen et al 2018 and winterwerp flocculation model winterwerp 1998 the winterwerp model is used to predict a single and dynamic characteristic floc size with a consideration of the impacts of g c and inherent floc properties winterwerp 1998 it has been widely used because of its high computational efficiency and easy integration into hydrodynamics models kuprenas et al 2018 winterwerp and kesteren 2004 based on in situ measurements in the pearl river estuary we aim to address the knowledge gap in understanding how s and s induced stratification interactively with turbulent shear g and spm concentration c control the vertical variation of floc size and flocculation process in different depth layers in a typical tide dominated estuarine environment based on the observations we propose a simple relationship between particle collision and s to improve existing flocculation models 2 materials and methods 2 1 regional setting and field measurements the pearl river delta is presented by a complicated river network that delivers 1 0 107 t a of sediment load into the south china sea through eight main outlets fig 1 a and 1b see also http www mwr gov cn sj tjgb hydrodynamics of this study area is characterized by irregular semidiurnal tides with apparent salinity current velocity and turbidity cycles two sites with contrasting salinity conditions namely h1 113 38 288 e 22 29 345 n and m1 113 28 016 e 22 04 529 n located in hengmen and modaomen outlets respectively were selected to investigate the flocculation process both sites are characterized by shallow water having a similar averaged depth of 6 5 m site h1 is mainly controlled by freshwater and affected by diluted water in a well mixed state during low tide periods tidal amplitude 1 38 m on the contrary site m1 is featured by stable halocline due to strong river discharge and weak tidal mixing tidal amplitude 0 8 m fig 2 fieldwork for recording particle size distributions psds current turbidity and salinity was conducted continuously covering four complete semi diurnal tides between august 18 20 2019 and august 21 23 2019 at the two sites respectively three instrument packages were employed including a shipboard downward looking 1 mhz nortek acoustic doppler profiler adp cell size 30 cm a on board steel frame fig 1c and a benthic quadrupod fig 1d specifically a sequoia laser in situ scattering and transmissiometry lisst 200x and an optical backscatterance sensor obs 3a were tied together in the steel frame they were lowered through the water column in a steady speed of 0 1 m s at an hourly interval sampling at 1 hz with the aim to record high resolution vertical data of psds turbidity and salinity meanwhile water samples were collected and filtered by pre weighed filters for calibration of turbidity and spm concentration the measuring instruments on the quadrupod included a lisst 200x sampling frequency 1 hz mounted at 1 35 m above the bed mab an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv for measuring turbulence 32 hz 0 5 mab an obs 3a 2 hz 0 55 mab for high temporal resolution observation and an upward looking adp cell size 30 cm mounted at 2 1 mab and a downward looking high resolution adp 5 cm 1 75 mab together with the shipboard adp were all configured to provide average values for every 10 min interval with the aim to provide a detailed vertical structure of currents the lisst 200x was able to record psds in 36 logarithmically spaced size groups over the range 1 500 μm agrawal and pottsmith 2000 however its performance is affected by high turbidity conditions guo et al 2017 to overcome this problem the path reduction module which reduces the optical path from 25 mm to 5 mm and thereby increasing the maximum concentration by a factor of 5 sequoiasci com was equipped with the lisst on quadrupod therefore high frequency and stable measurements of benthic flocculation can be satisfied 2 2 data processing 2 2 1 turbulent shear turbulent shear rate g is defined as 1 g v η 2 v s where v is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid η is the kolmogorov microscale and is the turbulent energy dissipation rate the values of can be obtained from the turbulence kinetic energy tke spectra guerra and thomson 2017 which is transformed from the fluctuated velocity recorded by adv 32 hz the tke spectra method is based on the kolmogorov hypothesis i e energy transfer is determined solely by in the inertial subrange kolmogorov 1941 pope 2000 however the quality of the adv data is affected by the occasional disturbance caused by doppler noise high spm concentration or weak doppler signal during slack waters goring and nikora 2002 wu et al 2011 which obscure the inertial subrange in tke spectra and impede the validity of g solving to derive continuous time series of g a three step procedure was applied in this study firstly tke spectra were estimated from the high frequency velocity 32 hz and then the inertial subrange was determined through an automated searching technique zhang et al 2020 secondly data quality was controlled by the slope of the spectra in the presence of inertial subrange according to the kolmogorov hypothesis the slope should be around 5 3 in this study a slope within a range of 5 3 20 was considered to indicate good quality data data beyond this range was regarded unusable the final step was to establish a relationship between g and the corresponding mean flow velocity u for every 10 min interval it is assumed that a proportional relationship exists between and cube of friction velocity u eq 2 nakagawa and nezu 1993 and between u and u eq 3 kuprenas et al 2018 combining the definition of g the relationship can be derived eq 4 2 u 3 3 u u 4 g k u 3 ν where k is a constant based on measured u and valid g from adv data the value of k 0 0502 0 0316 with correlation coefficient r 0 84 0 82 for site h1 m1 was obtained the value is of the same order of 0 075 proposed by kuprenas et al 2018 thereafter continuous values of g in the bottom layer could be estimated from u averaged from the adv 2 2 2 floc properties the lisst based raw data need to be pre processed before deriving psds for details see zhang et al 2020 to eliminate the influence caused by turbulence bursting in the benthic layer such as short term vertical sediment transport and variations of psds mikkelsen and pejrup 2001 a local outlier factor detection breunig et al 2000 was applied two methods were adopted to obtain the volumetric concentration vc of the three floc size groups i e flocculi microflocs and macroflocs the first method is to separate psds directly by the empirically critical diameter values dsp mikkelsen et al 2006 values of dsp between flocculi and microflocs and between microflocs and macroflocs were selected as 20 and 200 μm respectively lee et al 2012 winterwerp and kesteren 2004 the second method assumes that the psds in coastal waters can be decomposed into lognormal size classes it has the advantage of providing more detailed information e g the representative size and standard deviations σ about the unimodal psds of each group than the first method fettweis et al 2012 lee et al 2012 but this approach is much more expensive in terms of computational cost in our study the second method was performed only when analyzing detailed psds in the selected vertical profiles see section 3 4 and the first was applied in other cases it is worth to note that the vc of each group resolved from the two methods have similar trends despite the slight differences in the exact values e g r 0 89 and rmsd 14 for benthic macroflocs at site h1 therefore the choice of method does not affect the overall validity of the results the mean diameter of flocs can be expressed in various ways shen 2016 such as d 32 area weighted diameter d 43 volume weighted diameter d 60 hydrodynamic mean size and d 50 median size among these parameters d 32 is concerned with surface area and has been adopted by lisst 25 instrument agrawal and mikkelsen 2009 filippa et al 2012 considering the impact of salinity is associated with particle surface properties e g charge and cohesiveness d 32 was selected to be the representative diameter in this study 2 2 3 definition of three depth layers to help interpret the data the whole water column is divided into three vertical layers in our analysis based on observation the surface layer is defined as s 2 practical salinity units psu and water density gradient dρw dz 2 kg m4 here the suffix psu equivalent to units of parts per thousand is used to indicate salinity values of electrical conductivity measurements lewis and perkin 1978 the stratified layer is defined as dρw dz 2 kg m4 the benthic layer is defined as the water beneath the stratified layer note that the three defined layers were not always persistent at the two sites due to the change of mixing states by tides e g the benthic layer was taken over by the stratified layer during ebb tides at m1 while the water column was completely occupied by the surface layer during ebb tides at h1 2 3 numerical modelling of flocculation assuming nf 2 in this work which is commonly used in the literature maggi et al 2007 winterwerp 1998 in the modified winterwerp model proposed by kuprenas et al 2018 referred to k18 hereafter the rate equation for mean diameter of flocs d can be simply expressed as 5 dd d t 1 2 k a g c d 2 ρ p d p k b d g d d p μ g d 2 f y q d p where dp is the size of primary particles μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid fy is the floc yield strength and kb is breakup efficiency of flocs coefficients of ka and kb are related to the physicochemical properties of particles and water leussen 1994 winterwerp 1998 since quantitative information about the two coefficients is unavailable they are normally treated as fitting parameters in the model leussen 1994 2011 shen et al 2018 the coefficient q is given by 6 q c 1 c 2 d η where c 1 and c 2 are constant coefficients defined as 0 5 and 1 5 respectively the setting of c 1 and c 2 is to limit the size of the floc to kolmogorov microscale thereby improving the modelling performance across a wide range of concentrations kuprenas et al 2018 the key state variables in the k18 model include the particle size the mass spm concentration and the turbulent shear the impact of salinity and stratification is implicitly incorporated into the value of ka in this study we propose a simple parameterization of ka by including its explicit dependence on s and stratification time series of the state variables including s derived from the field measurements were fed into the model to evaluate the flocculation process 3 results 3 1 hydrodynamic conditions the mean spm concentrations measured from the survey were 31 and 22 5 mg l at site h1 and m1 respectively fig 2c and 2g these two sites were also similar in current strength such as fluctuation range between 1 12 and 0 8 m s at h1 and between 1 14 and 0 64 m s at m1 and maximum vertical averaged velocity 0 83 and 0 89 m s at h1 and m1 respectively fig 2d and 2h however the salinity condition differed significantly between the two sites site h1 was characterized by a weak halocline 0 34 psu m on bulk average that was periodically disturbed by tides fig 2b freshwater dominated during low tide periods and brackish water intruded this site in a partly mixed state following flood tides with maximum s 9 psu at high water level fig 2a in contrast to the weak and unstable stratification at h1 site m1 showed a persistent highly stratified state with a distinct band shaped halocline throughout the observation periods fig 2f the surface and benthic layers were occupied by freshwater 2 psu and saline water 13 psu respectively fig 2e in between was the stratified layer distributed within the range of s 2 13 psu fig 2e and 2f in this stratified layer ds dz 4 1 psu m and dρw dz 3 kg m4 and in other parts of the water column ds dz 1 4 psu m and dρw dz 1 kg m4 the stratified layer fluctuated vertically with the water level r 0 87 with an average depth of 3 2 m at its center and occupied 35 of the whole water column with an average thickness of 2 27 m resuspension of seafloor sediment occurred at both sites but in different forms fig 2c and 2g the vertical diffusion of resuspended sediment at site h1 was featured by a uniform c in the vertical plane fig 2c but at m1 it was confined below the stratified layer e g c is reduced to less than 30 mg l above 3 mab fig 2g regarding the vertical velocity structure fig 2d and 2h current strength was more uniform at site h1 σ 0 1 m s than that at m1 σ 0 17 m s in contrast to a vertically uniform flow structure at h1 site m1 was featured by baroclinic flows with the highest flow velocity appearing in the mid water depth the duration of ebb and flood in the benthic layer was approximately the same at both sites whereas ebb flows dominated in the surface layer accounting for 78 length of time at m1 meteorological forcing winds and waves for the monitoring period was monitored but proved to be negligible for our analysis because they are too weak to influence hydrodynamics and flocculation significant wave heights measured at 1 7 mab were persistently smaller than 0 12 m at both two sites the winds were also weak with averaged speed of 1 5 and 2 2 m s at site h1 and m1 respectively 3 2 flocculation zone at site h1 intensified flocculation with large particle size and vc occurred at the interface between freshwater and brackish water at high water slacks where s 2 psu fig 3 a and 3b particle vc in the region of s 2 psu accounted for 70 of the total particle vc and was characterized by a larger average diameter d 38 μm than that in freshwater d 28 μm when freshwater occupied the water column at low water levels flocs were almost smaller than 40 μm and a mild downward coarsening trend was seen in the particle size distribution particles in the low water level periods were more homogeneously distributed d 27 11 μm in the vertical plane than that during the high water d 37 32 μm fig 3a and 3b at site m1 intensive flocculation appeared in the stratified layer particles in this layer also accounted for 70 of the total vc on the other hand they were more than twice larger d 90 μm but much lighter ρf e 93 2 kg m3 than those in the surface and benthic layers d 41 μm and ρf e 196 7 kg m3 fig 3c and 3d in contrast to the periodic formation and destruction at h1 large flocs at m1 were persistently observed throughout the tidal cycles the region of s 2 psu and the stratified layer at the two sites appeared to provide the optimal condition for flocculation large flocs are scattered in these flocculation zones a critical value of s 2 psu referring to mode 2 for flocculation can also be concluded which was in agreement with experiment results e g s 5 psu zhang et al 2019 on the other hand the size of flocs d 90 μm and their vc 357 μl l in the stratified layer at site m1 were much larger than those in the region of s 2 psu at h1 d 38 μm and vc 205 μl l which indicates the importance of stratification on flocculation 3 3 distribution of floc size to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of floc size vc of the three size groups namely flocculi 20 μm microflocs 20 200 μm and macroflocs 200 μm was calculated respectively fig 4 results indicate that the vc of flocculi was closely correlated with c r 0 74 at both sites fig 4a and 4d compared to a more vertically uniform distribution at site h1 flocculi at m1 were mostly confined below the stratified layer the average vc of flocculi at m1 above 3 mab was 13 μl l which is merely 28 of that in the benthic layer microflocs at site h1 also showed a strong correlation with c r 0 71 with higher values of vc appearing near the benthic fig 4b however at site m1 42 of microflocs were scattered within the flocculation zone i e the stratified layer whereas 47 were confined in the benthic layer and correlated with c fig 4e large portions of macroflocs were concentrated in the flocculation zone at both sites accounting for 30 h1 and 64 m1 of total vc in the water column respectively fig 4c and 4f the relationships between each size group and environmental factors suggest that flocculi are mainly determined by c that primarily originates from local resuspension whereas macroflocs are largely controlled by stratification and promoted by salinity microflocs as a transition group between flocculi and macroflocs are affected by both sides they are influenced by not only c but also strong stratification 3 4 impact of stratification on flocculation with a favorable condition for flocculation see section 3 2 vertical profiles at site m1 around high slack tides t 15 h were analyzed in further detail results show that the stratified layer was featured by large particles with a wide size range fig 5 a the mean and standard deviation values of particle size in the stratified layer were 150 and 102 μm respectively notably larger than those d 22 μm and σ 8 μm in other parts i e the surface and benthic layers of the water column vc of particles in the stratified layer was 1077 μl l being more than 10 times of the value in the benthic layer 103 μl l and 80 times of that in the surface layer 13 μl l on the other hand ρf e in the stratified layer 73 8 kg m3 was less than a quarter of that outside the stratified layer 308 kg m3 psds at three heights h 1 8 5 and 6 5 mab respectively representing each depth layer were calculated to investigate the general patterns in the three layers results showed that both the surface and benthic layers exhibited a bimodal structure while the stratified layer presented a unimodal distribution fig 5b the bimodal structure in the psd of the surface layer was characterized by a similar distribution of flocculi and microflocs with diameters of 6 7 and 28 μm respectively whereas macroflocs were absent the stratified layer was occupied by macroflocs with a diameter of 334 μm accounting for as high as 90 of the total vc of particles particles were dominated by flocculi and microflocs again in the benthic layer accounting for 36 and 64 of the total vc of particles with diameters of 18 7 and 130 μm respectively compared to the wide range of psd of each size group σ 1 93 in the surface and benthic layers psd was confined within a narrow range in the stratified layer with σ 1 13 these significant differences between the stratified layer and its outside reveal that stratification greatly promotes flocculation resulting in concentrated psd dominated by larger particles with higher vc and lower ρf e than that in the unstratified water column 3 5 flocculation modelling based on our analysis of field data a simple parameterization scheme of collision efficiency of particles ka by including its explicit dependence on s referring to mode 2 and stratification dρw dz was applied in the k18 model which is expressed as 7 k a min k 1 f s f d ρ w dz 1 8 f s k 2 s i f s s k 2 s i f s s 9 f d ρ w dz k 3 d ρ w dz where maximum of ka 1 is adopted to meet its physical definition kuprenas et al 2018 winterwerp 1998 zhang et al 2020 parameters of k 1 k 2 and k 3 are positive constants which are derived from the minimum error between the simulated and measured diameter here s 2 psu in both two sites based on observation see section 3 2 and the data collected on the quadrupod with high stability and time resolution were tested for site h1 values of k 1 0 1 k 2 0 k 3 0 15 and kb 1e 6 were obtained with r 0 55 and rmsd 54 44 μm before 37 h fig 6 a and 7a and for site m1 values of k 1 0 k 2 0 k 3 0 65 and kb 7e 6 were derived with r 0 67 and rmsd 37 5 μm before 44 h fig 6g and 7b besides the measured particle size lagged simulated value by 0 6 h at site h1 which is partly attributed to inconsistent locations of instruments i e lisst 200x h 1 35 mab was above obs 3a and adv h 0 5 mab as it takes a certain time for resuspended sediment to transport to upper layer fettweis et al 2006 regarding to the original parameterization scheme i e without dependence of ka on s and stratification during same period for site h1 values of ka 0 15 and kb 1e 6 were obtained with r 0 42 and rmsd 56 14 μm fig 6a and 7a and for site m1 values of ka 0 05 and kb 1e 6 were derived with r 0 08 and rmsd 58 7 μm fig 6g and 7b compared to the original parameterization scheme our new parameterization of collision efficiency ka proves to be

2020 the advantage of our parameterization compared to empirical values derived from fitting is the introduction of a physically based prediction scheme of ka through an explicit dependency of particle collision on s and stratification so that the formula eq 7 9 can be applied broadly to estuarine environments 4 discussion 4 1 importance of salinity on flocculation in an earlier study zhang et al 2020 we have investigated the impact of c and g on flocculation at another two monitoring sites in the pearl river estuary results from the current study further prove the findings from the previous study that evolutions of flocs with different initial sizes synchronize gradually to adapt to the local hydrological environment in each depth layer and the trends of floc size evolution and absolute net flocculation rates are similar among diverse tidal shear cycles the impact of stratification was also explored in the previous study but to a less extent than the current study in the previous study we found that the halocline increases vertical variation of flocs size and divides the water column into two vertical zones with distinct flocculation dynamics flocculation within the stratified layer across the halocline was not investigated due to insufficient data one site was completely dominated by freshwater whilst the other was dominated by saline water with only a thin and unstable stratified layer near the surface in this study the newly derived observation data from site m1 which was featured by a persistent stratified layer allow a further investigation of flocculation dynamics in this layer our new observation suggests that the chemical impact of salinity in the form of surface charge is much smaller than that of stratification in stratified states site m1 the poor performance of modelling without considering stratification e g r 0 08 and 0 67 for the original and new scheme respectively fig 7b confirms that salinity induced stratification is an essential driver for flocculation especially for the formation of macroflocs see also section 3 3 it is worth noting that salinity is also highly correlated to the mixing degree of the river and sea born materials that is it can be treated as an indicator of physico chemical proporties of sediment e g mineralogy electrophoretic mobility cation exchange capacity and specific surface area leussen 1994 that suggests the necessity of continuous sampling and component analysis of suspended sediment in future studies 4 2 interplay of major influencing factors to illustrate flocculation pattern in surface layer data collected at site m1 was analyzed flocs size on the surface was quite small in general d 50 16 5 μm macroflocs from flocculation zone were dispersed into surface layer which coincided with high water level i e t 13 25 and 39 h in weak current environments e g u 0 2 m s fig 8 the brief peaks of floc were soon be deflocculated into flocculi and microflocs by subsequent ebb peak flows e g u 0 5 m s afterward the portion of microflocs increased slowly by the transformation of flocculi fig 8b the maximum values of spm concentration were in correspondence to the ebb peak flows r 0 71 fig 8c indicating that the surface layer was controlled by upstream freshwater the weak flocculation in the surface can be attributed to several aspects quite small values and fluctuation range of spm concentration 13 20 mg l resulting in insufficient particles limit flocculation in surface hill 1998 besides the negative charges on flocs surface as a result of low salinity can lead to electrostatic repulsion between particles which impedes their interaction and bonding parsons et al 2016 quezada et al 2018 in the stratified layer c was higher than that in the surface layer because of input from the benthic layer however its time series does not exhibit a significant correlation with floc size r 0 45 suggesting that c is not a main controlling factor for flocculation in this layer figs 2 and 3 c in the benthic layer was persistently larger than that in the upper layers due to resuspension during peak tidal flows with average values of 40 7 and 33 7 mg l at h1 and m1 respectively fig 6d and 6j the elevated c together with mild shear g 5 s fig 6c and 6i promoted flocculation in the benthic layer fig 6b and 6h although being less intensive compared to that in the stratified layer note that the benthic layer was taken over by the stratified layer during ebb tides at m1 it is also worth noting that volumetric concentration vc is not the same as mass concentration c vc reflects the flocculation status in terms of floc diameter d the relationship between vc and d is 10 vc n π 6 d 3 where n represents the number of particles the cube root of vc was positively correlated to d at site m1 r 0 78 fig 9 it is quite interesting and worth to note that n differs slightly between the surface and stratified layers while is significantly larger in the bottom layer where mass concentration c is much higher besides tidal cycle of hydrodynamic conditions can lead to both highly variability and periodicity of flocculation as for site h1 in a partly mixed state flocs size in the bottom layer was symmetrical around the moment of the strongest stratification at t 23 h fig 6a and 6f with skewness coefficient as low as 0 1 in detrending conditions the diameters of flocs showed quarter diurnal periodicity and a negative correlation with g r 0 65 fig 6a and 6c for site m1 controlled by stratification flocs decreased increased during flood ebb periods and exhibited semidiurnal periodicity of flocculation fig 6g and 6i 5 conclusions based on in situ observations and modelling this study investigated how salinity and salinity induced stratification interactively with turbulent shear g and spm concentration c control the vertical variation of floc size and the flocculation process in different depth layers in a typical tide dominated estuarine environment according to the results the following conclusions are drawn 1 flocculi are mainly affected by spm concentration and originate primarily from local resuspension whereas macroflocs are largely controlled by stratification microflocs as a transition group between flocculi and macroflocs are affected by dynamics of both sides they are controlled jointly by spm concentration shear rate and stratification 2 compared to bimodal psds in the surface and benthic layers dominated by small particles i e flocculi and microflocs the unimodal psd in the stratified layer is narrow and dominated by macroflocs with high vc and low ρf e 3 because of a high efficiency in promoting flocculation and formation of macroflocs the stratified layer around the halocline can be regarded as an optimal flocculation zone 4 flocculation modelling should consider an explicit dependency of particle collision on stratification credit authorship contribution statement ying zhang

4691,long term basin scale assessment of water storage is imperative for ensuring timely and equitable water share which is critical for india where prevailing water resources govern food security and economic developments here we holistically quantify the surface and subsurface water resources dynamics over three moderate to severely water stressed river basins in peninsular india namely the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins for the first time we jointly assimilate grace data pcr globwb simulation and in situ groundwater observations a comprehensive comparison of decadal trends of terrestrial water storage tws and its constituent components in three basins reveal a stable annual cycle and minimal trends during the period from july 2002 to june 2010 and declining trends of tws soil moisture storage sms and groundwater storage gws during the period from july 2010 to june 2017 in particular krishna river basin experienced the largest decrease in tws and gws with 30 95 mm yr 1 and 20 18 mm yr 1 respectively the analysis of water storage deficits well captures the influence of meteorological droughts in the region it shows that the groundwater extractions primarily govern the water availability during these dry phases grace derived gws anomalies and those obtained from the in situ data are in good agreement r 0 86 rmse 65 mm ρ 0 85 depicting the profound applicability of satellite observation in quantifying basin wide water resources we further isolate the impact of climatic variability and human interventions on tws anomaly trends by comparing output derived from grace and pcr globwb no human intervention nhi model runs the results depict that the human interventions account for 61 29 76 12 and 44 76 of tws trends in three basins the observation

more timely and efficiently keywords terrestrial water storage grace pcr globwb water storage deficits statistical analysis water resources management 1 introduction terrestrial water comprised of biomass snow cover surface water canopy water and soil moisture is a vital source of industrial agricultural and domestic water demands and is crucial for sustaining many auxiliary sectors including ecosystem and economy tiwari et al 2009 the increasing stress on terrestrial aquatic systems has threatened nearly 2 3rd of the prevailing habitats with over 5 billion people currently living in the regions prone to water scarcity this number is most likely to increase in the future due to climate change population growth and human activities like groundwater extractions urbanization and land use and land cover changes rodell et al 2018 vörösmarty et al 2010 apart from compromising food production groundwater depletion will lead to the increasing cost of infrastructure e g pumping saline water

döll et al 2014 long et al 2016 stoyanova and georgiev 2019 stoyanova 2020 in an agrarian economy like india where the dependency on surface and subsurface water resources have tremendously enhanced during the past decade leading to 28 area of the country vulnerable and 33 already affected with the water deficit conditions at various levels the sustainable management ensuring the equitable availability of the prevailing water resources becomes crucial central ground water board cgwb 2017 mishra and singh 2009 traditional assessment of the water resources systems utilizes data from the groundwater observation wells and water level gauges in rivers and reservoirs the limited availability of the in situ data their inability to represent the required spatial domain recorded data gaps and their subsequent interpolation the lack of digitization and restricted data access policies limit the holistic quantification and make a forecast of the freshwater availability exceedingly difficult over almost all the major aquifer systems famiglietti et al 2011 rodell et al 2018 therefore as an alternative the remotely sensed hydro meteorological fields from the satellite observation are integrated into the hydrological models as boundary conditions for a consistent assessment of the aquifer systems and the related water storage estimation bonan et al 2002 however the heterogeneity of aquifers spatial variability in climatic variables and anthropogenic impacts on hydrological fluxes including reservoir impoundment groundwater extraction etc deviate the model outputs from exactly mimicking the real field subjected to their operational scales notwithstanding a large variety and number of hydrological models using satellite data for quantifying the water resources trends the joint mission by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa usa and deutsches zentrum für luft und raumfahrt dlr germany known as grace has been collecting and archiving the earth s gravity anomalies since march 2002 which can be further processed to the terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa series famiglietti et al 2015 the ancillary data from hydrological

significant number of studies have been conducted to quantify the dynamics of tws and water fluxes on various spatial and temporal scales chen et al 2019 richey et al 2015 rodell et al 2018 scanlon et al 2018 among others highlighting the manifold socio economic problems and deteriorating water availability conditions primarily governed by the global climate change and population growth schewe et

drought events e g 2002 and 2009 droughts costing billions of dollars to the overall economy hazra et al 2013 webster et al 1998 while the groundwater table has been continuously depleting in northern india the overexploitation of aquifers has more recently shifted towards the peninsular and coastal plains and followed by the subsequent water scarcity problems triggered by fluctuating monsoon rainfall kumar et al 2005 tiwari et al 2009 mallya et al 2016 currently the river basins in peninsular india are moderate to severely non resilient to the hydro climatic perturbations which are likely to increase in the near future amid climate change and increasing human induced stresses on the water resources sharma and goyal 2018 therefore the basin scale comprehensive quantification of various water storage components and the subsequent assessment of the controlling factors are imperative for better aquifer management and mitigation strategies for sustained crop production sustainable ecosystem functioning and formulation of new water policies and up gradation or installation of new infrastructure under hydrological extremes droughts and floods ensuring the timely equitable and

gangetic basin dasgupta et al 2014 and north west india long et al 2016 suggesting the potential of utilizing both satellites and in situ data for managing the basin scale water resources but no studies are carried out explicitly for basins in peninsular india where water scarcity has been increasingly significant therefore we carried out a holistic quantification of all water storage ws components in peninsular india for the first time by jointly using the grace data pcr globwb simulation outputs and in situ well data and subsequently quantified the effects of natural and anthropogenic factors on the tws trends specifically this study seeks to i identify trends and dominant patterns in the basin scale dynamics of various water storage components tws gws sms by integrating grace based satellite data and pcr globwb 2 0 model simulation ii assess the water storage deficits in various ws components iii validate the remote sensing estimates of water resources using the in situ groundwater data iv understand the seasonal variability in various ws components and their interrelation in response to the water influx and v assess the role of climate and human interventions on various ws components in the study region and discuss the possible long term implications 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area three major river basins located in peninsular india i e the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins which encompass a cumulative area of 709151 km2 21 5 of india s geographical area and a total population of 200 million census of india 2011 were selected for the study fig 1 the basin boundaries are defined following the water resources information system india wris 2012 and cgwb 2017 a summary of the geographical area annual precipitation soil characteristics and the observation wells are shown in annexure 1 2 2 data used 2 2 1 terrestrial water storage tws we used monthly gravity anomaly data from the grace mission from july 2002 to june 2017 which has helped in quantifying the regional scale terrestrial water storage at an unprecedented accuracy of 10 100 mm landerer and swenson 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 the most recently released gravity anomaly data of level 06 were obtained from three processing centers namely centre for space research csr ut at austin and jet propulsion laboratory jpl in the form of mass concentration blocks i e mascons richard peltier et al 2018 save 2019 and from geoforschungszentrum gfz in the form of level 2 spherical harmonic sh coefficients truncated at degree and order 60 dahle et al 2019 several corrections and filtering including c20 replacement degree 2 coefficients with satellite laser ranging estimates de striping glacial isostatic adjustment gia geo center corrections application of fan filter of 250 km resolution were applied to the grace products for getting the basin averaged tws time series for the study duration a detailed description of the processing steps can be referred to in the papers by landerer and swenson 2012 richard peltier et al 2018 scanlon et al 2018 2016 and swenson and wahr 2006 measurement and leakage uncertainties in grace data were estimated following approaches by scanlon et al 2018 2016 supplementary material s1 the linear interpolation of the missing monthly values for grace tws followed xie et al 2018 along with other post processing approaches to deduce tws anomaly tws and all the subsequently derived ws components represent the corresponding long term anomaly series relative to the time mean between july 2002 and june 2017 and not the absolute values swenson and wahr 2006 furthermore to isolate the impact of human interventions on the tws anomaly twsa trends we compared grace twsa and pcr globwb no human intervention nhi model runs for the whole study duration scanlon et al 2018 all the surface water resources in the region exist either in the form of artificial water tanks 96 of the total surface water resources or dammed water for municipal use india wris 2012 the pcr globwb 2 0 model routed these types of surface water using the kinematic wave approximation sutanudjaja et al 2018 comparing to tws an insignificant trend 0 01 km3 yr 1 was observed in sws according to the output of the pcr globwb 2 0 model fig s1 therefore sws was included in the regional water balance eq 4 but is not plotted in figs 3 5 furthermore the biomass variations are uncaptured by grace owing to its detection limits rodell et al 2009 and hence were not incorporated in the water balance calculations details of all the data used for tws estimation and the subsequent segregation of gw components from tws are tabulated in annexure 1 2 2 2 precipitation the precipitation data from two sources one from tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm archive data 3b43 product 0 25 0 25 v7 and the other from gauge data measured by india meteorological department imd were conjunctively used trmm combines the satellite data with the rain gauge data from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc kummerow et al 2000 trmm archive data was further calibrated validated and improved with the gauge data taken from the india meteorological department imd following duan and bastiaanssen 2013 to give the time series of basin averaged monthly precipitation using thiessen polygon method 2 2 3 soil moisture due to the unavailability of the continuous and consistent recorded data series of soil moisture storage sms over the study region we have used the sms simulated by the pcr globwb 2 0 model which is a grid based hydrological model fully integrated with human water use the model has a computational resolution of 0 1 0 1 10 km at the equator and daily time step and simulates soil moisture storage and the water exchange between the surface and subsurface systems through precipitation and evapotranspiration for each grid cell in each time step sutanudjaja et al 2018 human water use is fully integrated into the hydrological model with all the water storage components viz sms gws and surface water sw routing paddy with 5 cm sw depth and non paddy crops are separately parametrized by considering the dynamic balance of hydrological fluxes between surface water and soil moisture incorporating the irrigation water within the region wada et al 2014 water demands for irrigation industry domestic use and livestock as a function of temperature considering the socio economic developments were estimated using the country specific information provided by faostat and were incorporated into the water balance http faostat fao org wada et al 2014 these water demands are met by consumptive water use from surface and groundwater resources followed by the return flow calculations in the model all other information regarding the vegetation and crop types and soil types were considered as per fao digital soil map of the world food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2007 temperature and other meteorological forcing data except for precipitation which was obtained according to section 2 2 2 are obtained from the wfdei dataset sutanudjaja et al 2018 the daily output of the soil moisture from each grid cell was integrated to give the basin averaged monthly time series 2 2 4 groundwater in situ groundwater level data were obtained from the central ground water board cgwb india for the study period i e july 2002 through june 2017 13 000 groundwater observation wells are operational by cgwb across the country out of which the data from 1103 wells india wris 2012 were found to be reasonable and selected for further use after screening for the temporal continuity and removal of the outliers the wells having two or more consecutive gaps in the recorded quarterly time series january may august and november were eliminated from the further calculations the groundwater storage based on the in situ data for both confined as well as unconfined aquifers was estimated from the following equations todd and mays 2005 1 g w s o b s h t s s b h m s s b f o r c o n f i n e d a q u i f e r h t s y h m s y f o r u n c o n f i n e d a q u i f e r where gwsobs is the groundwater storage gws based on the in situ data h t and h m represent the groundwater level gwl at time t and the long term mean gwl respectively s s and s y denote the specific storage and specific yield of the aquifer respectively b is the thickness of the aquifer out of 1103 screened wells 982 wells 89 were in the confined aquifers and the remaining 121 were in unconfined aquifers central ground water board cgwb 2017 the specific yield data is provided by central ground water board cgwb 2012 2 3 estimation of combined tws anomaly the generalized three cornered hat gtch method was employed to obtain the twsa time series corresponding to the minimal noise variance chen et al 2019 the combined time series of tws anomalies were calculated by eqs 2 and 3 by choosing the normalized j 1 3 w j 1 time dependent weights of the individual twss corresponding to the three data series 2 t w s a c o m b i n e d t j 1 3 w j t t w s a j t 3 w j 1 v a r r i j 1 3 1 v a r r i where w j t is the weight corresponding to the jth data series at time t r i is the relative uncertainty of three twsa and v a r r i is the variance of r i 2 4 estimation of gws based on the regional water balance considering the climatic conditions and the vegetation cover in our study region we neglected snow water equivalent and canopy water storage therefore the regional water balance equation becomes 4 g w s a e s t t t w s a c o m b i n e d t s w s a t s m s a t where gwsaest is the grace based estimate of groundwater storage anomaly twsacombined is the terrestrial water storage anomaly from grace products as per eq 2 swsa and smsa are the surface water storage anomaly and the soil moisture storage anomaly respectively simulated from the pcr globwb model the superscript t denotes the time all the water storage components are represented in terms of anomalies which are calculated by subtracting the long term mean from their respective time series as explained in section 2 2 1 both the grace derived tws and the model derived sms include the effects from the natural as well as anthropogenic factors thus making our analysis unbiased unlike the studies using gldas lsms output for sms which include only the climatic factors and hence neglect the influence of anthropogenic factors on sms and subsequently derived gws a schematic diagram depicting the methodology multiple data sources and the analyses conducted in this study is shown in fig 2 2 5 error analysis the error associated with the resulting monthly gws anomaly time series was derived from eq 5 using a root mean square of the respective errors in other monthly ws components used in eq 4 voss et al 2013 5 e g w s e t w s 2 e s m s 2 e s w s 2 where e t w s e s m s and e s w s are the trend error one sigma in tws from grace sms and sws from the pcr globwb model respectively e t w s is estimated as 0 5 mm yr 1 0 7 mm yr 1 and 0 8 mm yr 1 for the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively and was calculated by the propagation of monthly error grace measurement errors leakage errors in tws onto the least square estimated trends errors in the output of the pcr globwb model were quantified by the standard deviation of the trends in respective time series computed using methods by kato et al 2007 which resulted in an error of 1 6 mm yr 1 1 4 mm yr 1 and 1 7 mm yr 1 in sms 0 3 mm yr 1 0 2 mm yr 1 and 0 3 mm yr 1 in sws and 1 7 mm yr 1 1 8 mm yr 1 and 1 9 mm yr 1 in the resulting e g w s for the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively errors in all the ws components were calculated after removing the long term annual signals from the individual values here one notable thing is the magnification of the grace error as the basin size decreases highest for the smallest basin and vice versa which is consistent with the observation by scanlon et al 2018 2 6 statistical analysis we used several statistical techniques for comparing the observed gws anomaly series gwsaobs with the grace based gws anomaly series gwsaest which were obtained from the groundwater storage calculated by eqs 1 and 4 respectively root mean square error rmse was used for quantifying the combined effect of imprecision and biasness helsel and hirsch 2002 rmse manifests the deviation of a variable from its real value i e the observed values gwsaobs in the present study we used skewness and kurtosis for assessing the time series distribution of individual water storage components skewness and kurtosis represent the data symmetry and the tail heaviness of the distribution not the peakedness respectively westfall 2014 pearson correlation r was used for estimating the linear association of both the time series helsel and hirsch 2002 non parametric rank correlation i e spearman s rank correlation was also calculated for determining the statistical dependence of the two data sets which describes the monotonicity of the relationship between the two variables a high correlation for the two variables means a similar rank between the two variables thus high monotonicity 3 results and discussion 3 1 terrestrial water storage and water storage deficits fig 3 a 4 a and 5 a show the time series of terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa for the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively it is evident that the anomalies of tws possess seasonal variations and amplitudes larger than swsa and gwsa in all three river basins due to the integration of both the surface water and groundwater storage long term linear trends in twsa were positive 5 21 mm yr 1 in the godavari and slightly negative in the krishna and mahanadi river basins 1 35 mm yr 1 and 0 18 mm yr 1 table s2 on the contrary to the slightly negative or positive trends of twsa in the basins table s2 the per capita water availability in all three basins is projected to be continuously decreased table s1 we attempted to quantify the trends and to analyze how water storage is changing in recent times for this piecewise analysis we split the twsa series before and after the end of the 2009 drought year thus twsa dynamics in two distinct periods were found for all three river basins the first from july 2002 until june 2010 where twsa trends were quantified as a mix of positive the godavari and krishna river basins and negative trend the mahanadi river basin and the second from july 2010 until june 2017 where twsa was highly decreasing for all the three basins tables 2 s3 the time series of twsa showed a piecewise trend of 1 45 mm yr 1 10 48 mm yr 1 and 5 54 mm yr 1 from july 2002 to june 2010 and 10 41 mm yr 1 30 95 mm yr 1 and 18 81 mm yr 1 from july 2010 to june 2017 for the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively tables 2 s3 the corresponding net volumetric water loss from july 2010 until june 2017 was quantified as 22 79 km3 55 19 km3 and 18 64 km3 for the three basins respectively table 2 in addition to the negative trends in tws and other ws components in the recent period table 2 the high seasonal fluctuation in response to the variable rainfall in the region imposes a challenge to the policymakers water managers and the relevant government agencies to efficiently and equitably meet the freshwater demand under these highly dynamic conditions the signatures of water loss were evident in twsa during the years 2002 2003 2004 2005 2009 2011 and 2015 2016 in the godavari and mahanadi river basins fig 3 a 4 a and 5 a however all the meteorological droughts are well captured in the water storage deficits except the drought of 2009 in the krishna river basin though sometimes with lags and sometimes as a continuous prolonged drought instead of multiple deficits to further ascertain the water deficit conditions we calculated the monthly water storage deficit wsd fig 3 c 4 c and 5 c by removing the mean monthly water storage anomaly twsa gwsa and smsa of each basin during the whole study period twsa based wsd twsa wsd revealed the below average terrestrial water storage during the four years with a maximum decrease of water equivalent depth of 125 17 mm nov 2002 149 15 mm nov 2015 and 132 38 mm aug 2002 in the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively fig 3 c 4 c and 5 c the corresponding water volume deficit for these river basins was 39 15 km3 37 99 km3 and 18 74 km3 respectively cumulative tws deficit i e the sum of monthly wsd negative value only during the study period was maximum in mahanadi 4467 05 mm followed by krishna 4371 21 mm and godavari 4033 12 mm river basins to quantify the water depletion during the drought years and the subsequent recovery volumes we analyzed the cumulative water storage deficits wsd fig 6 cumulative tws in all three basins captured the downward trend in response to the meteorological drought of years 2002 and 2004 with a continuous prolonged tws depletion in godavari and krishna but two separate deficit periods in mahanadi river basin a monthly tws loss rate of 15 jul 2002 to nov 2005 14 sep 2002 to jul 2005 and 8 km3 aug 2002 to jul 2003 was observed in the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins tws recovered from jul 2003 to jun 2004 3 km3 month 1 in mahanadi river basin when it again started depleting until nov 2005 recovery in tws started from mid to late 2005 in the krishna and godavari river basis with a monthly gain rate of 13 and 9 km3 respectively the meteorological drought of the year 2009 started appearing in the godavari river basin from may 2008 until june 2010 and resulted in a tws loss of 10 km3 month 1 which recovered by late 2011 with 13 km3 month 1 the krishna river basin showed a tws surplus even after receiving the rainfall deficit of 20 from the long term average which had ultimately resulted in the century scale drought in the year 2009 hazra et al 2013 it implies that subsurface storage was sufficient in the region to meet various water demands the water was sustainably used which resulted in an average monthly recovery of 13 km3 from jul 2005 to march 2012 followed by a stable tws until apr 2015 on the contrary the mahanadi river basin experienced two events of average monthly water depletion 3 and 7 km3 and recovery 4 and 7 km3 each from jun 2004 to aug 2015 which cumulatively had a balance after showing stable dynamics of tws during the year 2012 tws in the godavari river basin further recovered by 30 km3 month 1 until jun 2017 with a loss rate of 5 km3 during sept 2015 jun 2016 cumulative tws is decreasing in the krishna river basin 12 km3 and in the mahanadi river basin 5 km3 but increasing in the godavari river basin 11 km3 during the year 2016 2017 3 2 soil moisture variations figs 3 b 4 b and 5 b portray the simulation outputs of soil moisture storage anomalies smsa in the three river basins from the pcr globwb model which fully integrates the human water use and the dynamic water balance with compartments of gws and routes surface water a quicker response to the climatic factors precipitation evapotranspiration and temperature can be seen in smsa as compared to gwsa and twsa the long term piecewise trends in the combined time series of smsa from july 2002 until june 2010 were negative for all basins viz the godavari 3 57 mm yr 1 krishna 0 76 mm yr 1 and mahanadi 7 77 mm yr 1 river basins table s3 smsa showed a declining trend of 10 06 mm yr 1 10 76 mm yr 1 and 10 51 mm yr 1 for the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively from july 2010 until june 2017 the decrease in sms in this period accounted for 96 6 34 8 and 55 9 of the reduction of tws table 2 thus indicating sms as a significant contributor to twsa in the godavari river basin the signatures of the drought events were also reflected in smsa but with dampened magnitudes than twsa which can be attributed to the apparent reason that the smsa contributes partially to twsa the various water storage components smsa and swsa estimated from the pcr globwb 2 0 model may be affected by uncertainties and error propagation due to model spin up and initial conditions model structure and capacity and forcing parameters the krishna river basin experienced relatively less frequent deficit events in sms than the other two basins figs 3 6 effects of all the meteorological droughts of 2002 2004 2009 and 2011 are not evident consistently in all three basins in response to these droughts a volumetric water loss of 7 3 5 and 2 km3 month 1 was observed in the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively from mid 2002 to mid 2003 a stable dynamic 1 km3 month 1 is observed in each basin during 2004 like the tws the effect of the 2009 drought appeared in the godavari basin as early as jun 2008 and lasted up to late 2009 with a monthly depletion of 2 5 km3 krishna and mahanadi river basins showed stable and decreasing rates 2 km3 in sms during the drought year 2009 after that sms in the krishna basin continuously recovered until jun 2011 while godavari and mahanadi basins experienced multiple events of losses and recoveries until mid 2014 which cumulatively balanced sms in all three basins has been decreasing with 4 5 2 km3 month 1 starting from may 2014 jun 2011 and sept 2014 in the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively fig 6 3 3 trends in gwsa and its role during dry years the anomalies of gws gwsa showed seasonality throughout the study period in all three river basins figs 3 b 4 b and 5 b this seasonality is summarized by calculating the mean monthly ws components throughout the study period fig 9 which will be discussed in section 3 6 it is also apparent that gwsa showed a phase lag of 1 3 months throughout the observation period due to the delay in groundwater recharge figs 3 b 4 b 5 b and 9 smaller amplitudes of gwsa compared to sms can be attributed to the smaller influence of climatic factors the limited storage change by groundwater recharge and the high groundwater withdrawal during the non monsoon seasons typically from october to may gwsa showed a minimal decline in the godavari river basin at the rate of 0 34 mm yr 1 equivalent water volume of 0 74 km3 and comparatively higher rates of 20 18 mm yr 1 eq water vol of 35 98 km3 and 8 3 mm yr 1 eq water vol of 8 23 km3 in the krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively during the period from july 2010 to june 2017 table 2 the loss of gw storage in the three basins accounted for 3 29 65 2 and 44 1 of the loss in total water storage respectively making gws the least contributor to tws in the godavari river basin and the highest contributor in the krishna river basin gws well captures the meteorological drought signatures in the study region with largely similar behavior to tws the impact of climatic factors e g precipitation is dampened in the groundwater storage which had resulted in the time lag in the onset of deficits and recoveries in gws as compared to sms or tws figs 3 6 there is gws depletion starting from mid 2002 until late 2005 and early 2006 with an approximate volumetric loss rate of 15 14 and 4 km3 month 1 in the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively fig 6 followed by the recovery however gws could not be recovered fully when it started to decrease again in late 2008 towards early 2011 for the godavari and mahanadi river basins as an exception the krishna river basin did not reveal the influence of the drought in the year 2009 the godavari river basin experienced a continuous recovery of gws with a mean rate of 11 km3 month 1 from jul 2010 while the krishna and mahanadi river basins showed decreasing gws rates of 7 km3 month 1 and 4 km3 month 1 respectively since mid 2015 moreover the time series of monthly gwsa was consistent with the terrestrial water storage tws loss during the water deficit periods figs 3 6 nevertheless the inherent phase lag due to the response of the hydrological system was present in gwsa throughout the period during the period of meteorological droughts it is likely that the water storage dynamics in particular the groundwater dynamics is primarily governed by the anthropogenic influences owing to the increased reliance and hence the withdrawal of gw for domestic and agricultural water demands and resulting irrigation for farmlands in case of meteorological drought years of 2002 2005 2009 and 2015 increased gw extraction for meeting high water demand 61 of irrigation and 80 of drinking water during these periods siebert et al 2010 appears to have determined the prominent dry phase centering the drought years and hence govern the interannual variability of twsa r 0 7 0 8 the coinciding of the maximum deficits in gwsa with that of twsa showed that the gw extractions primarily govern the water storage conditions during these dry years groundwater storage deficits gwsa wsd in fig 3 c 4 c and 5 c show the below average groundwater storage during the four drought years with a maximum decrease of water depth of 120 47 mm oct 2004 117 61 mm jan 2005 and 139 01 mm aug 2002 and the corresponding water volume loss of 37 68 km3 29 96 km3 and 19 68 km3 in the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively moreover the cumulative negative deficits in gws wsd during the study period were 3843 8 mm 3677 3 mm and 3863 02 mm which comprised 95 30 84 12 and 86 5 of the total deficit based on twsa tws wsd for the three basins respectively on the other hand soil moisture storage based wsd sms wsd made up 37 9 40 1 and 33 6 of the cumulative negative tws deficits in the three basins hence we can conclude that the groundwater plays a significant role in terrestrial water storage and therefore in the water availability during the dry periods in all basins 3 4 comparison of observed and grace derived gwsa for comparing gwsa estimated from eq 4 gwsaest with that from eq 1 using the in situ records gwsaobs we analyzed the time series of gwsaest and gwsaobs at four times a year when the in situ record of the groundwater wells is available january may august and november fig 7 for consistency we accumulated the precipitation in four seasons i e june august monsoon september november post monsoon december january post monsoon and february may pre monsoon fig 7 gwsaobs was compared with gwsaest using various statistical approaches table 3 gwsaest agreed favorably well with gwsaobs in terms of seasonal phase and the amplitude dynamics the maxima of both series occur in august monsoon season or november post monsoon season and the minima occur in may pre monsoon or summer season rmse between both the time series increases as the basin area decreases and follows the order mahanadi 65 45 mm krishna 54 79 mm godavari 54 74 mm similar to the observations in various parts of the world long et al 2016 shamsudduha et al 2012 strassberg et al 2007 the grace based estimates of gwsa showed a strong linear correlation with the observed gwsa as indicated by pearson correlation r with the highest in the krishna river basin r 0 91 and the lowest in the mahanadi river basin r 0 86 which depicts the high potential of the satellite for estimating the basin scale groundwater storage the scatter plots and linear fits shown in fig 8 represent that gwsaest followed a similar gradient to gwsaobs gwsaest gwsaobs 1 0 53 0 55 for all three basins the negative values of skewness and high kurtosis values 2 for all the basins depicted the data asymmetry and the heavier tails in the data series a strong monotone relationship between gswaobs and gswaest as indicated by spearman s rank correlation coefficient ρ 0 85 implies that the observed gwsa was in phase with the estimated gwsa moreover on an annual scale gwsaest and gswaobs agreed well and both showed no significant decreasing trend since 2002 implying the sustainable use of groundwater resources for various purposes the assumption of uniform aquifer thickness and physical properties and the uneven distribution of groundwater observation wells fig 1 accounts for the difference in the estimated and observed gwsa table 3 long et al 2016 moreover the observation wells do not represent the exact gws in the representative area at any time which adds errors in the observed time series of gwsa overall the high correlation among both the series provides confidence in the synergetic application of grace data pcr globwb model simulation and in situ groundwater data observed gwsa was relatively constant during both the decline and recovery period compared to the estimated gwsa probably due to the loss of nonrenewable water deep aquifers and the response lag compared to the real time record by grace a few times in monsoon and post season e g during 2002 and 2005 in the godavari and krishna river basins and during 2002 and 2015 in mahanadi river basin comparatively more rise in observed gwsa than in estimated gwsa fig 7 can be explained by the local flood impacts on the open wells after the drought in 2009 the krishna river basin showed a high recovery in the estimated gwsa fig 7 which can most likely be explained by the non negative condition of twsa wsd in preceding years and continuous recharge of water from soil moisture storage to the deeper aquifers the higher amplitude variations in the gwsaest may be partially attributed to the propagation of uncertainties in the modeled soil moisture storage either due to the model s physical structure or due to the uncertainties in the forcing variables to the pcr globwb model rodell et al 2007 continuously developing the pcr globwb model and the grace fo data with higher accuracy availability of the soil moisture data from the ground based sensors enhanced temporal and spatial continuity in the groundwater data may reduce the amplitude gap between gwsaobs and gwsaest in future studies 3 5 intra annual distribution of water storage fluxes the average monthly values of ws components and net precipitation p et were calculated for each river basin for the period from july 2002 to june 2017 fig 9 while the mean monthly net precipitation was the largest in july twsa exhibits the maximum in september or october the mean monthly values for constituent components of tws maximize in august or september for smsa and in november for gwsa the magnitude of maximum mean monthly ws components was the largest in twsa followed by smsa and the smallest in gwsa for all three river basins three notable inferences are drawn for each ws component during the indian monsoon season 1 the dominant climatic factor i e net precipitation flux apparently governs the dynamics of water storage in all three basins during the monsoon season june october since the peaks in mean monthly values of all ws components occurred within a specific range of time lag from the peak of net precipitation flux since there is a surplus of available water the irrigation activities by abstracted gw are likely to be almost absent in this season thus making the net precipitation flux a major contributor to the variation of smsa fig 9 the gradual decrease in temperature during the monsoon season fig s2 leading to reduced evapotranspiration further facilitates the recovery of ws components fig 9 it must be noted here that the actual timing of the indian monsoon varies by 1 2 weeks within this study region which is highly unlikely to affect our conclusions based on a long decadal assessment 2 during december to march april i e the post monsoon season tws declined at a faster rate that is mostly attributed to declining gws due to climatic and anthropogenic factors this declining behavior can be explained on one side by the minimal and highly heterogeneous precipitation and increased air temperature and evapotranspiration and on the other side by the decline of gws due to more frequent than usual irrigation irrigation done before the crop harvesting activities of rabi crops rabi and kharif are two cropping seasons in india during these periods this leads to a continuous decline with a lag until the monsoon arrives in may or june 3 during the pre monsoon season march to may all the ws components reflect the dry environment due to the temperature increase towards the upcoming summer season figs 9 and s2 after that the variable pre monsoon precipitation and minimal or no irrigation activities recover gws slowly the recovery of all ws components becomes steep as the monsoon arrives 3 6 are anthropogenic interventions the main drivers of water storage trends for determining the governing factors of ws dynamics we compared the trends of twsa with the irrigation intensity indicated by the percentage of irrigated areas in the basin tables 1 and 2 the krishna river basin with the highest irrigation intensity of 21 09 showed the highest declining trend in tws 30 95 mm yr 1 on the contrary inconsistency in the relationship between the trends in tws and irrigation intensity for the godavari and mahanadi river basins indicates other influencing factors e g irrigation with surface water therefore to further quantify and isolate the impact of human interventions reservoir management and water abstractions we run pcr globwb no human intervention nhi model scanlon et al 2018 by the model output we quantified the contribution of the human interventions to the trend in twsa as 6 38 mm yr 1 23 56 mm yr 1 and 8 42 mm yr 1 which were equivalent to 61 29 76 12 and 44 76 of the total twsa trend for the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively the difference in trend between the grace derived twsa and that from pcr globwb nhi runs was the highest for the krishna river basin thus ascertaining that the gw extractions govern the tws dynamics in this basin the second highest declining rate of twsa in the mahanadi river basin can be explained by the most negative trend of net precipitation flux table 2 in particular dry warm climate low precipitation and high temperatures and enhanced agricultural activities during the non monsoon season cumulatively make the water balance negative for the river basin furthermore we estimated the trends in climatic variables to compare with those of twsa since no significant relationship was observed between twsa and precipitation r 0 25 0 32 ρ 0 18 0 25 table s4 we estimated the net precipitation fluxes i e p et because the imbalance of water fluxes induces the change in water storage through the boundary of a system as a result of natural and anthropogenic perturbations the net precipitation flux showed negative values during the non monsoon season october to february with a transition during the pre monsoon season march to may and positive during the monsoon season june to september figs 9 and 10 the overall trends in annual total net precipitation are negative i e 2 83 mm yr 1 1 05 mm yr 1 and 3 39 mm yr 1 for the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively during july 2010 to june 2017 which explains about 27 3 and 18 of the total trend of respective twsa table 2 the remaining differences in the twsa were likely due to the underestimation of the water demand by the pcr globwb 2 0 model because instead of the actual water demand of a region it considered the water demand and subsequent allocation based on the auxiliary forcing parameters moreover the highest grace errors in twsa estimation for the smallest basin i e mahanadi can be one reason for the largest difference in trends 37 24 4 conclusion we carried out a basin scale holistic quantification of the water resources dynamics and long term trends under the influence of the human interventions and natural climatic perturbations over the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins located in peninsular india the current framework can be applied to various river basins globally for a complete quantification of the different components of water storage based on the grace satellite observations the global hydrology and water resources model pcr globwb 2 0 and in situ groundwater observations the long term variation of water storage july 2002 to june 2017 showed a mixed behavior of either increasing or minimally decreasing tws decreasing sms and increasing gws trends in the study region however all the water storage components showed declining trends in recent time july 2010 to june 2017 the water storage deficit analysis revealed that despite the minimal linear trends during july 2002 to june 2017 all three river basins experienced multiple deficit events in response to the cumulative influence of the rainfall deficits and groundwater abstraction the former likely due to enso impacts on the monsoon rainfall the relative contribution of 84 95 by the deficit of groundwater storage to total water storage deficit in the region indicates the excessive groundwater withdrawals relative to the replenishment and underscore the need for multilateral cooperation among the states and the various related stakeholders to wisely integrate the groundwater usage with the surface water availability for irrigation in the region trends and deficits in various water storage components in recent times highlight the need for revising water allocation strategies e g conjunctive water management plan irrigation systems and methods e g switching to drip irrigation and assessment of the governing factors social physical and economic of crop management practices for sustainable management to ensure optimum and equitable future water supply the meteorological drought events are well captured by the time series of tws and gws in the region albeit with the lags in various water storage components these signatures of drought events representing the integrated as well as disaggregated water availability in various components highlight the potential for efficient irrigation scheduling and effective quantification of the water deficit conditions that are not commonly visible leading to a timely evolution of the deficit severity and efficient measures of mitigation and adaption furthermore very good agreement r 0 86 0 91 ρ 0 85 0 91 of the grace derived groundwater anomalies with those estimated from in situ groundwater well data reveal that the grace products could potentially be used for quantifying gws and for subsequent basin scale hydrological implications the current study puts forward a blueprint for managing the basin scale water resources and food security more timely and efficiently we believe that the water deficit conditions revealed in this study will foster urgent discussions towards ensuring sustainable water use in the three basins the proposed framework for quantifying the surface and subsurface water resources dynamics complements the little existing knowledge on the basin scale water storage the potential areas of the future work within and beyond the current study region include the use of the currently operational grace fo mission launched on may 22 2018 which will cover more period compared to grace using the improved land surface models output or the ground based soil moisture data subject to the availability which will be conjunctively used with the improved pcr globwb model to eliminate the model related uncertainties improvement in the temporal and spatial resolutions of the in situ groundwater data will represent the gws with reduced uncertainties we also plan to use the artificial neural network ann models based on the various constituent water storage components as predictors to predict terrestrial water storage the ann model based forecasting and hindcasting of tws will enable us to fill the data gap between grace and grace fo records and help quantify the water storage dynamics of the region even beyond grace fo data records credit authorship contribution statement abhishek

4691,long term basin scale assessment of water storage is imperative for ensuring timely and equitable water share which is critical for india where prevailing water resources govern food security and economic developments here we holistically quantify the surface and subsurface water resources dynamics over three moderate to severely water stressed river basins in peninsular india namely the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins for the first time we jointly assimilate grace data pcr globwb simulation and in situ groundwater observations a comprehensive comparison of decadal trends of terrestrial water storage tws and its constituent components in three basins reveal a stable annual cycle and minimal trends during the period from july 2002 to june 2010 and declining trends of tws soil moisture storage sms and groundwater storage gws during the period from july 2010 to june 2017 in particular krishna river basin experienced the largest decrease in tws and gws with 30 95 mm yr 1 and 20 18 mm yr 1 respectively the analysis of water storage deficits well captures the influence of meteorological droughts in the region it shows that the groundwater extractions primarily govern the water availability during these dry phases grace derived gws anomalies and those obtained from the in situ data are in good agreement r 0 86 rmse 65 mm ρ 0 85 depicting the profound applicability of satellite observation in quantifying basin wide water resources we further isolate the impact of climatic variability and human interventions on tws anomaly trends by comparing output derived from grace and pcr globwb no human intervention nhi model runs the results depict that the human interventions account for 61 29 76 12 and 44 76 of tws trends in three basins the observation

application of fan filter of 250 km resolution were applied to the grace products for getting the basin averaged tws time series for the study duration a detailed description of the processing steps can be referred to in the papers by landerer and swenson 2012 richard peltier et al 2018 scanlon et al 2018 2016 and swenson and wahr 2006 measurement and leakage uncertainties in grace data were estimated following approaches by scanlon et al 2018 2016 supplementary material s1 the linear interpolation of the missing monthly values for grace tws followed xie et al 2018 along with other post processing approaches to deduce tws anomaly tws and all the subsequently derived ws components represent the corresponding long term anomaly series relative to the time mean between july 2002 and june 2017 and not the absolute values swenson and wahr 2006 furthermore to isolate the impact of human interventions on the tws anomaly twsa trends we compared grace twsa and pcr globwb no human

to tws an insignificant trend 0 01 km3 yr 1 was observed in sws according to the output of the pcr globwb 2 0 model fig s1 therefore sws was included in the regional water balance eq 4 but is not plotted in figs 3 5 furthermore the biomass variations are uncaptured by grace owing to its detection limits rodell et al 2009 and hence were not incorporated in the water balance calculations details of all the data used for tws estimation and the subsequent segregation of gw components from tws are tabulated in annexure 1 2 2 2 precipitation the precipitation data from two sources one from tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm archive data 3b43 product 0 25 0 25 v7 and the other from gauge data measured by india meteorological department imd were conjunctively used trmm combines the satellite data with the rain gauge data from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc kummerow et al 2000 trmm archive data was further calibrated validated and improved with the gauge data taken from the india meteorological department imd following duan and bastiaanssen 2013 to give the time series of basin averaged monthly precipitation using thiessen polygon method 2 2 3 soil moisture due to the unavailability of the continuous and consistent recorded data series of soil moisture storage sms over the study region we have used the sms simulated by the pcr globwb 2 0 model which is a grid based hydrological model fully integrated with human water use the model has a computational resolution of 0 1 0 1 10 km at the equator and daily time step and simulates soil moisture storage and the water exchange between the surface and subsurface systems through precipitation and evapotranspiration for each grid cell in each time step sutanudjaja et al 2018 human water use is fully integrated into the hydrological model with all the water storage components viz sms gws and surface water sw routing paddy with 5 cm sw depth and non paddy crops are separately parametrized by considering the dynamic balance of hydrological fluxes between surface water and soil moisture incorporating the irrigation water within the region wada et al 2014 water demands for irrigation industry domestic use and livestock as a function of temperature considering the socio economic developments were estimated using the country specific information provided by faostat and were incorporated into the water balance http faostat fao org wada et al 2014 these water demands are met by consumptive water use from surface and groundwater resources followed by the return flow calculations in the model all other information regarding the vegetation and crop types and soil types were considered as per fao digital soil map of the world food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2007 temperature and other meteorological forcing data except for precipitation which was obtained according to section 2 2 2 are obtained from the wfdei dataset sutanudjaja et al 2018 the daily output of the soil moisture from each grid cell was integrated to give the basin averaged monthly time series 2 2 4 groundwater in situ groundwater level data were obtained from the central ground water board cgwb india for the study period i e july 2002 through june 2017 13 000 groundwater observation wells are operational by cgwb across the country out of which the data from 1103 wells india wris 2012 were found to be reasonable and selected for further use after screening for the temporal continuity and removal of the outliers the wells having two or more consecutive gaps in the recorded quarterly time series january may august and november were eliminated from the further calculations the groundwater storage based on the in situ data for both confined as well as unconfined aquifers was estimated from the following equations todd and mays 2005 1 g w s o b s h t s s b h m s s b f o r c o n f i n e d a q u i f e r h t s y h m s y f o r u n c o n f i n e d a q u

specific storage and specific yield of the aquifer respectively b is the thickness of the aquifer out of 1103 screened wells 982 wells 89 were in the confined aquifers and the remaining 121 were in unconfined aquifers central ground water board cgwb 2017 the specific yield data is provided by central ground water board cgwb 2012 2 3 estimation of combined tws anomaly the generalized three cornered hat gtch method was employed to obtain the twsa time series corresponding to the minimal noise variance chen et al 2019 the combined time series of tws anomalies were calculated by eqs 2 and 3 by choosing the normalized j 1 3 w j 1 time dependent weights of the individual twss corresponding to the three data series 2 t w s a c o m b i n e d t j 1 3 w j t t w s a j t 3 w j 1 v a r r i j 1 3 1 v a r r i where w j t is the weight corresponding to the jth data series at time t r i is the relative uncertainty of three twsa and v a r r i is the variance of r i 2 4 estimation of gws based on the regional water balance considering the climatic conditions and the vegetation cover in our study region we neglected snow water equivalent and canopy water storage therefore the regional water balance equation becomes 4 g w s a e s t t t w s a c o m b i n e d t s w s a t s m s a t where gwsaest is the grace based estimate of groundwater storage anomaly twsacombined is the terrestrial water storage anomaly from grace products as per eq 2 swsa and smsa are the surface water storage anomaly and the soil moisture storage anomaly respectively simulated from the pcr globwb model the superscript t denotes the time all the water storage components are represented in terms of anomalies which are calculated by subtracting the long term mean from their respective time series as explained in section 2 2 1 both the grace derived tws and the model derived sms include the effects from the natural as well as anthropogenic factors thus making our analysis unbiased unlike the studies using gldas lsms output for sms which include only the climatic factors and hence neglect the influence of anthropogenic factors on sms and subsequently derived gws a schematic diagram depicting the methodology multiple data sources and the analyses conducted in this study is shown in fig 2 2 5 error analysis the error associated with the resulting monthly gws anomaly time series was derived from eq 5 using a root mean square of the respective errors in other monthly ws components used in eq 4 voss et al 2013 5 e g w s e t w s 2 e s m s 2 e s w s 2 where e t w s e s m s and e s w s are the trend error one sigma in tws from grace sms and sws from the pcr globwb model respectively e t w s is estimated as 0 5 mm yr 1 0 7 mm yr 1 and 0 8 mm yr 1 for the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively and was calculated by the propagation of monthly error grace measurement errors leakage errors in tws onto the least square estimated trends errors in the output of the pcr globwb model were quantified by the standard deviation of the trends in respective time series computed using methods by kato et al 2007 which resulted in an error of 1 6 mm yr 1 1 4 mm yr 1 and 1 7 mm yr 1 in sms 0 3 mm yr 1 0 2 mm yr 1 and 0 3 mm yr 1 in sws and 1 7 mm yr 1 1 8 mm yr 1 and 1 9 mm yr 1 in the resulting e g w s for the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively errors in all the ws components were calculated after removing the long term annual signals from the individual values here one notable thing is the magnification of the grace error as the basin size decreases highest for the smallest basin and vice versa which is consistent with the observation by scanlon et al 2018 2 6 statistical analysis we used several statistical techniques for comparing the observed gws anomaly series gwsaobs with the grace based gws anomaly series gwsaest which were obtained from the groundwater storage calculated by eqs 1 and 4 respectively root mean square error rmse was used for quantifying the combined effect of imprecision and biasness helsel and hirsch 2002 rmse manifests the deviation of a variable from its real value i e the observed values gwsaobs in the present study we used skewness and kurtosis for assessing the time series distribution of individual water storage components skewness and kurtosis represent the data symmetry and the tail heaviness of the distribution not the peakedness respectively westfall 2014 pearson correlation r was used for estimating the linear association of both the time series helsel and hirsch 2002 non parametric rank correlation i e spearman s rank correlation was also calculated for determining the statistical dependence of the two data sets which describes the monotonicity of the relationship between the two variables a high correlation for the two variables means a similar rank between the two variables thus high monotonicity 3 results and discussion 3 1 terrestrial water storage and water storage deficits fig 3 a 4 a and 5 a show the time series of terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa for the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively it is evident that the anomalies of tws possess seasonal variations and amplitudes larger than swsa and gwsa in all three river basins due to the integration of both the surface water and groundwater storage long term linear trends in twsa were positive 5 21 mm yr 1 in the godavari and slightly negative in the krishna and mahanadi river basins 1 35 mm yr 1 and 0 18 mm yr 1 table s2 on the contrary to the slightly negative or positive trends of twsa in the basins table s2 the per capita water availability in all three basins is projected to be continuously decreased table s1 we attempted to quantify the trends and to analyze how water storage is changing in recent times for this piecewise analysis we split the twsa series before and after the end of the 2009 drought year thus twsa dynamics in two distinct periods were found for all three river basins the first from july 2002 until june 2010 where twsa trends were quantified as a mix of positive the godavari and krishna river basins and negative trend the mahanadi river basin and the second from july 2010 until june 2017 where twsa was highly decreasing for all the three basins tables 2 s3 the time series of twsa showed a piecewise trend of 1 45 mm yr 1 10 48 mm yr 1 and 5 54 mm yr 1 from july 2002 to june 2010 and 10 41 mm yr 1 30 95 mm yr 1 and 18 81 mm yr 1 from july 2010 to june 2017 for the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively tables 2 s3 the corresponding net volumetric water loss from july 2010 until june 2017 was quantified as 22 79 km3 55 19 km3 and 18 64 km3 for the three basins respectively table 2 in addition to the negative trends in tws and other ws components in the recent period table 2 the high seasonal fluctuation in response to the variable rainfall in the region imposes a challenge to the policymakers water managers and the relevant government agencies to efficiently and equitably meet the freshwater demand under these highly dynamic conditions the signatures of water loss were evident in twsa during the years 2002 2003 2004 2005 2009 2011 and 2015 2016 in the godavari and mahanadi river basins fig 3 a 4 a and 5 a however all the meteorological droughts are well captured in the water storage deficits except the drought of 2009 in the krishna river basin though sometimes with lags and sometimes as a continuous prolonged drought instead of multiple deficits to further ascertain the water deficit conditions we calculated the monthly water storage deficit wsd fig 3 c 4 c and 5 c by removing the mean monthly water storage anomaly twsa gwsa and smsa of each basin during the whole study period twsa based wsd twsa wsd revealed the below average terrestrial water storage during the four years with a maximum decrease of water equivalent depth of 125 17 mm nov 2002 149 15 mm nov 2015 and 132 38 mm aug 2002 in the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively fig 3 c 4 c and 5 c the corresponding water volume deficit for these river basins was 39 15 km3 37 99 km3 and 18 74 km3 respectively cumulative tws deficit i e the sum of monthly wsd negative value only during the study period was maximum in mahanadi 4467 05 mm followed by krishna 4371 21 mm and godavari 4033 12 mm river basins to quantify the water depletion during the drought years and the subsequent recovery volumes we analyzed the cumulative water storage deficits wsd fig 6 cumulative tws in all three basins captured the downward trend in response to the meteorological drought of years 2002 and 2004 with a continuous prolonged tws depletion in godavari and krishna but two separate deficit periods in mahanadi river basin a monthly tws loss rate of 15 jul 2002 to nov 2005 14 sep 2002 to jul 2005 and 8 km3 aug 2002 to jul 2003 was observed in the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins tws recovered from jul 2003 to jun 2004 3 km3 month 1 in mahanadi river basin when it again started depleting until nov 2005 recovery in tws started from mid to late 2005 in the krishna and godavari river basis with a monthly gain rate of 13 and 9 km3 respectively the meteorological drought of the year 2009 started appearing in the godavari river basin from may 2008 until june 2010 and resulted in a tws loss of 10 km3 month 1 which recovered by late 2011 with 13 km3 month 1 the krishna river basin showed a tws surplus even after receiving the rainfall deficit of 20 from the long term average which had ultimately resulted in the century scale drought in the year 2009 hazra et al 2013 it implies that subsurface storage was sufficient in the region to meet various water demands the water was sustainably used which resulted in an average monthly recovery of 13 km3 from jul 2005 to march 2012 followed by a stable tws until apr 2015 on the contrary the mahanadi river basin experienced two events of average monthly water depletion 3 and 7 km3 and recovery 4 and 7 km3 each from jun 2004 to aug 2015 which cumulatively had a balance after showing stable dynamics of tws during the year 2012 tws in the godavari river basin further recovered by 30 km3 month 1 until jun 2017 with a loss rate of 5 km3 during sept 2015 jun 2016 cumulative tws is decreasing in the krishna river basin 12 km3 and in the mahanadi river basin 5 km3 but increasing in the godavari river basin 11 km3 during the year 2016 2017 3 2 soil moisture variations figs 3 b 4 b and 5 b portray the simulation outputs of soil moisture storage anomalies smsa in the three river basins from the pcr globwb model which fully integrates the human water use and the dynamic water balance with compartments of gws and routes surface water a quicker response to the climatic factors precipitation evapotranspiration and temperature can be seen in smsa as compared to gwsa and twsa the long term piecewise trends in the combined time series of smsa from july 2002 until june 2010 were negative for all basins viz the godavari 3 57 mm yr 1 krishna 0 76 mm yr 1 and mahanadi 7 77 mm yr 1 river basins table s3 smsa showed a declining trend of 10 06 mm yr 1 10 76 mm yr 1 and 10 51 mm yr 1 for the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively from july 2010 until june 2017 the decrease in sms in this period accounted for 96 6 34 8 and 55 9 of the reduction of tws table 2 thus indicating sms as a significant contributor to twsa in the godavari river basin the signatures of the drought events were also reflected in smsa but with dampened magnitudes than twsa which can be attributed to the apparent reason that the smsa contributes partially to twsa the various water storage components smsa and swsa estimated from the pcr globwb 2 0 model may be affected by uncertainties and error propagation due to model spin up and initial conditions model structure and capacity and forcing parameters the krishna river basin experienced relatively less frequent deficit events in sms than the other two basins figs 3 6 effects of all the meteorological droughts of 2002 2004 2009 and 2011 are not evident consistently in all three basins in response to these droughts a volumetric water loss of 7 3 5 and 2 km3 month 1 was observed in the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively from mid 2002 to mid 2003 a stable dynamic 1 km3 month 1 is observed in each basin during 2004 like the tws the effect of the 2009 drought appeared in the godavari basin as early as jun 2008 and lasted up to late 2009 with a monthly depletion of 2 5 km3 krishna and mahanadi river basins showed stable and decreasing rates 2 km3 in sms during the drought year 2009 after that sms in the krishna basin continuously recovered until jun 2011 while godavari and mahanadi basins experienced multiple events of losses and recoveries until mid 2014 which cumulatively balanced sms in all three basins has been decreasing with 4 5 2 km3 month 1 starting from may 2014 jun 2011 and sept 2014 in the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively fig 6 3 3 trends in gwsa and its role during dry years the anomalies of gws gwsa showed seasonality throughout the study period in all three river basins figs 3 b 4 b and 5 b this seasonality is summarized by calculating the mean monthly ws components throughout the study period fig 9 which will be discussed in section 3 6 it is also apparent that gwsa showed a phase lag of 1 3 months throughout the observation period due to the delay in groundwater recharge figs 3 b 4 b 5 b and 9 smaller amplitudes of gwsa compared to sms can be attributed to the smaller influence of climatic factors the limited storage change by groundwater recharge and the high groundwater withdrawal during the non monsoon seasons typically from october to may gwsa showed a minimal decline in the godavari river basin at the rate of 0 34 mm yr 1 equivalent water volume of 0 74 km3 and comparatively higher rates of 20 18 mm yr 1 eq water vol of 35 98 km3 and 8 3 mm yr 1 eq water vol of 8 23 km3 in the krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively during the period from july 2010 to june 2017 table 2 the loss of gw storage in the three basins accounted for 3 29 65 2 and 44 1 of the loss in total water storage respectively making gws the least contributor to tws in the godavari river basin and the highest contributor in the krishna river basin gws well captures the meteorological drought signatures in the study region with largely similar behavior to tws the impact of climatic factors e g precipitation is dampened in the groundwater storage which had resulted in the time lag in the onset of deficits and recoveries in gws as compared to sms or tws figs 3 6 there is gws depletion starting from mid 2002 until late 2005 and early 2006 with an approximate volumetric loss rate of 15 14 and 4 km3 month 1 in the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively fig 6 followed by the recovery however gws could not be recovered fully when it started to decrease again in late 2008 towards early 2011 for the godavari and mahanadi river basins as an exception the krishna river basin did not reveal the influence of the drought in the year 2009 the godavari river basin experienced a continuous recovery of gws with a mean rate of 11 km3 month 1 from jul 2010 while the krishna and mahanadi river basins showed decreasing gws rates of 7 km3 month 1 and 4 km3 month 1 respectively since mid 2015 moreover the time series of monthly gwsa was consistent with the terrestrial water storage tws loss during the water deficit periods figs 3 6 nevertheless the inherent phase lag due to the response of the hydrological system was present in gwsa throughout the period during the period of meteorological droughts it is likely that the water storage dynamics in particular the groundwater dynamics is primarily governed by the anthropogenic influences owing to the increased reliance and hence the withdrawal of gw for domestic and agricultural water demands and resulting irrigation for farmlands in case of meteorological drought years of 2002 2005 2009 and 2015 increased gw extraction for meeting high water demand 61 of irrigation and 80 of drinking water during these periods siebert et al 2010 appears to have determined the prominent dry phase centering the drought years and hence govern the interannual variability of twsa r 0 7 0 8 the coinciding of the maximum deficits in gwsa with that of twsa showed that the gw extractions primarily govern the water storage conditions during these dry years groundwater storage deficits gwsa wsd in fig 3 c 4 c and 5 c show the below average groundwater storage during the four drought years with a maximum decrease of water depth of 120 47 mm oct 2004 117 61 mm jan 2005 and 139 01 mm aug 2002 and the corresponding water volume loss of 37 68 km3 29 96 km3 and 19 68 km3 in the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively moreover the cumulative negative deficits in gws wsd during the study period were 3843 8 mm 3677 3 mm and 3863 02 mm which comprised 95 30 84 12 and 86 5 of the total deficit based on twsa tws wsd for the three basins respectively on the other hand soil moisture storage based wsd sms wsd made up 37 9 40 1 and 33 6 of the cumulative negative tws deficits in the three basins hence we can conclude that the groundwater plays a significant role in terrestrial water storage and therefore in the water availability during the dry periods in all basins 3 4 comparison of observed and grace derived gwsa for comparing gwsa estimated from eq 4 gwsaest with that from eq 1 using the in situ records gwsaobs we analyzed the time series of gwsaest and gwsaobs at four times a year when the in situ record of the groundwater wells is available january may august and november fig 7 for consistency we accumulated the precipitation in four seasons i e june august monsoon september november post monsoon december january post monsoon and february may pre monsoon fig 7 gwsaobs was compared with gwsaest using various statistical approaches table 3 gwsaest agreed favorably well with gwsaobs in terms of seasonal phase and the amplitude dynamics the maxima of both series occur in august monsoon season or november post monsoon season and the minima occur in may pre monsoon or summer season rmse between both the time series increases as the basin area decreases and follows the order mahanadi 65 45 mm krishna 54 79 mm godavari 54 74 mm similar to the observations in various parts of the world long et al 2016 shamsudduha et al 2012 strassberg et al 2007 the grace based estimates of gwsa showed a strong linear correlation with the observed gwsa as indicated by pearson correlation r with the highest in the krishna river basin r 0 91 and the lowest in the mahanadi river basin r 0 86 which depicts the high potential of the satellite for estimating the basin scale groundwater storage the scatter plots and linear fits shown in fig 8 represent that gwsaest followed a similar gradient to gwsaobs gwsaest gwsaobs 1 0 53 0 55 for all three basins the negative values of skewness and high kurtosis values 2 for all the basins depicted the data asymmetry and the heavier tails in the data series a strong monotone relationship between gswaobs and gswaest as indicated by spearman s rank correlation coefficient ρ 0 85 implies that the observed gwsa was in phase with the estimated gwsa moreover on an annual scale gwsaest and gswaobs agreed well and both showed no significant decreasing trend since 2002 implying the sustainable use of groundwater resources for various purposes the assumption of uniform aquifer thickness and physical properties and the uneven distribution of groundwater observation wells fig 1 accounts for the difference in the estimated and observed gwsa table 3 long et al 2016 moreover the observation wells do not represent the exact gws in the representative area at any time which adds errors in the observed time series of gwsa overall the high correlation among both the series provides confidence in the synergetic application of grace data pcr globwb model simulation and in situ groundwater data observed gwsa was relatively constant during both the decline and recovery period compared to the estimated gwsa probably due to the loss of nonrenewable water deep aquifers and the response lag compared to the real time record by grace a few times in monsoon and post season e g during 2002 and 2005 in the godavari and krishna river basins and during 2002 and 2015 in mahanadi river basin comparatively more rise in observed gwsa than in estimated gwsa fig 7 can be explained by the local flood impacts on the open wells after the drought in 2009 the krishna river basin showed a high recovery in the estimated gwsa fig 7 which can most likely be explained by the non negative condition of twsa wsd in preceding years and continuous recharge of water from soil moisture storage to the deeper aquifers the higher amplitude variations in the gwsaest may be partially attributed to the propagation of uncertainties in the modeled soil moisture storage either due to the model s physical structure or due to the uncertainties in the forcing variables to the pcr globwb model rodell et al 2007 continuously developing the pcr globwb model and the grace fo data with higher accuracy availability of the soil moisture data from the ground based sensors enhanced temporal and spatial continuity in the groundwater data may reduce the amplitude gap between gwsaobs and gwsaest in future studies 3 5 intra annual distribution of water storage fluxes the average monthly values of ws components and net precipitation p et were calculated for each river basin for the period from july 2002 to june 2017 fig 9 while the mean monthly net precipitation was the largest in july twsa exhibits the maximum in september or october the mean monthly values for constituent components of tws maximize in august or september for smsa and in november for gwsa the magnitude of maximum mean monthly ws components was the largest in twsa followed by smsa and the smallest in gwsa for all three river basins three notable inferences are drawn for each ws component during the indian monsoon season 1 the dominant climatic factor i e net precipitation flux apparently governs the dynamics of water storage in all three basins during the monsoon season june october since the peaks in mean monthly values of all ws components occurred within a specific range of time lag from the peak of net precipitation flux since there is a surplus of available water the irrigation activities by abstracted gw are likely to be almost absent in this season thus making the net precipitation flux a major contributor to the variation of smsa fig 9 the gradual decrease in temperature during the monsoon season fig s2 leading to reduced evapotranspiration further facilitates the recovery of ws components fig 9 it must be noted here that the actual timing of the indian monsoon varies by 1 2 weeks within this study region which is highly unlikely to affect our conclusions based on a long decadal assessment 2 during december to march april i e the post monsoon season tws declined at a faster rate that is mostly attributed to declining gws due to climatic and anthropogenic factors this declining behavior can be explained on one side by the minimal and highly heterogeneous precipitation and increased air temperature and evapotranspiration and on the other side by the decline of gws due to more frequent than usual irrigation irrigation done before the crop harvesting activities of rabi crops rabi and kharif are two cropping seasons in india during these periods this leads to a continuous decline with a lag until the monsoon arrives in may or june 3 during the pre monsoon season march to may all the ws components reflect the dry environment due to the temperature increase towards the upcoming summer season figs 9 and s2 after that the variable pre monsoon precipitation and minimal or no irrigation activities recover gws slowly the recovery of all ws components becomes steep as the monsoon arrives 3 6 are anthropogenic interventions the main drivers of water storage trends for determining the governing factors of ws dynamics we compared the trends of twsa with the irrigation intensity indicated by the percentage of irrigated areas in the basin tables 1 and 2 the krishna river basin with the highest irrigation intensity of 21 09 showed the highest declining trend in tws 30 95 mm yr 1 on the contrary inconsistency in the relationship between the trends in tws and irrigation intensity for the godavari and mahanadi river basins indicates other influencing factors e g irrigation with surface water therefore to further quantify and isolate the impact of human interventions reservoir management and water abstractions we run pcr globwb no human intervention nhi model scanlon et al 2018 by the model output we quantified the contribution of the human interventions to the trend in twsa as 6 38 mm yr 1 23 56 mm yr 1 and 8 42 mm yr 1 which were equivalent to 61 29 76 12 and 44 76 of the total twsa trend for the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively the difference in trend between the grace derived twsa and that from pcr globwb nhi runs was the highest for the krishna river basin thus ascertaining that the gw extractions govern the tws dynamics in this basin the second highest declining rate of twsa in the mahanadi river basin can be explained by the most negative trend of net precipitation flux table 2 in particular dry warm climate low precipitation and high temperatures and enhanced agricultural activities during the non monsoon season cumulatively make the water balance negative for the river basin furthermore we estimated the trends in climatic variables to compare with those of twsa since no significant relationship was observed between twsa and precipitation r 0 25 0 32 ρ 0 18 0 25 table s4 we estimated the net precipitation fluxes i e p et because the imbalance of water fluxes induces the change in water storage through the boundary of a system as a result of natural and anthropogenic perturbations the net precipitation flux showed negative values during the non monsoon season october to february with a transition during the pre monsoon season march to may and positive during the monsoon season june to september figs 9 and 10 the overall trends in annual total net precipitation are negative i e 2 83 mm yr 1 1 05 mm yr 1 and 3 39 mm yr 1 for the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins respectively during july 2010 to june 2017 which explains about 27 3 and 18 of the total trend of respective twsa table 2 the remaining differences in the twsa were likely due to the underestimation of the water demand by the pcr globwb 2 0 model because instead of the actual water demand of a region it considered the water demand and subsequent allocation based on the auxiliary forcing parameters moreover the highest grace errors in twsa estimation for the smallest basin i e mahanadi can be one reason for the largest difference in trends 37 24 4 conclusion we carried out a basin scale holistic quantification of the water resources dynamics and long term trends under the influence of the human interventions and natural climatic perturbations over the godavari krishna and mahanadi river basins located in peninsular india the current framework can be applied to various river basins globally for a complete quantification of the different components of water storage based on the grace satellite observations the global hydrology and water resources model pcr globwb 2 0 and in situ groundwater observations the long term variation of water storage july 2002 to june 2017 showed a mixed behavior of either increasing or minimally decreasing tws decreasing sms and increasing gws trends in the study region however all the water storage components showed declining trends in recent time july 2010 to june 2017 the water storage deficit analysis revealed that despite the minimal linear trends during july 2002 to june 2017 all three river basins experienced multiple deficit events in response to the cumulative influence of the rainfall deficits and groundwater abstraction the former likely due to enso impacts on the monsoon rainfall the relative contribution of 84 95 by the deficit of groundwater storage to total water storage deficit in the region indicates the excessive groundwater withdrawals relative to the replenishment and underscore the need for multilateral cooperation among the states and the various related stakeholders to wisely integrate the groundwater usage with the surface water availability for irrigation in the region trends and deficits in various water storage components in recent times highlight the need for revising water allocation strategies e g conjunctive water management plan irrigation systems and methods e g switching to drip irrigation and assessment of the governing factors social physical and economic of crop management practices for sustainable management to ensure optimum and equitable future water supply the meteorological drought events are well captured by the time series of tws and gws in the region albeit with the lags in various water storage components these signatures of drought events representing the integrated as well as disaggregated water availability in various components highlight the potential for efficient irrigation scheduling and effective quantification of the water deficit conditions that are not commonly visible leading to a timely evolution of the deficit severity and efficient measures of mitigation and adaption furthermore very good agreement r 0 86 0 91 ρ 0 85 0 91 of the grace derived groundwater anomalies with those estimated from in situ groundwater well data reveal that the grace products could potentially be used for quantifying gws and for subsequent basin scale hydrological implications the current study puts forward a blueprint for managing the basin scale water resources and food security more timely and efficiently we believe that the water deficit conditions revealed in this study will foster urgent discussions towards ensuring sustainable water use in the three basins the proposed framework for quantifying the surface and subsurface water resources dynamics complements the little existing knowledge on the basin scale water storage the potential areas of the future work within and beyond the current study region include the use of the currently operational grace fo mission launched on may 22 2018 which will cover more period compared to grace using the improved land surface models output or the ground based soil moisture data subject to the availability which will be conjunctively used with the improved pcr globwb model to eliminate the model related

4692,as rice production is water intensive establishing an accurate field scale water budget is paramount for sustainable use of local water resources this study s goal was to quantify and characterize half hourly and seasonal evapotranspiration et in two commercial zero grade rice fields in the u s mid south over three growing seasons during each growing season irrigation regimes for the studied fields differed between alternate wetting and drying awd and delayed flooding df the 2015 growing season enabled a direct comparison of the effects of awd and df on et while during the 2016 and 2017 seasons both fields were simultaneously under awd and df respectively the df method is the region s most common irrigation practice and it prescribes a continuous flood to be maintained for the majority of the growing season after the plants have reached the 5 leaf growth stage 40 50 days after planting in contrast after holding this initial flooding for 3 weeks awd allows for field drying to promote the capture of seasonal rains to reduce irrigation water withdrawal and associated water pumping costs in this study et was estimated using gap filled eddy covariance observations and two variations of the penman monteith equation these methods determined growing season et values between 560 mm and 636 mm this study found that there were no significant differences in cumulative et or yield when comparing awd to df practices furthermore awd elicited no change in et during periods of drying when compared to df by this metric awd did not induce drought stress within the plants we conclude that the main benefit of the awd practice is to take advantage of seasonal rainfall to offset pumping costs and pressure on irrigation water requirements while maintaining yields comparable to conventional irrigation practices keywords evapotranspiration rice alternate wetting and drying penman monteith eddy covariance 1 introduction water resources are currently consumed at unsustainable rates within the lower mississippi river basin where a majority of rice is grown in the united states kresse et al 2014 reba et al 2013 due to this depletion the region is increasing efforts to conserve water and quantify water use particularly by agricultural irrigation for its sustainable future management reba et al 2017 to promote sustainable water use in rice production various methods and technologies are being applied such as field levelling to zero grade which can reduce irrigation water use by up to 40 henry et al 2016 and multiple inlet irrigation which can reduce water use by up to 24 massey et al 2014 2017 2018 alternate wetting and drying awd is a practice that can potentially reduce irrigation water use by up to 20 by capturing rain during the growing season offsetting pumping costs for the producer carrijo et al 2017 pan et al 2017 lampayan et al 2015 prior to the onset of the initial flood in both awd and delayed flood df practices the rice germinates and establishes in non flooded soils moldenhauer et al 2013 the recommended awd practice allows periodic paddy drying which lasts approximately 5 days to occur at least 3 weeks after the first flooding the conventional df practice maintains a constant flood once the first flood is established until the fields are drained for harvest however the level and timing of drying induced in awd are management decisions based on irrigation infrastructure precipitation forecasting soil type plant variety growth stage and water supply while awd conserves water there are concerns regarding plant health grain quality and decreases in yield compared to conventional growing practices graham acquaah et al 2019 norton et al 2017 sudhir yadav et al 2012 therefore the timing and duration of the dry periods needs careful management awd is also expanding in use because of its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with rice production linquist et al 2015a 2015b 2018 runkle et al 2019 fields managed with awd have the potential to reduce evapotranspiration et when compared to conventionally managed fields due to the decline of available water at the soil surface and alteration of land surface radiative properties which may reduce the amount of open water or soil water evaporation norman et al 1995 liu et al 2019a 2019b however et is typically dominated by the plant mediated release of water transpiration especially during the later portion of the growing season when the rice canopy is fully developed wei et al 2015 2017 the water savings for awd are primarily seen in the capturing of rain events during drying periods ideally the amount of rainfall captured during these events should offset the amount of pumped water required to replace water lost through et kima et al 2015 in rice water budgets and irrigation schedulers producers use et to estimate the amount of water required to sustain crop production without incurring stress li and cui 1996 smith 1992 understanding how et changes throughout the growing season also provides an indication of canopy health moran et al 1995 et is tied to primary production of plant biomass as water release from the plant is regulated by stomatal control which helps dictate assimilation of carbon dioxide within the plant during the daytime ikawa et al 2018 roel et al 1999 wang et al 2020 because awd has the potential to conserve water resources and provide economic benefits to the producer nalley et al 2015 uncertainty within the terms of the water balance including et must be reduced through careful measurement in agricultural settings et is typically estimated using approaches such as the hargreaves or penman monteith equations which rely on meteorological data and basic estimates of phenology allen et al 1998 hargreaves and allen 2003 pereira et al 2015 however studies conducted in rice have indicated sizeable differences when comparing measured et using micrometeorological approaches such as the eddy covariance method and et estimated with variations of the penman monteith equation ikawa et al 2017 wang et al 2017 these approaches include the penman monteith method for actual et pm aet and the penman monteith method as outlined in fao document 56 pm fao56 monteith 1965 penman 1948 allen et al 1998 methods such as the pm aet are of interest as their improvement would provide a platform for relating associated changes in measured et to physically derived relationships between et and multiple meteorological and phenological variables contained within the pm aet many studies have identified areas of improvement for different implementations of the penman monteith equation by focusing on different components including canopy conductance and variable crop coefficients lecina et al 2003 alberto et al 2014 yan et al 2018 a common application of conductance is the big leaf approach that treats conductance as a bulk value across all leaves in the canopy where its parameterization can be completed using only observations of local meteorological variables lai and et observations however single layer conductance models typically underperform in periods of sparse lai 2 vegetation xu et al 2018 lafleur and rouse 1990 dual layer conductance approaches that address canopy and soil as separate contributors to et have been recommended to address the poor performance of the pm aet under sparse vegetation including rice shuttleworth and wallace 1985 facchi et al 2013 studies utilizing both the dual layer and single layer conductance frameworks in rice have shown comparable performance between each approach during the growing season gharsallah et al 2013 liu et al 2020 here we quantify et rates from within two fields in the humid u s mid south and compare awd and df irrigation management practices the primary aim of this study is to better characterize half hourly and seasonal et in this region and identify associated impacts of altering the conventional irrigation regime with respect to et for this aim we test whether fields with awd irrigation show reduced et relative to the df field due to the lack of a free water surface during drying events by quantifying et using different methods across multiple growing seasons we then examine how et changes during drying events to observe the effects drying has on plant activity we assume that during drying events if the plants undergoing awd remain unstressed the differences in transpiration should be negligible because transpiration makes up a large portion of et during the growing season we hypothesize that canopies with similar transpiration rates will show little differences in et once the canopy is established the second aim is to evaluate the performance of two accepted estimation methods in comparison to eddy covariance observations within both df and awd fields across the 2015 17 growing seasons finally we seek to compare crop coefficients derived from local estimates of reference et and eddy covariance to the crop coefficients for rice recommended in the fao 56 document 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study site is composed of two adjacent commercial fields 24 ha each located in eastern arkansas usa 34 35 8 6 n 91 45 05 w the fields have been used to grow rice in continuous rotation since 2004 and are zero graded with no slope within the planted area of the field for this study the fields are identified as north field nf and south field sf the soil within the fields is primarily characterized as poorly drained perry silty clay usda classification very fine smectitic thermic chromic epiaquerts which represents 100 of nf and 93 2 of sf runkle et al 2019 soil survey staff 2018 the remaining portion of sf soil 2 ha is a herbert silt loam fine silty mixed superactive mesic udollic epiaqualfs the composition of the soil varied between nf and sf where nf had greater clay content 62 vs 43 the fields are connected in a series of five similarly sized fields where irrigation water is delivered across each field moving north to south before arriving at the desired field the rice was drill seeded and the growers apply the first flood approximately 47 days after planting dap rice grown within the fields in each study year was a hybrid variety clearfield xl745 ricetec inc alvin tx usa and followed the typical growing season for rice in arkansas from early april to september the 2015 2017 growing seasons for nf and sf ranged 133 143 days from planting to harvest runkle et al 2019 irrigation during the growing season relies primarily on surface water which travels between fields by gravity flow through pipes and ditches irrigation routes are set up so that water must flow through each field as a series running north to south the irrigation treatments were altered between the three growing seasons table 1 in 2016 seeding was delayed due to wet field conditions and thus the first flood was established later in the summer compared to 2015 and 2017 i e 14 jun vs 14 17 may instrumentation consisted of eddy covariance and biometeorological sensors runkle et al 2019 and was identically installed in both fields these measurements contribute to the ameriflux management project nf us hrc and sf us hra and its subnetwork delta flux for responding to questions on sustainable practices in agriculture runkle et al 2017 due to the homogeneous fetch requirements for the eddy covariance technique the equipment was installed on the northern edge of each field at approximately half the distance of the northern border to capture the dominant southern winds during the growing season and fluxes north of each field were discarded equipment was installed approximately 15 m from the north edge of each field after drill seeding and removed immediately prior to harvest deployment during the growing season normally occurred within 4 days post planting and removal of equipment occurred 2 days prior to harvest fluxes collected at the towers using eddy covariance were screened to include only wind directions between 95 and 265 to ensure measurement footprints were limited to their respective fields gaps within the observed fluxes for all three years were empirically filled using an artificial neural networks approach knox et al 2015 2016 this method used the following explanatory variables days since the start of the study period leaf area index lai plant height friction velocity u air temperature t incoming solar radiation rg in vapor pressure deficit vpd water depth wd and fuzzy transformation sets representing seasonality and time of day see runkle et al 2019 for more details the turbulent energy flux models correlated with observations with r2 values 0 90 2 2 measurement of fluxes microclimate and plant parameters the eddy covariance ec system provided measurements of sensible heat h and latent heat le flux through the net exchange of the scalars temperature and h2o respectively the ec system included a 3d sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa and an open path infrared co2 h2o analyzer li 7500a li cor inc lincoln ne usa the ec system was mounted on a tripod with the sensor height measuring 2 2 m above the surface of the rice field separation for the ec sensors was approximately 0 1 m and was accounted for with frequency correction factors and signal lagging including flow distortion by transducer shadowing horst et al 2015 described in runkle et al 2019 and suvočarev et al 2019 the ec components used a designated analyzer interface unit li 7550 li cor inc lincoln ne usa with outputs recorded at 20 hz and half hourly fluxes calculated with eddypro v 6 2 software with the output including calculated flux quality flags and an analysis of the flux footprint throughout the growing season fluxes were screened based on multiple factors including turbulence dominant wind direction southern winds footprint size and availability based on power failures the flux footprint was used to only include periods where 90 of the data was measured within 350 m of the tower to remove the effects of measurement drift across adjacent fields runkle et al 2019 the resulting data coverage for half hourly sensible and latent heat fluxes after filtering ranged between 23 and 34 across the growing periods the four components of net radiation rn were measured cnr4 kipp zonen inc delft nl at a height of 2 0 m incoming and outgoing photosynthetically active radiation par was also measured using quantum sensors li 190sb li cor inc lincoln ne usa at 1 85 m air temperature t and relative humidity rh were measured using a shielded probe hmp155a vaisala helsinki fi in addition to the sonic anemometer wind speed and direction were also measured using a 2 d anemometer mounted at 3 2 m 05103 5 propeller wind monitor r m young traverse city mi usa soil heat flux g measurements were collected using two soil heat flux plates hfp01 hukseflux delft nl placed at different depths in each year 8 cm 5 cm and 4 cm below the soil surface for the 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively soil heat flux plate measurements were corrected for the stored energy in both soil and water column using soil surface temperature and water temperature thermistor measurements cs 107 betatherm 100k6a1ia campbell scientific inc logan ut usa thermistors were placed directly at the soil surface 2 cm above each soil heat flux plate and on a flotation device to capture the temperature of the changing flood level the energy balance closure ebc as reported in runkle et al 2019 was calculated using sensible and latent heat flux from the ec towers rn and storage corrected g at the half hourly time step for the 2015 2017 growing seasons the ebc for nf was 0 73 0 75 and 0 69 respectively and 0 89 0 69 and 0 82 for sf respectively volumetric water content measurements were collected using soil moisture time domain transmissometer probes sdi 12 acclima sydney au at 8 cm and 15 cm for all fields during all growing seasons measurements of wd were collected continuously using a piezometric sensor series 46x keller usa inc fort mill sc usa vented for automatic compensation for barometric pressure changes installed 30 cm from the tower in a perforated tube reaching approximately 30 cm below the soil surface other field parameters including plant density and soil bulk density were collected manually at different times during the growing season runkle et al 2019 bulk density and soil temperature above the soil heat flux plate were used in conjunction with wd measurements to correct for changes in heat storage in the water and saturated soil matrix above the plate during flooded and dry conditions fuchs and tanner 1968 runkle et al 2019 2 3 leaf area index lai and canopy height model to characterize changing canopy conditions and provide necessary inputs for the penman monteith approach and ec processing canopy height measurements were collected throughout the growing season and averaged across 10 measurements during each field excursion approx twice monthly but less frequently in 2016 see below because of high crop uniformity canopy height measurements were taken only within 30 m of the ec station and represented the height from the soil surface to the height of the canopy top at eye level ignoring flag leaves lai was measured at similar intervals using a plant canopy analyzer lai 2200c li cor inc lincoln ne usa averaging three samples taken within 30 m of the ec tower per measurement period typically sampling for lai did not begin until the canopy achieved a measurable level of growth usually 50 60 dap when the canopy height was approximately 0 5 m we estimated lai and canopy height throughout the growing season with a growing degree day gdd model yang et al 1995 this approach uses gdd as the cumulative sum of the differences between the mean daily temperature tmean daily and a base temperature tbase in this setting tbase was set as 10 c to represent the minimum temperature for growth and development in rice keisling et al 1984 lai and canopy height data were collected through field measurements during the 2015 2017 growing seasons in both the nf and sf lai observations were complemented with modis terra am satellite lai mod15a2h myneni et al 2015 to remedy gaps in field measurements and improve model timing regarding canopy development the modis data provided information about rice canopy dynamics most notably the transition to a phase of rapid growth approximately 45 dap as the rice canopy transitioned from the vegetative to reproductive stages the 1 km modis pixel encompassed vegetation from both studied fields fig 1 the area surrounding the experimental fields are also rice paddies with similar phenological development for the 2015 and 2017 growing seasons field observations collected with the lai 2200c n 8 and n 13 respectively were necessary to model lai as a linear and quadratic function of gdd during the early and rapid growth stages respectively in contrast only two field observations n 2 of lai were collected during the 2016 growing season in the early growth period to compensate for lack of data in 2016 in that year the modi5ah2 lai product was used to estimate lai myneni et al 2015 to correct for the modis lai product s consistent under estimation bias up to 20 determined in 2015 and 2017 the modis data points used to model lai during the 2016 growing season were adjusted using a scaling factor this factor was estimated using a regression slope between measured data points and the modis data at the same time period for each field across the 2015 2017 growing seasons the scaling factors slopes for each field were then applied to their respective modis data to generate a sufficient n 5 set of lai data that could be used to identify linear and quadratic growth periods with respect to gdd during the 2016 growing season a similar approach was applied to canopy height where field data were collected and modeled based on the period of the growing season canopy height measurements were collected during the 2015 2017 growing seasons for each field within the study nf and sf the same approach used to model lai before and after the transition from vegetative to reproductive stages was applied to canopy height where the growth patterns before and after this transition were considered to be linear and quadratic respectively in relation to gdd 2 4 methods for modeling et the pm aet is based on meteorological data and information about plant development the combination eq 1 is based on the latent energy requirement for evaporating water and the deficit of vapor pressure necessary for removing water it also accounts for the resistances for transpiring the water from plant tissue and transporting it away from the crop canopy it was used to evaluate data collected in real time from both fields at the 30 min time step 1 λ e t δ r n g c p ρ a v p d r a δ γ 1 r s r a where λ is the latent heat of vaporization 2 45 mj kg 1 e t is evapotranspiration mm day

height of wind speed see appendix a δ is the slope of vapor pressure temperature relationship kpa c 1 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 determined as 6 65 10 3 patm atm the pm aet can be used to estimate stomatal conductance using ec data through inversion and is also one of the few methods that can generate an et estimate at the half hourly time scale using only meteorological data the pm fao56 method eq 2 generates daily estimates of reference et eto mm day 1 from a reference crop a short well watered grass and the crop et mm day 1 is calculated using dimensionless crop coefficients 2 e t c e t 0 k c 0 408 δ r n g γ c n t 273 v p d u 2 m δ γ 1 c d u 2 m k c where e t c is crop evapotranspiration mm day 1 e t 0 is reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 t is mean daily air temperature at 2 0 m height c u2m is wind speed at 2 0 m height m s 1 cd and cn are coefficients based on canopy development for a theoretical crop at 0 12 m in height and kc is the crop coefficient for converting e t 0 to rice canopy et each rice development stage has a corresponding crop coefficient according to tabulated fao56 values the crop coefficients for rice grown in a humid environment with moderately high wind speed 2 m s 1 are equal to 1 05 1 20 and 0 9 for the initial mid season and late season periods of the growing season respectively the lengths of time used to define the initial developmental mid season and late season stages of rice crop growth are 30 30 80 and 40 days respectively the tabulated rice crop coefficients given were also derived from the water seeded rice practice where rice was deposited directly into pre flooded paddies based on the identical recommended values 1 05 for coefficient kc ini and open water surfaces for this method several assumptions were made in relation to the reference evapotranspiration and g reference evapotranspiration requires measurements taken from a representative plot that adheres to fao 56 standards so that all other assumptions inherent to the model hold for representativeness of the evaporative demand of the atmosphere the local usda weather station in stuttgart ar 20 km to east of site surrounded by similar agricultural fields provided measurements of t rh u3m and rg in the wind speed measurements from the weather station were corrected to u2m using the logarithmic wind speed profile approach outlined in fao56 additional components of rn were estimated using missing climate data methods outlined in fao 56 based on the location of the site as well as the day of year daily ground heat flux g is assumed by fao 56 to average to zero at the daily time step the crop coefficient was also adjusted using modeled canopy height and relative humidity as outlined in fao 56 chapter 6 to account for differences between the field site and the sites used to derive the recommended crop coefficients allen et al 1998 both the recommended and adjusted crop coefficients were compared to the observed crop coefficients at our field site 2 5 estimating and modeling canopy conductance canopy conductance gc is a key term within the pm aet model that reflects biological mediation of the exchange of gases between the rice canopy and the surrounding atmosphere to estimate gc within each experimental field site the pm aet model was inverted eq 3 to solve for gc using observed non gap filled ec measurements of et etec for the evapotranspiration term 3 g c λ e t e c γ g a δ r n g c p p a e s e a g a λ e t e c δ γ values of estimated gc were limited to periods with positive etec the estimated gc in these half hour intervals was used to parameterize a model eqs 4 8 which utilized both meteorological and biological inputs to predict estimates of gc in a jarvis style approach jarvis et al 1976 xu et al 2017 ershadi et al 2015 gardiol et al 2003 surface conductance gs was determined through gs gc laiactive 1 where laiactive determined with eq 8 represents the active fraction of lai m2 m

i 2 2 l a i 4 4 l a i where a 1 a 2 a 3 are fitted parameters and g s m a x is the maximum surface conductance the laiactive scales from gs to gc to incorporate the effects of canopy development and associated driving forces on surface conductance across the rice canopy collatz et al 1991 leuning et al 1995 the use of laiactive follows the big leaf approach for modeling conductance across landscapes zhang et al 2008 li et al 2016 xu et al 2017 to prevent uneven weighting of lai and contributing plant transpiration the laiactive parameter was assigned to have a value of unity during the early growing season when surface evaporation would be most pronounced in et maximum surface conductance gs max was determined as the maximum gs observation in a 7 day moving window across the entire growing season negative and pseudo infinite values gs 104 mm s 1 were removed as well as values when incoming r g i n radiation was 30 w m 2 for calibration and validation of the model we conducted a random selection of the data across all six site years for each step the calibration dataset represented 70 of the total dataset while the model and parameters were validated using the remaining 30 the parameters for the conductance model were optimized using nonlinear regression of measured and modeled et and assessed by the slope r2 and rmse of the regression the parameters were calculated using nonlinear least squares regression between measured et and modeled et while fitting gc with parameters a1 a2 and a3 thus any uncertainty in the biometeorological inputs in addition to measured et was also transmitted to the conductance term the conductance parameterization only utilized data taken from 40 dap and during the daytime period 8 am to 6 pm local time to ensure that conductance terms were not estimated with influence from periods when the rice canopy was less likely to impact et 2 6 comparison and analysis of et observations to better understand impacts related to differences in irrigation treatment we directly compared simultaneous et observations non gap filled to other biometeorological factors the variables tested included meteorological drivers in the penman monteith equation such as available energy and vpd and variables tied to the soil conditions in each field including volumetric water content vwc and wd modeled canopy height and lai were included in this analysis to account for canopy differences ratios of h to rn were analyzed over the growing season to better understand how shifts in et and canopy development affect the partitioning of available energy within the field energy balance cumulative estimates of et were compared across growing seasons and irrigation treatments the number of days missed due to the instrument deployment and pre harvest removal averaged 6 5 and 2 days across both fields for the 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively the estimates of cumulative et were also normalized by dap to calculate a seasonal et rate absent of bias incurred by differences in growing season length the 2015 growing season was the only growing season where the effects of drying could be compared using simultaneous observations between both fields throughout the entire growing season in 2016 and 2017 both fields were kept under the same irrigation management making it impossible to directly compare simultaneous et observations during drying events occurring in a single field instead comparisons for the 2016 and 2017 growing season provided an opportunity to observe the effects of drying by comparing periods where both fields were either wet or dry to determine the relative impacts of drying events during each month of the growing season to assess the impacts of drying events on et analysis of covariance ancova was used to determine if et was significantly different between fields when one was wet and the other was dry using wd measured in both fields the comparison was conducted on a monthly basis where wet wddf 0 wdawd 0 and dry wddf 0 wdawd 0 categories served as the groupings for et where the subscripts indicate the respective field irrigation treatment to remain consistent with other comparisons between fields this analysis was limited to measurements taken during the daytime 8 am 6 pm local time for the purposes of this paper we define a drying event as any period after initial flooding where wd in a field falls below the soil surface for at least 24 h the analysis was also limited to awd drying periods meaning any data prior to initial flooding and after the beginning of final drainage was not included comparisons between the modeled and observed et were used to evaluate model performance using residuals analysis residuals from regressions between modeled and observed et were compared to both meteorological and phenological variables within the respective fields to identify periods of higher and lower model performance the approach would also determine what input variables are critical in determining et in the u s mid south production setting as well as identifying variables that could be associated with differences between observed and modeled et moreover comparing performance across both pm methods allows a test of which methods are better suited for estimating et and understanding dynamics of et with respect to the local biometeorology for the pm fao56 method comparisons between modeled and observed values were limited to days where 40 of the original ec data between 8 am and 6 pm were missing before gap filling using the ann procedure this measure was taken to limit the impact of completely gap filled days while preventing uneven weighting within the non gap filled data set due to quality control based on turbulence and instrumentation limits 3 results 3 1 meteorological observations across all growing seasons the nf and sf sites maintained a mean daily temperature of 24 5 c with values ranging between 10 c early april and 36 c mid july mean daily relative humidity was 80 with values ranging 22 100 during the early growing season april and may and 40 100 during the mid late growing season june august after the flood was applied the mean daily vpd ranged between 0 5 and 1 7 kpa with maximum values exceeding 2 5 kpa during the daytime period 8 am 6 pm local time with peak values typically occurring between 4 pm and 6 pm wind

june and early july and maximum values typically occurred between 12 h and 14 h comparisons to the 30 year 1981 2010 average showed that monthly mean temperatures were always within 2 c of normal runkle et al 2019 comparison of precipitation during the growing season months of april to august showed that all three growing seasons were wetter than the 30 year normal of 492 mm with 505 mm in 2015 627 mm in 2016 and 868 mm in 2017 for all three measurement seasons 40 60 of the growing season precipitation occurred in april and may 3 2 canopy height and lai by comparing modis data to collected lai data we were able to determine a shift from slow to rapid canopy growth after emergence and the initial vegetative growth stages fig 2 due to different planting dates this transition date varied among growing seasons occurring between 40 and 50 dap maximum lai was achieved in the sf at 103 89 and 99 dap and 103 89 and 94 dap in the nf during the 2015 2017 growing seasons respectively maximum lai for the three respective growing seasons was 5 4 6 5 and 5 6 for the sf and 4 5 5 5 and 4 5 for the nf respectively relative to other years modis data for 2016 indicated a more rapid early growth and higher peak in lai while we do not have lai 2200c measurements in this year the canopy height measurements also show higher values for the 2015 2017 growing seasons maximum canopy height was reached between 111 and 124 dap for sf and between 109 and 130 days for nf fig 3 maximum canopy height for nf and sf ranged between 0 95 and 1 32 m and 0 93 1 24 m respectively similar to observed lai the 2016 growing season had a taller canopy during the latter portion of the growing season when the canopy was fully developed the timing of peak canopy height varied as well occurring between 105 and 118 dap across nf and sf respectively based on our estimates of phenological development both peak lai and peak canopy height occurred near the end of the r4 reproductive growth stage and the beginning of grain filling 3 3 growing season et estimates and dynamics in 2015 2017 the observed and gap filled growing season et ranged from 560 to 636 mm across the three growing seasons in both fields table 2 the 2015 growing season showed the lowest cumulative et across both fields from planting to harvest the lengths of the growing season were comparable between the fields i e from 0 to 2 days difference wd varied throughout each growing season especially in the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons where awd was applied to at least one field fig 4 for the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons drying events lasted between 2 and 7 days when irrigation was interrupted and the flood water was evaporated the minimum wd during drying events ranged between 2 and 30 cm below the soil surface prior to re flooding the soil moisture sensors at 15 cm below the soil surface indicated up to a 33 percentage point reduction saturation to minimum vwc in vwc during drying events volumetric water content measured during drying events in both fields during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons did not fall below 20 compared to 58 soil moisture at saturation during inundation the producers reestablished the flood based on presumed soil dryness and observed decline in the water depth corresponding to a wd of between 25 and 30 cm below the soil surface measured at the ec tower using the gap filled eddy covariance observations cumulative growing season et was calculated for nf and sf for the 2015 2017 growing seasons table 2 there were no clear relationships between irrigation treatment and estimated daily et rate as awd and df fields produced overlapping ranges of estimated daily et rates during the 2015 2017 growing seasons there were also no distinguishing patterns when only looking at the daytime et therefore irrigation regime did not seem to play a major factor in determining growing season et for nf and sf during the 2015 2017 growing seasons fields under awd management averaged 609 mm while fields under df management averaged 595 mm which were not significantly different in relation to cumulative seasonal precipitation across both fields during the growing season et exceeded growing season precipitation in 2015 and 2016 by as much as 20 while only accounting for up to 78 of growing season precipitation in 2017 when precipitation events were unusually frequent however the precipitation event dynamics did not match the crop water requirements and some irrigation applications were necessary to regulate the flood levels next we compared treatments at the half hourly time step to test the effects of awd and df on et across both fields for the 2015 2017 growing seasons using ann gap filled half hourly et the period of observation was limited to daytime values between 8 am and 6 pm to prevent uneven weighting from nighttime periods this comparison also confirms despite having different irrigation regimes there were no significant differences in et during the 2015 growing season fig 5 comparisons of et measured in 2016 and 2017 when both fields were in the same irrigation treatment showed similar results as well in addition these results did not change significantly when only observed values i e not gap filled data were used for comparison nf showed consistently similar le compared to sf in 2016 nf had slightly higher et based on a linear regression slope of 0 96 the slopes of each regression were significant with the slope standard error across all three comparisons never exceeding 0 00042 for comparisons between nf and sf across 2015 2017 rmse ranged between 1 02 and 1 68 mm day 1 with a majority of the divergence occurring earlier in the growing season the divergence in et during the early growing season when the soil water or water evaporation components dominate the et process was due to different planting and flooding schedules for each field events where one field was flooded first before the other indicate higher et and these events are especially common during the early growing season e g the cluster of points in fig 5c extending to 16 mm day 1 in nf and 8 mm day 1 in sf typically once the canopy was established the fields converged in terms of et and continued to do so through closure until they were drained for harvest based on our observations development and closure of the rice canopy clearly reduced the impact of factors of change in et between both fields including factors related to their respective irrigation treatments such as water level or soil moisture there were no significant differences in the measured rn between nf and sf across all three growing seasons the majority of et was driven by rn with the ratio of le to rn throughout the growing seasons ranging between 0 71 and 0 85 for individual months particularly july and august le measured between 55 and 75 of rn while in early periods of the growing season april and may le ranged between 24 and 51 of rn the ratio of h to rn consistently decreased from the beginning of the growing season until pre harvest draining when the ratio of h to rn increased in most cases given that the variation of rn was minimal during the growing season this decrease in the ratio of h to rn was most likely due to the increase in le associated with flooding canopy development and greater amounts of transpiration 3 4 effects of awd on et in eddy covariance observations in order to test the effect of awd on et variation due to changing flood water availability for evaporation parts of the 2015 growing season with drying events in sf and inundation in nf field were used to compare the simultaneous et values the length of drying events was consistently around 1 week our results indicate that prior to canopy development and closure specifically in may 2015 when dry and wet conditions were being compared directly there is a significant difference p 0 05 in measured et table 3 while there were significant differences in et these drying events were not carried out as part of an awd treatment as the first permanent flood had yet to be established in may 2015 the slope of 0 91 indicates that drying period et was 9 greater in the inundated nf compared to the non flooded conditions in sf during this period both fields did not have a developed canopy and only one drying event had occurred while we do not consider the significant differences in et to be a direct result of the awd treatment in nf analysis between the residuals taken from the initial field to field regression and the declining wd in sf indicated that the drying significantly explained only up to 5 of et residual variance all other months during the 2015 growing season indicated no significant difference in observed et across all hydrological conditions and declining wd in the drying field was unable to explain any significant differences observed in et between nf and sf we suspect that differences occurring early in the growing season are substantially influenced by precipitation as well in altering the plant canopy response with respect to et additionally in this farm setting precipitation can be managed in a way that water is actively drained between fields along a designated flow path nf to sf to prevent unsuitable growth conditions for the crop during early growth stages the canopy development stages explain the convergence of et between the two fields and the inability of changes in wd to explain significant differences in et during the latter portion of the growing season because both canopies were similar in structure and showed no decreases in yield associated with drying events in 2015 we can conclude that plant mediated transpiration was likely similar in both fields as the canopy continued to develop the contributing portion of transpiration to et increased resulting in similar et rates across both fields when the canopy was fully closed and developed canopy cover also likely exercised control over open water surface evaporation through shading meaning the contributing portion of evaporation to et likely decreased as well this would result in insensitivity to et and differences between fields with respect to water level in 2016 and 2017 there were no periods where only one field was dry since both fields were treated in awd and df respectively the columns in table 3 for these years are therefore during periods when both are dry during the 2016 slopes from the all wet case did not significantly differ from slopes in the all dry case across the growing season under both conditions nf appeared to always have greater et compared to sf despite both fields undergoing the same treatment measured et between both fields seemed to agree more during dry periods but these slopes were not significantly different from their wet counterpart during each individual month in 2017 when both fields were managed with df throughout the entire growing season the comparison indicated no significant differences in slopes from the comparison between wet and dry periods flooded conditions made it impossible to perform dry period analysis in june and july of 2017 as well based on the observations in 2016 2017 we can infer wetting and drying did not play a significant role in influencing differences in et across both fields meaning the field effect based on changing wd does not play a consistent significant role in our et comparisons this finding supports our observation of similar et between fields regardless of wd management across all growing seasons the change in slope between nf and sf et rates also indicated that the fields continued to converge on similar et as the canopy developed during the growing season as the slope drew nearer to a value of 1 with each successive month given that both fields were treated using the same irrigation method in 2016 and 2017 this similarity was expected and supports the concept of decreasing impacts of changing wd and associated soil water evaporation throughout the growing season as canopy transpiration dominates the et flux 3 5 modeling canopy conductance for the 2015 2017 growing seasons canopy conductance estimated using eddy covariance measurements for le and the inverted penman monteith equation was estimated using the full 2015 2017 dataset including both nf and sf maximum applied surface conductance from the 7 day moving window ranged between 8 and 70 mm s 1 across both fields for the 2015 2017 growing seasons with peak values occurring during periods characterized by increased canopy height and lai parameterization was performed for individual site seasons and across all six site years combined the parameters and standard error were estimated for each growing season as well as the combined period of all growing seasons table 4 3 6 modeling et for the 2015 2017 growing seasons using pm aet after parameterization with 70 of the data during calibration with data from across all six field seasons the calibrated model performed well against the remaining data as a validation set the parameterized pm equation estimated half hourly et with high correlation r2 0 84 m 1 0 0015 mm day 1 rmse 2 12 mm day 1 during daytime periods of the growing season across all six site years within each individual growing season model performance was varied across each irrigation comparison scenario but was still able to explain similar amounts of variance fig 6 analysis of model performance across the growing season indicated that the largest portion of variance between model and observation was during the early portion of the growing season 40 dap when the active fraction of lai was the lowest general performance across all three growing seasons was inconsistent as the model both overestimates et by 2 in 2015 and 2016 and underestimates et by 12 in 2017 during the 2017 growing season there was greater precipitation than 2015 and 2016 which could explain the model s inability to accurately reflect changes in canopy et in response to rain events and an elevated moisture status a two sample t test indicated that mean gs max estimated across 2017 was significantly p 0 05 lower than mean gs max in 2015 and 2016 by as much as 60 3 7 modeling et for the 2015 2017 growing seasons using pm fao56 the pm fao56 method was applied to the 2015 2017 growing season measurements at the daily time scale and compared to daily et measured using ec because we did not observe noticeable differences in et between nf and sf for all three growing seasons the average daily difference was only 0 027 mm an average et representing both fields was used when comparing to the fao56 estimates at the daily time step estimates from the pm fao56 approach were consistently higher than ec estimates with cumulative seasonal et amounts at 607 709 and 660 mm for the 2015 2017 growing seasons respectively these values were 8 105 and 81 mm greater than the seasonal et as directly measured by the ec adjusted estimates of et from the fao56 method for the 2015 2017 growing seasons were 611 698 and 651 mm which are 13 94 and 72 mm higher from the observed seasonal values respectively the estimated crop coefficient curve was shown to vary greatly throughout the growing season when compared to the fao56 recommended values including cases where the coefficient was adjusted for nonstandard conditions fig 7 the agreement between estimated and recommended kc values was poor throughout the growing season when comparing values of kc derived from gap filled ec data to recommended values daily values could vary as much as 80 higher or lower than the recommended values compared to data points from days containing less gap filling variance is reduced by 40 in estimated kc across the growing season but individual kc values are still underestimated up to 79 and overestimated up to 80 across both the recommended and adjusted kc values using only the non gap filled ec derived kc red points in fig 7 across 2015 2017 we estimate the kc ini kc mid and kc end to be 0 94 0 03 1 16 0 02 and 0 95 0 11 respectively variability between the recommended and observed crop coefficients was noticeable in the early growing season due to the difference in irrigation practices between the fao recommendation and our field site as mentioned in the methods but values were within an acceptable margin of error for the mid and late growing seasons when comparing et rates between the pm fao56 method and the ec towers using data we excluded data points from the initial 60 days to remove the variance introduced from kc ini we also limited observation to only include periods where 60 of the measured daytime 8 am to 6 pm local time et was present to reduce the amount of uncertainty introduced by ann gap filling fig 8 our results indicated no clear seasonal pattern to increased performance of the pm fao56 method when considering only the mid and late growing season across all growing seasons we observed a consisted overestimation of et during the late season period dap 115 in 2015 and 2016 but mid season performance varied from year to year the adjusted crop coefficients not shown provided no improvement when compared to the same ec observations similar to the pm aet approach we suspect that increased precipitation and regional differences in growth conditions between our site and the reference site could have resulted in an irregular canopy response and altered et from both fields during the growing season we observed the best performance of the pm fao56 method when both fields were under awd treatment and the amount of precipitation was noticeably less than in 2017 table 2 4 discussion 4 1 comparing et across irrigation regimes mean growing season et was estimated to be between 4 14 and 4 55 mm day 1 for df and between 4 20 and 4 46 mm day 1 for awd using gap filled eddy covariance estimates thus this is additional evidence that et rates do not significantly differ between the different treatments other studies have indicated a similar range of mean growing season et when compared to other conventional systems involving continuous flooding and awd both domestically and internationally table 5 based on this literature synthesis across methods climate conditions and production settings estimated growing season et ranged between 411 and 889 mm with daily et rates ranging from 3 31 to 7 87 mm day 1 table 5 when ec was used to measure et directly the range narrowed to 485 mm to 636 mm with measured daily et between 3 50 and 4 65 mm day 1 when only comparing studies reporting dap the median growing season et was 653 mm with an equivalent et rate of 4 87 mm day 1 other methods including the pm model showed a much larger range of et from 499 mm to 762 mm with estimated daily et ranging between 4 05 and 4 65 mm day 1 variation in estimated rates was likely linked to differences in climate conditions method and possibly production practices such as transplanting which changes the scope or range of observation compared to direct seeding naklang et al 1996 tuong and bhuiyan 1999 with respect to metrics such as derived daily et rate the number of days after transplanting or direct seeding indicate different growth phases that can potentially differ in productivity dingkuhn et al 1991 4 2 the effects of awd on et during the 2015 growing season in our study et rates measured using eddy covariance showed no significant differences across the entire growing season and no significant differences during drying events when et was expected to change due to the decline in wd regarding the drying events neither field experienced major declines in volumetric water content 20 vwc that significantly influenced differences in et between nf and sf studies conducted on field plots containing poorly drained clay soils have also reported similar results significant levels of drying relative to the study soils still yielded no significant differences in awd and control yields carrijo et al 2018 norton et al 2017 because we observed no significant differences in yield quality or quantity between the treatments runkle et al 2019 we assume with confidence that the plants were not significantly inhibited by water stress in grain production and associated transpiration thus a large portion of et remained unaffected by the awd treatment additionally the rice grown in both fields xl745 was a hybrid variety associated with high nutrient efficiency and water use efficiency to produce comparable yields in water limited conditions lópez lópez et al 2018 the combination of limited drying and the rice variety likely explained the lack of response in et to drying events in both fields 4 3 modeling conductance using inverted pm across the daytime period the estimated canopy conductance values from the inversion of the penman monteith equation showed values ranging roughly between 3 and 33 mm s 1 which are similar to other studies estimating canopy conductance in rice across a number of studies table 6 canopy conductance estimates from various studies table 6 show comparable ranges to the current study between 0 and 21 mm s 1 during the growing season daily maximum conductance estimated from half hourly data throughout growing seasons ranged between 24 mm s 1 2016 and 28 mm s 1 2015 for nf and 20 mm s 1 2016 and 33 mm s 1 2017 for sf with peak values occurring between 1 pm and 5 pm for both fields when the canopy is most active however based on comparisons between the model and the initial estimates of conductance the model was not able to accurately estimate conductance at any given time a comparison of initial conductance estimates from the inverted pm aet and known drivers of et such as net radiation and vpd showed no apparent relationships during the daytime period throughout the growing season while the parameterized model provided some definition to the relationships between environmental drivers and conductance across each growing season our results indicated that the rice canopy faced no apparent limitation based on vpd available energy or temperature with respect to conductance however the parameterized conductance was still able to generate more consistently accurate estimates of le when compared to using a static monthly value for canopy conductance in the penman monteith equation 4 4 improving pm aet and pm fao56 in this study the pm aet approach estimated et effectively across the growing season at the half hourly time step because the model was constrained based on time of day due to the conductance modeling et estimates generated outside of the primary period are considered less reliable and less valuable when describing mechanistic relationships between drivers and associated et during the growing season the canopy consistently experienced elevated levels of humidity 80 during the daytime period reducing the overall atmospheric demand of water we were also unable to detect significant responses in modeled stomatal conductance to changes in temperature and vpd meaning the plants were not stressed despite the elevated temperatures and increased vpd available energy was the primary driver of et throughout the growing season as evidenced through both direct observations and the use of the pm aet where measured available energy explained a significant amount of the variance in et residuals between both fields regarding our hypotheses we did not see any significant amount of variance between modeled and observed et explained using soil moisture or water level across a variety of conditions in each growing season as mentioned previously when addressing the effects of awd the canopy did not experience significant levels of drying below 40 vwc thus while we did not see a significant response low soil moisture is known to impact canopy health carrijo et al 2018 additionally the pm aet method generated acceptable estimates of et during the growing season regardless of irrigation regime regarding the pm fao56 approach it was clear that the current methodology produced comparable estimates of et in 2015 but the model performance was inconsistent across the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons based on the comparison of cumulative et amounts between the pm fao56 approach and the ec measurements when observing the pm fao56 daily et rates during the mid to late growing season we saw the best performance in 2016 when both nf and sf were under awd contrastingly the model performance was poorest in years the precipitation was greater 2017 or the fields were kept under different management strategies 2015 across the growing season the estimated kc and recommended kc were more similar in the mid to late growing season the dissimilarity between the estimated and recommended kc ini was likely due to the difference in production settings over which the coefficients were estimated water seeded rice production applies a substantially greater amount of water to the field during the early growing season compared to the drill seeding approach used in our experiments under flooded conditions at planting the resulting et would be higher compared to dry soil present in drill seeded rice meaning the ratio of crop et to reference et would also be greater in the flooded field this effect was reduced as the canopy developed in the later portion dap 60 of the growing season where variance was almost 50 less in the regression between ec derived values for kc mind and kc end and the recommended fao56 values however the early growing season does not represent a period of time where producers are actively concerned with irrigation applications as the first flood has not been applied yet producer interest in using et to schedule irrigation events would likely be tied to the mid and late growing season when plant water availability is critical to maintaining profitable yields henry et al 2013 local climate likely played a role in differences in crop coefficient as the recommended crop coefficients were generated under climates that are less humid doorenbos and pruitt 1977 doorenbos and kassam 1979 considering our findings we recommend that improvements to the method should include regional or site specific crop coefficient development to better account for differences in production practices such as water seeding vs drill seeding for practical applications the pm fao56 method could still be a viable option for producers to estimate et and schedule irrigation events the pm aet model performed well as a method for gap filling le fluxes at the half hourly time step based on our results with the pm aet capturing the amount of available energy as the difference between the net radiation and g is a critical component of estimating et as demonstrated in our experiment because available energy represents such a large portion of et in our production settings less complex et estimation methods such as the priestley taylor also a pm derivative and the hargreaves equation could prove to be valuable other studies based in rice across varying production systems have also identified available energy as the driving factor of et in rice paddy systems with the ratio of le to rn ranging from 71 to 74 during the typical growing period under flooded conditions hossen et al 2012 liu et al 2019a b timm et al 2014 while establishing robust methodology and application of tools is complex and multifaceted development of methods for estimating et at the canopy scale provides valuable information to better inform producers exploration and improved knowledge of modeling limitations and controls at the field scale can serve as a point of comparison for larger scale applications of et modeling using remote sensing jiang and ryu 2016 fisher et al 2020 5 conclusions based on this experiment s findings the use of awd as an irrigation treatment showed no significant effect on et when compared to the conventional df practice the treatments showed no significant differences in yields meaning that there was not significant water stress associated with drying events if taken as a plant health indicator et was not affected and leads us to conclude that the plants did not experience drought stress and could still access sufficient water within the soil as vwc did not fall below 20 during drying events we were able to use the pm aet approach and conductance model to estimate half hourly et across the growing season the model has potential to continue to provide mechanistic insight on driving environmental variables during different portions of the growing season with respect to et as seen in the comparison of field and recommended kc the pm fao56 method did not yield strong results we conclude that site specific crop coefficient values are necessary to generate accurate crop coefficient values especially during the early growing season however we also recognize that in practical application et during the mid to late growing season is more valuable for planning irrigation based on field et estimates

4692,as rice production is water intensive establishing an accurate field scale water budget is paramount for sustainable use of local water resources this study s goal was to quantify and characterize half hourly and seasonal evapotranspiration et in two commercial zero grade rice fields in the u s mid south over three growing seasons during each growing season irrigation regimes for the studied fields differed between alternate wetting and drying awd and delayed flooding df the 2015 growing season enabled a direct comparison of the effects of awd and df on et while during the 2016 and 2017 seasons both fields were simultaneously under awd and df respectively the df method is the region s most common irrigation practice and it prescribes a continuous flood to be maintained for the majority of the growing season after the plants have reached the 5 leaf growth stage 40 50 days after planting in contrast after holding this initial flooding for 3 weeks awd allows for field drying to promote the capture of seasonal rains to reduce irrigation water withdrawal and associated water pumping costs in this study et was estimated using gap filled eddy covariance observations and two variations of the penman monteith equation these methods determined growing season et values between 560 mm and 636 mm this study found that there were no significant differences in cumulative et or yield when comparing awd to df practices furthermore awd elicited no change in et during periods of drying when compared to df by this metric awd did not induce drought stress within the plants we conclude that the main benefit of the awd practice is to take advantage of seasonal rainfall to offset pumping costs and pressure on irrigation water requirements while maintaining yields comparable to conventional irrigation practices keywords evapotranspiration rice alternate wetting and drying penman monteith eddy covariance 1 introduction water resources are currently consumed at unsustainable rates within the lower mississippi river basin where a majority of rice is grown in the united states kresse et al 2014 reba et al 2013 due to this depletion the region is increasing efforts to conserve water and quantify water use particularly by agricultural irrigation for its sustainable future management reba et al 2017 to promote sustainable water use in rice production various methods and technologies are being applied such as field levelling to zero grade which can reduce irrigation water use by up to 40 henry et al 2016 and multiple inlet irrigation which can reduce water use by up to 24 massey et al 2014 2017 2018 alternate wetting and drying awd is a practice that can potentially reduce irrigation water use by up to 20 by capturing rain during the growing season offsetting pumping costs for the producer carrijo et al 2017 pan et al 2017 lampayan et al 2015 prior to the onset of the initial flood in both awd and delayed flood df practices the rice germinates and establishes in non flooded soils moldenhauer et al 2013 the recommended awd practice allows periodic paddy drying which lasts approximately 5 days to occur at least 3 weeks after the first flooding the conventional df practice maintains a constant flood once the first flood is established until the fields are drained for harvest however the level and timing of drying induced in awd are management decisions based on irrigation infrastructure precipitation forecasting soil type plant variety growth stage and water supply while awd conserves water there are concerns regarding plant health grain quality and decreases in yield compared to conventional growing practices graham acquaah et al 2019 norton et al 2017 sudhir yadav et al 2012 therefore the timing and duration of the dry periods needs careful management awd is also expanding in use because of its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with rice production linquist et al 2015a 2015b 2018 runkle et al 2019 fields managed with awd have the potential to reduce evapotranspiration et when compared to conventionally managed fields due to the decline of available water at the soil surface and alteration of land surface radiative properties which may reduce the amount of open water or soil water evaporation norman et al 1995 liu et al 2019a 2019b however et is typically dominated by the plant mediated release of water transpiration especially during the later portion of the growing season when the rice canopy is fully developed wei et al 2015 2017 the water savings for awd are primarily seen in the capturing of rain events during drying periods ideally the amount of rainfall captured during these events should offset the amount of pumped water required to replace water lost through et kima et al 2015 in rice water budgets and irrigation schedulers producers use et to estimate the amount of water required to sustain crop production without incurring stress li and cui 1996 smith 1992 understanding how et changes throughout the growing season also provides an indication of canopy health moran et al 1995 et is tied to primary production of plant biomass as water release from the plant is regulated by stomatal control which helps dictate assimilation of carbon dioxide within the plant during the daytime ikawa et al 2018 roel et al 1999 wang et al 2020 because awd has the potential to conserve water resources and provide economic benefits to the producer nalley et al 2015 uncertainty within the terms of the water balance including et must be reduced through careful measurement in agricultural settings et is typically estimated using approaches such as the hargreaves or penman monteith equations which rely on meteorological data and basic estimates of phenology allen et al 1998 hargreaves and allen 2003 pereira et al 2015 however studies conducted in rice have indicated sizeable differences when comparing measured et using micrometeorological approaches such as the eddy covariance method and et estimated with variations of the penman monteith equation ikawa et al 2017 wang et al 2017 these approaches include the penman monteith method for actual et pm aet and the penman monteith method as outlined in fao document 56 pm fao56 monteith 1965 penman 1948 allen et al 1998 methods such as the pm aet are of interest as their improvement would provide a platform for relating associated changes in measured et to physically derived relationships between et and multiple meteorological and phenological variables contained within the pm aet many studies have identified areas of improvement for different implementations of the penman monteith equation by focusing on different components including canopy conductance and variable crop coefficients lecina et al 2003 alberto et al 2014 yan et al 2018 a common application of conductance is the big leaf approach that treats conductance as a bulk value across all leaves in the canopy where its parameterization can be completed using only observations of local meteorological variables lai and et observations however single layer conductance models typically underperform in periods of sparse lai 2 vegetation xu et al 2018 lafleur and rouse 1990 dual layer conductance approaches that address canopy and soil as separate contributors to et have been recommended to address the poor performance of the pm aet under sparse vegetation including rice shuttleworth and wallace 1985 facchi et al 2013 studies utilizing both the dual layer and single layer conductance frameworks in rice have shown comparable performance between each approach during the growing season gharsallah et al 2013 liu et al 2020 here we quantify et rates from within two fields in the humid u s mid south and compare awd and df irrigation management practices the primary aim of this study is to better characterize half hourly and seasonal et in this region and identify associated impacts of altering the conventional irrigation regime with respect to et for this aim we test whether fields with awd irrigation show reduced et relative to the df field due to the lack of a free water surface during drying events by quantifying et using different methods across multiple growing seasons we then examine how et changes during drying events to observe the effects drying has on plant activity we assume that during drying events if the plants undergoing awd remain unstressed the differences in transpiration should be negligible because transpiration makes up a large portion of et during the growing season we hypothesize that canopies with similar transpiration rates will show little differences in et once the canopy is established the second aim is to evaluate the performance of two accepted estimation methods in comparison to eddy covariance observations within both df and awd fields across the 2015 17 growing seasons finally we seek to compare crop coefficients derived from local estimates of reference et and eddy covariance to the crop coefficients for rice recommended in the fao 56 document 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study site is composed of two adjacent commercial fields 24 ha each located in eastern arkansas usa 34 35 8 6 n 91 45 05 w the fields have been used to grow rice in continuous rotation since 2004 and are zero graded with no slope within the planted area of the field for this study the fields are identified as north field nf and south field sf the soil within the fields is primarily characterized as poorly drained perry silty clay usda classification very fine smectitic thermic chromic epiaquerts which represents 100 of nf and 93 2 of sf runkle et al 2019 soil survey staff 2018 the remaining portion of sf soil 2 ha is a herbert silt loam fine silty mixed superactive mesic udollic epiaqualfs the composition of the soil varied between nf and sf where nf had greater clay content 62 vs 43 the fields are connected in a series of five similarly sized fields where irrigation water is delivered across each field moving north to south before arriving at the desired field the rice was drill seeded and the growers apply the first flood approximately 47 days after planting dap rice grown within the fields in each study year was a hybrid variety clearfield xl745 ricetec inc alvin tx usa and followed the typical growing season for rice in arkansas from early april to september the 2015 2017 growing seasons for nf and sf ranged 133 143 days from planting to harvest runkle et al 2019 irrigation during the growing season relies primarily on surface water which travels between fields by gravity flow through pipes and ditches irrigation routes are set up so that water must flow through each field as a series running north to south the irrigation treatments were altered between the three growing seasons table 1 in 2016 seeding was delayed due to wet field conditions and thus the first flood was established later in the summer compared to 2015 and 2017 i e 14 jun vs 14 17 may instrumentation consisted of eddy covariance and biometeorological sensors runkle et al 2019 and was identically installed in both fields these measurements contribute to the ameriflux management project nf us hrc and sf us hra and its subnetwork delta flux for responding to questions on sustainable practices in agriculture runkle et al 2017 due to the homogeneous fetch requirements for the eddy covariance technique the equipment was installed on the northern edge of each field at approximately half the distance of the northern border to capture the dominant southern winds during the growing season and fluxes north of each field were discarded equipment was installed approximately 15 m from the north edge of each field after drill seeding and removed immediately prior to harvest deployment during the growing season normally occurred within 4 days post planting and removal of equipment occurred 2 days prior to harvest fluxes collected at the towers using eddy covariance were screened to include only wind directions between 95 and 265 to ensure measurement footprints were limited to their respective fields gaps within the observed fluxes for all three years were empirically filled using an artificial neural networks approach knox et al 2015 2016 this method used the following explanatory variables days since the start of the study period leaf area index lai plant height friction velocity u air temperature t incoming solar radiation rg in vapor pressure deficit vpd water depth wd and fuzzy transformation sets representing seasonality and time of day see runkle et al 2019 for more details the turbulent energy flux models correlated with observations with r2 values 0 90 2 2 measurement of fluxes microclimate and plant parameters the eddy covariance ec system provided measurements of sensible heat h and latent heat le flux through the net exchange of the scalars temperature and h2o respectively the ec system included a 3d sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa and an open path infrared co2 h2o analyzer li 7500a li cor inc lincoln ne usa the ec system was mounted on a tripod with the sensor height measuring 2 2 m above the surface of the rice field separation for the ec sensors was approximately 0 1 m and was accounted for with frequency correction factors and signal lagging including flow distortion by transducer shadowing horst et al 2015 described in runkle et al 2019 and suvočarev et al 2019 the ec components used a designated analyzer interface unit li 7550 li cor inc lincoln ne usa with outputs recorded at 20 hz and half hourly fluxes calculated with eddypro v 6 2 software with the output including calculated flux quality flags and an analysis of the flux footprint throughout the growing season fluxes were screened based on multiple factors including turbulence dominant wind direction southern winds footprint size and availability based on power failures the flux footprint was used to only include periods where 90 of the data was measured within 350 m of the tower to remove the effects of measurement drift across adjacent fields runkle et al 2019 the resulting data coverage for half hourly sensible and latent heat fluxes after filtering ranged between 23 and 34 across the growing periods the four components of net radiation rn were measured cnr4 kipp zonen inc delft nl at a height of 2 0 m incoming and outgoing photosynthetically active radiation par was also measured using quantum sensors li 190sb li cor inc lincoln ne usa at 1 85 m air temperature t and relative humidity rh were measured using a shielded probe hmp155a vaisala helsinki fi in addition to the sonic anemometer wind speed and direction were also measured using a 2 d anemometer mounted at 3 2 m 05103 5 propeller wind monitor r m young traverse city mi usa soil heat flux g measurements were collected using two soil heat flux plates hfp01 hukseflux delft nl placed at different depths in each year 8 cm 5 cm and 4 cm below the soil surface for the 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively soil heat flux plate measurements were corrected for the stored energy in both soil and water column using soil surface temperature and water temperature thermistor measurements cs 107 betatherm 100k6a1ia campbell scientific inc logan ut usa thermistors were placed directly at the soil surface 2 cm above each soil heat flux plate and on a flotation device to capture the temperature of the changing flood level the energy balance closure ebc as reported in runkle et al 2019 was calculated using sensible and latent heat flux from the ec towers rn and storage corrected g at the half hourly time step for the 2015 2017 growing seasons the ebc for nf was 0 73 0 75 and 0 69 respectively and 0 89 0 69 and 0 82 for sf respectively volumetric water content measurements were collected using soil moisture time domain transmissometer probes sdi 12 acclima sydney au at 8 cm and 15 cm for all fields during all growing seasons measurements of wd were collected continuously using a piezometric sensor series 46x keller usa inc fort mill sc usa vented for automatic compensation for barometric pressure changes installed 30 cm from the tower in a perforated tube reaching approximately 30 cm below the soil surface other field parameters including plant density and soil bulk density were collected manually at different times during the growing season runkle et al 2019 bulk density and soil temperature above the soil heat flux plate were used in conjunction with wd measurements to correct for changes in heat storage in the water and saturated soil matrix above the plate during flooded and dry conditions fuchs and tanner 1968 runkle et al 2019 2 3 leaf area index lai and canopy height model to characterize changing canopy conditions and provide necessary inputs for the penman monteith approach and ec processing canopy height measurements were collected throughout the growing season and averaged across 10 measurements during each field excursion approx twice monthly but less frequently in 2016 see below because of high crop uniformity canopy height measurements were taken only within 30 m of the ec station and represented the height from the soil surface to the height of the canopy top at eye level ignoring flag leaves lai was measured at similar intervals using a plant canopy analyzer lai 2200c li cor inc lincoln ne usa averaging three samples taken within 30 m of the ec tower per measurement period typically sampling for lai did not begin until the canopy achieved a measurable level of growth usually 50 60 dap when the canopy height was approximately 0 5 m we estimated lai and canopy height throughout the growing season with a growing degree day gdd model yang et al 1995 this approach uses gdd as the cumulative sum of the differences between the mean daily temperature tmean daily and a base temperature tbase in this setting tbase was set as 10 c to represent the minimum temperature for growth and development in rice keisling et al 1984 lai and canopy height data were collected through field measurements during the 2015 2017 growing seasons in both the nf and sf lai observations were complemented with modis terra am satellite lai mod15a2h myneni et al 2015 to remedy gaps in field measurements and improve model timing regarding canopy development the modis data provided information about rice canopy dynamics most notably the transition to a phase of rapid growth approximately 45 dap as the rice canopy transitioned from the vegetative to reproductive stages the 1 km modis pixel encompassed vegetation from both studied fields fig 1 the area surrounding the experimental fields are also rice paddies with similar phenological development for the 2015 and 2017 growing seasons field observations collected with the lai 2200c n 8 and n 13 respectively were necessary to model lai as a linear and quadratic function of gdd during the early and rapid growth stages respectively in contrast only two field observations n 2 of lai were collected during the 2016 growing season in the early growth period to compensate for lack of data in 2016 in that year the modi5ah2 lai product was used to estimate lai myneni et al 2015 to correct for the modis lai product s consistent under estimation bias up to 20 determined in 2015 and 2017 the modis data points used to model lai during the 2016 growing season were adjusted using a scaling factor this factor was estimated using a regression slope between measured data points and the modis data at the same time period for each field across the 2015 2017 growing seasons the scaling factors slopes for each field were then applied to their respective modis data to generate a sufficient n 5 set of lai data that could be used to identify linear and quadratic growth periods with respect to gdd during the 2016 growing season a similar approach was applied to canopy height where field data were collected and modeled based on the period of the growing season canopy height measurements were collected during the 2015 2017 growing seasons for each field within the study nf and sf the same approach used to model lai before and after the transition from vegetative to reproductive stages was applied to canopy height where the growth patterns before and after this transition were considered to be linear and quadratic respectively in relation to gdd 2 4 methods for modeling et the pm aet is based on meteorological data and information about plant development the combination eq 1 is based on the latent energy requirement for evaporating water and the deficit of vapor pressure necessary for removing water it also accounts for the resistances for transpiring the water from plant tissue and transporting it away from the crop canopy it was used to evaluate data collected in real time from both fields at the 30 min time step 1 λ e t δ r n g c p ρ a v p d r a δ γ 1 r s r a where λ is the latent heat of vaporization 2 45 mj kg 1 e t is evapotranspiration mm day

height of wind speed see appendix a δ is the slope of vapor pressure temperature relationship kpa c 1 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 determined as 6 65 10 3 patm atm the pm aet can be used to estimate stomatal conductance using ec data through inversion and is also one of the few methods that can generate an et estimate at the half hourly time scale using only meteorological data the pm fao56 method eq 2 generates daily estimates of reference et eto mm day 1 from a reference crop a short well watered grass and the crop et mm day 1 is calculated using dimensionless crop coefficients 2 e t c e t 0 k c 0 408 δ r n g γ c n t 273 v p d u 2 m δ γ 1 c d u 2 m k c where e t c is crop evapotranspiration mm day 1 e t 0 is reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 t is mean daily air temperature at 2 0 m height c u2m is wind speed at 2 0 m height m s 1 cd and cn are coefficients based on canopy development for a theoretical crop at 0 12 m in height and kc is the crop coefficient for converting e t 0 to rice canopy et each rice development stage has a corresponding crop coefficient according to tabulated fao56 values the crop coefficients for rice grown in a humid environment with moderately high wind speed 2 m s 1 are equal to 1 05 1 20 and 0 9 for the initial mid season and late season periods of the growing season respectively the lengths of time used to define the initial developmental mid season and late season stages of rice crop growth are 30 30 80 and 40 days respectively the tabulated rice crop coefficients given were also derived from the water seeded rice practice where rice was deposited directly into pre flooded paddies based on the identical recommended values 1 05 for coefficient kc ini and open water surfaces for this method several assumptions were made in relation to the reference evapotranspiration and g reference evapotranspiration requires measurements taken from a representative plot that adheres to fao 56 standards so that all other assumptions inherent to the model hold for representativeness of the evaporative demand of the atmosphere the local usda weather station in stuttgart ar 20 km to east of site surrounded by similar agricultural fields provided measurements of t rh u3m and rg in the wind speed measurements from the weather station were corrected to u2m using the logarithmic wind speed profile approach outlined in fao56 additional components of rn were estimated using missing climate data methods outlined in fao 56 based on the location of the site as well as the day of year daily ground heat flux g is assumed by fao 56 to average to zero at the daily time step the crop coefficient was also adjusted using modeled canopy height and relative humidity as outlined in fao 56 chapter 6 to account for differences between the field site and the sites used to derive the recommended crop coefficients allen et al 1998 both the recommended and adjusted crop coefficients were compared to the observed crop coefficients at our field site 2 5 estimating and modeling canopy conductance canopy conductance gc is a key term within the pm aet model that reflects biological mediation of the exchange of gases between the rice canopy and the surrounding atmosphere to estimate gc within each experimental field site the pm aet model was inverted eq 3 to solve for gc using observed non gap filled ec measurements of et etec for the evapotranspiration term 3 g c λ e t e c γ g a δ r n g c p p a e s e a g a λ e t e c δ γ values of estimated gc were limited to periods with positive etec the estimated gc in these half hour intervals was used to parameterize a model eqs 4 8 which utilized both meteorological and biological inputs to predict estimates of gc in a jarvis style approach jarvis et al 1976 xu et al 2017 ershadi et al 2015 gardiol et al 2003 surface conductance gs was determined through gs gc laiactive 1 where laiactive determined with eq 8 represents the active fraction of lai m2 m

i 2 2 l a i 4 4 l a i where a 1 a 2 a 3 are fitted parameters and g s m a x is the maximum surface conductance the laiactive scales from gs to gc to incorporate the effects of canopy development and associated driving forces on surface conductance across the rice canopy collatz et al 1991 leuning et al 1995 the use of laiactive follows the big leaf approach for modeling conductance across landscapes zhang et al 2008 li et al 2016 xu et al 2017 to prevent uneven weighting of lai and contributing plant transpiration the laiactive parameter was assigned to have a value of unity during the early growing season when surface evaporation would be most pronounced in et maximum surface conductance gs max was determined as the maximum gs observation in a 7 day moving window across the entire growing season negative and pseudo infinite values gs 104 mm s 1 were removed as well as values when incoming r g i n radiation was 30 w m 2 for calibration and validation of the model we conducted a random selection of the data across all six site years for each step the calibration dataset represented 70 of the total dataset while the model and parameters were validated using the remaining 30 the parameters for the conductance model were optimized using nonlinear regression of measured and modeled et and assessed by the slope r2 and rmse of the regression the parameters were calculated using nonlinear least squares regression between measured et and modeled et while fitting gc with parameters a1 a2 and a3 thus any uncertainty in the biometeorological inputs in addition to measured et was also transmitted to the conductance term the conductance parameterization only utilized data taken from 40 dap and during the daytime period 8 am to 6 pm local time to ensure that conductance terms were not estimated with influence from periods when the rice canopy was less likely to impact et 2 6 comparison and analysis of et observations to better understand impacts related to differences in irrigation treatment we directly compared simultaneous et observations non gap filled to other biometeorological factors the variables tested included meteorological drivers in the penman monteith equation such as available energy and vpd and variables tied to the soil conditions in each field including volumetric water content vwc and wd modeled canopy height and lai were included in this analysis to account for canopy differences ratios of h to rn were analyzed over the growing season to better understand how shifts in et and canopy development affect the partitioning of available energy within the field energy balance cumulative estimates of et were compared across growing seasons and irrigation treatments the number of days missed due to the instrument deployment and pre harvest removal averaged 6 5 and 2 days across both fields for the 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively the estimates of cumulative et were also normalized by dap to calculate a seasonal et rate absent of bias incurred by differences in growing season length the 2015 growing season was the only growing season where the effects of drying could be compared using simultaneous observations between both fields throughout the entire growing season in 2016 and 2017 both fields were kept under the same irrigation management making it impossible to directly compare simultaneous et observations during drying events occurring in a single field instead comparisons for the 2016 and 2017 growing season provided an opportunity to observe the effects of drying by comparing periods where both fields were either wet or dry to determine the relative impacts of drying events during each month of the growing season to assess the impacts of drying events on et analysis of covariance ancova was used to determine if et was significantly different between fields when one was wet and the other was dry using wd measured in both fields the comparison was conducted on a monthly basis where wet wddf 0 wdawd 0 and dry wddf 0 wdawd 0 categories served as the groupings for et where the subscripts indicate the respective field irrigation treatment to remain consistent with other comparisons between fields this analysis was limited to measurements taken during the daytime 8 am 6 pm local time for the purposes of this paper we define a drying event as any period after initial flooding where wd in a field falls below the soil surface for at least 24 h the analysis was also limited to awd drying periods meaning any data prior to initial flooding and after the beginning of final drainage was not included comparisons between the modeled and observed et were used to evaluate model performance using residuals analysis residuals from regressions between modeled and observed et were compared to both meteorological and phenological variables within the respective fields to identify periods of higher and lower model performance the approach would also determine what input variables are critical in determining et in the u s mid south production setting as well as identifying variables that could be associated with differences between observed and modeled et moreover comparing performance across both pm methods allows a test of which methods are better suited for estimating et and understanding dynamics of et with respect to the local biometeorology for the pm fao56 method comparisons between modeled and observed values were limited to days where 40 of the original ec data between 8 am and 6 pm were missing before gap filling using the ann procedure this measure was taken to limit the impact of completely gap filled days while preventing uneven weighting within the non gap filled data set due to quality control based on turbulence and instrumentation limits 3 results 3 1 meteorological observations across all growing seasons the nf and sf sites maintained a mean daily temperature of 24 5 c with values ranging between 10 c early april and 36 c mid july mean daily relative humidity was 80 with values ranging 22 100 during the early growing season april and may and 40 100 during the mid late growing season june august after the flood was applied the mean daily vpd ranged between 0 5 and 1 7 kpa with maximum values exceeding 2 5 kpa during the daytime period 8 am 6 pm local time with peak values typically occurring between 4 pm and 6 pm wind speed averaged 2 06 m s 1 with maximum speeds exceeding 10 m s 1 mean incoming solar radiation was 248 w m 2 across all growing seasons with maximum measured values 1000 w m 2 occurring between mid june and early july and maximum values typically occurred between 12 h and 14 h comparisons to the 30 year 1981 2010 average showed that monthly mean temperatures were always within 2 c of normal runkle et al 2019 comparison of precipitation during the growing season months of april to august showed that all three growing seasons were wetter than the 30 year normal of 492 mm with 505 mm in 2015 627 mm in 2016 and 868 mm in 2017 for all three measurement seasons 40 60 of the growing season precipitation occurred in april and may 3 2 canopy height and lai by comparing modis data to collected lai data we were able to determine a shift from slow to rapid canopy growth after emergence and the initial vegetative growth stages fig 2 due to different planting dates this transition date varied among growing seasons occurring between 40 and 50 dap maximum lai was achieved in the sf at 103 89 and 99 dap and 103 89 and 94 dap in the nf during the 2015 2017 growing seasons respectively maximum lai for the three respective growing seasons was 5 4 6 5 and 5 6 for the sf and 4 5 5 5 and 4 5 for the nf respectively relative to other years modis data for 2016 indicated a more rapid early growth and higher peak in lai while we do not have lai 2200c measurements in this year the canopy height measurements also show higher values for the 2015 2017 growing seasons maximum canopy height was reached between 111 and 124 dap for sf and between 109 and 130 days for nf fig 3 maximum canopy height for nf and sf ranged between 0 95 and 1 32 m and 0 93 1 24 m respectively similar to observed lai the 2016 growing season had a taller canopy during the latter portion of the growing season when the canopy was fully developed the timing of peak canopy height varied as well occurring between 105 and 118 dap across nf and sf respectively based on our estimates of phenological development both peak lai and peak canopy height occurred near the end of the r4 reproductive growth stage and the beginning of grain filling 3 3 growing season et estimates and dynamics in 2015 2017 the observed and gap filled growing season et ranged from 560 to 636 mm across the three growing seasons in both fields table 2 the 2015 growing season showed the lowest cumulative et across both fields from planting to harvest the lengths of the growing season were comparable between the fields i e from 0 to 2 days difference wd varied throughout each growing season especially in the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons where awd was applied to at least one field fig 4 for the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons drying events lasted between 2 and 7 days when irrigation was interrupted and the flood water was evaporated the minimum wd during drying events ranged between 2 and 30 cm below the soil surface prior to re flooding the soil moisture sensors at 15 cm below the soil surface indicated up to a 33 percentage point reduction saturation to minimum vwc in vwc during drying events volumetric water content measured during drying events in both fields during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons did not fall below 20 compared to 58 soil moisture at saturation during inundation the producers reestablished the flood based on presumed soil dryness and observed decline in the water depth corresponding to a wd of between 25 and 30 cm below the soil surface measured at the ec tower using the gap filled eddy covariance observations cumulative growing season et was calculated for nf and sf for the 2015 2017 growing seasons table 2 there were no clear relationships between irrigation treatment and estimated daily et rate as awd and df fields produced overlapping ranges of estimated daily et rates during the 2015 2017 growing seasons there were also no distinguishing patterns when only looking at the daytime et therefore irrigation regime did not seem to play a major factor in determining growing season et for nf and sf during the 2015 2017 growing seasons fields under awd management averaged 609 mm while fields under df management averaged 595 mm which were not significantly different in relation to cumulative seasonal precipitation across both fields during the growing season et exceeded growing season precipitation in 2015 and 2016 by as much as 20 while only accounting for up to 78 of growing season precipitation in 2017 when precipitation events were unusually frequent however the precipitation event dynamics did not match the crop water requirements and some irrigation applications were necessary to regulate the flood levels next we compared treatments at the half hourly time step to test the effects of awd and df on et across both fields for the 2015 2017 growing seasons using ann gap filled half hourly et the period of observation was limited to daytime values between 8 am and 6 pm to prevent uneven weighting from nighttime periods this comparison also confirms despite having different irrigation regimes there were no significant differences in et during the 2015 growing season fig 5 comparisons of et measured in 2016 and 2017 when both fields were in the same irrigation treatment showed similar results as well in addition these results did not change significantly when only observed values i e not gap filled data were used for comparison nf showed consistently similar le compared to sf in 2016 nf had slightly higher et based on a linear regression slope of 0 96 the slopes of each regression were significant with the slope standard error across all three comparisons never exceeding 0 00042 for comparisons between nf and sf across 2015 2017 rmse ranged between 1 02 and 1 68 mm day 1 with a majority of the divergence occurring earlier in the growing season the divergence in et during the early growing season when the soil water or water evaporation components dominate the et process was due to different planting and flooding schedules for each field events where one field was flooded first before the other indicate higher et and these events are especially common during the early growing season e g the cluster of points in fig 5c extending to 16 mm day 1 in nf and 8 mm day 1 in sf typically once the canopy was established the fields converged in terms of et and continued to do so through closure until they were drained for harvest based on our observations development and closure of the rice canopy clearly reduced the impact of factors of change in et between both fields including factors related to their respective irrigation treatments such as water level or soil moisture there were no significant differences in the measured rn between nf and sf across all three growing seasons the majority of et was driven by rn with the ratio of le to rn throughout the growing seasons ranging between 0 71 and 0 85 for individual months particularly july and august le measured between 55 and 75 of rn while in early periods of the growing season april and may le ranged between 24 and 51 of rn the ratio of h to rn consistently decreased from the beginning of the growing season until pre harvest draining when the ratio of h to rn increased in most cases given that the variation of rn was minimal during the growing season this decrease in the ratio of h to rn was most likely due to the increase in le associated with flooding canopy development and greater amounts of transpiration 3 4 effects of awd on et in eddy covariance observations in order to test the effect of awd on et variation due to changing flood water availability for evaporation parts of the 2015 growing season with drying events in sf and inundation in nf field were used to compare the simultaneous et values the length of drying events was consistently around 1 week our results indicate that prior to canopy development and closure specifically in may 2015 when dry and wet conditions were being compared directly there is a significant difference p 0 05 in measured et table 3 while there were significant differences in et these drying events were not carried out as part of an awd treatment as the first permanent flood had yet to be established in may 2015 the slope of 0 91 indicates that drying period et was 9 greater in the inundated nf compared to the non flooded conditions in sf during this period both fields did not have a developed canopy and only one drying event had occurred while we do not consider the significant differences in et to be a direct result of the awd treatment in nf analysis between the residuals taken from the initial field to field regression and the declining wd in sf indicated that the drying significantly explained only up to 5 of et residual variance all other months during the 2015 growing season indicated no significant difference in observed et across all hydrological conditions and declining wd in the drying field was unable to explain any significant differences observed in et between nf and sf we suspect that differences occurring early in the growing season are substantially influenced by precipitation as well in altering the plant canopy response with respect to et additionally in this farm setting precipitation can be managed in a way that water is actively drained between fields along a designated flow path nf to sf to prevent unsuitable growth conditions for the crop during early growth stages the canopy development stages explain the convergence of et between the two fields and the inability of changes in wd to explain significant differences in et during the latter portion of the growing season because both canopies were similar in structure and showed no decreases in yield associated with drying events in 2015 we can conclude that plant mediated transpiration was likely similar in both fields as the canopy continued to develop the contributing portion of transpiration to et increased resulting in similar et rates across both fields when the canopy was fully closed and developed canopy cover also likely exercised control over open water surface evaporation through shading meaning the contributing portion of evaporation to et likely decreased as well this would result in insensitivity to et and differences between fields with respect to water level in 2016 and 2017 there were no periods where only one field was dry since both fields were treated in awd and df respectively the columns in table 3 for these years are therefore during periods when both are dry during the 2016 slopes from the all wet case did not significantly differ from slopes in the all dry case across the growing season under both conditions nf appeared to always have greater et compared to sf despite both fields undergoing the same treatment measured et between both fields seemed to agree more during dry periods but these slopes were not significantly different from their wet counterpart during each individual month in 2017 when both fields were managed with df throughout the entire growing season the comparison indicated no significant differences in slopes from the comparison between wet and dry periods flooded conditions made it impossible to perform dry period analysis in june and july of 2017 as well based on the observations in 2016 2017 we can infer wetting and drying did not play a significant role in influencing differences in et across both fields meaning the field effect based on changing wd does not play a consistent significant role in our et comparisons this finding supports our observation of similar et between fields regardless of wd management across all growing seasons the change in slope between nf and sf et rates also indicated that the fields continued to converge on similar et as the canopy developed during the growing season as the slope drew nearer to a value of 1 with each successive month given that both fields were treated using the same irrigation method in 2016 and 2017 this similarity was expected and supports the concept of decreasing impacts of changing wd and associated soil water evaporation throughout the growing season as canopy transpiration dominates the et flux 3 5 modeling canopy conductance for the 2015 2017 growing seasons canopy conductance estimated using eddy covariance measurements for le and the inverted penman monteith equation was estimated using the full 2015 2017 dataset including both nf and sf maximum applied surface conductance from the 7 day moving window ranged between 8 and 70 mm s 1 across both fields for the 2015 2017 growing seasons with peak values occurring during periods characterized by increased canopy height and lai parameterization was performed for individual site seasons and across all six site years combined the parameters and standard error were estimated for each growing season as well as the combined period of all growing seasons table 4 3 6 modeling et for the 2015 2017 growing seasons using pm aet after parameterization with 70 of the data during calibration with data from across all six field seasons the calibrated model performed well against the remaining data as a validation set the parameterized pm equation estimated half hourly et with high correlation r2 0 84 m 1 0 0015 mm day 1 rmse 2 12 mm day 1 during daytime periods of the growing season across all six site years within each individual growing season model performance was varied across each irrigation comparison scenario but was still able to explain similar amounts of variance fig 6 analysis of model performance across the growing season indicated that the largest portion of variance between model and observation was during the early portion of the growing season 40 dap when the active fraction of lai was the lowest general performance across all three growing seasons was inconsistent as the model both overestimates et by 2 in 2015 and 2016 and underestimates et by 12 in 2017 during the 2017 growing season there was greater precipitation than 2015 and 2016 which could explain the model s inability to accurately reflect changes in canopy et in response to rain events and an elevated moisture status a two sample t test indicated that mean gs max estimated across 2017 was significantly p 0 05 lower than mean gs max in 2015 and 2016 by as much as 60 3 7 modeling et for the 2015 2017 growing seasons using pm fao56 the pm fao56 method was applied to the 2015 2017 growing season measurements at the daily time scale and compared to daily et measured using ec because we did not observe noticeable differences in et between nf and sf for all three growing seasons the average daily difference was only 0 027 mm an average et representing both fields was used when comparing to the fao56 estimates at the daily time step estimates from the pm fao56 approach were consistently higher than ec estimates with cumulative seasonal et amounts at 607 709 and 660 mm for the 2015 2017 growing seasons respectively these values were 8 105 and 81 mm greater than the seasonal et as directly measured by the ec adjusted estimates of et from the fao56 method for the 2015 2017 growing seasons were 611 698 and 651 mm which are 13 94 and 72 mm higher from the observed seasonal values respectively the estimated crop coefficient curve was shown to vary greatly throughout the growing season when compared to the fao56 recommended values including cases where the coefficient was adjusted for nonstandard conditions fig 7 the agreement between estimated and recommended kc values was poor throughout the growing season when comparing values of kc derived from gap filled ec data to recommended values daily values could vary as much as 80 higher or lower than the recommended values compared to data points from days containing less gap filling variance is reduced by 40 in estimated kc across the growing season but individual kc values are still underestimated up to 79 and overestimated up to 80 across both the recommended and adjusted kc values using only the non gap filled ec derived kc red points in fig 7 across 2015 2017 we estimate the kc ini kc mid and kc end to be 0 94 0 03 1 16 0 02 and 0 95 0 11 respectively variability between the recommended and observed crop coefficients was noticeable in the early growing season due to the difference in irrigation practices between the fao recommendation and our field site as mentioned in the methods but values were within an acceptable margin of error for the mid and late growing seasons when comparing et rates between the pm fao56 method and the ec towers using data we excluded data points from the initial 60 days to remove the variance introduced from kc ini we also limited observation to only include periods where 60 of the measured daytime 8 am to 6 pm local time et was present to reduce the amount of uncertainty introduced by ann gap filling fig 8 our results indicated no clear seasonal pattern to increased performance of the pm fao56 method when considering only the mid and late growing season across all growing seasons we observed a consisted overestimation of et during the late season period dap 115 in 2015 and 2016 but mid season performance varied from year to year the adjusted crop coefficients not shown provided no improvement when compared to the same ec observations similar to the pm aet approach we suspect that increased precipitation and regional differences in growth conditions between our site and the reference site could have resulted in an irregular canopy response and altered et from both fields during the growing season we observed the best performance of the pm fao56 method when both fields were under awd treatment and the amount of precipitation was noticeably less than in 2017 table 2 4 discussion 4 1 comparing et across irrigation regimes mean growing season et was estimated to be between 4 14 and 4 55 mm day 1 for df and between 4 20 and 4 46 mm day 1 for awd using gap filled eddy covariance estimates thus this is additional evidence that et rates do not significantly differ between the different treatments other studies have indicated a similar range of mean growing season et when compared to other conventional systems involving continuous flooding and awd both domestically and internationally table 5 based on this literature synthesis across methods climate conditions and production settings estimated growing season et ranged between 411 and 889 mm with daily et rates ranging from 3 31 to 7 87 mm day 1 table 5 when ec was used to measure et directly the range narrowed to 485 mm to 636 mm with measured daily et between 3 50 and 4 65 mm day 1 when only comparing studies reporting dap the median growing season et was 653 mm with an equivalent et rate of 4 87 mm day 1 other methods including the pm model showed a much larger range of et from 499 mm to 762 mm with estimated daily et ranging between 4 05 and 4 65 mm day 1 variation in estimated rates was likely linked to differences in climate conditions method and possibly production practices such as transplanting which changes the scope or range of observation compared to direct seeding naklang et al 1996 tuong and bhuiyan 1999 with respect to metrics such as derived daily et rate the number of days after transplanting or direct seeding indicate different growth phases that can potentially differ in productivity dingkuhn et al 1991 4 2 the effects of awd on et during the 2015 growing season in our study et rates measured using eddy covariance showed no significant differences across the entire growing season and no significant differences during drying events when et was expected to change due to the decline in wd regarding the drying events neither field experienced major declines in volumetric water content 20 vwc that significantly influenced differences in et between nf and sf studies conducted on field plots containing poorly drained clay soils have also reported similar results significant levels of drying relative to the study soils still yielded no significant differences in awd and control yields carrijo et al 2018 norton et al 2017 because we observed no significant differences in yield quality or quantity between the treatments runkle et al 2019 we assume with confidence that the plants were not significantly inhibited by water stress in grain production and associated transpiration thus a large portion of et remained unaffected by the awd treatment additionally the rice grown in both fields xl745 was a hybrid variety associated with high nutrient efficiency and water use efficiency to produce comparable yields in water limited conditions lópez lópez et al 2018 the combination of limited drying and the rice variety likely explained the lack of response in et to drying events in both fields 4 3 modeling conductance using inverted pm across the daytime period the estimated canopy conductance values from the inversion of the penman monteith equation showed values ranging roughly between 3 and 33 mm s 1 which are similar to other studies estimating canopy conductance in rice across a number of studies table 6 canopy conductance estimates from various studies table 6 show comparable ranges to the current study between 0 and 21 mm s 1 during the growing season daily maximum conductance estimated from half hourly data throughout growing seasons ranged between 24 mm s 1 2016 and 28 mm s 1 2015 for nf and 20 mm s 1 2016 and 33 mm s 1 2017 for sf with peak values occurring between 1 pm and 5 pm for both fields when the canopy is most active however based on comparisons between the model and the initial estimates of conductance the model was not able to accurately estimate conductance at any given time a comparison of initial conductance estimates from the inverted pm aet and known drivers of et such as net radiation and vpd showed no apparent relationships during the daytime period throughout the growing season while the parameterized model provided some definition to the relationships between environmental drivers and conductance across each growing season our results indicated that the rice canopy faced no apparent limitation based on vpd available energy or temperature with respect to conductance however the parameterized conductance was still able to generate more consistently accurate estimates of le when compared to using a static monthly value for canopy conductance in the penman monteith equation 4 4 improving pm aet and pm fao56 in this study the pm aet approach estimated et effectively across the growing season at the half hourly time step because the model was constrained based on time of day due to the conductance modeling et estimates generated outside of the primary period are considered less reliable and less valuable when describing mechanistic relationships between drivers and associated et during the growing season the canopy consistently experienced elevated levels of humidity 80 during the daytime period reducing the overall atmospheric demand of water we were also unable to detect significant responses in modeled stomatal conductance to changes in temperature and vpd meaning the plants were not stressed despite the elevated temperatures and increased vpd available energy was the primary driver of et throughout the growing season as evidenced through both direct observations and the use of the pm aet where measured available energy explained a significant amount of the variance in et residuals between both fields regarding our hypotheses we did not see any significant amount of variance between modeled and observed et explained using soil moisture or water level across a variety of conditions in each growing season as mentioned previously when addressing the effects of awd the canopy did not experience significant levels of drying below 40 vwc thus while we did not see a significant response low soil moisture is known to impact canopy health carrijo et al 2018 additionally the pm aet method generated acceptable estimates of et during the growing season regardless of irrigation regime regarding the pm fao56 approach it was clear that the current methodology produced comparable estimates of et in 2015 but the model performance was inconsistent across the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons based on the comparison of cumulative et amounts between the pm fao56 approach and the ec measurements when observing the pm fao56 daily et rates during the mid to late growing season we saw the best performance in 2016 when both nf and sf were under awd contrastingly the model performance was poorest in years the precipitation was greater 2017 or the fields were kept under different management strategies 2015 across the growing season the estimated kc and recommended kc were more similar in the mid to late growing season the dissimilarity between the estimated and recommended kc ini was likely due to the difference in production settings over which the coefficients were estimated water seeded rice production applies a substantially greater amount of water to the field during the early growing season compared to the drill seeding approach used in our experiments under flooded conditions at planting the resulting et would be higher compared to dry soil present in drill seeded rice meaning the ratio of crop et to reference et would also be greater in the flooded field this effect was reduced as the canopy developed in the later portion dap 60 of the growing season where variance was almost 50 less in the regression between ec derived values for kc mind and kc end and the recommended fao56 values however the early growing season does not represent a period of time where producers are actively concerned with irrigation applications as the first flood has not been applied yet producer interest in using et to schedule irrigation events would likely be tied to the mid and late growing season when plant water availability is critical to maintaining profitable yields henry et al 2013 local climate likely played a role in differences in crop coefficient as the recommended crop coefficients were generated under climates that are less humid doorenbos and pruitt 1977 doorenbos and kassam 1979 considering our findings we recommend that improvements to the method should include regional or site specific crop coefficient development to better account for differences in production practices such as water seeding vs drill seeding for practical applications the pm fao56 method could still be a viable option for producers to estimate et and schedule irrigation events the pm aet model performed well as a method for gap filling le fluxes at the half hourly time step based on our results with the pm aet capturing the amount of available energy as the difference between the net radiation and g is a critical component of estimating et as demonstrated in our experiment because available energy represents such a large portion of et in our production settings less complex et estimation methods such as the priestley taylor also a pm derivative and the hargreaves equation could prove to be valuable other studies based in rice across varying production systems have also identified available energy as the driving factor of et in rice paddy systems with the ratio of le to rn ranging from 71 to 74 during the typical growing period under flooded conditions hossen et al 2012 liu et al 2019a b timm et al 2014 while establishing robust methodology and application of tools is complex and multifaceted development of methods for estimating et at the canopy scale provides valuable information to better inform producers exploration and improved knowledge of modeling limitations and controls at the field scale can serve as a point of comparison for larger scale applications of et modeling using remote sensing jiang and ryu 2016 fisher et al 2020 5 conclusions based on this experiment s findings the use of awd as an irrigation treatment showed no significant effect on et when compared to the conventional df practice the treatments showed no significant differences in yields meaning that there was not significant water stress associated with drying events if taken as a plant health indicator et was not affected and leads us to conclude that the plants did not experience drought stress and could still access sufficient water within the soil as vwc did not fall below 20 during drying events we were able to use the pm aet approach and conductance model to estimate half hourly et across the growing season the model has potential to continue to provide mechanistic insight on driving environmental variables during different portions of the growing season with respect to et as seen in the comparison of field and recommended kc the pm fao56 method did not yield strong results we conclude that site specific crop coefficient values are necessary to generate accurate crop coefficient values especially during the early growing season however we also recognize that in practical application et during the mid to late growing season is more valuable for planning irrigation based on field et estimates

4693,with the extensive use of 2d flood models the resolution and quality of digital elevation models dems have come under greater focus especially in urban hydrology one of the major research areas in this regard is the effect of dem resolution on flood modelling this study first investigates the root causes of the impact of dem resolution on urban fluvial flood modelling outputs using dems with grid resolutions ranging from 1 m to 50 m the study then investigates how dem resolution affects the definition and characterisation of the river channel and the consequences of this for the modelled results for this purpose a separate set of merged dems was generated where the river channel as defined by the 1 m resolution dem is merged with coarser resolution dems data obtained during the flood event caused by storm desmond 2015 in cockermouth cumbria uk was used for this study the hec ras 2d model was used for all of the simulations the benchmark model obtained with the 1 m resolution dem was calibrated using measured water levels at two locations within the rivers results show that there is a 30 increase in flood extent from 58 9 ha to 79 0 ha and a 150 increase in mean flood depth from 1 74 m to 4 30 m when the resolution reduces from a 1 m grid to a 50 m grid the main reason for this is the increasing lack of definition of the river channel with an associated reduction in the estimated depth of the river resulting in reduced river channel conveyance this then leads to an increase in the flood extent and depth especially in the immediate vicinity of the river this effect is amplified when the dem grid size is greater than the river width when the 1 m resolution dem for the river channel is used in conjunction with coarser resolution dems for the surrounding areas merged dems there is a significant improvement in the agreement between the modelled and the reference case obtained from the benchmark model flood extents and depths the use of merged dems reduces the error in mean flood depth from 90 to 4 and reduces the overall rmse in flood depths from 2 6 m to 0 9 m at 30 m resolution the use of merged dems where a higher resolution dem is used to characterise the river channel in conjunction with for example a 30 m resolution dem e g the freely available nasa shuttle radar topography mission dems for the wider area could be a cost effective solution for locations where higher resolution dems may not be available keywords digital elevation model resolution fluvial flood urban flood flood extent flood depth 1 introduction between 1998 and 2017 floods affected more than two billion people worldwide and flood together with storms and droughts contributed to 80 90 of the worldwide natural disasters in the last ten years who 2020 across england the environment agency ea estimates that there are 2 7 million properties at risk of fluvial and coastal flooding three million properties at risk of pluvial flooding and 660 000 at risk from all sources coastal fluvial and pluvial environment agency 2009 with the ever increasing development of dwellings on flood plains pottier et al 2005 and more extreme and intense rainfall events due to phenomenon such as el niño driven by global warming corringham and cayan 2019 ward et al 2014 the frequency magnitude and impacts of flood events are only going to increase accurate modelling and forecasting of flooding play a major role in the better management of flood risk the rapid advancement in remote sensing data collection and monitoring over the last decade has faciltated more widespread flood modelling activities bates 2012 2004 schumann et al 2009 2007 for example nasa s shuttle radar topography mission srtm has provided a 30 m resolution digital elevation model dem globally for free from 2015 in addition many countries have their own databases of dems with higher resolution than the srtm 30 m resolution data for example within england digital terrain models dtms and digital surface models dsms of 1 m resolution are available at no cost from the ea environment agency 2018 this wide availability of digital elevation models dem together with supercomputers to handle the required simulation power has made 2d flood modelling the preferred option for predicting flood properties including extent depth and velocity especially in urban areas where surface dynamics are very high with the extensive use of 2d flood models the resolution and quality of dems have come under greater focus especially in urban hydrology ogania et al 2019 ozdemir et al 2013 peña and nardi 2018 saksena and merwade 2015a one of the major research areas in this regard is the effect of dem resolution on the estimation of flood properties it is perhaps obvious that higher resolution dems produce more accurate results as long as the model can handle such high resolution dems however with so many financial and practical challenges in producing a wide area high resolution dem 1m especially in developing countries and the associated computational burden it is not necessarily the highest resolution dem but the optimal resolution dem that is to be preferred azizian and brocca 2020 brandt 2016 although the optimal resolution for a particular area and application will depend on the catchment characteristics common criteria can be identified by investigating the dem resolution vs flood characteristics relationship in detail for various catchment and flood types for example saksena and merwade 2015 analysed a range of dem resolutions from 6 m to 30 m in fluvial flood modelling and sought to relate the differences arising from the use of the various dem resolutions with the resultant flood inundation maps they then used this information to create improved flood inundation maps from coarser resolution dems they found that increasing the grid size of the dem increased the flood areas and flood depths however application of this finding is limited to fluvial flooding and to the specific catchment characteristics and cannot be generalised to all catchment types in fact most of the studies which suggest that coarser resolution dems result in the overprediction of flood areas and or flood depths are based on fluvial modelling over time this has resulted in a common perception that regardless of flood type coarser resolution dems will always result in an overprediction of flood extent and depth however studies also show the opposite behaviour when it comes to surface water flooding ozdemir et al 2013 found that when the dem resolution is increased from 1 m to 10 cm the resultant maximum flood depth increases however this resolution range was used to identify the impacts of micro urban surface dynamics such as small bumps in the road and cannot be generalised over a wider area in which the surface dynamics are predominately due to larger structures and buildings there are also studies which show an inconsistent pattern of flood properties against dem resolution tamiru and rientjes 2005 this inconsistency in the results and conclusions of previous studies demands a more detailed analysis which should not only focus on the results but also investigate the root cause of the differences observed this will help to build a common understanding of the effect of dem resolution on flood properties such in depth analysis is lacking in most of the previous studies and some of the studies identified the need for further in depth analysis tamiru and rientjes 2005 all the studies above which investigated the effect of dem resolution used a uniform resolution for the whole area during any particular model run this makes it difficult to pinpoint the root cause of the behaviour of the flood model especially when there is a river or canal present in the model area the effect of a coarser resolution could be different depending on the land use for example a river and a developed area will exhibit different behaviours in terms of flood propagation when studied using different resolution dems when a uniform resolution dem is used over the entire study area it is difficult to pinpoint the root cause of over under prediction resulting from a coarser resolution dem this study aims to investigate the effect of dem resolution in the definition and characterisation of the river channel and the consequences of this in urban fluvial flood modelling by making use of a merged dem approach with different resolutions for river and the rest of the area the objectives are to a examine the effect of dem resolution on flood depth and flood extent b investigate the root cause of the effect and c find out whether improving the definition of the river channel by using the merged dem significantly affects the predicted outcomes for flood extent and depth 2 methodology 2 1 study site and selected flood event the study site cockermouth is a market town located at the confluence of the rivers cocker and derwent in the northwest of england cumbria uk it covers approximately 142 ha fig 1 according to the 2011 census data the town has a population of around 8800 people and 4000 households the river cocker is a tributary of the river derwent and flows for 19 km before joining the derwent in cockermouth 2011 office for national statistics 2018 the maximum river widths of the rivers within the study site are approximately 15 m and 50 m for the river cocker and the river derwent respectively the study area represents a typical urban area with a large proportion of built up area as can be seen from fig 1 furthermore since the lowest resolution used in this study was 1 m it was a preferable choice to use a small urban area for this study as it allows us to understand the local dem and flood dynamics better as demonstrated in previous studies e g leitão et al 2016 ozdemir et al 2013 cockermouth has experienced serious flood events in 2005 2009 and 2015 in 2015 the town was severely affected by three consecutive storms desmond 5 6 12 2015 eva 24 12 2015 and frank 29 30 12 2015 met office 2018 storm desmond resulted in record breaking rainfall of 341 4 mm and 405 mm over 24 hrs and 48 hrs respectively it resulted in severe flooding with 5200 homes in the northeast of england met office 2018 being impacted a peak flow of between 390 m3 s 450 m3 s was recorded on the river derwent at ouse bridge this exceeded the previous highest peak flow ever recorded 378 m3 s due to the national level significance of this event this event was well documented which is one of the reasons for the selection of this case study 2 2 data collection the topographical and hydrological data used in this study table 1 were all obtained from the ea environment agency 2009 as stated previously high resolution dtm and dsm up to 25 cm resolution are available for england at no cost from the ea all the dem used in this study were derived from the 1 m dsm and dtm volumetric flow at the river boundaries of the model domain was not available however volumetric flow time series were available for both rivers at 15 min intervals at southwaite bridge and ouse bridge for the river cocker and river derwent respectively which are located considerably farther from the modelled river boundaries this data was used in this study for boundary conditions with necessary adjustment which is explained in detail in section 2 3 as cockermouth is situated at the confluence of two rivers and also due to frequent flooding at cockermouth there are two water level gauging stations on the rivers located at p1 river cocker and p2 river derwent as indicated in fig 1 this data was used for the calibration of the fluvial flood model 2 3 flood inundation modelling 2 3 1 dem generation a dem of the study site at 1 m resolution was generated using the dsm and dtm obtained from the ea the river channels were extracted from the dtm and placed in the dsm to obtain the river depths once the 1 m resolution dem was generated it was then resampled to produce coarser dems with 2 m 5 m 10 m 30 m and 50 m resolutions except for the 30 m resolution which represents freely available srtm data other resolutions were chosen to represent a range of potentially useful dem resolutions these dems are presented in fig 2 using the range of dems produced a second set of dems were generated where the river channel of each of the dems was replaced with the river channel from the 1 m resolution dem in the following sections the dems with the river channels at the same resolution as the rest of the surveyed area are referred to as uniform dems and those where the river channel is based on a 1 m resolution dem and the rest of the surveyed area is based on a range of dem resolutions are referred to as merged dems 2 3 2 flood modelling the 2d flood inundation modelling was carried out using hec ras v5 2d u s army corps of engineering 2016 hec ras 2d is capable of simulating surface flooding caused by rainfall as well as river flooding u s army corps of engineering 2016 in this study we only analysed the fluvial flooding resulting from both rivers pluvial flooding was not modelled hec ras v5 2d provides a means of creating 2d terrains with multiple resolutions which made it possible to run the model with merged dems hec ras 2d solves either the full 2d saint venant equations or the 2d diffusive wave equations as described below u s army corps of engineering 2016 1 ζ t p x q y 0 2 p t x p 2 h y pq h n 2 p g p 2 q 2 h 2 g h ζ x p f ρ x h τ xx ρ y h τ xy 3 q t y q 2 h x pq h n 2 q g p 2 q 2 h 2 g h ζ y q f ρ y h τ yy ρ x h τ xy where h is the water depth m p and q are the specific flow in the x and y directions m3 s 1 is the surface elevation m g is the acceleration due to gravity m s 2 n is the manning roughness ρ is the water density kg m 3 τ xx τ yy and τ xy are the components of the effective shear stress and f is the coriolis s 1 equation 1 is the continuity equation and eqs 2 and 3 are the momentum equations in the x and y axis respectively together these equations are referred to as 2d saint venant equations when the diffusive wave is selected the inertial terms of the momentum equations eqs 2 and 3 are neglected and the resulting set of equations are called the 2d diffusive wave equations hec ras 2d fluvial flooding requires two main inputs dem and river boundary conditions there are two upstream boundaries cocker us and derwent us in fig 1 and one downstream boundary derwent ds in the model domain since there were no observed data available at the downstream boundary a normal depth condition calculated based on the energy slope was used despite the lack of observed data at this location the boundary condition adopted provides a semi dynamic condition i e as the flow changes so does the downstream boundary depth the input required by the hec ras 2d model for this boundary condition is the energy slope calculated at the downstream point which in our case was 0 1 measured volumetric flow time series were available for both rivers at 15 min intervals at southwaite bridge and ouse bridge for the river cocker and river derwent respectively which are located considerably farther from modelled river boundaries cocker us and derwent us in fig 1 the quantity of data and the time needed to model the entire extent of both rivers using the measured boundary points meant this was not feasible we did not use a routing model for the following reasons 1 inadequate river flow data flow data for the river cocker was only available at one location which is southwaite bridge p1 and p2 only provide water level measurements this did not only constrain the use of a routing model e g musningkum for the river cocker but also affects the impact of the river cocker on the river derwent flows when using a routing model for the river derwent 2 when comparing the water level data for both the river cocker and the river derwent fig 3 we noticed that there is no significant lag in the peaks between the upstream locations the southwaite bridge for the river cocker and the ouse bridge for the river derwent and the downstream locations p1 for the river cocker and p2 for the river derwent the water levels in the river cocker increased along the measured length without either attenuation in level or a time lag due to the above reasons we used a simple model to obtain the boundary conditions as all the analyses were carried out using the maximum flood extent and depths the main objective of the calibration was to get the modelled peaks of the flood as close as possible to the observed peaks hence we adjusted the measured river flow time series at the ouse bridge for the river derwent and at the southwaite bridge for the river cocker using a constant multiplier we started with a multiplier of 1 no changes for both boundaries cocker us and derwent us we then adjusted the multiplier for the cocker us until a good agreement was obtained between the measured and modelled water levels at p1 a good agreement was obtained using a multiplier of 1 42 once the cocker us boundary condition was fixed we then adjusted the multiplier for the derwent us until a good agreement was at p2 this was obtained using a multiplier 0 96 at the derwent us for the manning s coefficient we followed the approach described in many hydraulic modelling studies in the past aronica et al 2002 horritt and bates 2001 jung et al 2012 savage et al 2016 werner et al 2005 and used two different values a value of 0 035 corresponds to major natural rivers for river channels and a value of 0 05 for the flood plain i e the rest of the area these values were selected based on the recommended values in widely used literature e g chow 1959 arcement and schneider 1989 for all the simulations a computational mesh with 5 m square cells was used fig 4 the main aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dem resolution hence to avoid the mesh configurations affecting the model results we kept the mesh configuration consistent for all simulations with different configurations of dem 2 4 fit index analysis in order to compare the results from different resolution dems and also to compare the effect of the composition of the dems uniform or merged different measures were used in addition to the common error measure such as root means square error we also used a fit index fi analysis to compare the results fi is a measure of the error between the reference and predicted flood areas horritt and bates 2001 pappenberger et al 2007 fig 5 and equation 4 illustrate the basis of the fi analysis 4 fit i n d e x f i a ref a pre a ref a pre a tp a tp a fp a fn essentially fi varies from 0 when the true positive area is 0 and 1 when there is 100 fit on the basis of flood area between the reference and predicted maps 3 results and discussion 3 1 goodness of fit between the reference model and observations 3 1 1 river water levels fig 6 illustrates the goodness of fit between the modelled results obtained using a 1 m dem and the measured water levels at two locations the first on the river cocker p1 and the second on the river derwent p2 root mean square errors rmse between the measured and simulated water levels were calculated as being 0 28 and 0 69 respectively the main reason for a better calibration at p1 is because only one boundary has to be adjusted to calibrate at p1 which is located before the confluence of the river derwent and river cocker p2 is located after the confluence of the two rivers and therefore both boundaries had to be adjusted which resulted in a slightly poorer goodness of fit since the analysis mainly uses maximum flood depths the emphasis was placed on calibrating the peaks of the hydrograph the peaks were calibrated with 7 and 1 error at p1 and p2 respectively 3 1 2 flood extent we also compared the modelled flood extents with the measured flood extent as provided by the ea fig 7 the ea flood extent was provided with a note stating that the flood outline identifies the maximum extent of flooding and not all properties within the extent were flooded however no further information was available to identify the areas within the overall extent that were not flooded this explains why the ea flood extent is completely filled in whereas the model predicted flood extent contains many unflooded areas within the maximum extent however the outer boundary of the extents is almost similar indicating a good agreement between the modelled and measured flood extents as with most floods there are no measured flood depths available for this event the calibrated model results obtained with the 1 m dem are therefore considered to be benchmark conditions reference case for all the analysis presented 3 2 flood area and depth uniform dem fig 8 presents the maximum flood depth maps for different resolutions derived from hec ras 2d results when the uniform dems were used in the simulations the inundated area increases as the resolution of the dem becomes coarser the flooded area increased from 59 ha to 79 ha when the resolution went from 1 m to 50 m most of the small pockets within a flooded area that are not showing as flooded in the higher resolution simulations due to the surrounding taller buildings developments are indicated as having flooded in the lower resolution model runs in addition the modelled flood depths generally are higher for the coarser resolution model runs although this effect occurs almost everywhere it is significantly amplified in the vicinity of the river cocker to analyse this effect further we looked at cross sections of the two rivers as indicated on fig 9 x x on the river derwent and y y on the river cocker at dem resolutions of 1 m 10 m and 50 m for both cross sections at the coarser resolutions the riverbed becomes smoother and less deep due to the influence of the adjacent riverbanks in the case of the river cocker y y as the width of the river at this location is only approximately 15 m the river almost disappears from the simulation when the dem used is coarser than 10 m this is reflected in the flood extent and flood depth in fig 8 where the flood depth and extent become significantly higher in the vicinity of the river cocker when the resolution is coarser than 10 m flood extent and depths in the vicinity of the river derwent also increase but not as significant as for the river cocker due to the larger river width similar observations were observed for cross sections at other locations along both rivers however for the sake of brevity we have only presented one cross section from each river here we also wanted to check if this increase in flood extent and depth is only due to differences in the depth of the riverbed or if other factors contributed to this for example taller buildings being smoothed out as a result of a coarser resolution dem could also result in a larger flood extent however this could also result in the opposite effect with the coarser resolution raising certain cells due to smoothing which could then become a barrier to the floodwater propagating to other cells to see how a change in dem resolution affects the apparent flood depth we plotted the change in the flood depth e fd of a flooded cell against the change in the elevation e dem of that cell for each flooded cell and repeated this for all resolutions fig 10 efd and edem are defined in eq 5 and eq 6 repectively 5 e fd i j fd i j fd r j 6 e dem i j dem i j dem r j where fd is flood depth dem is elevation subscripts i indicates the resolution of interest 2 m 5 m 10 m 30 m and 50 m r indicates the reference resolution i e 1 m and superscript j indicates the particular cell of interest since efd and edem are essentially the differences from the reference condition in the following sections they are also referred to as the error in flood depth and error in the elevation respectively the authors are aware that the difference in the flood depth in a cell is also affected by the surrounding cells understanding these dynamics across the model domain is of great interest in modelling but are difficult to define and generalise hence we limited this analysis to the effect of the elevation difference in the particular cell of interest the results are presented in fig 10 where two colour pallets are used blue for cells located within the river area hereafter referred to as river cells and red for other locations hereafter referred to as land cells fig 10 also shows the density plots of e fd and e dem and the percentage of land red numbers and river cells blue numbers that fall in each region of the plot the distribution of edem there is an increasing spread of edem demonstrating a greater error as the dem becomes coarser for the land cells the change in the dem is almost equally distributed in terms of an increase positive edem and a decrease negative edem in relation to the benchmark for all the coarser resolutions this means the coarser resolution dem raised as many land cells as it lowered with the river cells at 2 m resolution the effect is similar to that for the land cells with edem distributed almost equally in both sides of the axis however as the dem becomes coarser the proportion of cells indicating values lower than the benchmark keeps decreasing and when the resolution is more than 30 m it becomes less than 10 both river beds are higher than the reference dem due to the influence of the river banks when the dem resolution is more than 10 m in summary we found that as the dem resolution becomes coarser i there are equal increases and decreases in the modelled elevation of individual land cells and ii the majority of the river cells are elevated due to the influence of the river banks the correlation between efd and edem the increased overflow from the river resulting from the reduction in the channel definition caused an increase in the indicated flood depths positive efd of 76 92 of the cells among these are almost all of the cells which decrease in height due to the coarser resolution negative edem the remaining 8 24 cells which indicate a reduced flood depth are all cells which increase in height at coarser resolutions the flood depth of the majority of river cells increases positive efd when using a coarser resolution dem however it can be seen that there are river cells with positive edem and negative efd meaning the raised river bed causes a reduction in the flood depths for a proportion of river cells the proportion of river cells with a positive edem and negative efd increases from 11 to 39 when the resolution changes from 2 m to 50 m these river cells are mostly located at locations where there are no barriers such as tall buildings in the flood plain this allows the floodwater to propagate out of the river reducing the flood depth of raised river cells to illustrate this we have presented a cropped area of the flood map obtained using a 50 m resolution dem in fig 11 indicating areas with a negative and a positive efd together with a road map of the same area it can be seen that the raised river cells with an increased flood depth positive efd are located along a stretch of river where it is surrounded by a highly developed area with tall buildings which confine the flow resulting in the higher flood depths of river cells in contrast raised river cells with decreased efd are located along a stretch of river where it is surrounded by a low lying undeveloped area which lets the flow propagate out of the river it is therefore important to note that although the coarser resolution dem invariably raises the river bed it doesn t always result in an increase in the flood depth within the river cells finally when using the 30 m and 50 m resolution dems as can be seen in fig 9 the lack of definition of the river channel and the banks especially for the river cocker results in very high modelled flood depths it is recognised that some of these modelled depths of up to 20 m for both river and surrounding land cells are not credible in reality 3 3 flood area and depth uniform dem vs merged dem having examined the effect of resolution on uniform dems this section examines what happens if a merged dem is used instead of a uniform dem fig 12 shows flood maps for resolutions of 10 m 30 m and 50 m for both uniform and merged dems the visual difference between the flood maps with merged and uniform dems for resolutions less than 10 m is not obvious so for the sake of brevity we have not included these plots however the results from these dems are included in the numerical analyses that are presented later flood maps based on a merged dem provide a better agreement with the baseline 1 m resolution map in terms of both flood extent and flood depth mainly due to the unchanged riverbeds compared with the uniform dem approach however there was no consistent trend of overestimation or underestimation in flood extent as we observed in fig 10 the changes in the elevation of land cells due to coarser resolution are random so consequently the effect caused by these random elevation changes in the flood properties are also expected to be random without the overbank flood caused by the river flood maps with a merged dem and resolutions of 30 m and 50 m failed to predict many small pockets of flooding resulting in an underestimation of the flooded area one reason could be that low lying small passages in the developed areas which aid flood propagation are now elevated in the coarser resolution dems 30 m and 50 m due to surrounding buildings and therefore do not propagate the flood to neighbouring locations anymore hence the increase or decrease of the flooded area with decreasing resolution in a merged dem is highly dependent upon the local terrain characteristics and there is no consistent trend in contrast to the trend that was apparent with the uniform dem approach fig 13 shows the distribution of flood depths derived using the uniform and merged dems together with vertical dotted lines showing the average flood depth it can be seen that there is greater consistency in estimation compared with the 1 m resolution dem reference case when using the merged dem approach in terms of the average depth and distribution as the resolution of the uniform dem decreases the distribution becomes smoother and wider with an increase in the estimated mean value at 50 m resolution the error in mean flood depth is 150 however when using the merged dem approach the greatest difference is 20 and this was again obtained in the case of the 50 m resolution dem there is a significant difference in both the shape of the distribution and the mean flood depth when the uniform dem resolution changes from 10 m to 30 m this is due to the width of the river channels river cocker 15 m river derwent 50 m in relation to the resolution of the dem at 1 m resolution reference flood depths there are two peaks corresponding to cells from each river and the surrounding cells this characteristic of the distribution is better matched when using the merged dem approach even when the resolution is 50 m the changes in the indicated flood area for the various dem resolutions are presented in fig 14 and table 2 for both uniform and merged dems in fig 14 the area of land flooded above the threshold depth was calculated for threshold flood depths ranging from 0 all flooded area to 5 m in the case of the uniform dems the decrease in the dem resolution from 1 m to 50 m increases the simulated total flooded area from 58 9 ha to 79 0 ha 30 the effect caused by the loss of the characterisation of the river channel can again be seen when the uniform dem resolution decreases from 10 m to 30 m the simulated flooded area increases marginally from 58 9 ha to 59 4 ha when the dem resolution decreases from 1 m to 10 m however it increases from 59 4 ha to 73 9 ha when the dem resolution decreases from 10 m to 30 m with merged dems as we already observed in fig 12 the difference in the simulated flooded area is much less and without a consistent pattern in fact the total flooded area with a 10 m resolution dem of 57 1 ha is greater than the flooded area of 50 6 ha with a 30 m resolution dem regardless of the threshold flood depth 3 4 error estimation to estimate the error caused by the use of a coarser resolution in both uniform and merged dems the overall root mean square error rmse was calculated for predicted flood depths for all the resolutions against the reference case fig 15 the flood depths in all the individual cells that were flooded in the reference case were used for this calculation this is a commonly used simple measure to calculate the error in 2d flood modelling ogania et al 2019 ozdemir et al 2013 saksena and merwade 2015a in our case flood predictions with uniform dems show an increasing linear trend against rmse saksena and merwade 2015a also found an increasing linear trend of rmse against grid size which agrees with our findings when merged dems are used there is a significant reduction in the estimated error with the rmse reducing from 2 6 m to 0 9 m at 30 m resolution and from 5 25 m to 1 m at 50 m resolution it is interesting to note that for a dem resolution up to 10 m the improvement is not significant this is because the loss of river channel characterisation is not very apparent until the dem resolution goes above 10 m in this case this will of course be dependent on the width of the river channel fig 16 shows the fit index variation which provides a measure of the error in terms of the predicted flood extent with reference to the reference flood map obtained using 1 m dem the fit index shows a progressive reduction in the agreement with the reference case as the resolution decreases from 1 m to 50 m with a 25 reduction with a 50 m resolution uniform dem to understand whether this due to false positives overestimation or false negatives underestimation the ratio between overestimation underestimation is also presented in fig 16 u o ratio this ratio is always less than one for uniform dem flood maps which indicates that there is a greater degree of overestimation in the modelled results however it is interesting to note that underestimation also occurs where the lower resolution flood models failed to predict certain flooded areas this is likely to be where the coarser resolution dems result in certain cells increasing in height thereby reducing flood propagation with merged dems again the changes up to 10 m resolution are not as significant as the resolutions greater than 10 m although the fit index did not show a significant difference with the 30 m resolution dem it is clear from the u o ratio that it is due to underprediction of the flooded area with a merged dem interestingly flood maps derived with merged dems underpredict the flooded area compared with uniform dems which always over predict this demonstrates that it is the effect of the river channel characterisation that results in the overprediction of flood area and depth when using coarser resolution dems without the loss of characterisation of the river channel the common perception of overprediction due to coarser resolution is not always true in addition the absence of a consistent trend in the u o ratio for merged dems indicates that it is largely dependent on the modelled terrain 3 5 general discussion there was no clear pattern in the changes in elevation of the land cells when coarser resolution dems were used as many land cells were raised as were lowered however there was an increase in flood depths of 80 90 for the land cells when using the coarser resolution dem ranging from 2 m to 50 m compared with the 1 m resolution dem reference case this is due to the loss of characterisation of the river channel including an apparent raising of the river bed as the dem resolution decreases resulting in more water being propagated from the river cells into the surrounding land cells this finding was corroborated by the use of merged dems in which the characterisation of the river channel remains the same throughout and a there was no consistent trend of overestimation or underestimation in flood depths and extents and b there was a better agreement between the modelled flood depths and extents and the reference case compared with uniform dems it is clear that the river width has to be one of the deciding factors when considering the optimal resolution of dem to be used when carrying out a fluvial flood model for a particular location as observed once the dem resolution exceeds the river width the overprediction of flood depth and extent increase significantly the change in the simulated flooded area resulting from the 15 m wide river cocker and the 50 m wide river derwent as the dem resolution decreased from 10 m to 30 m was 30 times higher than the change in the flooded area when the dem resolution decreased from 1 m to 10 m this demonstrates that the resolution of the dem used to characterise the river channel should be at least less than the river width although the use of a coarser resolution dem results overall in an overprediction of flood depths and extents there are river stretches where there are reduced flood depths due to the use of coarser resolution dems these are locations where the surrounding area is low lying without much urban development to confine the flood water to the river this finding helps to identify river stretches where a coarser resolution dem would possibly under or over predict flood depths such knowledge would be of great value if flood management decisions need to be taken using a flood map produced using a coarser resolution dem the availability of fit for purpose data and the national significance of the storm desmond flood event were the main reasons for the choice of the case study we believe this study area with a large proportion of built up area fig 1 represents a typical urban surface furthermore since the lowest resolution used in this study was 1 m it was a preferable choice to use a small urban area as it allowed us to study the effect of different resolution dems in detail and understand better the local influences on the dem and the consequent flood behaviour similar studies in the past also took advantage of relatively small study areas which enabled them to understand the local dynamics better leitão et al 2016 ozdemir et al 2013 for example ozdemir et al 2013 used a study area of 0 1 km2 10 ha for their study to look at the effect of dem resolutions ranging from 10 cm to 1 m leitão et al 2016 used an area of 0 9 km2 to assess the impact of combining different dems on flood modelling results although the values of the comparators could be different for another study area with a smaller or larger urban area the major finding is still valid which is there is a significant improvement in the prediction of flood properties when a dem of sufficient resolution is used to define adequately the riverbed that is then used within a 2d fluvial model in this study we have used bilinear interpolation for resampling this is one of the most commonly used methods for dem resampling esri 2020 the other most commonly used resampling method is cubic convolution interpolation it has been shown in the past that the resampling method can have an impact on the resulting dems aguilar et al 2005 chaplot et al 2006 heritage et al 2009 however we do not expect the impact of the coarsening method to be significant in comparison to the coarsening effect itself especially at resolutions coarser than 10 m where the coarsening effects are very significant to assess this we compared the effect of coarsening with the effect of the coarsening method for 2 m 10 m and 50 m resolution dems we compared bilinear interpolation the one used in this study with cubic convolution interpolation keys 1981 we did not test the nearest neighbour approach for dem resampling as it is primarily used for discrete data esri 2020 the nearest neighbour approach will also result in a rougher dem surface which is then likely to cause instabilities in the flood model especially at resolutions coarser than 10 m fig 17 shows the boxplot of errors caused by coarsening with reference to the 1 m dem and the boxplot of differences between the cell heights obtained using the different resampling methods bilinear interpolation and cubic convolution interpolation for 2 m 10 m and 50 m resolution dems as can be seen from the plots the difference in cell heights using the two different methods is almost negligible compared to the error caused by the coarsening at resolutions of 10 m and 50 m although at 2 m resolution the sampling effect is greater it still considerably less than the differences caused by the coarsening effect in addition the aim of the study was to demonstrate the advantage of merged dems over coarser resolution dems where this effect is negligible due to the scope of this study we kept the mesh size constant for all the simulations so there was no significant change in the computational time however in other situations the size of the computational mesh will be based on the dem resolution the coarser the dem resolution the larger the computational mesh size will be this will significantly reduce the computational burden and can be utilised in modelling applications such as flood warning systems in this study we have not addressed issues that arise from dem errors during measurement and post processing however we acknowledge the fact that depending the techniques used these errors could be as significant as coarsening errors abily et al 2016 wang et al 2012 zotou et al 2020 further recent studies have also raised the issue of the blocking out effect of buildings in dtms which prevent flood flows and possible storage effects of the buildings in flood modelling bellos and tsakiris 2015 we believe in future in addition to dem and mesh configurations this also needs to be studied in detail in 2d flood modelling given its potential impact on the flood dynamics in a built up area 4 conclusion this study first investigates the root causes of the impact of dem resolution on urban fluvial flood modelling using dems ranging from 1 m to 50 m dems with resolutions of 2 m to 50 m were derived by resampling the 1 m dem the study then investigates how dem resolution affects the definition and characterisation of the river channel and the consequences of this for the modelled results for this purpose a separate set of merged dems were generated where the river channel obtained with the 1 m resolution dem is merged with coarser resolution dems data obtained during the flood event caused by storm desmond 2015 in cockermouth cumbria uk was used for this study the study area covers around 142 ha with the town centre located at the confluence of two rivers the river derwent and the river cocker the hec ras 2d model was used for all the simulations the benchmark model obtained with the 1 m resolution dem was calibrated with measured water levels at two locations within the rivers the following conclusions can be made from the results the use of coarser resolution dems in the model affected river cells in a different way to the land cells within the river channel the coarser resolution dems raised more cells than it lowered when using a 2 m resolution dem 53 of cells were raised and 47 lowered however when using a 50 m resolution dem 91 were raised and 9 lowered for the land cells there was less of an effect with the ratio between raising and lowering the ratio was between 0 9 and 1 7 at different dem resolutions overall the flood depth and flood extent increased with decreasing dem resolution there was a 30 increase in flood extent from 58 9 ha to 79 0 ha and a 150 increase in mean flood depth from 1 74 m to 4 30 m when the dem resolution reduces from 1 m grid to 50 m grid the main reason for this is the increasing lack of definition of the river channel with an associated reduction in the estimated depth of the river resulting in reduced river channel conveyance this then leads to an increase in the flood extent and depth especially in the immediate vicinity of the river despite the overall over prediction of flood depths due to the use of a coarser resolution dem there were also areas both inside and outside of the river channel where the flood depth was under predicted the main reason being the increased elevation of these areas due to the use of a coarser resolution dem in river stretches where there are no developments or there are lower river banks the flood water propagates into the surrounding areas when using coarser resolution dems this consequently reduces the flood depth of the river cells at these river stretches this means the coarser resolution dem does not always increase the flood depth everywhere within the river the land use and terrain of the surrounding area also have an associated effect when the river channel is characterised using a high resolution dem and is then used in conjunction with a coarser resolution dem for the surrounding area merged dems there is a significant improvement in the agreement between the modelled and the actual results of flood depths the use of merged dems reduced the error in mean flood depth from 150 to 20 and the overall rmse in flood depths from 5 26 m to 0 98 m at 50 m resolution however there is no consistent trend in the rmse with the resolution of the merged dem this is different to the findings with the uniform dem where the rmse increases linearly with the resolution in terms of flood extent the use of coarser resolution merged dems tend to underpredict the affected area compared with uniform dems however the fit index comparison demonstrates that merged dems provide a better indication of flood extent than uniform dems it is clear that the resolution of the dem used has an impact on the simulated flood extents and depths for optimal results the resolution of the dem used for a particular location should be at least finer than the width of the river channel we have demonstrated that the use of merged dems may be a cost effective way of obtaining fit for purpose flood maps in locations where high resolution dems have not yet been developed the use of merged dems significantly improves the flood prediction in comparison to uniform dems this could help improve flood modelling without having to survey the entire model extent when there are financial and practical limitation which is often the case especially in developing countries for example nasa s shuttle radar topography mission dems which are 30 m resolution are freely available however when this dem is used in a fluvial flood model the resulting flood depths and flood extents could be significantly higher or sometimes lower depending on factors such the widths of river channels the degree of urbanisation and the topography of the surrounding areas this study suggests that using the srtm dems together with a better representation of the river channel derived from bathymetry or a higher resolution dem e g 1 m might be a more cost effective approach than seeking to obtain a high resolution dem for the whole area in addition there may not be the resources available to generate a wide scale 1 m resolution dem our findings also have implications for other flood risk management activities such as the identification of emergency evacuation routes the approach we have developed provides a means of developing reliable flood risk maps without necessarily requiring a high resolution dem for the total affected area such maps can then inform the development of better overall flood risk management practices credit authorship contribution

4693,with the extensive use of 2d flood models the resolution and quality of digital elevation models dems have come under greater focus especially in urban hydrology one of the major research areas in this regard is the effect of dem resolution on flood modelling this study first investigates the root causes of the impact of dem resolution on urban fluvial flood modelling outputs using dems with grid resolutions ranging from 1 m to 50 m the study then investigates how dem resolution affects the definition and characterisation of the river channel and the consequences of this for the modelled results for this purpose a separate set of merged dems was generated where the river channel as defined by the 1 m resolution dem is merged with coarser resolution dems data obtained during the flood event caused by storm desmond 2015 in cockermouth cumbria uk was used for this study the hec ras 2d model was used for all of the simulations the benchmark model obtained with the 1 m resolution dem was calibrated using measured water levels at two locations within the rivers results show that there is a 30 increase in flood extent from 58 9 ha to 79 0 ha and a 150 increase in mean flood depth from 1 74 m to 4 30 m when the resolution reduces from a 1 m grid to a 50 m grid the main reason for this is the increasing lack of definition of the river channel with an associated reduction in the estimated depth of the river resulting in reduced river channel conveyance this then leads to an increase in the flood extent and depth especially in the immediate vicinity of the river this effect is amplified when the dem grid size is greater than the river width when the 1 m resolution dem for the river channel is used in conjunction with coarser resolution dems for the surrounding areas merged dems there is a significant improvement in the agreement between the modelled and the reference case obtained from the benchmark model flood extents and depths the use of merged dems reduces the error in mean flood depth from 90 to 4 and reduces the overall rmse in flood depths from 2 6 m to 0 9 m at 30 m resolution the use of merged dems where a higher resolution dem is used to characterise the river channel in conjunction with for example a 30 m resolution dem e g the freely available nasa shuttle radar topography mission dems for the wider area could be a cost effective solution for locations where higher resolution dems may not be available keywords digital elevation model resolution fluvial flood urban flood flood extent flood depth 1 introduction between 1998 and 2017 floods affected more than two billion people worldwide and flood together with storms and droughts contributed to 80 90 of the worldwide natural disasters in the last ten years who 2020 across england the environment agency ea estimates that there are 2 7 million properties at risk of fluvial and coastal flooding three million properties at risk of pluvial flooding and 660 000 at risk from all sources coastal fluvial and pluvial environment agency 2009 with the ever increasing development of dwellings on flood plains pottier et al 2005 and more extreme and intense rainfall events due to phenomenon such as el niño driven by global warming corringham and cayan 2019 ward et al 2014 the frequency magnitude and impacts of flood events are only going to increase accurate modelling and forecasting of flooding play a major role in the better management of flood risk the rapid advancement in remote sensing data collection and monitoring over the last decade has faciltated more widespread flood modelling activities bates 2012 2004 schumann et al 2009 2007 for example nasa s shuttle radar topography mission srtm has provided a 30 m resolution digital elevation model dem globally for free from 2015 in addition many countries have their own databases of dems with higher resolution than the srtm 30 m resolution data for example within england digital terrain models dtms and digital surface models dsms of 1 m resolution are available at no cost from the ea environment agency 2018 this wide availability of digital elevation models dem together with supercomputers to handle the required simulation power has made 2d flood modelling the preferred option for predicting flood properties including extent depth and velocity especially in urban areas where surface dynamics are very high with the extensive use of 2d flood models the resolution and quality of dems have come under greater focus especially in urban hydrology ogania et al 2019 ozdemir et al 2013 peña and nardi 2018 saksena and merwade 2015a one of the major research areas in this regard is the effect of dem resolution on the estimation of flood properties it is perhaps obvious that higher resolution dems produce more accurate results as long as the model can handle such high resolution dems however with so many financial and practical challenges in producing a wide area high resolution dem 1m especially in developing countries and the associated computational burden it is not necessarily the highest resolution dem but the optimal resolution dem that is to be preferred azizian and brocca 2020 brandt 2016 although the optimal resolution for a particular area and application will depend on the catchment characteristics common criteria can be identified by investigating the dem resolution vs flood characteristics relationship in detail for various catchment and flood types for example saksena and merwade 2015 analysed a range of dem resolutions from 6 m to 30 m in fluvial flood modelling and sought to relate the differences arising from the use of the various dem resolutions with the resultant flood inundation maps they then used this information to create improved flood inundation maps from coarser resolution dems they found that increasing the grid size of the dem increased the flood areas and flood depths however application of this finding is limited to fluvial flooding and to the specific catchment characteristics and cannot be generalised to all catchment types in fact most of the studies which suggest that coarser resolution dems result in the overprediction of flood areas and or flood depths are based on fluvial modelling over time this has resulted in a common perception that regardless of flood type coarser resolution dems will always result in an overprediction of flood extent and depth however studies also show the opposite behaviour when it comes to surface water flooding ozdemir et al 2013 found that when the dem resolution is increased from 1 m to 10 cm the resultant maximum flood depth increases however this resolution range was used to identify the impacts of micro urban surface dynamics such as small bumps in the road and cannot be generalised over a wider area in which the surface dynamics are predominately due to larger structures and buildings there are also studies which show an inconsistent pattern of flood properties against dem resolution tamiru and rientjes 2005 this inconsistency in the results and conclusions of previous studies demands a more detailed analysis which should not only focus on the results but also investigate the root cause of the differences observed this will help to build a common understanding of the effect of dem resolution on flood properties such in depth analysis is lacking in most of the previous studies and some of the studies identified the need for further in depth analysis tamiru and rientjes 2005 all the studies above which investigated the effect of dem resolution used a uniform resolution for the whole area during any particular model run this makes it difficult to pinpoint the root cause of the behaviour of the flood model especially when there is a river or canal present in the model area the effect of a coarser resolution could be different depending on the land use for example a river and a developed area will exhibit different behaviours in terms of flood propagation when studied using different resolution dems when a uniform resolution dem is used over the entire study area it is difficult to pinpoint the root cause of over under prediction resulting from a coarser resolution dem this study aims to investigate the effect of dem resolution in the definition and characterisation of the river channel and the consequences of this in urban fluvial flood modelling by making use of a merged dem approach with different resolutions for river and the rest of the area the objectives are to a examine the effect of dem resolution on flood depth and flood extent b investigate the root cause of the effect and c find out whether improving the definition of the river channel by using the merged dem significantly affects the predicted outcomes for flood extent and depth 2 methodology 2 1 study site and selected flood event the study site cockermouth is a market town located at the confluence of the rivers cocker and derwent in the northwest of england cumbria uk it covers approximately 142 ha fig 1 according to the 2011 census data the town has a population of around 8800 people and 4000 households the river cocker is a tributary of the river derwent and flows for 19 km before joining the derwent in cockermouth 2011 office for national statistics 2018 the maximum river widths of the rivers within the study site are approximately 15 m and 50 m for the river cocker and the river derwent respectively the study area represents a typical urban area with a large proportion of built up area as can be seen from fig 1 furthermore since the lowest resolution used in this study was 1 m it was a preferable choice to use a small urban area for this study as it allows us to understand the local dem and flood dynamics better as demonstrated in previous studies e g leitão et al 2016 ozdemir et al 2013 cockermouth has experienced serious flood events in 2005 2009 and 2015 in 2015 the town was severely affected by three consecutive storms desmond 5 6 12 2015 eva 24 12 2015 and frank 29 30 12 2015 met office 2018 storm desmond resulted in record breaking rainfall of 341 4 mm and 405 mm over 24 hrs and 48 hrs respectively it resulted in severe flooding with 5200 homes in the northeast of england met office 2018 being impacted a peak flow of between 390 m3 s 450 m3 s was recorded on the river derwent at ouse bridge this exceeded the previous highest peak flow ever recorded 378 m3 s due to the national level significance of this event this event was well documented which is one of the reasons for the selection of this case study 2 2 data collection the topographical and hydrological data used in this study table 1 were all obtained from the ea environment agency 2009 as stated previously high resolution dtm and dsm up to 25 cm resolution are available for england at no cost from the ea all the dem used in this study were derived from the 1 m dsm and dtm volumetric flow at the river boundaries of the model domain was not available however volumetric flow time series were available for both rivers at 15 min intervals at southwaite bridge and ouse bridge for the river cocker and river derwent respectively which are located considerably farther from the modelled river boundaries this data was used in this study for boundary conditions with necessary adjustment which is explained in detail in section 2 3 as cockermouth is situated at the confluence of two rivers and also due to frequent flooding at cockermouth there are two water level gauging stations on the rivers located at p1 river cocker and p2 river derwent as indicated in fig 1 this data was used for the calibration of the fluvial flood model 2 3 flood inundation modelling 2 3 1 dem generation a dem of the study site at 1 m resolution was generated using the dsm and dtm obtained from the ea the river channels were extracted from the dtm and placed in the dsm to obtain the river depths once the 1 m resolution dem was generated it was then resampled to produce coarser dems with 2 m 5 m 10 m 30 m and 50 m resolutions except for the 30 m resolution which represents freely available srtm data other resolutions were chosen to represent a range of potentially useful dem resolutions these dems are presented in fig 2 using the range of dems produced a second set of dems were generated where the river channel of each of the dems was replaced with the river channel from the 1 m resolution dem in the following sections the dems with the river channels at the same resolution as the rest of the surveyed area are referred to as uniform dems and those where the river channel is based on a 1 m resolution dem and the rest of the surveyed area is based on a range of dem resolutions are referred to as merged dems 2 3 2 flood modelling the 2d flood inundation modelling was carried out using hec ras v5 2d u s army corps of engineering 2016 hec ras 2d is capable of simulating surface flooding caused by rainfall as well as river flooding u s army corps of engineering 2016 in this study we only analysed the fluvial flooding resulting from both rivers pluvial flooding was not modelled hec ras v5 2d provides a means of creating 2d terrains with multiple resolutions which made it possible to run the model with merged dems hec ras 2d solves either the full 2d saint venant equations or the 2d diffusive wave equations as described below u s army corps of engineering 2016 1 ζ t p x q y 0 2 p t x p 2 h y pq h n 2 p g p 2 q 2 h 2 g h ζ x p f ρ x h τ xx ρ y h τ xy 3 q t y q 2 h x pq h n 2 q g p 2 q 2 h 2 g h ζ y q f ρ

momentum equations in the x and y axis respectively together these equations are referred to as 2d saint venant equations when the diffusive wave is selected the inertial terms of the momentum equations eqs 2 and 3 are neglected and the resulting set of equations are called the 2d diffusive wave equations hec ras 2d fluvial flooding requires two main inputs dem and river boundary conditions there are two upstream boundaries cocker us and derwent us in fig 1 and one downstream boundary derwent ds in the model domain since there were no observed data available at the downstream boundary a normal depth condition calculated based on the energy slope was used despite the lack of observed data at this location the boundary condition adopted provides a semi dynamic condition i e as the flow changes so does the downstream boundary depth the input required by the hec ras 2d model for this boundary condition is the energy slope calculated at the downstream point which in our case was 0 1 measured volumetric flow time series were available for both rivers at 15 min intervals at southwaite bridge and ouse bridge for the river cocker and river derwent respectively which are located considerably farther from modelled river boundaries cocker us and derwent us in fig 1 the quantity of data and the time needed to model the entire extent of both rivers using the measured boundary points meant this was not feasible we did not use a routing model for the following reasons 1 inadequate river flow data flow data for the river cocker was only available at one location which is southwaite bridge p1 and p2 only provide water level measurements this did not only constrain the use of a routing model e g musningkum for the river cocker but also affects the impact of the river cocker on the river derwent flows when using a routing model for the river derwent 2 when comparing the water level data for both the river cocker and the river derwent fig 3 we noticed that there is no significant lag in the peaks between the upstream locations the southwaite bridge for the river cocker and the ouse bridge for the river derwent and the downstream locations p1 for the river cocker and p2 for the river derwent the water levels in the river cocker increased along the measured length without either attenuation in level or a time lag due to the above reasons we used a simple model to obtain the boundary conditions as all the analyses were carried out using the maximum flood extent and depths the main objective of the calibration was to get the modelled peaks of the flood as close as possible to the observed peaks hence we adjusted the measured river flow time series at the ouse bridge for the river derwent and at the southwaite bridge for the river cocker using a constant multiplier we started with a multiplier of 1 no changes for both boundaries cocker us and derwent us we then adjusted the multiplier for the cocker us until a good agreement was obtained between the measured and modelled water levels at p1 a good agreement was obtained using a multiplier of 1 42 once the cocker us boundary condition was fixed we then adjusted the multiplier for the derwent us until a good agreement was at p2 this was obtained using a multiplier 0 96 at the derwent us for the manning s coefficient we followed the approach described in many hydraulic modelling studies in the past aronica et al 2002 horritt and bates 2001 jung et al 2012 savage et al 2016 werner et al 2005 and used two different values a value of 0 035 corresponds to major natural rivers for river channels and a value of 0 05 for the flood plain i e the rest of the area these values were selected based on the recommended values in widely used literature e g chow 1959 arcement and schneider 1989 for all the simulations a computational mesh with 5 m square cells was used fig 4 the main aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dem resolution hence to avoid the mesh configurations affecting the model results we kept the mesh configuration consistent for all simulations with different configurations of dem 2 4 fit index analysis in order to compare the results from different resolution dems and also to compare the effect of the composition of the dems uniform or merged different measures were used in addition to the common error measure such as root means square error we also used a fit index fi analysis to compare the results fi is a measure of the error between the reference and predicted flood areas horritt and bates 2001 pappenberger et al 2007 fig 5 and equation 4 illustrate the basis of the fi analysis 4 fit i n d e x f i a ref a pre a ref a pre a tp a tp a fp a fn essentially fi varies from 0 when the true positive area is 0 and 1 when there is 100 fit on the basis of flood area between the reference and predicted maps 3 results and discussion 3 1 goodness of fit between the reference model and observations 3 1 1 river water levels fig 6 illustrates the goodness of fit between the modelled results obtained using a 1 m dem and the measured water levels at two locations the first on the river cocker p1 and the second on the river derwent p2 root mean square errors rmse between the measured and simulated water levels were calculated as being 0 28 and 0 69 respectively the main reason for a better calibration at p1 is because only one boundary has to be adjusted to calibrate at p1 which is located before the confluence of the river derwent and river cocker p2 is located after the confluence of the two rivers and therefore both boundaries had to be adjusted which resulted in a slightly poorer goodness of fit since the analysis mainly uses maximum flood depths the emphasis was placed on calibrating the peaks of the hydrograph the peaks were calibrated with 7 and 1 error at p1 and p2 respectively 3 1 2 flood extent we also compared the modelled flood extents with the measured flood extent as provided by the ea fig 7 the ea flood extent was provided with a note stating that the flood outline identifies the maximum extent of flooding and not all properties within the extent were flooded however no further information was available to identify the areas within the overall extent that were not flooded this explains why the ea flood extent is completely filled in whereas the model predicted flood extent contains many unflooded areas within the maximum extent however the outer boundary of the extents is almost similar indicating a good agreement between the modelled and measured flood extents as with most floods there are no measured flood depths available for this event the calibrated model results obtained with the 1 m dem are therefore considered to be benchmark conditions reference case for all the analysis presented 3 2 flood area and depth uniform dem fig 8 presents the maximum flood depth maps for different resolutions derived from hec ras 2d results when the uniform dems were used in the simulations the inundated area increases as the resolution of the dem becomes coarser the flooded area increased from 59 ha to 79 ha when the resolution went from 1 m to 50 m most of the small pockets within a flooded area that are not showing as flooded in the higher resolution simulations due to the surrounding taller buildings developments are indicated as having flooded in the lower resolution model runs in addition the modelled flood depths generally are higher for the coarser resolution model runs although this effect occurs almost everywhere it is significantly amplified in the vicinity of the river cocker to analyse this effect further we looked at cross sections of the two rivers as indicated on fig 9 x x on the river derwent and y y on the river cocker at dem resolutions of 1 m 10 m and 50 m for both cross sections at the coarser resolutions the riverbed becomes smoother and less deep due to the influence of the adjacent riverbanks in the case of the river cocker y y as the width of the river at this location is only approximately 15 m the river almost disappears from the simulation when the dem used is coarser than 10 m this is reflected in the flood extent and flood depth in fig 8 where the flood depth and extent become significantly higher in the vicinity of the river cocker when the resolution is coarser than 10 m flood extent and depths in the vicinity of the river derwent also increase but not as significant as for the river cocker due to the larger river width similar observations were observed for cross sections at other locations along both rivers however for the sake of brevity we have only presented one cross section from each river here we also wanted to check if this increase in flood extent and depth is only due to differences in the depth of the riverbed or if other factors contributed to this for example taller buildings being smoothed out as a result of a coarser resolution dem could also result in a larger flood extent however this could also result in the opposite effect with the coarser resolution raising certain cells due to smoothing which could then become a barrier to the floodwater propagating to other cells to see how a change in dem resolution affects the apparent flood depth we plotted the change in the flood depth e fd of a flooded cell against the change in the elevation e dem of that cell for each flooded cell and repeated this for all resolutions fig 10 efd and edem are defined in eq 5 and eq 6 repectively 5 e fd i j fd i j fd r j 6 e dem i j dem i j dem r j where fd is flood depth dem is elevation subscripts i indicates the resolution of interest 2 m 5 m 10 m 30 m and 50 m r indicates the reference resolution i e 1 m and superscript j indicates the particular cell of interest since efd and edem are essentially the differences from the reference condition in the following sections they are also referred to as the error in flood depth and error in the elevation respectively the authors are aware that the difference in the flood depth in a cell is also affected by the surrounding cells understanding these dynamics across the model domain is of great interest in modelling but are difficult to define and generalise hence we limited this analysis to the effect of the elevation difference in the particular cell of interest the results are presented in fig 10 where two colour pallets are used blue for cells located within the river area hereafter referred to as river cells and red for other locations hereafter referred to as land cells fig 10 also shows the density plots of e fd and e dem and the percentage of land red numbers and river cells blue numbers that fall in each region of the plot the distribution of edem there is an increasing spread of edem demonstrating a greater error as the dem becomes coarser for the land cells the change in the dem is almost equally distributed in terms of an increase positive edem and a decrease negative edem in relation to the benchmark for all the coarser resolutions this means the coarser resolution dem raised as many land cells as it lowered with the river cells at 2 m resolution the effect is similar to that for the land cells with edem distributed almost equally in both sides of the axis however as the dem becomes coarser the proportion of cells indicating values lower than the benchmark keeps decreasing and when the resolution is more than 30 m it becomes less than 10 both river beds are higher than the reference dem due to the influence of the river banks when the dem resolution is more than 10 m in summary we found that as the dem resolution becomes coarser i there are equal increases and decreases in the modelled elevation of individual land cells and ii the majority of the river cells are elevated due to the influence of the river banks the correlation between efd and edem the increased overflow from the river resulting from the reduction in the channel definition caused an increase in the indicated flood depths positive efd of 76 92 of the cells among these are almost all of the cells which decrease in height due to the coarser resolution negative edem the remaining 8 24 cells which indicate a reduced flood depth are all cells which increase in height at coarser resolutions the flood depth of the majority of river cells increases positive efd when using a coarser resolution dem however it can be seen that there are river cells with positive edem and negative efd meaning the raised river bed causes a reduction in the flood depths for a proportion of river cells the proportion of river cells with a positive edem and negative efd increases from 11 to 39 when the resolution changes from 2 m to 50 m these river cells are mostly located at locations where there are no barriers such as tall buildings in the flood plain this allows the floodwater to propagate out of the river reducing the flood depth of raised river cells to illustrate this we have presented a cropped area of the flood map obtained using a 50 m resolution dem in fig 11 indicating areas with a negative and a positive efd together with a road map of the same area it can be seen that the raised river cells with an increased flood depth positive efd are located along a stretch of river where it is surrounded by a highly developed area with tall buildings which confine the flow resulting in the higher flood depths of river cells in contrast raised river cells with decreased efd are located along a stretch of river where it is surrounded by a low lying undeveloped area which lets the flow propagate out of the river it is therefore important to note that although the coarser resolution dem invariably raises the river bed it doesn t always result in an increase in the flood depth within the river cells finally when using the 30 m and 50 m resolution dems as can be seen in fig 9 the lack of definition of the river channel and the banks especially for the river cocker results in very high modelled flood depths it is recognised that some of these modelled depths of up to 20 m for both river and surrounding land cells are not credible in reality 3 3 flood area and depth uniform dem vs merged dem having examined the effect of resolution on uniform dems this section examines what happens if a merged dem is used instead of a uniform dem fig 12 shows flood maps for resolutions of 10 m 30 m and 50 m for both uniform and merged dems the visual difference between the flood maps with merged and uniform dems for resolutions less than 10 m is not obvious so for the sake of brevity we have not included these plots however the results from these dems are included in the numerical analyses that are presented later flood maps based on a merged dem provide a better agreement with the baseline 1 m resolution map in terms of both flood extent and flood depth mainly due to the unchanged riverbeds compared with the uniform dem approach however there was no consistent trend of overestimation or underestimation in flood extent as we observed in fig 10 the changes in the elevation of land cells due to coarser resolution are random so consequently the effect caused by these random elevation changes in the flood properties are also expected to be random without the overbank flood caused by the river flood maps with a merged dem and resolutions of 30 m and 50 m failed to predict many small pockets of flooding resulting in an underestimation of the flooded area one reason could be that low lying small passages in the developed areas which aid flood propagation are now elevated in the coarser resolution dems 30 m and 50 m due to surrounding buildings and therefore do not propagate the flood to neighbouring locations anymore hence the increase or decrease of the flooded area with decreasing resolution in a merged dem is highly dependent upon the local terrain characteristics and there is no consistent trend in contrast to the trend that was apparent with the uniform dem approach fig 13 shows the distribution of flood depths derived using the uniform and merged dems together with vertical dotted lines showing the average flood depth it can be seen that there is greater consistency in estimation compared with the 1 m resolution dem reference case when using the merged dem approach in terms of the average depth and distribution as the resolution of the uniform dem decreases the distribution becomes smoother and wider with an increase in the estimated mean value at 50 m resolution the error in mean flood depth is 150 however when using the merged dem approach the greatest difference is 20 and this was again obtained in the case of the 50 m resolution dem there is a significant difference in both the shape of the distribution and the mean flood depth when the uniform dem resolution changes from 10 m to 30 m this is due to the width of the river channels river cocker 15 m river derwent 50 m in relation to the resolution of the dem at 1 m resolution reference flood depths there are two peaks corresponding to cells from each river and the surrounding cells this characteristic of the distribution is better matched when using the merged dem approach even when the resolution is 50 m the changes in the indicated flood area for the various dem resolutions are presented in fig 14 and table 2 for both uniform and merged dems in fig 14 the area of land flooded above the threshold depth was calculated for threshold flood depths ranging from 0 all flooded area to 5 m in the case of the uniform dems the decrease in the dem resolution from 1 m to 50 m increases the simulated total flooded area from 58 9 ha to 79 0 ha 30 the effect caused by the loss of the characterisation of the river channel can again be seen when the uniform dem resolution decreases from 10 m to 30 m the simulated flooded area increases marginally from 58 9 ha to 59 4 ha when the dem resolution decreases from 1 m to 10 m however it increases from 59 4 ha to 73 9 ha when the dem resolution decreases from 10 m to 30 m with merged dems as we already observed in fig 12 the difference in the simulated flooded area is much less and without a consistent pattern in fact the total flooded area with a 10 m resolution dem of 57 1 ha is greater than the flooded area of 50 6 ha with a 30 m resolution dem regardless of the threshold flood depth 3 4 error estimation to estimate the error caused by the use of a coarser resolution in both uniform and merged dems the overall root mean square error rmse was calculated for predicted flood depths for all the resolutions against the reference case fig 15 the flood depths in all the individual cells that were flooded in the reference case were used for this calculation this is a commonly used simple measure to calculate the error in 2d flood modelling ogania et al 2019 ozdemir et al 2013 saksena and merwade 2015a in our case flood predictions with uniform dems show an increasing linear trend against rmse saksena and merwade 2015a also found an increasing linear trend of rmse against grid size which agrees with our findings when merged dems are used there is a significant reduction in the estimated error with the rmse reducing from 2 6 m to 0 9 m at 30 m resolution and from 5 25 m to 1 m at 50 m resolution it is interesting to note that for a dem resolution up to 10 m the improvement is not significant this is because the loss of river channel characterisation is not very apparent until the dem resolution goes above 10 m in this case this will of course be dependent on the width of the river channel fig 16 shows the fit index variation which provides a measure of the error in terms of the predicted flood extent with reference to the reference flood map obtained using 1 m dem the fit index shows a progressive reduction in the agreement with the reference case as the resolution decreases from 1 m to 50 m with a 25 reduction with a 50 m resolution uniform dem to understand whether this due to false positives overestimation or false negatives underestimation the ratio between overestimation underestimation is also presented in fig 16 u o ratio this ratio is always less than one for uniform dem flood maps which indicates that there is a greater degree of overestimation in the modelled results however it is interesting to note that underestimation also occurs where the lower resolution flood models failed to predict certain flooded areas this is likely to be where the coarser resolution dems result in certain cells increasing in height thereby reducing flood propagation with merged dems again the changes up to 10 m resolution are not as significant as the resolutions greater than 10 m although the fit index did not show a significant difference with the 30 m resolution dem it is clear from the u o ratio that it is due to underprediction of the flooded area with a merged dem interestingly flood maps derived with merged dems underpredict the flooded area compared with uniform dems which always over predict this demonstrates that it is the effect of the river channel characterisation that results in the overprediction of flood area and depth when using coarser resolution dems without the loss of characterisation of the river channel the common perception of overprediction due to coarser resolution is not always true in addition the absence of a consistent trend in the u o ratio for merged dems indicates that it is largely dependent on the modelled terrain 3 5 general discussion there was no clear pattern in the changes in elevation of the land cells when coarser resolution dems were used as many land cells were raised as were lowered however there was an increase in flood depths of 80 90 for the land cells when using the coarser resolution dem ranging from 2 m to 50 m compared with the 1 m resolution dem reference case this is due to the loss of characterisation of the river channel including an apparent raising of the river bed as the dem resolution decreases resulting in more water being propagated from the river cells into the surrounding land cells this finding was corroborated by the use of merged dems in which the characterisation of the river channel remains the same throughout and a there was no consistent trend of overestimation or underestimation in flood depths and extents and b there was a better agreement between the modelled flood depths and extents and the reference case compared with uniform dems it is clear that the river width has to be one of the deciding factors when considering the optimal resolution of dem to be used when carrying out a fluvial flood model for a particular location as observed once the dem resolution exceeds the river width the overprediction of flood depth and extent increase significantly the change in the simulated flooded area resulting from the 15 m wide river cocker and the 50 m wide river derwent as the dem resolution decreased from 10 m to 30 m was 30 times higher than the change in the flooded area when the dem resolution decreased from 1 m to 10 m this demonstrates that the resolution of the dem used to characterise the river channel should be at least less than the river width although the use of a coarser resolution dem results overall in an overprediction of flood depths and extents there are river stretches where there are reduced flood depths due to the use of coarser resolution dems these are locations where the surrounding area is low lying without much urban development to confine the flood water to the river this finding helps to identify river stretches where a coarser resolution dem would possibly under or over predict flood depths such knowledge would be of great value if flood management decisions need to be taken using a flood map produced using a coarser resolution dem the availability of fit for purpose data and the national significance of the storm desmond flood event were the main reasons for the choice of the case study we believe this study area with a large proportion of built up area fig 1 represents a typical urban surface furthermore since the lowest resolution used in this study was 1 m it was a preferable choice to use a small urban area as it allowed us to study the effect of different resolution dems in detail and understand better the local influences on the dem and the consequent flood behaviour similar studies in the past also took advantage of relatively small study areas which enabled them to understand the local dynamics better leitão et al 2016 ozdemir et al 2013 for example ozdemir et al 2013 used a study area of 0 1 km2 10 ha for their study to look at the effect of dem resolutions ranging from 10 cm to 1 m leitão et al 2016 used an area of 0 9 km2 to assess the impact of combining different dems on flood modelling results although the values of the comparators could be different for another study area with a smaller or larger urban area the major finding is still valid which is there is a significant improvement in the prediction of flood properties when a dem of sufficient resolution is used to define adequately the riverbed that is then used within a 2d fluvial model in this study we have used bilinear interpolation for resampling this is one of the most commonly used methods for dem resampling esri 2020 the other most commonly used resampling method is cubic convolution interpolation it has been shown in the past that the resampling method can have an impact on the resulting dems aguilar et al 2005 chaplot et al 2006 heritage et al 2009 however we do not expect the impact of the coarsening method to be significant in comparison to the coarsening effect itself especially at resolutions coarser than 10 m where the coarsening effects are very significant to assess this we compared the effect of coarsening with the effect of the coarsening method for 2 m 10 m and 50 m resolution dems we compared bilinear interpolation the one used in this study with cubic convolution interpolation keys 1981 we did not test the nearest neighbour approach for dem resampling as it is primarily used for discrete data esri 2020 the nearest neighbour approach will also result in a rougher dem surface which is then likely to cause instabilities in the flood model especially at resolutions coarser than 10 m fig 17 shows the boxplot of errors caused by coarsening with reference to the 1 m dem and the boxplot of differences between the cell heights obtained using the different resampling methods bilinear interpolation and cubic convolution interpolation for 2 m 10 m and 50 m resolution dems as can be seen from the plots the difference in cell heights using the two different methods is almost negligible compared to the error caused by the coarsening at resolutions of 10 m and 50 m although at 2 m resolution the sampling effect is greater it still considerably less than the differences caused by the coarsening effect in addition the aim of the study was to demonstrate the advantage of merged dems over coarser resolution dems where this effect is negligible due to the scope of this study we kept the mesh size constant for all the simulations so there was no significant change in the computational time however in other situations the size of the computational mesh will be based on the dem resolution the coarser the dem resolution the larger the computational mesh size will be this will significantly reduce the computational burden and can be utilised in modelling applications such as flood warning systems in this study we have not addressed issues that arise from dem errors during measurement and post processing however we acknowledge the fact that depending the techniques used these errors could be as significant as coarsening errors abily et al 2016 wang et al 2012 zotou et al 2020 further recent studies have also raised the issue of the blocking out effect of buildings in dtms which prevent flood flows and possible storage effects of the buildings in flood modelling bellos and tsakiris 2015 we believe in future in addition to dem and mesh configurations this also needs to be studied in detail in 2d flood modelling given its potential impact on the flood dynamics in a built up area 4 conclusion this study first investigates the root causes of the impact of dem resolution on urban fluvial flood modelling using dems ranging from 1 m to 50 m dems with resolutions of 2 m to 50 m were derived by resampling the 1 m dem the study then investigates how dem resolution affects the definition and characterisation of the river channel and the consequences of this for the modelled results for this purpose a separate set of merged dems were generated where the river channel obtained with the 1 m resolution dem is merged with coarser resolution dems data obtained during the flood event caused by storm desmond 2015 in cockermouth cumbria uk was used for this study the study area covers around 142 ha with the town centre located at the confluence of two rivers the river derwent and the river cocker the hec ras 2d model was used for all the simulations the benchmark model obtained with the 1 m resolution dem was calibrated with measured water levels at two locations within the rivers the following conclusions can be made from the results the use of coarser resolution dems in the model affected river cells in a different way to the land cells within the river channel the coarser resolution dems raised more cells than it lowered when using a 2 m resolution dem 53 of cells were raised and 47 lowered however when using a 50 m resolution dem 91 were raised and 9 lowered for the land cells there was less of an effect with the ratio between raising and lowering the ratio was between 0 9 and 1 7 at different dem resolutions overall the flood depth and flood extent increased with decreasing dem resolution there was a 30 increase in flood extent from 58 9 ha to 79 0 ha and a 150 increase in mean flood depth from 1 74 m to 4 30 m when the dem resolution reduces from 1 m grid to 50 m grid the main reason for this is the increasing lack of definition of the river channel with an associated reduction in the estimated depth of the river resulting in reduced river channel conveyance this then leads to an increase in the flood extent and depth especially in the immediate vicinity of the river despite the overall over prediction of flood depths due to the use of a coarser resolution dem there were also areas both inside and outside of the river channel where the flood depth was under predicted the main reason being the increased elevation of these areas due to the use of a coarser resolution dem in river stretches where there are no developments or there are lower river banks the flood water propagates into the surrounding areas when using coarser resolution dems this consequently reduces the flood depth of the river cells at these river stretches this means the coarser resolution dem does not always increase the flood depth everywhere within the river the land use and terrain of the surrounding area also have an associated effect when the river channel is characterised using a high resolution dem and is then used in conjunction with a coarser resolution dem for the surrounding area merged dems there is a significant improvement in the agreement between the modelled and the actual results of flood depths the use of merged dems reduced the error in mean flood depth from 150 to 20 and the overall rmse in flood depths from 5 26 m to 0 98 m at 50 m resolution however there is no consistent trend in the rmse with the resolution of the merged dem this is different to the findings with the uniform dem where the rmse increases linearly with the resolution in terms of flood extent the use of coarser resolution merged dems tend to underpredict the affected area compared with uniform dems however the fit index comparison demonstrates that merged dems provide a better indication of flood extent than uniform dems it is clear that the resolution of the dem used has an impact on the simulated flood extents and depths for optimal results the resolution of the dem used for a particular location should be at least finer than the width of the river channel we have demonstrated that the use of merged dems may be a cost effective way of obtaining fit for purpose flood maps in locations where high resolution dems have not yet been developed the use of merged dems significantly improves the flood prediction in comparison to uniform dems this could help improve flood modelling without having to survey the entire model extent when there are financial and practical limitation which is often the case especially in developing countries for example nasa s shuttle radar topography mission dems which are 30 m resolution are freely available however when this dem is used in a fluvial flood model the resulting flood depths and flood extents could be significantly higher or sometimes lower depending on factors such the widths of river channels the degree of urbanisation and the topography of the surrounding areas this study suggests that using the srtm dems together with a better representation of the river channel derived from bathymetry or a higher resolution dem e g 1 m might be a more cost effective approach than seeking to obtain a high resolution dem for the whole area in addition there may not be the resources available to generate a wide scale 1 m resolution dem our findings also have implications for other flood risk management activities such as the identification of emergency evacuation routes the approach we have developed provides a means of developing reliable flood risk maps without necessarily requiring a high resolution dem for the total affected area such maps can then inform the development of better overall flood risk management practices credit authorship contribution

4694,drought is a severe and chronic natural hazard that deeply affects production and livelihoods its characteristics and propagation have been extensively discussed but the effects of temperature evapotranspiration and runoff on drought under different carbon emission conditions are still worth considering combining with the release of the sixth international coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 datasets of multiple patterns were compared with observational datasets the most available data were screened to verify the accuracy of cmip6 and were used to determine global standardized precipitation index spi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and standardized runoff index sri to analyze global drought properties such as frequency duration and spatial extent according to the shared socioeconomic pathways ssps scenarios drought properties in the future were compared with those in the past and results were as follows first more accurate precipitation and evapotranspiration data were provided by the canems5 and more accurate soil moisture data were provided by the bcc csm2 mr second in the 21st century the frequency duration and spatial extent of global drought in most areas would increase finally the key influencing factor of drought would the evapotranspiration the relationship among rainfall runoff and temperature was mutually binding overall global droughts in particular exceptional droughts showed a progressive worsening of conditions and a marked increase in the future this study provides a reference for exploring global drought changes under climate change and provides a basis for the application of the cmip6 keywords cmip6 drought spi spei sri climate change 1 introduction drought is a chronic natural disaster that occurs frequently around the world and its management is not as quick and its mitigation is not as prompt as for other natural disasters such as flash floods windstorms cyclones and even earthquakes the impacts of drought on social life and economic development are greater more extensive longer lasting and more profound than most other natural disasters chen et al 2009 droughts pose a serious threat to food water and ecological systems on which people depend for their survival and in severe cases can exert invisible pressure on natural ecosystems it has been estimated that annual global economic losses due to drought are as high as 6 to 8 billion us dollars far exceeding those of other natural disasters wilhite 2000 global arid areas are mainly located in most of asia most of australia most of africa western north america and western south america approximately 35 percent of the total land area and more than 120 countries and regions are threatened by drought disasters in 1943 india bangladesh and other places suffered from severe drought with no water to irrigate crops at all resulting in crop failure severe famine and the death of 3 5 million people in the period 1968 1973 a huge drought covering 36 african countries affected 25 million people with more than 10 million people fleeing from famine and a cumulative death toll of more than 2 million including more than 1 5 million in the sahara region alone this is in addition to countless other major droughts which top the list of the world s top 10 disasters therefore understanding evaluating and combating drought have always been important issues that humanity needs to address although the concept of drought is intuitive no universally accepted definition of drought has yet been presented dai 2012 however drought is caused by a complex long term coupling of atmospheric hydrological and geo biological interactions compounded by human factors although drought cannot be clearly defined it is indisputable that inadequate precipitation is the main cause of drought mckee et al 1993a 1993b climate change in turn can further affect water cycle patterns and lead to changes in water availability by affecting the space time distribution of atmospheric water holding capacity which can trigger further droughts anthropogenic changes and environmental degradation have led to widespread changes in climate making drought assessment more difficult ipcc 2012 hawkins et al 2014 diffenbaugh et al 2011 on a global scale every 1 c increase in temperature will reduce precipitation by about 2 held and soden 2006 liu et al 2018 now that global warming is a fact of life proper global data is necessary when exploring globally the issue of drought the coupled mode intercomparison project cmip promoted by the world climate research programme wcrp is currently the most influential international data source meehl et al 1997 2000 more than 20 years have passed since its implementation in 1995 and a large amount of historical hydrometeorological data have been accumulated these data have contributed to the prediction of future scenario patterns beginning with the cmip3 they have been applied to assess droughts it has become clear that the frequency and severity of global droughts from the cmip3 would gradually increase dai 2012 sheffield and wood 2007 when the cmip5 was released the global drought problem was found to be more serious wang and chen 2014 orlowsky and seneviratne 2012 zhang et al 2019 most drought studies consider drought based on precipitation while this is not problematic however uncertainties between drought and the cmip prediction have been identified mainly due to inconsistencies between precipitation variability and global warming so the assessment of drought cannot be determined by one factor alone therefore in addition to precipitation other climatic variables such as temperature and geographic factors such as soil moisture should be taken into account in drought assessment to improve the modelling of the response of hydrological cycle to climate change ashfaq et al 2010 2013 van huijgevoort et al 2014 at present drought investigations based on multivariate uncertainty and climate change are receiving much attention and the release of cmip6 provides a new possibility for data selection for these investigations meanwhile using the selected data of precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture of the cmip6 the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993a 1993b the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 wells et al 2004 oladipo 2010 zhou et al 2020a 2020b and the standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 were employed to evaluate global drought the former two indices in association with meteorological factors such as precipitation and temperature implying evapotranspiration were employed to evaluate meteorological drought and the third index in association with soil moisture implying water storage of the earth s surface was employed to evaluate hydrological drought then the frequency duration and spatial extent of different droughts were analyzed compared to those in the past droughts under climate change in the future based on the different climate models were summarized to produce new information on global drought in a way it also provided an important application of the cmip6 2 data and methodology at present whether the cmip6 data are available for the analysis of global drought should be investigated global drought change under climate scenarios in the future is another important objective clearly a single dataset is not enough and more observational datasets need to be compared with the cmip6 to ensure their availability the cmip6 contains a large quantity data and comparing all of them is not meaningful for a drought study therefore precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture were selected for comparison in addition three drought indices spi sri and spei that resulted from different hydrometeorological elements or combinations respectively were used to evaluate global drought to avoid the bias of a single index due to the difference of spatial resolution between different datasets first results and observations from different models were filtered by monthly scale for more intuitive and convenient comparison and second a bilinear interpolation method was applied to uniformly interpolate on a 2 5 2 5 grid in terms of latitude and longitude in previous analyses significant biases from long time series in the original climate simulations in particular precipitation were found marani and zanetti 2015 grauso et al 2010 in order to effectively reduce discrepancies among different models the tested results were revised by using the mann kendall trend test method and the sen slope estimation method which effectively eliminate the impact of autocorrelation on the estimation of long term trends in time series kendall 1990 gilbert 1988 helsel and hirsch 1992 2 1 observation based dataset for precipitation data the global precipitation climatology project gpcp is the observational dataset produced by optimally combining precipitation related international satellites including microwave infrared and bathymetry data with thousands of continental rain gauge observations na et al 2020 huffman et al 1997 2001 adler et al 2003 the gpcp dataset has been providing monthly scale precipitation with a resolution of 2 5 2 5 on a latitude and longitude grid since january 1979 and also daily scale precipitation with a resolution of 1 1 since january 1996 the data with global coverage are long standing and widely used in estimating global climate patterns curtis et al 2007 gu et al 2007 liu et al 2009 shiu et al 2012 mehran et al 2014 demory et al 2014 therefore monthly scale precipitation data of the gpcp since january 1979 was selected as the observational dataset for comparison with the cmip6 to obtain soil moisture and evaporation observations the noah dataset of the global land data assimilation system gldas was obtained it has been used as the land model of the national centers for environmental modeling prediction ncep operational regional and global weather and climate models since 1996 and continues to benefit from a steady progression of improvements chen et al 1996 koren et al 1999 the soil moisture soil temperature latent heat flux and sensible heat flux data provided by gldas are considered to be the world s leading high resolution data the research conducted by gldas covers many disciplines including climate change prediction agricultural irrigation water resources and even biological fields syed et al 2008 baba et al 2013 yang and chen 2015 bi et al 2016 2 2 global climate model data the cmip6 has been progressively released through wcrp https esgfnode llnl gov search cmip6 to assess the availability of precipitation 11 gcms from the cmip6 were used eyring et al 2016 they have been validated in the long term application of the cmip5 and commonly applied in hydrometeorological studies kumar et al 2013 2014 wang and chen 2014 lin et al 2014 swart et al 2019 it is also convenient for the comparison of drought between the cmip6 and the cmip5 some details of these gcms are given in table 1 along with their respective modelling groups countries regions horizontal resolution and number of datasets all of which differ only under initial conditions the historical runs of these models were selected because they can serve as an important benchmark for assessing the performance of models by comparison with the observed data these cmip6 historical simulations covered the period 1850 2014 except for the e3sm 1 0 model which ended in 1999 in order to unify the resolution all models were reclassified on a 2 5 2 5 resolution using the bilinear interpolation which is one of the common methods used in regional analysis of global data penalba and rivera 2016 zazulie et al 2017 as shown in table 1 a variety of datasets and multiple data layers of the cmip6 were selected in the validation phase of accuracy in evaluating the accuracy of cmip6 the time series correlations and standard deviations between cmip6 and observed dataset were compared at each raster location around the globe and the result that was closer to the observed dataset was the most accurate cmip6 dataset which was then used to calculate drought indices data of precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff were used to calculate different drought indices where precipitation and evapotranspiration data were compared with observational datasets to obtain the most accurate data of the cmip6 there was no uniformly recognized observational dataset for runoff data so runoff data were selected with reference to the most accurate data on precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture since these three influences are critical to runoff generation for different elements the data from different agencies may behave differently in which case in order to obtain a more accurate global drought scenario only the most accurate data of the cmip6 was utilized for the index calculation regardless of whether the agencies producing data for that element were the same due to differences in the feedback processes among different climate models the response of models to future greenhouse gas ghg emissions i e climate sensitivity is subject to large uncertainties that affect the credibility of estimate and therefore the modelling of carbon emissions has been eliminated in cmip6 and replaced by the scenario model intercomparison project scenario mip such as ssp1 1 9 ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 the ssp1 1 9 with radiative forcing of 1 9 w m2 and global warming of 1 5 c and the ssp1 2 6 with radiative forcing of 2 6 w m2 and global warming less than 2 c till to 2100 were subjective to the lowest radiation emission scenarios which resulted in low social vulnerability and low mitigation challenge the ssp2 4 5 with radiative forcing of 4 5 w m2 the ssp3 7 0 with radiative forcing of 7 0 w m2 and the ssp5 8 5 with radiative forcing of 8 5 w m2 were subjective to the medium the medium high and the highest radiation emission scenarios which resulted in moderate medium high and high social vulnerability and mitigation challenge respectively among the scenarios the ssp5 8 5 as the worst scenario which can be expected in the future embodies the impact of unconventional development and is the focus of current research ashfaq et al 2015 the ssp2 4 5 which has aroused wide concern in most countries striving for sustainable development also needs to be focused on therefore the ssp5 8 5 scenario was selected as the future base data for analyzing global drought characteristics and the ssp2 4 5 scenario would be compared whether the drought can really be alleviated 2 3 drought evaluation first of all one of the important ways for evaluating drought is the drought indices which have an ability to describe drought events although there are currently many drought indices dai 2011 spi spei and sri were employed in evaluating global drought it is worth noting that spi and spei were mainly employed to identify meteorological drought which was caused by insufficient precipitation for the former and considering both precipitation and evapotranspiration for the latter it is known that water will also be retained by soil and vegetation when rain fall on the surface and form streamflow therefore the retention of soil moisture can show water storage in earth s surface and sri was used to describe hydrological drought caused by insufficient runoff and soil water although spi sri and spei had different concerns different input data and different methods for describing drought the statistical concepts of the three are similar after considering the process from meteorological drought to hydrological drought the evaluation based on spei and sri was used as an alternative method to analyze agricultural drought after eliminating seasonal interference the above indicators can be directly compared in different locations and under different climates based on the probability of drought which reduces the climate and geographical constraints and is more suitable for this study we analyzed five levels of drought severity based on the us drought monitor classifications svoboda et al 2002 d0 abnormally dry 20 30 d1 moderate drought 10 20 d2 severe drought 5 10 d3 extreme drought 2 5 and d4 exceptional drought 2 all drought levels were analyzed at 1 month 3 month 6 month and 12 month scales but in order to highlight the catastrophic and dangerous nature of severe drought results of this study focused on showing the drought characteristics of severe drought extreme drought and exceptional drought at the 6 month level and further selected suitable research objects and this was also in line with the relevant statistical basis ashfaq et al 2015 due to the influence of global warming the increase in global temperature brings about an increase in precipitation which indirectly leads to an increase in runoff which leads to greater volatility in spi and sri and the time series of indicators will show an increase this trend does not mean that the drought has eased but it affects the ability of spi and sri to reflect climate warming since the current classification of drought index was not applicable to all time ranges in order to avoid such errors the index classification adopted in this paper was based on the baseline simulation of indicators within a certain time range and the severity of drought was carried out according to the foregoing classification therefore according to the quantile size of the three indicators the drought grades were planned based on the characteristics of the cmip6 data using 2014 as the time boundary describing the drought frequency drought duration and drought spatial range in the next 85 years and comparing them with the past 85 years of drought characteristics at the same time dividing the 21st century into two time periods on average and comparing the frequency and duration of drought in the two periods before and after it better explained the degree of drought changes in the late 21st century compared with the early 21st century effectively reducing the impact of mid term data for the impact of overall data ashfaq et al 2015 this paper investigated d the 26 research areas of the world according to giorgi and bi 2005 see fig 1 and table 2 the impact of exceptional drought was the most important of multiple drought levels theoretically an exceptional drought can cause economic social and even human disastrous impacts in a short period of time for example a drought of this level will cause a decrease in the water level of lakes and rivers partial drying and zero flow which in turn will increase the ground refractive index and produce irreversible changes in the ecological environment in a short period of time marengo et al 2008 in addition an exceptional drought will also cause a reduction in food production and if an exceptional drought event reduced food production by up to 33 it would seriously threaten the socioeconomic system and human food security dong et al 2015 in summary the drought frequency and drought duration of exceptional drought will be analyzed later and quantitative reasons for concern about exceptional drought will be given 3 results 3 1 dataset filtering the accuracy of precipitation evapotranspiration and soil water data from the cmip6 under historical conditions should be evaluated to ensure their suitability before they are applied for calculating drought indices data of the 11 gcms from the cmip6 were compared with the observed data from the gpcp and the gldas the correlation coefficient and the standard deviation of precipitation evapotranspiration and soil water between the 11 gcms and the observed data are shown in table 3 results showed that the correlation coefficients and the standard deviation in term of the global average accounted for 0 517 0 637 and 26 34 mm for precipitation 0 793 0 94 and 13 29 mm for evapotranspiration and 0 363 0 480 and 38 49 mm for soil water respectively in general the correlations of precipitation evapotranspiration and soil water between 11 gcms and the observed data were significant besides that those of evapotranspiration were better than those of precipitation which were better than those of soil water since both correlation and standard deviation were used to evaluate the relationship between data of the cmip6 and observed data the weights were equally divided between the two to calculate the final scores for each gcms and observed data among the 11 gcms the best one was the canesm5 for precipitation the canesm5 for evapotranspiration and the bcc csm2 mr for soil moisture therefore data from the canesm5 and the bcc csm2 mr were selected to calculate drought indices this paper obtained the optimal data of the cmip6 and verified them based on the time series of observation data but in order to verify the spatial distribution of the cmip6 the correlation and difference between the cmip6 and observation data were drawn in space in terms of distribution the dataset for precipitation and evapotranspiration was canesm5 and the optimal dataset for soil moisture was bcc csm2 mr the correlation between the two datasets and the observed data was drawn with standard deviation as a spatial distribution map see fig 2 it was illustrated that the correlation coefficient between the cmip6 and observed series in evapotranspiration is higher than precipitation in precipitation and soil moisture for evapotranspiration the higher coefficients were found in europe and northern asia i e neu nee nas and the lower in grl and sah but the overall standard deviations were less than 50 mm for precipitation the correlation coefficients were higher in south america and africa i e amz waf eaf sqf than in other regions but larger standard deviations occurred near the equator for soil moisture the correlation coefficients in most regions were low but the correlations in amz and eqf were higher than those in other regions the standard deviations for soil moisture were also small in most regions namely for precipitation the spatial distribution of precipitation of canesm5 was higher than other regions in northeastern asia southern africa western south america and central and northern north america although subject to the influence of an interpolation method the simulation situation in coastal areas and near the equator was poor which is closely related to monsoons and special climatic phenomena including climate warming for evapotranspiration canesm5 presented a situation similar to precipitation in the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration bcc csm2 mr as the best data set among the 11 gcms and its spatial distribution did not show a good correlation in asia and northeast europe and it performed relatively poorly in summary data of canesm5 provided the input of precipitation and evapotranspiration parameters for spi and spei in combination with the above analysis data of the bcc csm2 mr was selected as the runoff input part of sri in canesm5 and bcc csm2 mr 3 2 drought frequency the period 2015 2100 was divided into two time periods 2015 2057 and 2058 2100 fig 3 shows drought frequency for different drought classes and different drought indices in the two periods the drought frequency was expressed as a percentage with higher percentages indicating more frequent droughts in terms of different drought severities the drought frequency gradually decreased as the number of drought classes decreased from spi the decrease in drought frequency was mainly concentrated in northern south america and southern africa amz sqf with a decrease of about 30 while northern oceania nau also had a decrease of nearly 10 and the largest decrease was in sas with a decrease of about 40 from spei the drought frequency decrease was mainly concentrated in northern europe nas and the decrease was similar to that of spi however the decrease of drought frequency in grl which had the same latitude as nas was not obvious it indicated that in this region all of them were dominated by exceptional drought events from sri the decrease of drought frequency was relatively average with the decrease of the number of drought classes and there was no obvious decrease in the region but the overall drought frequency decreased by 5 10 the three indexes showed relatively consistent trends across drought severity classes but the drought frequency performance varied among the indexes only spei showed a higher drought frequency in grl while spi failed to show drought frequency in the nas region numerically spi reflected the smallest drought frequency with most areas concentrated in 0 20 and the highest drought frequency was not exceeding 45 spei had the highest drought frequency of 65 but the area was smaller and the overall trend was similar to that of spi the drought frequency in most areas was higher than 20 and the highest frequency exceeded 80 and the average drought frequency was much higher than spi and spei comparing the drought frequency in two different periods it can be found that the overall drought frequency had a slight increase over time but the overall upward trend was very slow no more than 5 only the central africa waf eaf eqf sqf shown by sri had a high amplitude and the maximum amplitude was no more than 10 55 increased to 65 spei showed a decrease in drought frequency with time in high latitudes but this did not mean that the drought situation would be weakened because another factor leading to drought was drought duration which will be discussed later from the current status of drought frequency the overall spatial extent of sri drought frequency was higher than that of spi and spei and most of africa waf eaf eqf sqf and northern south america amz were the zones with higher drought frequency the overall drought frequency did not change much with time indicating that when the frequency of drought events increased to a certain level a boundary effect would occur which may eventually lead to a more severe drought disaster under the ssp5 8 5 scenario the drought frequency would decrease in the future indicating that a large number of exceptional droughts would occur in the future which was considered as a drought transfer effect this shifting effect was not a transfer between drought types but a shift from less severe or negligible drought events to more severe droughts as the environment deteriorated which was important and will be discussed later around exceptional drought besides spi showed a more even distribution of drought frequencies with no one region being more severe drought suggesting that drought events would eventually have global impacts through changes in runoff conditions as carbon emissions increased but that droughts closer to the coastline would be less severe mainly due to energy exchange between seawater and inland this paper did not consider inundation due to sea level rise where seawater inundation results in more inland areas will be transformed into coasts and areas close to the coast will disappear from the world fig 4 shows changes in the spatial pattern of the exceptional drought frequency in 2015 2057 and 2058 2100 compared with 1850 2014 for 6 months between 2015 and 2057 except that the sri index showed a large increase in drought frequency compared with the baseline period the drought frequency of spi and spei showed a decreasing trend in the middle and high latitudes the drought frequency of spi and spei decreased by about 5 compared with the baseline period in the middle and high latitudes and some high latitudes wna cna neu nee decreased by 10 in the spatial pattern presented by spi in contrast drought frequency increased by 15 in most areas and by 5 in waf med sah cas tib wna and sau between 2058 and 2100 the overall trend of drought frequency was similar to the previous stage and spi showed lower drought frequency in eqf some studies presented that global climate change will bring more droughts and floods and more droughts will increase in arid regions and decreased in humid regions flato and boer 2001 seen from spi and spei in fig 4 the increase of drought frequency was more obvious in arid areas in the humid areas can also be confirmed it indicated that precipitation and evapotranspiration are both important factors affecting drought frequency compared with the changes of drought frequency in the two periods the drought frequency did not change much in sri and only tib showed a small fluctuation with a fluctuation range of about 10 the spei drought frequency increased significantly the drought frequency in 2058 2100 compared with the baseline period showed a positive increase the overall drought frequency increased by more than 15 and the waf area had an increase of more than 20 the spi also showed an increase compared with 2015 2057 but the drought frequency in high latitudes was still lower than the baseline period overall the drought frequency showed an overall high consistency in the ssp5 8 5 scenario and will gradually increase with future developments the increase in drought frequency at high latitudes med sqf and amz was smaller than the increase at middle and low latitudes however this phenomenon does not prove that drought conditions would be better in high latitudes than in middle and low latitudes a decrease in drought frequency did not mean a decrease in the total number of drought months lower drought frequencies may be for more prolonged drought events or even correspond to longer drought epochs over large areas therefore drought duration will be analyzed in what follows 3 3 drought duration fig 5 shows the drought duration for different drought classes and different drought indices in the two periods the drought duration is measured in months experienced and the higher the number of months the longer the drought duration in terms of different drought severities the drought duration gradually decreased as the number of drought levels decreased from spi the regions with longer drought durations in the future were mainly in the middle and high latitudes where the drought duration was about 3 4 months in csa sqf nau and sau areas lower drought ephemeris of 0 1 months occurred this situation differed from the drought frequency in the same period the spi had lower drought frequencies in the middle and high latitudes than in the mid latitudes meaning that the drought situation demonstrated by spi would not be significantly alleviated in the future however as the number of drought levels decreased the drought duration shortened more in northern europe with a decrease of more than 1 month from spei the areas with longer drought durations were in the central africa region waf eqf eaf with drought durations of more than 20 months the areas with a greater decrease in drought duration were in western europe med neu nee with a decrease of about 4 months from sri the global drought duration showed a more average situation with no obvious regional characteristics and an average drought duration between 3 and 5 months the drought duration of spi in high latitudes was basically the same as that of sri but the drought duration of sri in other areas was higher than that of spi the drought duration of spei in mid latitudes was much higher than that of other indices about 8 10 times higher than that of other indexes in addition some high latitudes also had a higher distribution of drought duration which was basically consistent with the causes of drought in antarctica due to the greater influence of circulation at high latitudes low multi year precipitation and low multi year average temperature the trend of drought duration in spi decreased with time and it was more obvious in the exceptional drought level with a decrease of about 1 month the highest increase in drought duration among the three indexes was observed in northeastern south america central africa and northern oceania amz waf eaf nau where the drought duration nearly doubled in general the spatial extent of drought duration decreased with the increase of drought level but the change between extreme drought and exceptional drought was not obvious which was consistent with the reflection of drought frequency indicating that exceptional drought events did occupy a larger proportion of future drought events and the phenomenon also verified that drought events would be transmitted in different drought levels fig 6 shows changes in the spatial pattern of the exceptional 6 month drought in 2015 2057 and 2058 2100 compared with 1850 2014 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario during 2015 2057 the drought duration increased globally compared with the baseline period with an increase of 0 2 month in most regions especially in south america and south africa amz csa sqf the drought duration of spi spei and sri increased by 0 4 10 and 0 8 months respectively during 2058 2100 the average drought duration increments of spi and sri were similar within 0 1 month spi showed a partial reduction in drought duration in neu consistent with the previous stage but the area of reduction in drought duration decreased compared with the drought duration of the next two stages the spei showed an increase of 0 5 month in most regions while spi and sri showed an increase of 0 2 and 0 4 months in northern south america and central africa respectively meanwhile the increase of drought duration in most coastal areas was greater than that in inland areas on the whole the average exceptional drought duration on the 6 month time scale was still low and the change was not obvious outside the spei area the spei showed that drought duration changes were more concentrated in the middle latitudes indicating that the impact of global climate change was more concentrated in the equatorial region the above phenomena were caused by the increase of temperature evapotranspiration and precipitation with the global climate change there was a mitigation relationship between the impact of temperature and precipitation which led to no increase in the duration of global drought by spi and sri in terms of hydrometeorological elements precipitation and soil moisture are two direct elements to influence the drought global changes of drought duration from the spi and sri are small evapotranspiration is an indirect factor mainly in association with temperature for drought and the spei is collectively resulted in precipitation and temperature the change of temperature plays an important role in prolonging drought duration when less impact from precipitation 3 4 drought area fig 7 shows changes in the time scale and spatial extent of all indexes in 26 regions around the world exceptional drought this value was the change in the spatial extent of the exceptional drought on a 6 month time scale of spi spei and sri in the future 2015 2100 compared with the base period 1930 2014 it was found in all regions that the spatial extent of spei varied the most especially in tropical and subtropical regions around 2100 where the impact of global warming was higher than that of other regions among them at the end of the 21st century the spatial extent of spei of northern europe med oceania nau sau northern south america amz and most of africa sah waf eaf eqf sqf saf increased by more than 50 but the spatial extent of spi and sri had hardly changed on the other hand the spei spatial extent of temperate regions such as western america wna and central asia cas had a small increase about 30 in addition the spatial extent of sri in all regions was higher than that of spi but the spatial extent of sri in most regions at the end of the 21st century was less than 10 indicating that climate change had less impact on the spatial extent of sri except for the mediterranean region med parts of south america ssa and parts of central america cam the spatial extent of spi in almost all regions had not changed significantly throughout the 21st century generally speaking in the next period of time although various drought indicators would increase or remain unchanged it did not mean that the drought would ease especially in the context of ssp5 8 5 according to the data the spatial extent of the spi and sri indicators would be maintained at a certain baseline level while the spatial extent of drought indicated by spei would increase and the drought situation would remain severe the description of the spatial extent of drought effectively confirmed the previous conclusions on the frequency and duration of drought the area where the extent of drought increased sharply was also the area where the frequency of drought increased and the duration of drought also changed with the frequency and extent of drought 4 discussion first of all this paper selected different cmip6 data to be interpolated on a grid of 2 5 in order to compare the data uniformly and it was more in line with the characteristics of global statistics in the follow up research for smaller areas it is recommended to use a resolution that can show more details such as 1 0 25 or even 0 1 the drought trend based on ssp8 5 8 future situation data was described but the current international requirements for various countries and the future development trend of each country were more inclined to be lower than the scenario of ssp8 5 8 therefore the ssp2 4 5 which represents a scenario combining moderate social vulnerability and radiative forcing for achieving sustainable development was selected to further know how drought trends will be in the future using 2014 as the dividing line and 1850 2014 as the benchmark it explored the changes in the drought index from 2015 to 2100 three drought indices 6 month of spi spei and sri to describe the development of drought were compared in fig 8 it can be seen from fig 8 that in the context of ssp2 4 5 the data of the three indicators had not changed much among them sri was more stable in the world and spi and spei had a certain degree of fluctuation at the same time the changes in each region were also in line with the overall drought trend described in ssp8 5 8 judging from the box plot the range of spi was more stable and there were no outliers spei fluctuated greatly and slightly reflected an upward trend on the whole in the scenario of ssp2 4 5 the spread of drought was significantly slower than in the scenario of ssp5 8 5 and the change from the baseline period data was not obvious indicating that ssp2 4 5 can effectively control the spread of drought if most countries in the world made efforts and sacrifices for the agreement drought can be controlled artificially and the ecological environment and development would be better after comparing the two ssp scenarios horizontally this article focused on multiple vertical cmip data it selected the rcp scenario of cmip5 and the ssp scenario of cmip6 for comparison in order not to be affected by the calculation model of cmip6 this paper selected the results from literature for comparison due to the length of the space only some important points are summarized firstly based on the cmip5 data it was found that most droughts were caused by increased evapotranspiration and the increase in precipitation was a more positive way of impact orlowsky and seneviratne 2012 this view was basically consistent with the view obtained in fig 2 secondly analyzing the rcp8 5 scenario ashfaq et al 2015 the conclusions of drought characteristics in various regions of the world were similar to the results of this study at the same time in the data introduction of cmip the difference between ssp8 5 8 and rcp8 5 was small finally in the best data in terms of the judgment of the datasets this article is different from the cmip5 data some studies report that the optimal cmip5 for precipitation were cnrm cm5 and miroc4h wu et al 2014 arid semi arid regions and canesm4 ranks no four digits zhao et al 2014 there was a 4 deviation with the best datasets for the global scale the multi mode coupled cmip5 was a better dataset through the analysis of global climate drought characteristics it is believed that the cmip6 inherits part of the advantages of cmip5 and can show the future close to the real drought situation which is more obvious under high emission scenarios however there are still few discussions related to cmip6 and it cannot be simply assumed that cmip6 is better than cmip5 but the comparative analysis of multiple scenarios and institutions will be the trend of exploring drought in the future 5 conclusions this paper aimed at validating the newly released cmip6 and exploring the global drought characteristics based on cmip6 the following conclusions were reached through multiple screening shared socioeconomic pathways and multiple drought indicators 1 for the cmip6 selection data most of the 11 gcms selected performed better with the observed data in terms of standard deviation indicating high accuracy of cmip6 data canesm5 and bcc csm2 mr showed unique advantages from three perspectives precipitation evapotranspiration and soil water comparisons were acceptable both in terms of correlation and standard deviation in terms of the spatial distribution of precipitation multiple data showed more distinct differences with overall cmip6 performing better in africa asia and south america 2 in considering future drought frequency and drought duration the period 2015 2100 was divided into two time periods and drought frequency and drought duration were calculated on the basis of the ssp5 8 5 scenario it was concluded that drought frequency and drought duration were internally transmitted across different drought classes and that the three indicators showed different spatial distributions of drought frequency and drought duration and as shown by sri the spatial distribution of droughts was more widespread the overall drought situation in northern africa was not promising but other regions should be aware of the globalization of drought trends and that exceptional drought would become more common in the future 3 in terms of drought characteristics the spatial extent frequency and duration of droughts were increasing in most parts of the world in addition high latitudes were more affected by global climate change than equatorial regions and under ssp5 8 5 global drought changes showed a strong consistency and overall drier characteristics 4 in terms of the spatial extent of drought different regions were not consistent most regions of the spi and sri indexes showed a stable and slightly rising trend while the spei s showed a more obvious rise the spatial extent of spei in most areas was above 30 and sri was about 10 therefore it was concluded that the main factor affecting the spatial extent of drought in the future would evapotranspiration rather than the sudden decrease of rainfall the increased drought risk means that it will cause irreversible harm to the global human system social system economic system and even the whole ecosystem and the areas with high drought risk need to be managed more effectively and water resources management should be controlled effectively to further adjust the unreasonable policies and guidelines in addition this paper also discussed drought characteristics based on the moderate emission in the future and showed that the sustainable development can effectively reduce the global drought risk credit authorship contribution statement tian wang methodology xinjun tu formal analysis supervision vijay p singh supervision

4694,drought is a severe and chronic natural hazard that deeply affects production and livelihoods its characteristics and propagation have been extensively discussed but the effects of temperature evapotranspiration and runoff on drought under different carbon emission conditions are still worth considering combining with the release of the sixth international coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 datasets of multiple patterns were compared with observational datasets the most available data were screened to verify the accuracy of cmip6 and were used to determine global standardized precipitation index spi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and standardized runoff index sri to analyze global drought properties such as frequency duration and spatial extent according to the shared socioeconomic pathways ssps scenarios drought properties in the future were compared with those in the past and results were as follows first more accurate precipitation and evapotranspiration data were provided by the canems5 and more accurate soil moisture data were provided by the bcc csm2 mr second in the 21st century the frequency duration and spatial extent of global drought in most areas would increase finally the key influencing factor of drought would the evapotranspiration the relationship among rainfall runoff and temperature was mutually binding overall global droughts in particular exceptional droughts showed a progressive worsening of conditions and a marked increase in the future this study provides a reference for exploring global drought changes under climate change and provides a basis for the application of the cmip6 keywords cmip6 drought spi spei sri climate change 1 introduction drought is a chronic natural disaster that occurs frequently around the world and its management is not as quick and its mitigation is not as prompt as for other natural disasters such as flash floods windstorms cyclones and even earthquakes the impacts of drought on social life and economic development are greater more extensive longer lasting and more profound than most other natural disasters chen et al 2009 droughts pose a serious threat to food water and ecological systems on which people depend for their survival and in severe cases can exert invisible pressure on natural ecosystems it has been estimated that annual global economic losses due to drought are as high as 6 to 8 billion us dollars far exceeding those of other natural disasters wilhite 2000 global arid areas are mainly located in most of asia most of australia most of africa western north america and western south america approximately 35 percent of the total land area and more than 120 countries and regions are threatened by drought disasters in 1943 india bangladesh and other places suffered from severe drought with no water to irrigate crops at all resulting in crop failure severe famine and the death of 3 5 million people in the period 1968 1973 a huge drought covering 36 african countries affected 25 million people with more than 10 million people fleeing from famine and a cumulative death toll of more than 2 million including more than 1 5 million in the sahara region alone this is in addition to countless other major droughts which top the list of the world s top 10 disasters therefore understanding evaluating and combating drought have always been important issues that humanity needs to address although the concept of drought is intuitive no universally accepted definition of drought has yet been presented dai 2012 however drought is caused by a complex long term coupling of atmospheric hydrological and geo biological interactions compounded by human factors although drought cannot be clearly defined it is indisputable that inadequate precipitation is the main cause of drought mckee et al 1993a 1993b climate change in turn can further affect water cycle patterns and lead to changes in water availability by affecting the space time distribution of atmospheric water holding capacity which can trigger further droughts anthropogenic changes and environmental degradation have led to widespread changes in climate making drought assessment more difficult ipcc 2012 hawkins et al 2014 diffenbaugh et al 2011 on a global scale every 1 c increase in temperature will reduce precipitation by about 2 held and soden 2006 liu et al 2018 now that global warming is a fact of life proper global data is necessary when exploring globally the issue of drought the coupled mode intercomparison project cmip promoted by the world climate research programme wcrp is currently the most influential international data source meehl et al 1997 2000 more than 20 years have passed since its implementation in 1995 and a large amount of historical hydrometeorological data have been accumulated these data have contributed to the prediction of future scenario patterns beginning with the cmip3 they have been applied to assess droughts it has become clear that the frequency and severity of global droughts from the cmip3 would gradually increase dai 2012 sheffield and wood 2007 when the cmip5 was released the global drought problem was found to be more serious wang and chen 2014 orlowsky and seneviratne 2012 zhang et al 2019 most drought studies consider drought based on precipitation while this is not problematic however uncertainties between drought and the cmip prediction have been identified mainly due to inconsistencies between precipitation variability and global warming so the assessment of drought cannot be determined by one factor alone therefore in addition to precipitation other climatic variables such as temperature and geographic factors such as soil moisture should be taken into account in drought assessment to improve the modelling of the response of hydrological cycle to climate change ashfaq et al 2010 2013 van huijgevoort et al 2014 at present drought investigations based on multivariate uncertainty and climate change are receiving much attention and the release of cmip6 provides a new possibility for data selection for these investigations meanwhile using the selected data of precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture of the cmip6 the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993a 1993b the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 wells et al 2004 oladipo 2010 zhou et al 2020a 2020b and the standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 were employed to evaluate global drought the former two indices in association with meteorological factors such as precipitation and temperature implying evapotranspiration were employed to evaluate meteorological drought and the third index in association with soil moisture implying water storage of the earth s surface was employed to evaluate hydrological drought then the frequency duration and spatial extent of different droughts were analyzed compared to those in the past droughts under climate change in the future based on the different climate models were summarized to produce new information on global drought in a way it also provided an important application of the cmip6 2 data and methodology at present whether the cmip6 data are available for the analysis of global drought should be investigated global drought change under climate scenarios in the future is another important objective clearly a single dataset is not enough and more observational datasets need to be compared with the cmip6 to ensure their availability the cmip6 contains a large quantity data and comparing all of them is not meaningful for a drought study therefore precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture were selected for comparison in addition three drought indices spi sri and spei that resulted from different hydrometeorological elements or combinations respectively were used to evaluate global drought to avoid the bias of a single index due to the difference of spatial resolution between different datasets first results and observations from different models were filtered by monthly scale for more intuitive and convenient comparison and second a bilinear interpolation method was applied to uniformly interpolate on a 2 5 2 5 grid in terms of latitude and longitude in previous analyses significant biases from long time series in the original climate simulations in particular precipitation were found marani and zanetti 2015 grauso et al 2010 in order to effectively reduce discrepancies among different models the tested results were revised by using the mann kendall trend test method and the sen slope estimation method which effectively eliminate the impact of autocorrelation on the estimation of long term trends in time series kendall 1990 gilbert 1988 helsel and hirsch 1992 2 1 observation based dataset for precipitation data the global precipitation climatology project gpcp is the observational dataset produced by optimally combining precipitation related international satellites including microwave infrared and bathymetry data with thousands of continental rain gauge observations na et al 2020 huffman et al 1997 2001 adler et al 2003 the gpcp dataset has been providing monthly scale precipitation with a resolution of 2 5 2 5 on a latitude and longitude grid since january 1979 and also daily scale precipitation with a resolution of 1 1 since january 1996 the data with global coverage are long standing and widely used in estimating global climate patterns curtis et al 2007 gu et al 2007 liu et al 2009 shiu et al 2012 mehran et al 2014 demory et al 2014 therefore monthly scale precipitation data of the gpcp since january 1979 was selected as the observational dataset for comparison with the cmip6 to obtain soil moisture and evaporation observations the noah dataset of the global land data assimilation system gldas was obtained it has been used as the land model of the national centers for environmental modeling prediction ncep operational regional and global weather and climate models since 1996 and continues to benefit from a steady progression of improvements chen et al 1996 koren et al 1999 the soil moisture soil temperature latent heat flux and sensible heat flux data provided by gldas are considered to be the world s leading high resolution data the research conducted by gldas covers many disciplines including climate change prediction agricultural irrigation water resources and even biological fields syed et al 2008 baba et al 2013 yang and chen 2015 bi et al 2016 2 2 global climate model data the cmip6 has been progressively released through wcrp https esgfnode llnl gov search cmip6 to assess the availability of precipitation 11 gcms from the cmip6 were used eyring et al 2016 they have been validated in the long term application of the cmip5 and commonly applied in hydrometeorological studies kumar et al 2013 2014 wang and chen 2014 lin et al 2014 swart et al 2019 it is also convenient for the comparison of drought between the cmip6 and the cmip5 some details of these gcms are given in table 1 along with their respective modelling groups countries regions horizontal resolution and number of datasets all of which differ only under initial conditions the historical runs of these models were selected because they can serve as an important benchmark for assessing the performance of models by comparison with the observed data these cmip6 historical simulations covered the period 1850 2014 except for the e3sm 1 0 model which ended in 1999 in order to unify the resolution all models were reclassified on a 2 5 2 5 resolution using the bilinear interpolation which is one of the common methods used in regional analysis of global data penalba and rivera 2016 zazulie et al 2017 as shown in table 1 a variety of datasets and multiple data layers of the cmip6 were selected in the validation phase of accuracy in evaluating the accuracy of cmip6 the time series correlations and standard deviations between cmip6 and observed dataset were compared at each raster location around the globe and the result that was closer to the observed dataset was the most accurate cmip6 dataset which was then used to calculate drought indices data of precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff were used to calculate different drought indices where precipitation and evapotranspiration data were compared with observational datasets to obtain the most accurate data of the cmip6 there was no uniformly recognized observational dataset for runoff data so runoff data were selected with reference to the most accurate data on precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture since these three influences are critical to runoff generation for different elements the data from different agencies may behave differently in which case in order to obtain a more accurate global drought scenario only the most accurate data of the cmip6 was utilized for the index calculation regardless of whether the agencies producing data for that element were the same due to differences in the feedback processes among different climate models the response of models to future greenhouse gas ghg emissions i e climate sensitivity is subject to large uncertainties that affect the credibility of estimate and therefore the modelling of carbon emissions has been eliminated in cmip6 and replaced by the scenario model intercomparison project scenario mip such as ssp1 1 9 ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 the ssp1 1 9 with radiative forcing of 1 9 w m2 and global warming of 1 5 c and the ssp1 2 6 with radiative forcing of 2 6 w m2 and global warming less than 2 c till to 2100 were subjective to the lowest radiation emission scenarios which resulted in low social vulnerability and low mitigation challenge the ssp2 4 5 with radiative forcing of 4 5 w m2 the ssp3 7 0 with radiative forcing of 7 0 w m2 and the ssp5 8 5 with radiative forcing of 8 5 w m2 were subjective to the medium the medium high and the highest radiation emission scenarios which resulted in moderate medium high and high social vulnerability and mitigation challenge respectively among the scenarios the ssp5 8 5 as the worst scenario which can be expected in the future embodies the impact of unconventional development and is the focus of current research ashfaq et al 2015 the ssp2 4 5 which has aroused wide concern in most countries striving for sustainable development also needs to be focused on therefore the ssp5 8 5 scenario was selected as the future base data for analyzing global drought characteristics and the ssp2 4 5 scenario would be compared whether the drought can really be alleviated 2 3 drought evaluation first of all one of the important ways for evaluating drought is the drought indices which have an ability to describe drought events although there are currently many drought indices dai 2011 spi spei and sri were employed in evaluating global drought it is worth noting that spi and spei were mainly employed to identify meteorological drought which was caused by insufficient precipitation for the former and considering both precipitation and evapotranspiration for the latter it is known that water will also be retained by soil and vegetation when rain fall on the surface and form streamflow therefore the retention of soil moisture can show water storage in earth s surface and sri was used to describe hydrological drought caused by insufficient runoff and soil water although spi sri and spei had different concerns different input data and different methods for describing drought the statistical concepts of the three are similar after considering the process from meteorological drought to hydrological drought the evaluation based on spei and sri was used as an alternative method to analyze agricultural drought after eliminating seasonal interference the above indicators can be directly compared in different locations and under different climates based on the probability of drought which reduces the climate and geographical constraints and is more suitable for this study we analyzed five levels of drought severity based on the us drought monitor classifications svoboda et al 2002 d0 abnormally dry 20 30 d1 moderate drought 10 20 d2 severe drought 5 10 d3 extreme drought 2 5 and d4 exceptional drought 2 all drought levels were analyzed at 1 month 3 month 6 month and 12 month scales but in order to highlight the catastrophic and dangerous nature of severe drought results of this study focused on showing the drought characteristics of severe drought extreme drought and exceptional drought at the 6 month level and further selected suitable research objects and this was also in line with the relevant statistical basis ashfaq et al 2015 due to the influence of global warming the increase in global temperature brings about an increase in precipitation which indirectly leads to an increase in runoff which leads to greater volatility in spi and sri and the time series of indicators will show an increase this trend does not mean that the drought has eased but it affects the ability of spi and sri to reflect climate warming since the current classification of drought index was not applicable to all time ranges in order to avoid such errors the index classification adopted in this paper was based on the baseline simulation of indicators within a certain time range and the severity of drought was carried out according to the foregoing classification therefore according to the quantile size of the three indicators the drought grades were planned based on the characteristics of the cmip6 data using 2014 as the time boundary describing the drought frequency drought duration and drought spatial range in the next 85 years and comparing them with the past 85 years of drought characteristics at the same time dividing the 21st century into two time periods on average and comparing the frequency and duration of drought in the two periods before and after it better explained the degree of drought changes in the late 21st century compared with the early 21st century effectively reducing the impact of mid term data for the impact of overall data ashfaq et al 2015 this paper investigated d the 26 research areas of the world according to giorgi and bi 2005 see fig 1 and table 2 the impact of exceptional drought was the most important of multiple drought levels theoretically an exceptional drought can cause economic social and even human disastrous impacts in a short period of time for example a drought of this level will cause a decrease in the water level of lakes and rivers partial drying and zero flow which in turn will increase the ground refractive index and produce irreversible changes in the ecological environment in a short period of time marengo et al 2008 in addition an exceptional drought will also cause a reduction in food production and if an exceptional drought event reduced food production by up to 33 it would seriously threaten the socioeconomic system and human food security dong et al 2015 in summary the drought frequency and drought duration of exceptional drought will be analyzed later and quantitative reasons for concern about exceptional drought will be given 3 results 3 1 dataset filtering the accuracy of precipitation evapotranspiration and soil water data from the cmip6 under historical conditions should be evaluated to ensure their suitability before they are applied for calculating drought indices data of the 11 gcms from the cmip6 were compared with the observed data from the gpcp and the gldas the correlation coefficient and the standard deviation of precipitation evapotranspiration and soil water between the 11 gcms and the observed data are shown in table 3 results showed that the correlation coefficients and the standard deviation in term of the global average accounted for 0 517 0 637 and 26 34 mm for precipitation 0 793 0 94 and 13 29 mm for evapotranspiration and 0 363 0 480 and 38 49 mm for soil water respectively in general the correlations of precipitation evapotranspiration and soil water between 11 gcms and the observed data were significant besides that those of evapotranspiration were better than those of precipitation which were better than those of soil water since both correlation and standard deviation were used to evaluate the relationship between data of the cmip6 and observed data the weights were equally divided between the two to calculate the final scores for each gcms and observed data among the 11 gcms the best one was the canesm5 for precipitation the canesm5 for evapotranspiration and the bcc csm2 mr for soil moisture therefore data from the canesm5 and the bcc csm2 mr were selected to calculate drought indices this paper obtained the optimal data of the cmip6 and verified them based on the time series of observation data but in order to verify the spatial distribution of the cmip6 the correlation and difference between the cmip6 and observation data were drawn in space in terms of distribution the dataset for precipitation and evapotranspiration was canesm5 and the optimal dataset for soil moisture was bcc csm2 mr the correlation between the two datasets and the observed data was drawn with standard deviation as a spatial distribution map see fig 2 it was illustrated that the correlation coefficient between the cmip6 and observed series in evapotranspiration is higher than precipitation in precipitation and soil moisture for evapotranspiration the higher coefficients were found in europe and northern asia i e neu nee nas and the lower in grl and sah but the overall standard deviations were less than 50 mm for precipitation the correlation coefficients were higher in south america and africa i e amz waf eaf sqf than in other regions but larger standard deviations occurred near the equator for soil moisture the correlation coefficients in most regions were low but the correlations in amz and eqf were higher than those in other regions the standard deviations for soil moisture were also small in most regions namely for precipitation the spatial distribution of precipitation of canesm5 was higher than other regions in northeastern asia southern africa western south america and central and northern north america although subject to the influence of an interpolation method the simulation situation in coastal areas and near the equator was poor which is closely related to monsoons and special climatic phenomena including climate warming for evapotranspiration canesm5 presented a situation similar to precipitation in the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration bcc csm2 mr as the best data set among the 11 gcms and its spatial distribution did not show a good correlation in asia and northeast europe and it performed relatively poorly in summary data of canesm5 provided the input of precipitation and evapotranspiration parameters for spi and spei in combination with the above analysis data of the bcc csm2 mr was selected as the runoff input part of sri in canesm5 and bcc csm2 mr 3 2 drought frequency the period 2015 2100 was divided into two time periods 2015 2057 and 2058 2100 fig 3 shows drought frequency for different drought classes and different drought indices in the two periods the drought frequency was expressed as a percentage with higher percentages indicating more frequent droughts in terms of different drought severities the drought frequency gradually decreased as the number of drought classes decreased from spi the decrease in drought frequency was mainly concentrated in northern south america and southern africa amz sqf with a decrease of about 30 while northern oceania nau also had a decrease of nearly 10 and the largest decrease was in sas with a decrease of about 40 from spei the drought frequency decrease was mainly concentrated in northern europe nas and the decrease was similar to that of spi however the decrease of drought frequency in grl which had the same latitude as nas was not obvious it indicated that in this region all of them were dominated by exceptional drought events from sri the decrease of drought frequency was relatively average with the decrease of the number of drought classes and there was no obvious decrease in the region but the overall drought frequency decreased by 5 10 the three indexes showed relatively consistent trends across drought severity classes but the drought frequency performance varied among the indexes only spei showed a higher drought frequency in grl while spi failed to show drought frequency in the nas region numerically spi reflected the smallest drought frequency with most areas concentrated in 0 20 and the highest drought frequency was not exceeding 45 spei had the highest drought frequency of 65 but the area was smaller and the overall trend was similar to that of spi the drought frequency in most areas was higher than 20 and the highest frequency exceeded 80 and the average drought frequency was much higher than spi and spei comparing the drought frequency in two different periods it can be found that the overall drought frequency had a slight increase over time but the overall upward trend was very slow no more than 5 only the central africa waf eaf eqf sqf shown by sri had a high amplitude and the maximum amplitude was no more than 10 55 increased to 65 spei showed a decrease in drought frequency with time in high latitudes but this did not mean that the drought situation would be weakened because another factor leading to drought was drought duration which will be discussed later from the current status of drought frequency the overall spatial extent of sri drought frequency was higher than that of spi and spei and most of africa waf eaf eqf sqf and northern south america amz were the zones with higher drought frequency the overall drought frequency did not change much with time indicating that when the frequency of drought events increased to a certain level a boundary effect would occur which may eventually lead to a more severe drought disaster under the ssp5 8 5 scenario the drought frequency would decrease in the future indicating that a large number of exceptional droughts would occur in the future which was considered as a drought transfer effect this shifting effect was not a transfer between drought types but a shift from less severe or negligible drought events to more severe droughts as the environment deteriorated which was important and will be discussed later around exceptional drought besides spi showed a more even distribution of drought frequencies with no one region being more severe drought suggesting that drought events would eventually have global impacts through changes in runoff conditions as carbon emissions increased but that droughts closer to the coastline would be less severe mainly due to energy exchange between seawater and inland this paper did not consider inundation due to sea level rise where seawater inundation results in more inland areas will be transformed into coasts and areas close to the coast will disappear from the world fig 4 shows changes in the spatial pattern of the exceptional drought frequency in 2015 2057 and 2058 2100 compared with 1850 2014 for 6 months between 2015 and 2057 except that the sri index showed a large increase in drought frequency compared with the baseline period the drought frequency of spi and spei showed a decreasing trend in the middle and high latitudes the drought frequency of spi and spei decreased by about 5 compared with the baseline period in the middle and high latitudes and some high latitudes wna cna neu nee decreased by 10 in the spatial pattern presented by spi in contrast drought frequency increased by 15 in most areas and by 5 in waf med sah cas tib wna and sau between 2058 and 2100 the overall trend of drought frequency was similar to the previous stage and spi showed lower drought frequency in eqf some studies presented that global climate change will bring more droughts and floods and more droughts will increase in arid regions and decreased in humid regions flato and boer 2001 seen from spi and spei in fig 4 the increase of drought frequency was more obvious in arid areas in the humid areas can also be confirmed it indicated that precipitation and evapotranspiration are both important factors affecting drought frequency compared with the changes of drought frequency in the two periods the drought frequency did not change much in sri and only tib showed a small fluctuation with a fluctuation range of about 10 the spei drought frequency increased significantly the drought frequency in 2058 2100 compared with the baseline period showed a positive increase the overall drought frequency increased by more than 15 and the waf area had an increase of more than 20 the spi also showed an increase compared with 2015 2057 but the drought frequency in high latitudes was still lower than the baseline period overall the drought frequency showed an overall high consistency in the ssp5 8 5 scenario and will gradually increase with future developments the increase in drought frequency at high latitudes med sqf and amz was smaller than the increase at middle and low latitudes however this phenomenon does not prove that drought conditions would be better in high latitudes than in middle and low latitudes a decrease in drought frequency did not mean a decrease in the total number of drought months lower drought frequencies may be for more prolonged drought events or even correspond to longer drought epochs over large areas therefore drought duration will be analyzed in what follows 3 3 drought duration fig 5 shows the drought duration for different drought classes and different drought indices in the two periods the drought duration is measured in months experienced and the higher the number of months the longer the drought duration in terms of different drought severities the drought duration gradually decreased as the number of drought levels decreased from spi the regions with longer drought durations in the future were mainly in the middle and high latitudes where the drought duration was about 3 4 months in csa sqf nau and sau areas lower drought ephemeris of 0 1 months occurred this situation differed from the drought frequency in the same period the spi had lower drought frequencies in the middle and high latitudes than in the mid latitudes meaning that the drought situation demonstrated by spi would not be significantly alleviated in the future however as the number of drought levels decreased the drought duration shortened more in northern europe with a decrease of more than 1 month from spei the areas with longer drought durations were in the central africa region waf eqf eaf with drought durations of more than 20 months the areas with a greater decrease in drought duration were in western europe med neu nee with a decrease of about 4 months from sri the global drought duration showed a more average situation with no obvious regional characteristics and an average drought duration between 3 and 5 months the drought duration of spi in high latitudes was basically the same as that of sri but the drought duration of sri in other areas was higher than that of spi the drought duration of spei in mid latitudes was much higher than that of other indices about 8 10 times higher than that of other indexes in addition some high latitudes also had a higher distribution of drought duration which was basically consistent with the causes of drought in antarctica due to the greater influence of circulation at high latitudes low multi year precipitation and low multi year average temperature the trend of drought duration in spi decreased with time and it was more obvious in the exceptional drought level with a decrease of about 1 month the highest increase in drought duration among the three indexes was observed in northeastern south america central africa and northern oceania amz waf eaf nau where the drought duration nearly doubled in general the spatial extent of drought duration decreased with the increase of drought level but the change between extreme drought and exceptional drought was not obvious which was consistent with the reflection of drought frequency indicating that exceptional drought events did occupy a larger proportion of future drought events and the phenomenon also verified that drought events would be transmitted in different drought levels fig 6 shows changes in the spatial pattern of the exceptional 6 month drought in 2015 2057 and 2058 2100 compared with 1850 2014 under the ssp5 8 5 scenario during 2015 2057 the drought duration increased globally compared with the baseline period with an increase of 0 2 month in most regions especially in south america and south africa amz csa sqf the drought duration of spi spei and sri increased by 0 4 10 and 0 8 months respectively during 2058 2100 the average drought duration increments of spi and sri were similar within 0 1 month spi showed a partial reduction in drought duration in neu consistent with the previous stage but the area of reduction in drought duration decreased compared with the drought duration of the next two stages the spei showed an increase of 0 5 month in most regions while spi and sri showed an increase of 0 2 and 0 4 months in northern south america and central africa respectively meanwhile the increase of drought duration in most coastal areas was greater than that in inland areas on the whole the average exceptional drought duration on the 6 month time scale was still low and the change was not obvious outside the spei area the spei showed that drought duration changes were more concentrated in the middle latitudes indicating that the impact of global climate change was more concentrated in the equatorial region the above phenomena were caused by the increase of temperature evapotranspiration and precipitation with the global climate change there was a mitigation relationship between the impact of temperature and precipitation which led to no increase in the duration of global drought by spi and sri in terms of hydrometeorological elements precipitation and soil moisture are two direct elements to influence the drought global changes of drought duration from the spi and sri are small evapotranspiration is an indirect factor mainly in association with temperature for drought and the spei is collectively resulted in precipitation and temperature the change of temperature plays an important role in prolonging drought duration when less impact from precipitation 3 4 drought area fig 7 shows changes in the time scale and spatial extent of all indexes in 26 regions around the world exceptional drought this value was the change in the spatial extent of the exceptional drought on a 6 month time scale of spi spei and sri in the future 2015 2100 compared with the base period 1930 2014 it was found in all regions that the spatial extent of spei varied the most especially in tropical and subtropical regions around 2100 where the impact of global warming was higher than that of other regions among them at the end of the 21st century the spatial extent of spei of northern europe med oceania nau sau northern south america amz and most of africa sah waf eaf eqf sqf saf increased by more than 50 but the spatial extent of spi and sri had hardly changed on the other hand the spei spatial extent of temperate regions such as western america wna and central asia cas had a small increase about 30 in addition the spatial extent of sri in all regions was higher than that of spi but the spatial extent of sri in most regions at the end of the 21st century was less than 10 indicating that climate change had less impact on the spatial extent of sri except for the mediterranean region med parts of south america ssa and parts of central america cam the spatial extent of spi in almost all regions had not changed significantly throughout the 21st century generally speaking in the next period of time although various drought indicators would increase or remain unchanged it did not mean that the drought would ease especially in the context of ssp5 8 5 according to the data the spatial extent of the spi and sri indicators would be maintained at a certain baseline level while the spatial extent of drought indicated by spei would increase and the drought situation would remain severe the description of the spatial extent of drought effectively confirmed the previous conclusions on the frequency and duration of drought the area where the extent of drought increased sharply was also the area where the frequency of drought increased and the duration of drought also changed with the frequency and extent of drought 4 discussion first of all this paper selected different cmip6 data to be interpolated on a grid of 2 5 in order to compare the data uniformly and it was more in line with the characteristics of global statistics in the follow up research for smaller areas it is recommended to use a resolution that can show more details such as 1 0 25 or even 0 1 the drought trend based on ssp8 5 8 future situation data was described but the current international requirements for various countries and the future development trend of each country were more inclined to be lower than the scenario of ssp8 5 8 therefore the ssp2 4 5 which represents a scenario combining moderate social vulnerability and radiative forcing for achieving sustainable development was selected to further know how drought trends will be in the future using 2014 as the dividing line and 1850 2014 as the benchmark it explored the changes in the drought index from 2015 to 2100 three drought indices 6 month of spi spei and sri to describe the development of drought were compared in fig 8 it can be seen from fig 8 that in the context of ssp2 4 5 the data of the three indicators had not changed much among them sri was more stable in the world and spi and spei had a certain degree of fluctuation at the same time the changes in each region were also in line with the overall drought trend described in ssp8 5 8 judging from the box plot the range of spi was more stable and there were no outliers spei fluctuated greatly and slightly reflected an upward trend on the whole in the scenario of ssp2 4 5 the spread of drought was significantly slower than in the scenario of ssp5 8 5 and the change from the baseline period data was not obvious indicating that ssp2 4 5 can effectively control the spread of drought if most countries in the world made efforts and sacrifices for the agreement drought can be controlled artificially and the ecological environment and development would be better after comparing the two ssp scenarios horizontally this article focused on multiple vertical cmip data it selected the rcp scenario of cmip5 and the ssp scenario of cmip6 for comparison in order not to be affected by the calculation model of cmip6 this paper selected the results from literature for comparison due to the length of the space only some important points are summarized firstly based on the cmip5 data it was found that most droughts were caused by increased evapotranspiration and the increase in precipitation was a more positive way of impact orlowsky and seneviratne 2012 this view was basically consistent with the view obtained in fig 2 secondly analyzing the rcp8 5 scenario ashfaq et al 2015 the conclusions of drought characteristics in various regions of the world were similar to the results of this study at the same time in the data introduction of cmip the difference between ssp8 5 8 and rcp8 5 was small finally in the best data in terms of the judgment of the datasets this article is different from the cmip5 data some studies report that the optimal cmip5 for precipitation were cnrm cm5 and miroc4h wu et al 2014 arid semi arid regions and canesm4 ranks no four digits zhao et al 2014 there was a 4 deviation with the best datasets for the global scale the multi mode coupled cmip5 was a better dataset through the analysis of global climate drought characteristics it is believed that the cmip6 inherits part of the advantages of cmip5 and can show the future close to the real drought situation which is more obvious under high emission scenarios however there are still few discussions related to cmip6 and it cannot be simply assumed that cmip6 is better than cmip5 but the comparative analysis of multiple scenarios and institutions will be the trend of exploring drought in the future 5 conclusions this paper aimed at validating the newly released cmip6 and exploring the global drought characteristics based on cmip6 the following conclusions were reached through multiple screening shared socioeconomic pathways and multiple drought indicators 1 for the cmip6 selection data most of the 11 gcms selected performed better with the observed data in terms of standard deviation indicating high accuracy of cmip6 data canesm5 and bcc csm2 mr showed unique advantages from three perspectives precipitation evapotranspiration and soil water comparisons were acceptable both in terms of correlation and standard deviation in terms of the spatial distribution of precipitation multiple data showed more distinct differences with overall cmip6 performing better in africa asia and south america 2 in considering future drought frequency and drought duration the period 2015 2100 was divided into two time periods and drought frequency and drought duration were calculated on the basis of the ssp5 8 5 scenario it was concluded that drought frequency and drought duration were internally transmitted across different drought classes and that the three indicators showed different spatial distributions of drought frequency and drought duration and as shown by sri the spatial distribution of droughts was more widespread the overall drought situation in northern africa was not promising but other regions should be aware of the globalization of drought trends and that exceptional drought would become more common in the future 3 in terms of drought characteristics the spatial extent frequency and duration of droughts were increasing in most parts of the world in addition high latitudes were more affected by global climate change than equatorial regions and under ssp5 8 5 global drought changes showed a strong consistency and overall drier characteristics 4 in terms of the spatial extent of drought different regions were not consistent most regions of the spi and sri indexes showed a stable and slightly rising trend while the spei s showed a more obvious rise the spatial extent of spei in most areas was above 30 and sri was about 10 therefore it was concluded that the main factor affecting the spatial extent of drought in the future would evapotranspiration rather than the sudden decrease of rainfall the increased drought risk means that it will cause irreversible harm to the global human system social system economic system and even the whole ecosystem and the areas with high drought risk need to be managed more effectively and water resources management should be controlled effectively to further adjust the unreasonable policies and guidelines in addition this paper also discussed drought characteristics based on the moderate emission in the future and showed that the sustainable development can effectively reduce the global drought risk credit authorship contribution statement tian wang methodology xinjun tu formal analysis supervision vijay p singh supervision
