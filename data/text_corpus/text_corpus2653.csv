13265,managing oily wastewater continues to be a significant challenge with the continuous rise in oil extraction and processing necessitating new and improved technologies to separate oil from water in this regard smart materials provide controllable super wettability to separate either oil or water from their mixture based on the chosen wetting properties of the material however several challenges facing smart materials include high cost low separation fluxes poor durability and complex equipment for separation this study demonstrates the use of a fluorine free superhydrophobic superoleophilic copper mesh fabricated using n 2 aminoethyl 11 aminoundecyltrimethoxysilane oil water separation using this material allows separation fluxes exceeding 80 000 l m2 h with separation efficiencies above 90 this cost effective and straightforward approach is also durable as demonstrated via abrasion tests more importantly we demonstrate a simple strategy to reversibly switch the wettability of the copper mesh between hydrophilic oleophobic and hydrophobic oleophilic states this strategy allows varying the static water contact angles between 150o and 0o consequently oil can be separated from an oil water mixture using the hydrophobic oleophilic wetting state while water can be separated from the oil water mixture using the hydrophilic oleophobic wetting state with further development this material can address oily wastewater produced in industrial applications and oil spills graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords copper mesh water oil separation switchable wettability high flux separation wettability transition 1 introduction with a continuous rise in manufacturing processes technologies and oil and gas extraction largescale production of oily wastewater is emerging as a serious environmental concern oil extraction may also utilize significant amounts of water which can be an order of magnitude larger than the quantity of oil produced 1 besides accidents during production can contaminate local water bodies resulting in catastrophic environmental effects in extreme cases such as the bp deepwater horizon oil spill 2 the discharge of oily wastewater into the environment can have a global impact with severe damages to aquatic ecosystems the fishing industry and human health 3 hence there is a crucial need for new technologies capable of separating oil mixed with water oily pollutants can be removed using several techniques including flotation coagulation biological treatment and membrane separation 4 7 in this regard membrane filtration and adsorption technologies using superwetting materials have shown great promise over traditional methods owing to their low cost high efficiency and environmentally friendly approach hence several efforts have taken advantage of the materials with superwetting properties 8 10 specifically metallic meshes can be tailored to become wetting or non wetting using a variety of chemicals for example lauric acid was shown to modify the wetting characteristics of copper mesh for oil water separation 11 achieving higher separation fluxes with switchable wetting behavior can be advantageous since it provides more flexibility in conducting oil water separation superwetting properties are achieved mainly from the surface morphology and chemical composition of the surface the resulting superwetting properties can have different interfacial effects on oil and water creating new opportunities and strategies for oil water separation recently smart separation has gained significant interest since it can remove both oil and water using the same material by applying an external stimulus these stimuli responsive materials have been demonstrated over the years with the external stimuli being ph temperature electric potential magnetic field light and pressure 12 17 different polymers as membrane materials can show ph responsive wettability for example carboxyl and polyacrylic acid paa can be used under low ph to create an oleophilic surface by forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds 18 other stimuli responsive surfaces include the use of light for instance the separation of brine oil mixtures was accomplished on a dye sensitized tio2 surface using visible light illumination 19 another technique for changing wetting characteristics of materials includes pre wetting the surface with oil or water to attract the polar or non polar groups to the membrane by using this approach a superamphiphobic mesh was fabricated to separate light and heavy oil on demand by introducing a low surface energy solvent 20 table 1 below shows recent studies illustrating oil water separation using different materials with corresponding fluxes and efficiencies this study describes the use of n 2 aminoethyl 11 aminoundecyltrimethoxysilane to create a low surface energy material with low adhesion to water we chose this substance over others because of the amine group s potential to respond to external stimuli and demonstrate switching of interfacial activity the preparation of a superhydrophobic superoleophilic material presented here is a simple inexpensive and relatively quick two step dip process which does not involve any special fabrication equipment to achieve the surface morphology for superwetting behavior on copper we deposited cucl crystals on a copper mesh to introduce dual scale roughness 40 moreover the copper mesh allows much larger pore sizes for oil water separation relative to polymeric materials resulting in significantly larger fluxes 26 additionally the copper mesh provides high temperature stability and higher mechanical strength while being pliable making it a more durable filter than temperature sensitive polymeric materials the current study takes advantage of the favorable properties of a copper mesh to demonstrate an efficient and low cost technique for high flux oil water separation the process involves an eco friendly fluorine free simple dip coating process that creates a superwetting mesh yielding high separation fluxes specifically we discuss the performance of a silane coated copper mesh as a superhydrophobic superoleophilic filter including its mechanical durability and stability in acidic and basic environments since copper meshes with different pore structures can be readily procured this fabrication process is scalable since it does not involve difficult time consuming and expensive equipment to create the membrane we also demonstrate switchability in wetting using a simple chemical treatment step separating oil or water from their mixture in an industrial setting using a larger mesh area with a suitable hydrostatic head height of oil water column above the mesh would allow high oil water separation rates while maintaining the pressure under critical values with the ability to handle large fluxes with switchability this material promises to address the needs for oil water separation in various applications ranging from oil and gas extraction to addressing oil spill accidents 2 experimental section 2 1 materials the fabrication process uses copper mesh

into small pieces of the desired size was washed ultrasonically in ethanol acetone and deionized water for 5 min each the copper mesh was dried under dry nitrogen flow and then immersed in a 15 w w nitric acid solution at room temperature for 10 min then the copper mesh was removed from the solution and thoroughly rinsed with deionized water followed by drying under a nitrogen stream then the copper mesh was immersed in a 0 25 m cucl2 solution ph adjusted to 2 by adding hcl for 3 h at room temperature the resulting mesh with cucl crystals was then washed with ethanol followed by silane deposition in aqueous alcohol containing 95 ethanol 4 water and 1 silane c16h38n2o3si the deposition time lasted 4 min after which the mesh was removed from the solution and rinsed with ethanol for silane deposition the manufacturer gelest suggested process involves starting at 2 min and then increasing the time based on the desired coverage initially 2 min of deposition time resulted in non uniform surface coating hence the deposition was conducted for 4 min which provided full coverage of the mesh with the silane molecule then the amino functional silane coated copper mesh was cured in an oven for 10 min at 80 c 2 3 characterization the surface morphologies of pristine and modified copper mesh were observed using a scanning electron microscope sem carl zeiss supra 55 fesem and elemental analysis was carried out using energy dispersion spectroscopy eds oxford aztec fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir perkin elmer spectrum one was used to analyze the chemical composition a contact angle measuring instrument rame hart model 590 was used to measure water contact angle wca and underwater oil contact angle uoca using 10 Î¼l droplets the average contact angles reported here represent the average of left and right contact angles all digital photos were obtained using a digital single lens reflex camera nikon d610 2 4 oil water separation the fabricated superhydrophobic copper mesh was used in the arrangement shown in fig 2 the modified mesh separated oil water using a vertical flow arrangement where the fluid mixture is suspended on top of the copper mesh all experiments were conducted with no external pressure source and the separation proceeded under the influence of gravity all oils used in experiments were dyed by sudan iv for clear distinction with water after separation the separation efficiency Î· of oil water is quantified using eq 1 1 Î· m p m 0 100 where m p represents the mass of liquid that permeates through the mesh and m 0 denotes the total mass of the permeate in the original mixture before separation the separation efficiency of the device was based only on the collected oil the water content in the collected oil was assumed negligible based on no observable oil water interfaces in the collection flask for extended durations this calculation procedure could also underpredict the separation efficiency since any oil left on the membrane or evaporating from the surface was not considered lowering the amount of oil collected after complete separation we measured the separation flux to quantify the oil water separation performance the mass flux across the fabricated copper mesh was calculated using eq 2 2 flux m p Ïat where m p is the total mass of permeate flowing through the mesh Ï is the density of the permeate a represents the effective area of the membrane in the separation device and t is the duration for separation 3 results 3 1 morphologies and composition the presence of a rough surface on the copper mesh promotes the cassie wetting state 27 this wetting state was accomplished by immersing the mesh in an acidic cucl2 solution followed by surface modification using n 2 aminoethyl 11 aminoundecyltrimethoxysilane fig 3 shows the sem images of the clean copper mesh and the silane coated cucl copper mesh the main difference between the pristine copper mesh and silane modified cucl copper mesh is the dual roughness and micro texture that can be seen in the sem insets a b and c are smooth since no etching took place insets d e and f show that the copper mesh has non uniform square topography that is roughly 10 Î¼m in length the small protrusions in the sem are nanoscale and cover the entirety of the microstructures it is also evident that the etching process has not compromised the mesh size although the silane used in this study is a polar molecule the surface still displays superhydrophobic properties since the charged amine group is chemically bonded to the copper surface the silanol formation is shown in fig 4 where the bulk of the surface will consist of the bent alkyl chain non polar group the methoxy group in the silane molecule undergoes hydrolysis creating polar hydroxyl groups attached to the silicon atom the polar hydroxyl groups form a bond with the surface due to the affinity to the chlorine atoms present on the copper surface the reaction between n 2 aminoethyl 11 aminoundecyltrimethoxysilane and cucl2 is shown below cu 0 s c u ii c l 2 aq 2 c u i cl s sio 3 c h 3 16 n 2 3 h 2 o si c h 3 13 nhn h 2 oh 3 3 c h 3 oh cucl si c h 3 13 nhn

surface at 2953 cm 1 and 2874 cm 1 from the ch stretching mode 28 nitrogen groups show characteristic signals for a primary amine of an n h stretching vibration mode at 3440 cm 1 and 3289 cm 1 29 relative to published information on nh stretching vibrations 30 we believe nh shifted towards a higher wavenumber due to the stretching of the alkyl chain and bending of the amine which is typical for interactions between copper and amine groups 31 the c n stretching mode at 1259 cm 1 and 803 cm 1 is assigned to a typical n h bending vibration for a primary and secondary amine 32 the formation of siloxane bonds sio stretch can be inferred from the band located at 1085 cm 1 9 the eds analysis shows the chemical composition of the copper mesh at different stages of fabrication the cucl copper mesh can be seen in fig 6 a before silanization fig 6b corresponds to cucl copper mesh after silanization with the surface composed of si and an increase in c from the alkyl chain of the silane and a decrease in o from the reaction of surface hydroxyl groups with the hydroxyl group of the silane molecule additionally the eds analysis detects trace amounts of fe and al impurities present at negligibly small amounts 3 2 wettability introducing a rough hierarchical structure on a surface may allow either superhydrophobic or superhydrophilic wettability 33 in this regard surface microstructures and chemical composition play critical roles in affecting surface wettability 34 cucl copper mesh is hydrophilic without any surface modification and the silane coated cucl copper mesh is superhydrophobic due to low surface energy resulting from the coating compare fig 7 a and b the silane modified mesh conforms to the cassie baxter state wherein the liquid does not penetrate the air filled gaps of the rough surface in this case the surface wettability is governed by the following eq 3 3 cos Î¸ r f 1 cosÎ¸ f 2 where Î¸ r and Î¸ are the contact angles of the silane coated mesh and a flat cucl copper foil respectively f 1 is the fraction of liquid droplet base in contact with the solid and f 2 is the fraction of the droplet base in contact with air f 1 f 2 1 for the silane coated cucl copper mesh Î¸ r is 150 and Î¸ is 49 accordingly eq 3 gives f 1 0 081 and f 2 0 919 the calculation shows that the area fraction of water droplets contacting air is 91 9 and the area fraction of water droplets contacting the silane coated cucl copper mesh is only 8 1 this observation indicates a significant amount of air trapped within the rough structures of the copper mesh resulting in the superhydrophobicity of the mesh consequently water droplets are prevented from penetrating the copper mesh however the oil has a strong affinity with the long alkyl chains of the silane similarly interactions between oil or water and the silane coated cucl copper mesh make it superoleophobic and superhydrophilic fig 7c in this case the water wets the mesh and exists in the wenzel state but oil exists in the cassie baxter state the contact angle for the oil droplet on the cucl copper mesh submerged in water was calculated using the following eq 4 35 4 cos Î¸ ow f Î³ os Î³ ws Î³ ow f 1 where Î³ os and Î³ ws are the surface tensions at the oil solid and water solid interfaces respectively and f is the fraction of the droplet base in contact with the solid surface with Î³ ws higher than Î³ os we achieve a contact angle Î¸ ow much larger than 90 on the rough surface the silane treated mesh is superoleophilic allowing oil to wet the mesh and pass through it easily fig 7d in this case water will exist in the cassie baxter state while oil will displace air within the mesh s textured surface to exist in the wenzel state a series of experiments show the wetting behavior of the superhydrophobic and superoleophilic silane coated copper mesh surface the unmodified cucl copper mesh sank in a beaker of water while the silane modified cucl copper mesh was unaffected by the water and was buoyant in a beaker of water fig 8 a the water intrusion pressure p of the silane coated cucl copper mesh was calculated using eq 5 5 p Ïg h max where Ï is the density of water g is the acceleration of gravity and h max is the maximum height of water supported by the mesh fig 8b this measurement was conducted by placing the mesh under a water column to exert hydrostatic pressure as shown in fig 8b for example with a maximum height of 15 4 cm water cannot penetrate the mesh for a pressure differential less than 1 51 kpa microscopic air pockets are trapped within the microscale roughness of the modified copper mesh submerged in water air trapping within the mesh results in higher reflectance of visible light especially when viewed at an oblique angle making the surface look like a mirror the silver mirror phenomenon 36 evident in fig 8c shows that the mesh prevents water penetration through the pores this observation is yet another indication of the cassie wetting state since sufficient roughness is required to create a superhydrophobic surface and trapped air between the mesh and the water further water repellency of the silane coated copper mesh is demonstrated in the supplementary videos see supplementary information 3 3 mechanical stability the superhydrophobic properties of rough surfaces are typically at risk of losing their wettability properties since the molecules are either monomolecular or a fragile film on the surface the mechanical stability is an essential indicator of whether the material can withstand nonideal conditions in practical applications 37 we also quantify performance repeatability by conducting multiple cycles and examining the efficiency of oil water separation the mechanical stability was investigated by conducting abrasion tests with 220 grit sandpaper the tests were carried out by moving the fabricated mesh 20 cm along the sandpaper with an external pressure of 75 g as shown in fig 9 the wca decreased marginally after ten cycles of the abrasion test however even after hundreds of cycles the mesh properties are still water repelling even though the mesh itself was beginning to fall apart fig 9 the mesh gets smooth streaks in the areas treated with sandpaper this aggressive test also results in many frayed wires as shown in the inset 3 4 switchable surface the silane modified copper mesh remains hydrophobic over a wide range of ph values this test was conducted by using different concentrations of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide as shown in fig 10 the wettability of the silane modified copper mesh changes from hydrophobic to hydrophilic only below a ph of 4 in order to make the surface wettability easily switchable we use acetic acid to weakly interact with the hydrocarbon chain on the silane modified surface via van der waals forces while acetic acid introduces additional methyl groups it also contains a polar carboxylic acid group to interact favorably with water in order to test the hypothesis 1 v v acetic acid was added to the surface which quickly showed wetting phenomena 1 v v acetic acid which is roughly the same concentration as the household vinegar can wet the silane modified surface of the cucl copper mesh and penetrate the pores of the mesh fig 11 a the solutions contact angle dropped significantly with higher acetic acid concentration as shown in fig 11b and c more importantly this effect is reversible the mesh can be returned to a hydrophobic state by rinsing with di water and nitrogen drying for 30 s fig 12 the transition in wettability is illustrated in fig 13 while the methyl group within acetic acid interacts with the hydrocarbon chain of the bound silane molecule on copper a favorable interaction of acetic acid s carboxylic group takes place with water the addition of more water creates additional hydrogen bonds on the surface making it hydrophilic further possibilities that will need to be addressed in future studies are the possibility of amine protonation and if the acetic acid switching mechanism relates to the amine as well as the hydrocarbon chain in order to demonstrate the switch to a hydrophilic mesh 1 acetic acid was added in sufficient volume to cover the mesh and ensure wetting homogeneity across the surface the specific concentration of 1 acetic acid was strong enough to change the surface from superhydrophobic to superhydrophilic while at the same time avoiding a more acidic environment for the oil water separation process the purpose of the rinsing and drying of the surface is to remove the weakly bonded acetic acid and reintroduce air in the microscale voids of the modified copper mesh making it superhydrophobic again the di water rinse also removes any spontaneously formed acetate salt on the surface of the mesh 3 5 on demand oil water separation a mixture of oil and water was separated with a superhydrophobic mesh using the arrangement shown in fig 14 this investigation was carried out using a water clear toluene red mixture the addition of toluene to water creates a dispersed oil mixture which is poured into the separation device the separation performance was quantified by measuring the mass change in the oil collected while repelling water in the mixture using the mesh with the modified copper mesh locked tight in the separation device oil flows easily through the mesh while water is held from penetrating the mesh as shown in fig 15 the modified mesh has an average separation efficiency of 94 and the separation fluxes of the water oil mixture are all above 46 197 l m2h reaching as high as 80 050 l m2h the separation is evident since the collected water is clear and the toluene is dyed red there was no significant or consistent decrease in separation efficiency or flux for the trials conducted under lab testing conditions indicating no major fouling issues hence the modified copper mesh can sustain significantly higher separation fluxes relative to the traditional polymeric membrane approach 38 39 with a decrease in mesh size we would expect the separation efficiency to increase and the separation flux to decrease due to lower permeability the mesh size should be considerably smaller to separate an oil water emulsion since a typical emulsified droplet 10 Î¼m would pass through a copper mesh with a pore opening of 150 Î¼m as for solid contaminants small particles 150 Î¼m suspended in oil would pass through the oleophilic mesh the mesh would retain particles suspended in the aqueous medium this study mainly focuses on separating oil water mixtures and does not consider the removal of particles however the use of a size selective particulate filter as an additional step could help separate suspended particles after the oil separation from the oil water mixture water can be collected separately after adding 1 acetic acid allowing water to penetrate the mesh as shown in fig 16 the mesh wettability can again be switched to superhydrophobic once the mesh is treated with water and dried by passing nitrogen or air for 30 s as described earlier this switching between superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic wettabilities was carried out 20 times to test repeatability as shown in fig 17 it is evident from the study that acetic acid does not corrode the copper mesh since the superhydrophobic wetting state is demonstrated repeatably this process indicates that the acetic acid does not react with the underlying copper layer it is only weakly attached to the hydrophobic chain of the silane through van der waals forces consequently acetic acid is easily rinsed away and can be reused in this case a single drop 10 Î¼l of 5 acetic acid was used to switch between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces the result indicates that the switching process can be carried out without significant degradation in the wetting transition the process of adding acetic acid will reduce the time of switching out separation meshes in industrial applications this approach will also cut material costs since only one mesh layer is needed to separate water or oil instead of multiple meshes with different wettabilities lastly the separation system will not need significant changes or adjustments requiring only simple flow control to manage the separate collection of oil and water 4 conclusion this study describes the use of a copper mesh with dual scale roughness and switchable wettability for oil water separation with gravity driven flow the fabricated materials demonstrate high flux and high efficiency separation of oil water mixtures furthermore the durability tests conducted using a toluene water mixture indicate that it is possible to maintain high separation fluxes and efficiencies even after repeated use of the mesh based on abrasion tests conducted using sandpaper the superhydrophobic mesh showed good robustness by demonstrating non wetting behavior even though the copper mesh itself was compromised furthermore the study demonstrates reversible switching in wetting states of the copper mesh using simple intermediary steps this switching behavior was demonstrated using mild 1 v v acetic acid transforming the silane coated mesh from a hydrophobic to a hydrophilic surface the wettability is switched back to a hydrophobic behavior by flowing water and then drying with nitrogen this process provides a practical and straightforward strategy for treating oily wastewater in industrial applications and a promising approach to address

between n 2 aminoethyl 11 aminoundecyltrimethoxysilane and cucl2 is shown below cu 0 s c u ii c l 2 aq 2 c u i cl s sio 3 c h 3 16 n 2 3 h 2 o si c h 3 13 nhn h 2 oh 3 3 c h 3 oh cucl si c h 3 13 nhn

surface at 2953 cm 1 and 2874 cm 1 from the ch stretching mode 28 nitrogen groups show characteristic signals for a primary amine of an n h stretching vibration mode at 3440 cm 1 and 3289 cm 1 29 relative to published information on nh stretching vibrations 30 we believe nh shifted towards a higher wavenumber due to the stretching of the alkyl chain and bending of the amine which is typical for interactions between copper and amine groups 31 the c n stretching mode at 1259 cm 1 and 803 cm 1 is assigned to a typical n h bending vibration for a primary and secondary amine 32 the formation of siloxane bonds sio stretch can be inferred from the band located at 1085 cm 1 9 the eds analysis shows the chemical composition of the copper mesh at different stages of fabrication the cucl copper mesh can be seen in fig 6 a before silanization fig 6b corresponds to cucl copper mesh after silanization with the surface composed of si and an increase in c from the alkyl chain of the silane and a decrease in o from the reaction of surface hydroxyl groups with the hydroxyl group of the silane molecule additionally the eds analysis detects trace amounts of fe and al impurities present at negligibly small amounts 3 2 wettability introducing a rough hierarchical structure on a surface may allow either superhydrophobic or superhydrophilic wettability 33 in this regard surface microstructures and chemical composition play critical roles in affecting surface wettability 34 cucl copper mesh is hydrophilic without any surface modification and the silane coated cucl copper mesh is superhydrophobic due to low surface energy resulting from the coating compare fig 7 a and b the silane modified mesh conforms to the cassie baxter state wherein the liquid does not penetrate the air filled gaps of the rough surface in this case the surface wettability is governed by the following eq 3 3 cos Î¸ r f 1 cosÎ¸ f 2 where Î¸ r and Î¸ are the contact angles of the silane coated mesh and a flat cucl copper foil respectively f 1 is the fraction of liquid droplet base in contact with the solid and f 2 is the fraction of the droplet base in contact with air f 1 f 2 1 for the silane coated cucl copper mesh Î¸ r is 150 and Î¸ is 49 accordingly eq 3 gives f 1 0 081 and f 2 0 919 the calculation shows that the area fraction of water droplets contacting air is 91 9 and the area fraction of water droplets contacting the silane coated cucl copper mesh is only 8 1 this observation indicates a significant amount of air trapped within the rough structures of the copper mesh resulting in the superhydrophobicity of the mesh consequently water droplets are prevented from penetrating the copper mesh however the oil has a strong affinity with the long alkyl chains of the silane similarly interactions between oil or water and the silane coated cucl copper mesh make it superoleophobic and superhydrophilic fig 7c in this case the water wets the mesh and exists in the wenzel state but oil exists in the cassie baxter state the contact angle for the oil droplet on the cucl copper mesh submerged in water was calculated using the following eq 4 35 4 cos Î¸ ow f Î³ os Î³ ws Î³ ow f 1 where Î³ os and Î³ ws are the surface tensions at the oil solid and water solid interfaces respectively and f is the fraction of the droplet base in contact with the solid surface with Î³ ws higher than Î³ os we achieve a contact angle Î¸ ow much larger than 90 on the rough surface the silane treated mesh is superoleophilic allowing oil to wet the mesh and pass through it easily fig 7d in this case water will exist in the cassie baxter state while oil will displace air within the mesh s textured surface to exist in the wenzel state a series of experiments show the wetting behavior of the superhydrophobic and superoleophilic silane coated copper mesh surface the unmodified cucl copper mesh sank in a beaker of water while the silane modified cucl copper mesh was unaffected by the water and was buoyant in a beaker of water fig 8 a the water intrusion pressure p of the silane coated cucl copper mesh was calculated using eq 5 5 p Ïg h max where Ï is the density of water g is the acceleration of gravity and h max is the maximum height of water supported by the mesh fig 8b this measurement was conducted by placing the mesh under a water column to exert hydrostatic pressure as shown in fig 8b for example with a maximum height of 15 4 cm water cannot penetrate the mesh for a pressure differential less than 1 51 kpa microscopic air pockets are trapped within the microscale roughness of the modified copper mesh submerged in water air trapping within the mesh results in higher reflectance of visible light especially when viewed at an oblique angle making the surface look like a mirror the silver mirror phenomenon 36 evident in fig 8c shows that the mesh prevents water penetration through the pores this observation is yet another indication of the cassie wetting state since sufficient roughness is required to create a superhydrophobic surface and trapped air between the mesh and the water further water repellency of the silane coated copper mesh is demonstrated in the supplementary videos see supplementary information 3 3 mechanical stability the superhydrophobic properties of rough surfaces are typically at risk of losing their wettability properties since the molecules are either monomolecular or a fragile film on the surface the mechanical stability is an essential indicator of whether the material can withstand nonideal conditions in practical applications 37 we also quantify performance repeatability by conducting multiple cycles and examining the efficiency of oil water separation the mechanical stability was investigated by conducting abrasion tests with 220 grit sandpaper the tests were carried out by moving the fabricated mesh 20 cm along the sandpaper with an external pressure of 75 g as shown in fig 9 the wca decreased marginally after ten cycles of the abrasion test however even after hundreds of cycles the mesh properties are still water repelling even though the mesh itself was beginning to fall apart fig 9 the mesh gets smooth streaks in the areas treated with sandpaper this aggressive test also results in many frayed wires as shown in the inset 3 4 switchable surface the silane modified copper mesh remains hydrophobic over a wide range of ph values this test was conducted by using different concentrations of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide as shown in fig 10 the wettability of the silane modified copper mesh changes from hydrophobic to hydrophilic only below a ph of 4 in order to make the surface wettability easily switchable we use acetic acid to weakly interact with the hydrocarbon chain on the silane modified surface via van der waals forces while acetic acid introduces additional methyl groups it also contains a polar carboxylic acid group to interact favorably with water in order to test the hypothesis 1 v v acetic acid was added to the surface which quickly showed wetting phenomena 1 v v acetic acid which is roughly the same concentration as the household vinegar can wet the silane modified surface of the cucl copper mesh and penetrate the pores of the mesh fig 11 a the solutions contact angle dropped significantly with higher acetic acid concentration as shown in fig 11b and c more importantly this effect is reversible the mesh can be returned to a hydrophobic state by rinsing with di water and nitrogen drying for 30 s fig 12 the transition in wettability is illustrated in fig 13 while the methyl group within acetic acid interacts with the hydrocarbon chain of the bound silane molecule on copper a favorable interaction of acetic acid s carboxylic group takes place with water the addition of more water creates additional hydrogen bonds on the surface making it hydrophilic further possibilities that will need to be addressed in future studies are the possibility of amine protonation and if the acetic acid switching mechanism relates to the amine as well as the hydrocarbon chain in order to demonstrate the switch to a hydrophilic mesh 1 acetic acid was added in sufficient volume to cover the mesh and ensure wetting homogeneity across the surface the specific concentration of 1 acetic acid was strong enough to change the surface from superhydrophobic to superhydrophilic while at the same time avoiding a more acidic environment for the oil water separation process the purpose of the rinsing and drying of the surface is to remove the weakly bonded acetic acid and reintroduce air in the microscale voids of the modified copper mesh making it superhydrophobic again the di water rinse also removes any spontaneously formed acetate salt on the surface of the mesh 3 5 on demand oil water separation a mixture of oil and water was separated with a superhydrophobic mesh using the arrangement shown in fig 14 this investigation was carried out using a water clear toluene red mixture the addition of toluene to water creates a dispersed oil mixture which is poured into the separation device the separation performance was quantified by measuring the mass change in the oil collected while repelling water in the mixture using the mesh with the modified copper mesh locked tight in the separation device oil flows easily through the mesh while water is held from penetrating the mesh as shown in fig 15 the modified mesh has an average separation efficiency of 94 and the separation fluxes of the water oil mixture are all above 46 197 l m2h reaching as high as 80 050 l m2h the separation is evident since the collected water is clear and the toluene is dyed red there was no significant or consistent decrease in separation efficiency or flux for the trials conducted under lab testing conditions indicating no major fouling issues hence the modified copper mesh can sustain significantly higher separation fluxes relative to the traditional polymeric membrane approach 38 39 with a decrease in mesh size we would expect the separation efficiency to increase and the separation flux to decrease due to lower permeability the mesh size should be considerably smaller to separate an oil water emulsion since a typical emulsified droplet 10 Î¼m would pass through a copper mesh with a pore opening of 150 Î¼m as for solid contaminants small particles 150 Î¼m suspended in oil would pass through the oleophilic mesh the mesh would retain particles suspended in the aqueous medium this study mainly focuses on separating oil water mixtures and does not consider the removal of particles however the use of a size selective particulate filter as an additional step could help separate suspended particles after the oil separation from the oil water mixture water can be collected separately after adding 1 acetic acid allowing water to penetrate the mesh as shown in fig 16 the mesh wettability can again be switched to superhydrophobic once the mesh is treated with water and dried by passing nitrogen or air for 30 s as described earlier this switching between superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic wettabilities was carried out 20 times to test repeatability as shown in fig 17 it is evident from the study that acetic acid does not corrode the copper mesh since the superhydrophobic wetting state is demonstrated repeatably this process indicates that the acetic acid does not react with the underlying copper layer it is only weakly attached to the hydrophobic chain of the silane through van der waals forces consequently acetic acid is easily rinsed away and can be reused in this case a single drop 10 Î¼l of 5 acetic acid was used to switch between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces the result indicates that the switching process can be carried out without significant degradation in the wetting transition the process of adding acetic acid will reduce the time of switching out separation meshes in industrial applications this approach will also cut material costs since only one mesh layer is needed to separate water or oil instead of multiple meshes with different wettabilities lastly the separation system will not need significant changes or adjustments requiring only simple flow control to manage the separate collection of oil and water 4 conclusion this study describes the use of a copper mesh with dual scale roughness and switchable wettability for oil water separation with gravity driven flow the fabricated materials demonstrate high flux and high efficiency separation of oil water mixtures furthermore the durability tests conducted using a toluene water mixture indicate that it is possible to maintain high separation fluxes and efficiencies even after repeated use of the mesh based on abrasion tests conducted using sandpaper the superhydrophobic mesh showed good robustness by demonstrating non wetting behavior even though the copper mesh itself was compromised furthermore the study demonstrates reversible switching in wetting states of the copper mesh using simple intermediary steps this switching behavior was demonstrated using mild 1 v v acetic acid transforming the silane coated mesh from a hydrophobic to a hydrophilic surface the wettability is switched back to a hydrophobic behavior by flowing water and then drying with nitrogen this process provides a practical and straightforward strategy for treating oily wastewater in industrial applications and a promising approach to address

maximum mineralization activities of 80 and 70 respectively under optimal conditions in addition they only lose 1 7 0 3 mg of iron and 6 2 0 9 mg of copper during oxidation process catalysts exhibit better activities at ph 3 and 5 respectively for fe and cu iron based catalysts lose their activities when recycled and the activity of 7 5 fe zro2 catalyst decreased Êfrom 80 to 38 after 3 cycles on the contrary cu based catalysts maintain their high activity when recycled overall copper based catalysts are very promising materials with enhanced catalytic activity and high stability for the degradation of ibuprofen in heterogeneous fenton like process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords fenton like oxidation heterogeneous catalysis zro2 ibuprofen wastewater treatment 1 introduction the environmental stress on water bodies is growing due to the addition of a large number of persistent pollutants coming from multidimensional sources 1 conventional biological processes are unable to treat such organic compounds 2 3 and there is an increasing demand for the development of sustainable processes which are able to completely eliminate the pollutants into fundamental chemical entities such as water and carbon dioxide 4 5 advanced oxidation processes aops have shown great potential and have successfully been employed for the treatment of a wide range of wastewater streams containing refractory organics these processes generate very strong oxidizing species such as hydroxyl radicals oh which attack and degrade the pollutants 6 the oh have very high oxidation potential and can degrade a wide range of organics 7 8 several types of aops are applied for the degradation of organic compounds such as ozonation photocatalysis sonolysis electrochemical oxidation catalytic wet air oxidation cwao fenton process and a combination of these techniques 9 among aops fenton process is the most widely employed method for the treatment of wastewaters due to its simplicity low cost and very high oxidation rates 6 10 11 however it has two serious limitations such as the requirement of fairly strict acidic conditions ph 3 3 5 and the production of large volumes of residual sludge during the process which creates additional processing and environmental challenges 12 13 the limitations of the homogeneous fenton process can be easily prevented using heterogeneous catalysts where iron and other transition metals are supported bonded over different metal oxide support materials 14 19 in this way it is possible to reduce the metal loading in fenton like process and the catalyst can be easily recovered and reused in subsequent cycles thus making the process more sustainable 20 24 furthermore heterogeneous catalysts can also afford better catalytic activities over a wide range of ph 14 although a number of heavy metals have been successfully employed iron based materials are used predominantly as heterogeneous fenton like catalysts due to low cost and abundant availability 25 however most of the iron based materials have great tendency to form stable complexes with the organic compounds and lose their activities 26 making regeneration of such deactivated materials a challenging and cost intensive task 26 27 furthermore iron based catalysts are active only under acidic conditions and it is extremely difficult to prevent leaching of iron into the aqueous phase resulting in loss of catalyst activity and release of heavy metals in violation of regulatory guidelines 18 studies employing new types of iron based catalysts have mainly reported the degradation of a model pollutant and not their mineralization which is a more reliable parameter for evaluating the oxidation capacity of a new material with regards to the organic abatement 14 in recent years several alternatives to iron have been investigated as potential fenton like catalysts 28 among them copper based materials have attracted attention as promising material for the development of heterogeneous fenton like catalysts for the organic abatement from liquid streams due to their relatively lower cost compared to other heavy metals low toxicity and high catalytic activities 16 28 30 unlike iron copper do not form stable complexes with the degraded organic products and thus extended recycling of these materials in heterogeneous fenton process is possible making the process more attractive and feasible in terms of economics 29 to enhance the environmental sustainability of the heterogeneous fenton processes it is essential that the catalytic materials are able to completely abate the organics from the liquid streams rather than carrying out mere degradation because the fate of these metabolites still represents an environmental concern moreover the fenton like catalysts should not follow a reaction pathway which leads to the formation of more toxic metabolites than the parent organic substances 31 32 the development of highly active and stable heterogeneous catalysts is a complex challenge because it involves several key steps such as finding the right metal impregnation of the optimal amount of metal over the appropriate support catalyst characterization followed by activity analysis and finally the investigation of the catalyst stability 33 35 numerous articles have been published in the literature on the fenton like reaction carried out in the presence of heterogeneous iron and copper based catalysts for the abatement of different organics 14 18 28 36 only a few studies have investigated the use of zro2 in fenton like reaction 37 39 iron oxide supported over hollow magnetic porous zirconia fibers exhibits good catalytic activity in the photo fenton oxidation of organic pollutants methylene blue and phenol 39 while zirconia coated magnetite nanoparticles has been efficiently used for the removal of 3 4 dichlorobenzotrifluoride with a mineralization of about 53 37 when iron oxide was supported over sulfonated zro2 a toc abatement of 57 has been obtain for treatment of clofibric acid by fenton like process 38 all these reaction has been carried out in acidic conditions to enhanced the iron oxides oxidation capacities zirconia has proved to be an interesting support to be investigated due to its chemical stability and its promising activity when modified by transition metals in a preliminary study we have combined the use of strontium doped copper and iron and zro2 support for the degradation and mineralization of ibuprofen 40 results indicated that cu supported zro2 is a promising catalyst for removal of ibuprofen achieving a complete degradation and a 50 of mineralization ibuprofen has been chosen as a model pollutant due to its serious environmental effect and its wide use with many studies related to its abatement 2 19 31 in the present work we focus on the best fe zro2 and cu zro2 formulations by evaluating the dependence of activity on the various process parameters in order to find conditions for maximum stability coupled with milder reaction conditions that can provide more sustainable solutions for more performant water treatment processes 2 experimental 2 1 catalyst preparation we have prepared a series of zro2 supported catalysts containing between 5 and 10 wt of cu or fe the support was obtained from calcination at 773 k for 3 h of zirconium hydroxide

2 2 5h2o and 0 761 g of fe no3 3 9h2o were dissolved in water 1 2 ml and the solutions was poured over 2 g of the support to reach the required amount of metal loading three different loading of 5 7 5

after reaction samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm using an eppendorf centrifuge 5804 r and filtered through a 0 45 Î¼m membrane filters total organic carbon toc has been used as parameter to follow the mineralization of ibuprofen conversion to co2 and h2o during reaction and has been measured by a toc vcpn shimadzu analyzer v series with auto sampler as reported in a previous work 24 toc monitoring is fundamental because it allows to assess the amount of organics that has been completely removed from liquid waste during treatment the toc removal efficiencies were determined using eq 1 1 toc removal efficiency toc i toc f toc i 100 moreover toc and ibp mineralization have been used interchangeably in this study several experiments were also carried out to verify the reproducibility of our activity measurements and the errors resulted to be within 3 the oxidation process was optimized by evaluating the effects of different parameters as reported in table 1 the leaching of iron and copper during heterogeneous fenton process was determined with us epa 3051 method using inductivity coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes vista pro first a calibration curve was

initially introduced metal weight mg l mf finally left metal weight at the end of fenton like process mg l homogeneous fenton reaction has been carried out to evaluate the contribution of the homogeneous fenton oxidation to the ibp degradation due to leaching of iron and copper from the heterogeneous catalyst during the reaction tests for the homogenous reaction has been carried out in the same condition of heterogeneous fenton process 100 ml of ibuprofen sodium salt solution containing 10 mg l of c13h17o2na has been treated at 343 k for 150 min with 1 g l of hydrogen peroxide and with 2 2 mg of iron iii nitrate nonahydrate at ph 3 or 3 3 mg of copper ii nitrate hemi pentahydrate at ph 5 amount of iron and copper precursors used has been determined from the maximum leaching obtained for fe or cu under reaction conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization table 2 summarizes compositions and bet surface area of the investigated catalysts the addition of cu or fe only slight affects the surface area of pure zro2 which drop from 64 m2 g to 54 60 m2 g in accordance with the bet results crystal size values are in the range 12 14 nm the addition of different metals and different amounts of each metal does not induce substantial changes in the surface area and crystallite size structural characterization has been carried out by means of xrd fig 1 for all the samples reflections due to monoclinic pdf number 98 006 0900 and tetragonal zirconia pdf number 98 065 5671 are observed with main reflection at 28 2 and 30 2 respectively xrd profiles of zr5cu and zr5fe do not reveal the presence of any copper or iron phase suggesting a homogeneous dispersion of cu fe over zirconia that escape detection by x ray diffraction for iron based materials fe2o3 hexagonal space group r 3 c pdf number 98 002 2505 main reflection at 33 2 has been identified at the higher fe loading 7 5 and 10 wt a detailed analysis of the xrd profile for copper based materials 7 5 and 10 wt evidenced some changes with respect to the support profile highlighting the presence of cuo monoclinic space group c 1 2 c 1 pdf number 98 004 3180 main reflection at 38 7 the presence of cuo can be evidenced by the increase in intensity of the peaks at 35 6 and 38 7 in fact these reflections are also visible in the bare support and in zr5cu attributable to the monoclinic zro2 but with a higher amount of copper these peaks change their relative intensity compared to peaks only due to monoclinic zro2 such as peaks at 34 2 and 40 8 as the amount of metal added to the support increases the xrd profiles show more defined peaks for the phases of fe2o3 and cuo indicating the formation of larger crystallites clusters the homogeneity of the materials has also been confirmed by sem analysis fig 2 performed over representative zr7 5fe and zr7 5cu samples elemental composition measured through edxs in several points reveals for zr7 5fe and zr7 5cu an amount of iron and copper respectively between 6 9 8 0 and 6 4 8 2 in good agreement with the nominal loadings for a better understanding of the properties of the two series of the catalyst temperature programmed reduction experiments with h2 h2 tpr have been carried out over zr5fe and zr5cu profiles with multiple reduction signals are observed for both catalysts fig 3 in the case of zr5fe the peaks are very broad and cover a very wide temperature range 473 873 k while in zr5cu two well defined peaks are observed at much lower temperatures 373 573 k in both samples reduction signals are correlated to the presence of the corresponding metal oxide fe2o3 and cuo in accordance with literature 41 43 the reduction of fe2o3 occurs in three steps first the reduction to fe3o4 then the transformation to feo and finally the reduction to metallic fe 42 43 the reduction profiles of zr7 5cu shows two peaks and a small shoulder the first two signals are related to highly dispersed surface cuo species while the shoulder at higher temperature is due to bulk cuo 41 overall the characterization of the materials indicates the formation of fe2o3 and cuo respectively for the iron and copper based catalysts the modification of the metal loading does not change the textural characteristics of the support maintaining a high surface area and not highlighting significant differences in the crystal size the homogeneous dispersion of iron and copper oxides on zro2 is confirmed by xrd profile of the materials sem images and tpr experiments 3 2 effect of ph on catalytic activity and stability the ph of the aqueous phase is the most critical parameter in heterogeneous fenton like process because the catalyst can exhibit maximum activity only in a specific ph range 14 in order to observe the effect of ph on the catalytic performance of iron and copper based catalysts with variable loadings fenton like oxidation was performed at three ph conditions and the results are presented in fig 4 the aqueous solution of ibp has a ph of 5 in addition we tested the catalytic activity under acidic ph 3 and basic ph 8 conditions 44 46 after 30 min of reaction all the formulations achieve almost complete degradation of ibuprofen 97 100 not shown for sake of clarity but the mineralization of the degradation products is strictly related to the reaction conditions this indicates that the developed catalyst can degrade quickly the parent molecule ibp into secondary compounds that are then mineralized to co2 and h2o maximum mineralization ranges from 5 to 80 depending on the metal and conditions and it was reached in the first 30 min with only small variations recorded for longer times this behavior is due to the high intrinsic activity of the catalysts which allow to mineralize ibuprofen in the very first minutes of the reaction for times longer than 30 min the mineralization of ibp undergoes few variations because the reaction induces degradation into secondary compounds that cannot be fully converted to co2 and h2o by the catalysts if we look into the results it is evident that the optimal ph for the iron based catalysts is 3 and the optimal ph for all the copper based catalysts is 5 this confirms that the nature of the heterogeneous catalyst controls the favorable ph conditions it is worth mentioning that under optimized ph conditions the catalytic activity of zr7 5fe catalyst is slightly higher than zr7 5cu it is likely that under more acidic conditions the lost iron ions trigger a homogeneous fenton process and thus yielded a slightly better catalytic activity on the other hand the leached copper ions should form cu ii species which exhibit lower process efficiency for the oxidation of organics 28 47 and ultimately the solely responsible heterogeneous phase reaction afforded a slightly lower toc abatement the best metal loading for both iron and copper catalysts is 7 5 because under the favorable conditions of ph the catalysts afforded the highest ibp mineralization 76 and 70 respectively on the contrary catalysts with 5 iron and copper loadings mineralized only 65 and 62 of ibp similarly when the zirconia supports are loaded with 10 of iron and copper the toc abatements declined these results suggest that 5 metal loading is likely not enough to cover the entire surface area of the support material and thus a defective and incomplete redox cycle would reduce the catalytic activity of fenton like process on the contrary 10 metal loading seems excessive because ibp mineralization either remained the same or decreased this suggests that once the supporting material is entirely covered by the metal the increased metal loading starts forming additional metal layers over the catalyst surface and competing redox cycles may result in reducing of the process efficacy 48 this is in line with the gradual intensification of the signals due to fe2o3 and cuo in the xrd profiles on increasing metal loading from 5 to 10 wt suggesting the formation of larger crystallites clusters on the surface apart from fairly high activity the stability of the heterogeneous catalyst is also of importance because if the catalyst keeps losing the impregnated metal then it will not only suppress the recyclability of the catalyst but also make the fenton like process non environment friendly the leaching of iron and copper at variable ph conditions during the fenton like process has been determined using eq 2 and the results are presented in fig 5 the results indicate that the iron based catalysts are very stable under all ph conditions besides it has been observed that the iron based catalyst with 7 5 loading has undergone through minimum iron loss i e 1 7 0 3 mg which is well below the regulations of european union directives and the guidelines of environmental protection agency epa on the maximum limits of metals allowed to be released in treated water 49 50 on the other hand copper based catalysts are very unstable under acidic conditions at ph 3 between 57 and 86 copper is lost after fenton like process however when the ph is raised to 5 and above the copper leaching is significantly reduced lower than 10 moreover at ph 5 the catalyst with 7 5 loading has lost the minimum copper ca 6 2 0 9 mg which is again below the guidelines laid out by the environmental regulatory agencies 49 50 the contribution of the homogeneous oxidation due to leaching of iron and copper during the reaction was negligible with a maximum toc removal of 10 for iron salt at ph 3 and 5 for copper at ph 5 the metal leaching for iron and copper based catalyst has also been measured varying the reaction conditions catalyst dose oxidant dose and temperature the most critical parameter is acidic ph for copper based catalyst for all the other processing conditions the catalysts are almost stable with a leaching lower than 10 these results indicate that the heterogeneous fenton like process which employs copper based catalysts must be carried out at mild acidic to near neutral ph conditions to avoid heavy metal leaching 51 the higher catalyst stabilities of iron based materials compared with their peer copper catalysts suggests that iron have stronger bonding with the zirconia support and this higher stability enabled it to afford higher ibp mineralization as well higher leaching of metal ions has been recorded under severe acidic conditions ph 3 reflecting the solubility of fe2o3 and cuo indeed these oxides are not soluble in water but they are soluble in acid medium and the dissolution is ph dependent with higher values obtained at lower ph 52 53 the solubilisation of copper oxide is more favorable than that of iron oxide pksp of 20 36 and 87 95 respectively for cu and fe oxides 54 55 and this difference in solubility can explain the different leaching of metal oxides when the metal oxides are supported over zro2 the different strength of metal support interaction can also influence the dissolution of the metal ions our results suggest that for iron based catalyst stronger metal support interaction are involved preventing iron leaching in addition for both metals leaching is affected by the loading from the leaching results obtained by icp a dependence on the amount of metal deposited on the support is observed with the larger loss of metal for samples with 5 of fe cu independently from the ph this can be correlated to the different degree of metal metal and metal support interaction at varying metal loadings enabling a stronger metal support and metal metal interactions when larger crystallites are formed on the surface 3 3 effect of catalyst dose on catalytic activity and stability the active sites of the heterogeneous catalyst which in turn are dependent on the amount of catalyst are mainly responsible for the generation of oh from the oxidant 28 to better elucidate this point fenton like oxidation reactions were performed by varying either metal loading and catalyst dosing and the results are presented in fig 6a it is important to mention that the variation in the metal loading is the key factor to determine the total number of active sites through which the oxidant is converted into free oh while the catalyst dose serves merely as a multiplier to the total number of active sites offered by the catalyst with certain metal loading and is illustrated using eq 3 3 n w c s m l where n total number of active sites wc catalyst dose employed in the reaction s active sites per unit weight of the catalyst ml metal loading when the catalyst dose wc of 5 fe catalyst is increased from 200 to 400 mg l in fenton like process the ibp mineralization increases from 65 to 69 zr5fe has lower number of active sites s due to the insufficient metal coverage over the support and increasing the wc will increase the total number of active sites and ultimately raise the catalytic activities similarly when zr7 5fe catalyst is used and the wc is increased from 200 to 400 mg l the toc abatements increased from 76 to 80 these results are in compliance with eq 3 and indicate that 7 5 fe loaded catalyst has the maximum number of active sites per unit weight of the catalyst and increasing the catalyst dose elevates the total sum of active sites n participating in the fenton like reaction and thus higher toc abatements are obtained 4 56 it is also likely that 200 mg l of zr7 5fe catalyst incorporated optimum number of active sites in the reaction system and the additional active sites by increasing wc may have induced a scavenging effect 57 but counter balanced by the reciprocating homogeneous phase reaction maintaining a higher oxidation strength on the contrary when 200 and 300 mg l of 10 fe are engaged in the fenton like oxidation the ibp degradation declined to 65 and 66 respectively but substantially increased to 76 when wc is increased to 400 mg l these results suggest that the compound active sites exposed in zr10fe catalyst are reduced because the first layer of iron species in contact with support is blocked by the secondary layer and that is why lower catalytic activities have been observed at lower catalyst doses however when the wc is increased to 400 mg l the higher total number of active sites leads to higher toc abatement unlike iron when 200 mg l of 5 cu catalyst is employed for fenton like oxidation the observed ibp mineralization is 62 increasing the wc to 300 and 400 mg l the toc removal efficacies dropped to 52 and 51 similarly 200 mg l of zr7 5cu catalyst mineralized 70 of ibp but higher catalyst doses negatively impacted the process efficacy on the other hand 200 mg l of 10 cu catalyst afforded 66 of toc removal and further increase in the catalyst dose resulted in loss of activity these results suggest that the total number of active sites in copper catalysts are higher than the number required to maximize catalytic activity and additional active sites caused very strong scavenging effects reducing the overall catalyst performances 3 4 effect of oxidant dose on catalytic activity and stability h2o2 is the source of oh and the optimal concentration of the oxidant will not only reduce the requirement of chemicals but also enhance the efficacy of the fenton like process the effect of variable oxidant doses on the ibp mineralization with different catalysts is summarized in fig 6b for all the catalysts the addition of 20 ml l results in lower activity in general the best activity is obtained for 30 ml l of h2o2 while a further increase to 40 ml l does not affect the activity this behavior shows that 20 ml l of oxidant is insufficient to generate enough oh to afford high ibp mineralization it also indicates that the prime catalyst to oxidant ratio is obtained when 7 5 metal loaded catalysts are used along with 30 ml l of h2o2 because higher ibp mineralization is obtained under these conditions on the contrary the excess of oxidant in 40 ml l of h2o2 may have caused scavenging thus lowering the efficacy of the fenton like process 58 59 moreover when excess amount of oxidant is employed in the fenton like process radicals with low oxidation potential are generated and ultimately oxidation efficiency drops 30 it is worth mentioning that the iron based catalysts have better capacity to transform the oxidant into oh when compared with their counterpart copper based catalysts and this is in agreement with previous studies 60 61 3 5 effect of temperature on catalytic activity and stability temperature plays a key role in the activity of homogeneous and heterogeneous fenton process homogeneous systems are generally used at room temperature but increasing the temperature can improve the oxidation rate and the degree of mineralization by reducing the required amounts of h2o2 and fe2 62 similarly heterogeneous catalysts benefit from higher temperatures to achieve higher catalytic activities the rate of oh generation from the oxidant is greatly influenced by the reaction temperature and in turn affects the overall efficacy of the heterogeneous fenton process 63 64 when the process is carried out at room temperature very low degradation of ibp is observed over iron and copper catalysts with an abatement in the range 17 23 in order to observe the effect of temperature on the activities of different catalysts the fenton like process has been carried out at three different temperatures and results are outlined in fig 6c zr5fe and zr10fe afforded 50 and 58 ibp mineralization at 333 k and when the temperature is increased to 343 kc ibp abatements rose sharply to 69 and 77 respectively however further increase in the reaction temperature i e 353 k slightly reduced the ibp mineralization to 67 and 71 while working with 7 5fe as the temperature increases from 333 to 343 k the toc abatement did not increase substantially i e 76 to 80 but further increase in the temperature negatively impacted the catalytic performance and efficacy of the fenton like process dropped to 70 it is important to mention that the catalyst with optimal iron loading has yielded better activities even at lower reaction temperature contrary zr5cu and zr10cu have shown linear catalytic activities with rising temperature and ibp degradation increased from 44 to 64 and 64 to 69 respectively however when 7 5cu is utilized in fenton like process the ibp mineralization first increased until 343 k but further increase in temperature caused a slight decline in the activity these results indicate that the rate of oh generation from the oxidant at 333 k is relatively low and induces lower degradation of ibp as the temperature increases the rate of oh generation increases 65 but beyond 343 k the wasteful utilization of free radicals increases and thus overall process efficiency declines it is also likely that at 353 k the equilibrium of adsorption desorption is disturbed and poor adsorption of ibp molecules onto the catalyst surface has resulted the lower toc abatement moreover at 353 k higher amount of the oxidant is decomposed into water and oxygen and reduced quantity of free radicals negatively affects the process efficacy 66 67 3 6 effect of recycling on catalytic activity and stability the reusability of the catalyst and its performance under cycling conditions is of great importance due to reduction of the cost of the chemicals and elimination of the post treatment costs such as separation of dissolved catalyst from the aqueous phase 68 to monitor the activity of the catalysts under cycling conditions all the catalysts were recycled three times and the results are presented in fig 6d if we look into the activity profile of zr5fe the ibp mineralization sharply decreased from 69 to 49 after the 1st recycle and continuously decreased to 32 in the 3rd recycle similarly zr7 5fe afforded 80 toc abatement when freshly employed and after 3rd recycle only mineralize 38 of ibp likewise zr10fe lost more than 50 of its activity after 3rd recycle however when we look into the metallic loses of all the iron based catalysts separately these loses are not more than 15 in all the three recycles these results suggest that the loss of activity of iron based catalysts could be mainly related to poisoning due to strong adsorption of other species specifically the degradation products of the pollutant competing for catalytic sites 18 27 69 on the other hand catalytic activity of cu based catalysts remains almost stable over four recycles these results evidenced that the developed copper based catalysts yield very stable performances in the heterogeneous fenton process it also suggests that copper based catalysts do not form complexes either with the parent organic molecule or its metabolites and the afforded toc abatements are entirely achieved through fenton like oxidation zr7 5cu and zr7 5fe catalysts resulted to be among the most active in the literature as reported in table 3 with a mineralization of 80 and 69 respectively higher mineralization than those obtained in this study has been achieved by ivanets et al 70 with magnesium ferrite nanoparticles 98 and by chen et al 71 with zero valent iron carbon composites 88 the activity of the magnesium ferrite nanoparticles is strongly dependent on the amount of catalyst used in the reaction with a significant decrease in toc removal from 98 to 48 when the catalyst dose is reduced from 500 to 200 mg l respectively while our materials are less affected by the concentration of the catalyst in fact by varying the catalyst dose from 200 to 400 mg l zr7 5fe shows a toc removal in the range 76 80 range and zr7 5cu in the range 60 69 homogeneous fenton is ineffective for mineralization of ibuprofen 15 while higher toc removal is achieved for processes combined with uv 82 84 85 ultrasound us 79 or electro fenton technology 83 similarly appreciable degrees of ibp mineralization are achieved by the synergistic effect of a heterogeneous catalyst with ultraviolet radiation uv 74 75 ln doped feocl reached 82 of ibp mineralization in a photo fenton reaction 75 while tio2 successfully reduced toc to 88 in the photocatalytic reaction and a slight synergistic enhancement was found in the sonophotocatalytic process 92 74 summarizing iron and copper based catalyst are very active materials for the abatement of ibuprofen by fenton like process both materials show very high activity but the higher abatement is obtained for different reaction conditions iron based materials evidenced better activity al low ph while copper based samples are more active at ph 5 moreover for zrfe a higher amount of catalyst 400 mg is required to optimize the ibp abatement while zrcu achieved better performance with 200 mg iron based catalysts require more severe conditions in order to achieve the best activity this may be due to a higher reducibility of the cuo species supported on zirconia compared to fe2o3 as evidenced in the tpr profiles thus allowing the redox cycle of copper to be activated under less critical conditions than that of iron but once activated the redox cycle of iron however is able to better degrade ibuprofen and this may be related to the presence of three subsequent reduction steps as discussed in section 3 1 another distinctive element between iron based and copper based catalysts is the stability after recycling while zrfe progressively loses its ability to degrade ibp copper based systems are very stable this may be related to the greater interaction of the organic degradation compounds formed during the reaction with fe3 with consequent poisoning of the catalyst 4 conclusion this study has shown that the developed catalysts with 7 5 wt iron and copper loadings over zirconia support possess very high and promising activities for ibp mineralization in heterogeneous fenton like process although both type of catalysts has the same supporting material iron loaded catalysts afford better activities at ph 3 while optimal ph for copper based catalysts is 5 the catalysts with optimal metal loadings of 7 5 wt are very stable under all processing conditions and metal loses are below the guidelines set by the environmental regulatory agency although copper based catalysts show lower activities their stability upon recycling is higher compared to iron based catalyst making them more promising for fenton like treatments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the authors thank acquedotto poiana spa for the use of the instrumentation for the toc

13266,in this study a series of iron and copper based catalysts with varying metal loadings are prepared by wet impregnation over zirconia support and tested as catalyst for the treatment of ibuprofen with a fenton like process the textural and morphological properties of catalysts are investigated by standard techniques both iron and copper based catalysts when loaded with 7 5 wt of metal affords maximum mineralization activities of 80 and 70 respectively under optimal conditions in addition they only lose 1 7 0 3 mg of iron and 6 2 0 9 mg of copper during oxidation process catalysts exhibit better activities at ph 3 and 5 respectively for fe and cu iron based catalysts lose their activities when recycled and the activity of 7 5 fe zro2 catalyst decreased Êfrom 80 to 38 after 3 cycles on the contrary cu based catalysts maintain their high activity when recycled overall copper based catalysts are very promising materials with enhanced catalytic activity and high stability for the degradation of ibuprofen in heterogeneous fenton like process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords fenton like oxidation heterogeneous catalysis zro2 ibuprofen wastewater treatment 1 introduction the environmental stress on water bodies is growing due to the addition of a large number of persistent pollutants coming from multidimensional sources 1 conventional biological processes are unable to treat such organic compounds 2 3 and there is an increasing demand for the development of sustainable processes which are able to completely eliminate the pollutants into fundamental chemical entities such as water and carbon dioxide 4 5 advanced oxidation processes aops have shown great potential and have successfully been employed for the treatment of a wide range of wastewater streams containing refractory organics these processes generate very strong oxidizing species such as hydroxyl radicals oh which attack and degrade the pollutants 6 the oh have very high oxidation potential and can degrade a wide range of organics 7 8 several types of aops are applied for the degradation of organic compounds such as ozonation photocatalysis sonolysis electrochemical oxidation catalytic wet air oxidation cwao fenton process and a combination of these techniques 9 among aops fenton process is the most widely employed method for the treatment of wastewaters due to its simplicity low cost and very high oxidation rates 6 10 11 however it has two serious limitations such as the requirement of fairly strict acidic conditions ph 3 3 5 and the production of large volumes of residual sludge during the process which creates additional processing and environmental challenges 12 13 the limitations of the homogeneous fenton process can be easily prevented using heterogeneous catalysts where iron and other transition metals are supported bonded over different metal oxide support materials 14 19 in this way it is possible to reduce the metal loading in fenton like process and the catalyst can be easily recovered and reused in subsequent cycles thus making the process more sustainable 20 24 furthermore heterogeneous catalysts can also afford better catalytic activities over a wide range of ph 14 although a number of heavy metals have been successfully employed iron based materials are used predominantly as heterogeneous fenton like catalysts due to low cost and abundant availability 25 however most of the iron based materials have great tendency to form stable complexes with the organic compounds and lose their activities 26 making regeneration of such deactivated materials a challenging and cost intensive task 26 27 furthermore iron based catalysts are active only under acidic conditions and it is extremely difficult to prevent leaching of iron into the aqueous phase resulting in loss of catalyst activity and release of heavy metals in violation of regulatory guidelines 18 studies employing new types of iron based catalysts have mainly reported the degradation of a model pollutant and not their mineralization which is a more reliable parameter for evaluating the oxidation capacity of a new material with regards to the organic abatement 14 in recent years several alternatives to iron have been investigated as potential fenton like catalysts 28 among them copper based materials have attracted attention as promising material for the development of heterogeneous fenton like catalysts for the organic abatement from liquid streams due to their relatively lower cost compared to other heavy metals low toxicity and high catalytic activities 16 28 30 unlike iron copper do not form stable complexes with the degraded organic products and thus extended recycling of these materials in heterogeneous fenton process is possible making the process more attractive and feasible in terms of economics 29 to enhance the environmental sustainability of the heterogeneous fenton processes it is essential that the catalytic materials are able to completely abate the organics from the liquid streams rather than carrying out mere degradation because the fate of these metabolites still represents an environmental concern moreover the fenton like catalysts should not follow a reaction pathway which leads to the formation of more toxic metabolites than the parent organic substances 31 32 the development of highly active and stable heterogeneous catalysts is a complex challenge because it involves several key steps such as finding the right metal impregnation of the optimal amount of metal over the appropriate support catalyst characterization followed by activity analysis and finally the investigation of the catalyst stability 33 35 numerous articles have been published in the literature on the fenton like reaction carried out in the presence of heterogeneous iron and copper based catalysts for the abatement of different organics 14 18 28 36 only a few studies have investigated the use of zro2 in fenton like reaction 37 39 iron oxide supported over hollow magnetic porous zirconia fibers exhibits good catalytic activity in the photo fenton oxidation of organic pollutants methylene blue and phenol 39 while zirconia coated magnetite nanoparticles has been efficiently used for the removal of 3 4 dichlorobenzotrifluoride with a mineralization of about 53 37 when iron oxide was supported over sulfonated zro2 a toc abatement of 57 has been obtain for treatment of clofibric acid by fenton like process 38 all these reaction has been carried out in acidic conditions to enhanced the iron oxides oxidation capacities zirconia has proved to be an interesting support to be investigated due to its chemical stability and its promising activity when modified by transition metals in a preliminary study we have combined the use of strontium doped copper and iron and zro2 support for the degradation and mineralization of ibuprofen 40 results indicated that cu supported zro2 is a promising catalyst for removal of ibuprofen achieving a complete degradation and a 50 of mineralization ibuprofen has been chosen as a model pollutant due to its serious environmental effect and its wide use with many studies related to its abatement 2 19 31 in the present work we focus on the best fe zro2 and cu zro2 formulations by evaluating the dependence of activity on the various process parameters in order to find conditions for maximum stability coupled with milder reaction conditions that can provide more sustainable solutions for more performant water treatment processes 2 experimental 2 1 catalyst preparation we have prepared a series of zro2 supported catalysts containing between 5 and 10 wt of cu or fe the support was obtained from calcination at 773 k for 3 h of zirconium hydroxide mel chemicals supported catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation starting from the required amounts of copper and iron precursors copper ii nitrate hemi pentahydrate acs reagent 98

after reaction samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm using an eppendorf centrifuge 5804 r and filtered through a 0 45 Î¼m membrane filters total organic carbon toc has been used as parameter to follow the mineralization of ibuprofen conversion to co2 and h2o during reaction and has been measured by a toc vcpn shimadzu analyzer v series with auto sampler as reported in a previous work 24 toc monitoring is fundamental because it allows to assess the amount of organics that has been completely removed from liquid waste during treatment the toc removal efficiencies were determined using eq 1 1 toc removal efficiency toc i toc f toc i 100 moreover toc and ibp mineralization have been used interchangeably in this study several experiments were also carried out to verify the reproducibility of our activity measurements and the errors resulted to be within 3 the oxidation process was optimized by evaluating the effects of different parameters as reported in table 1 the leaching of iron

initially introduced metal weight mg l mf finally left metal weight at the end of fenton like process mg l homogeneous fenton reaction has been carried out to evaluate the contribution of the homogeneous fenton oxidation to the ibp degradation due to leaching of iron and copper from the heterogeneous catalyst during the reaction tests for the homogenous reaction has been carried out in the same condition of heterogeneous fenton process 100 ml of ibuprofen sodium salt solution containing 10 mg l of c13h17o2na has been treated at 343 k for 150 min with 1 g l of hydrogen peroxide and with 2 2 mg of iron iii nitrate nonahydrate at ph 3 or 3 3 mg of copper ii nitrate hemi pentahydrate at ph 5 amount of iron and copper precursors used has been determined from the maximum leaching obtained for fe or cu under reaction conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization table 2 summarizes compositions and bet surface area of the investigated catalysts the addition of cu or fe only slight affects the surface area of pure zro2 which drop from 64 m2 g to 54 60 m2 g in accordance with the bet results crystal size values are in the range 12 14 nm the addition of different metals and different amounts of each metal does not induce substantial changes in the surface area and crystallite size structural characterization has been carried out by means of xrd fig 1 for all the samples reflections due to monoclinic pdf number 98 006 0900 and tetragonal zirconia pdf number 98 065 5671 are observed with main reflection at 28 2 and 30 2 respectively xrd profiles of zr5cu and zr5fe do not reveal the presence of any copper or iron phase suggesting a homogeneous dispersion of cu fe over zirconia that escape detection by x ray diffraction for iron based materials fe2o3 hexagonal space group r 3 c pdf number 98 002 2505 main reflection at 33 2 has been identified at the higher fe loading 7 5 and 10 wt a detailed analysis of the xrd profile for copper based materials 7 5 and 10 wt evidenced some changes with respect to the support profile highlighting the presence of cuo monoclinic space group c 1 2 c 1 pdf number 98 004 3180 main reflection at 38 7 the presence of cuo can be evidenced by the increase in intensity of the peaks at 35 6 and 38 7 in fact these reflections are also visible in the bare support and in zr5cu attributable to the monoclinic zro2 but with a higher amount of copper these peaks change their relative intensity compared to peaks only due to monoclinic zro2 such as peaks at 34 2 and 40 8 as the amount of metal added to the support increases the xrd profiles show more defined peaks for the phases of fe2o3 and cuo indicating the formation of larger crystallites clusters the homogeneity of the materials has also been confirmed by sem analysis fig 2 performed over representative zr7 5fe and zr7 5cu samples elemental composition measured through edxs in several points reveals for zr7 5fe and zr7 5cu an amount of iron and copper respectively between 6 9 8 0 and 6 4 8 2 in good agreement with the nominal loadings for a better understanding of the properties of the two series of the catalyst temperature programmed reduction experiments with h2 h2 tpr have been carried out over zr5fe and zr5cu profiles with multiple reduction signals are observed for both catalysts fig 3 in the case of zr5fe the peaks are very broad and cover a very wide temperature range 473 873 k while in zr5cu two well defined peaks are observed at much lower temperatures 373 573 k in both samples reduction signals are correlated to the presence of the corresponding metal oxide fe2o3 and cuo in accordance with literature 41 43 the reduction of fe2o3 occurs in three steps first the reduction to fe3o4 then the transformation to feo and finally the reduction to metallic fe 42 43 the reduction profiles of zr7 5cu shows two peaks and a small shoulder the first two signals are related to highly dispersed surface cuo species while the shoulder at higher temperature is due to bulk cuo 41 overall the characterization of the materials indicates the formation of fe2o3 and cuo respectively for the iron and copper based catalysts the modification of the metal loading does not change the textural characteristics of the support maintaining a high surface area and not highlighting significant differences in the crystal size the homogeneous dispersion of iron and copper oxides on zro2 is confirmed by xrd profile of the materials sem images and tpr experiments 3 2 effect of ph on catalytic activity and stability the ph of the aqueous phase is the most critical parameter in heterogeneous fenton like process because the catalyst can exhibit maximum activity only in a specific ph range 14 in order to observe the effect of ph on the catalytic performance of iron and copper based catalysts with variable loadings fenton like oxidation was performed at three ph conditions and the results are presented in fig 4 the aqueous solution of ibp has a ph of 5 in addition we tested the catalytic activity under acidic ph 3 and basic ph 8 conditions 44 46 after 30 min of reaction all the formulations achieve almost complete degradation of ibuprofen 97 100 not shown for sake of clarity but the mineralization of the degradation products is strictly related to the reaction conditions this indicates that the developed catalyst can degrade quickly the parent molecule ibp into secondary compounds that are then mineralized to co2 and h2o maximum mineralization ranges from 5 to 80 depending on the metal and conditions and it was reached in the first 30 min with only small variations recorded for longer times this behavior is due to the high intrinsic activity of the catalysts which allow to mineralize ibuprofen in the very first minutes of the reaction for times longer than 30 min the mineralization of ibp undergoes few variations because the reaction induces degradation into secondary compounds that cannot be fully converted to co2 and h2o by the catalysts if we look into the results it is evident that the optimal ph for the iron based catalysts is 3 and the optimal ph for all the copper based catalysts is 5 this confirms that the nature of the heterogeneous catalyst controls the favorable ph conditions it is worth mentioning that under optimized ph conditions the catalytic activity of zr7 5fe catalyst is slightly higher than zr7 5cu it is likely that under more acidic conditions the lost iron ions trigger a homogeneous fenton process and thus yielded a slightly better catalytic activity on the other hand the leached copper ions should form cu ii species which exhibit lower process efficiency for the oxidation of organics 28 47 and ultimately the solely responsible heterogeneous phase reaction afforded a slightly lower toc abatement the best metal loading for both iron and copper catalysts is 7 5 because under the favorable conditions of ph the catalysts afforded the highest ibp mineralization 76 and 70 respectively on the contrary catalysts with 5 iron and copper loadings mineralized only 65 and 62 of ibp similarly when the zirconia supports are loaded with 10 of iron and copper the toc abatements declined these results suggest that 5 metal loading is likely not enough to cover the entire surface area of the support material and thus a defective and incomplete redox cycle would reduce the catalytic activity of fenton like process on the contrary 10 metal loading seems excessive because ibp mineralization either remained the same or decreased this suggests that once the supporting material is entirely covered by the metal the increased metal loading starts forming additional metal layers over the catalyst surface and competing redox cycles may result in reducing of the process efficacy 48 this is in line with the gradual intensification of the signals due to fe2o3 and cuo in the xrd profiles on increasing metal loading from 5 to 10 wt suggesting the formation of larger crystallites clusters on the surface apart from fairly high activity the stability of the heterogeneous catalyst is also of importance because if the catalyst keeps losing the impregnated metal then it will not only suppress the recyclability of the catalyst but also make the fenton like process non environment friendly the leaching of iron and copper at variable ph conditions during the fenton like process has been determined using eq 2 and the results are presented in fig 5 the results indicate that the iron based catalysts are very stable under all ph conditions besides it has been observed that the iron based catalyst with 7 5 loading has undergone through minimum iron loss i e 1 7 0 3 mg which is well below the regulations of european union directives and the guidelines of environmental protection agency epa on the maximum limits of metals allowed to be released in treated water 49 50 on the other hand copper based catalysts are very unstable under acidic conditions at ph 3 between 57 and 86 copper is lost after fenton like process however when the ph is raised to 5 and above the copper leaching is significantly reduced lower than 10 moreover at ph 5 the catalyst with 7 5 loading has lost the minimum copper ca 6 2 0 9 mg which is again below the guidelines laid out by the environmental regulatory agencies 49 50 the contribution of the homogeneous oxidation due to leaching of iron and copper during the reaction was negligible with a maximum toc removal of 10 for iron salt at ph 3 and 5 for copper at ph 5 the metal leaching for iron and copper based catalyst has also been measured varying the reaction conditions catalyst dose oxidant dose and temperature the most critical parameter is acidic ph for copper based catalyst for all the other processing conditions the catalysts are almost stable with a leaching lower than 10 these results indicate that the heterogeneous fenton like process which employs copper based catalysts must be carried out at mild acidic to near neutral ph conditions to avoid heavy metal leaching 51 the higher catalyst stabilities of iron based materials compared with their peer copper catalysts suggests that iron have stronger bonding with the zirconia support and this higher stability enabled it to afford higher ibp mineralization as well higher leaching of metal ions has been recorded under severe acidic conditions ph 3 reflecting the solubility of fe2o3 and cuo indeed these oxides are not soluble in water but they are soluble in acid medium and the dissolution is ph dependent with higher values obtained at lower ph 52 53 the solubilisation of copper oxide is more favorable than that of iron oxide pksp of 20 36 and 87 95 respectively for cu and fe oxides 54 55 and this difference in solubility can explain the different leaching of metal oxides when the metal oxides are supported over zro2 the different strength of metal support interaction can also influence the dissolution of the metal ions our results suggest that for iron based catalyst stronger metal support interaction are involved preventing iron leaching in addition for both metals leaching is affected by the loading from the leaching results obtained by icp a dependence on the amount of metal deposited on the support is observed with the larger loss of metal for samples with 5 of fe cu independently from the ph this can be correlated to the different degree of metal metal and metal support interaction at varying metal loadings enabling a stronger metal support and metal metal interactions when larger crystallites are formed on the surface 3 3 effect of catalyst dose on catalytic activity and stability the active sites of the heterogeneous catalyst which in turn are dependent on the amount of catalyst are mainly responsible for the generation of oh from the oxidant 28 to better elucidate this point fenton like oxidation reactions were performed by varying either metal loading and catalyst dosing and the results are presented in fig 6a it is important to mention that the variation in the metal loading is the key factor to determine the total number of active sites through which the oxidant is converted into free oh while the catalyst dose serves merely as a multiplier to the total number of active sites offered by the catalyst with certain metal loading and is illustrated using eq 3 3 n w c s m l where n total number of active sites wc catalyst dose employed in the reaction s active sites per unit weight of the catalyst ml metal loading when the catalyst dose wc of 5 fe catalyst is increased from 200 to 400 mg l in fenton like process the ibp mineralization increases from 65 to 69 zr5fe has lower number of active sites s due to the insufficient metal coverage over the support and increasing the wc will increase the total number of active sites and ultimately raise the catalytic activities similarly when zr7 5fe catalyst is used and the wc is increased from 200 to 400 mg l the toc abatements increased from 76 to 80 these results are in compliance with eq 3 and indicate that 7 5 fe loaded catalyst has the maximum number of active sites per unit weight of the catalyst and increasing the catalyst dose elevates the total sum of active sites n participating in the fenton like reaction and thus higher toc abatements are obtained 4 56 it is also likely that 200 mg l of zr7 5fe catalyst incorporated optimum number of active sites in the reaction system and the additional active sites by increasing wc may have induced a scavenging effect 57 but counter balanced by the reciprocating homogeneous phase reaction maintaining a higher oxidation strength on the contrary when 200 and 300 mg l of 10 fe are engaged in the fenton like oxidation the ibp degradation declined to 65 and 66 respectively but substantially increased to 76 when wc is increased to 400 mg l these results suggest that the compound active sites exposed in zr10fe catalyst are reduced because the first layer of iron species in contact with support is blocked by the secondary layer and that is why lower catalytic activities have been observed at lower catalyst doses however when the wc is increased to 400 mg l the higher total number of active sites leads to higher toc abatement unlike iron when 200 mg l of 5 cu catalyst is employed for fenton like oxidation the observed ibp mineralization is 62 increasing the wc to 300 and 400 mg l the toc removal efficacies dropped to 52 and 51 similarly 200 mg l of zr7 5cu catalyst mineralized 70 of ibp but higher catalyst doses negatively impacted the process efficacy on the other hand 200 mg l of 10 cu catalyst afforded 66 of toc removal and further increase in the catalyst dose resulted in loss of activity these results suggest that the total number of active sites in copper catalysts are higher than the number required to maximize catalytic activity and additional active sites caused very strong scavenging effects reducing the overall catalyst performances 3 4 effect of oxidant dose on catalytic activity and stability h2o2 is the source of oh and the optimal concentration of the oxidant will not only reduce the requirement of chemicals but also enhance the efficacy of the fenton like process the effect of variable oxidant doses on the ibp mineralization with different catalysts is summarized in fig 6b for all the catalysts the addition of 20 ml l results in lower activity in general the best activity is obtained for 30 ml l of h2o2 while a further increase to 40 ml l does not affect the activity this behavior shows that 20 ml l of oxidant is insufficient to generate enough oh to afford high ibp mineralization it also indicates that the prime catalyst to oxidant ratio is obtained when 7 5 metal loaded catalysts are used along with 30 ml l of h2o2 because higher ibp mineralization is obtained under these conditions on the contrary the excess of oxidant in 40 ml l of h2o2 may have caused scavenging thus lowering the efficacy of the fenton like process 58 59 moreover when excess amount of oxidant is employed in the fenton like process radicals with low oxidation potential are generated and ultimately oxidation efficiency drops 30 it is worth mentioning that the iron based catalysts have better capacity to transform the oxidant into oh when compared with their counterpart copper based catalysts and this is in agreement with previous studies 60 61 3 5 effect of temperature on catalytic activity and stability temperature plays a key role in the activity of homogeneous and heterogeneous fenton process homogeneous systems are generally used at room temperature but increasing the temperature can improve the oxidation rate and the degree of mineralization by reducing the required amounts of h2o2 and fe2 62 similarly heterogeneous catalysts benefit from higher temperatures to achieve higher catalytic activities the rate of oh generation from the oxidant is greatly influenced by the reaction temperature and in turn affects the overall efficacy of the heterogeneous fenton process 63 64 when the process is carried out at room temperature very low degradation of ibp is observed over iron and copper catalysts with an abatement in the range 17 23 in order to observe the effect of temperature on the activities of different catalysts the fenton like process has been carried out at three different temperatures and results are outlined in fig 6c zr5fe and zr10fe afforded 50 and 58 ibp mineralization at 333 k and when the temperature is increased to 343 kc ibp abatements rose sharply to 69 and 77 respectively however further increase in the reaction temperature i e 353 k slightly reduced the ibp mineralization to 67 and 71 while working with 7 5fe as the temperature increases from 333 to 343 k the toc abatement did not increase substantially i e 76 to 80 but further increase in the temperature negatively impacted the catalytic performance and efficacy of the fenton like process dropped to 70 it is important to mention that the catalyst with optimal iron loading has yielded better activities even at lower reaction temperature contrary zr5cu and zr10cu have shown linear catalytic activities with rising temperature and ibp degradation increased from 44 to 64 and 64 to 69 respectively however when 7 5cu is utilized in fenton like process the ibp mineralization first increased until 343 k but further increase in temperature caused a slight decline in the activity these results indicate that the rate of oh generation from the oxidant at 333 k is relatively low and induces lower degradation of ibp as the temperature increases the rate of oh generation increases 65 but beyond 343 k the wasteful utilization of free radicals increases and thus overall process efficiency declines it is also likely that at 353 k the equilibrium of adsorption desorption is disturbed and poor adsorption of ibp molecules onto the catalyst surface has resulted the lower toc abatement moreover at 353 k higher amount of the oxidant is decomposed into water and oxygen and reduced quantity of free radicals negatively affects the process efficacy 66 67 3 6 effect of recycling on catalytic activity and stability the reusability of the catalyst and its performance under cycling conditions is of great importance due to reduction of the cost of the chemicals and elimination of the post treatment costs such as separation of dissolved catalyst from the aqueous phase 68 to monitor the activity of the catalysts under cycling conditions all the catalysts were recycled three times and the results are presented in fig 6d if we look into the activity profile of zr5fe the ibp mineralization sharply decreased from 69 to 49 after the 1st recycle and continuously decreased to 32 in the 3rd recycle similarly zr7 5fe afforded 80 toc abatement when freshly employed and after 3rd recycle only mineralize 38 of ibp likewise zr10fe lost more than 50 of its activity after 3rd recycle however when we look into the metallic loses of all the iron based catalysts separately these loses are not more than 15 in all the three recycles these results suggest that the loss of activity of iron based catalysts could be mainly related to poisoning due to strong adsorption of other species specifically the degradation products of the pollutant competing for catalytic sites 18 27 69 on the other hand catalytic activity of cu based catalysts remains almost stable over four recycles these results evidenced that the developed copper based catalysts yield very stable performances in the heterogeneous fenton process it also suggests that copper based catalysts do not form complexes either with the parent organic molecule or its metabolites and the afforded toc abatements are entirely achieved through fenton like oxidation zr7 5cu and zr7 5fe catalysts resulted to be among the most active in the literature as reported in table 3 with a mineralization of 80 and 69 respectively higher mineralization than those obtained in this study has been achieved by ivanets et al 70 with magnesium ferrite nanoparticles 98 and by chen et al 71 with zero valent iron carbon composites 88 the activity of the magnesium ferrite nanoparticles is strongly dependent on the amount of catalyst used in the reaction with a significant decrease in toc removal from 98 to 48 when the catalyst dose is reduced from 500 to 200 mg l respectively while our materials are less affected by the concentration of the catalyst in fact by varying the catalyst dose from 200 to 400 mg l zr7 5fe shows a toc removal in the range 76 80 range and zr7 5cu in the range 60 69 homogeneous fenton is ineffective for mineralization of ibuprofen 15 while higher toc removal is achieved for processes combined with uv 82 84 85 ultrasound us 79 or electro fenton technology 83 similarly appreciable degrees of ibp mineralization are achieved by the synergistic effect of a heterogeneous catalyst with ultraviolet radiation uv 74 75 ln doped feocl reached 82 of ibp mineralization in a photo fenton reaction 75 while tio2 successfully reduced toc to 88 in the photocatalytic reaction and a slight synergistic enhancement was found in the sonophotocatalytic process 92 74 summarizing iron and copper based catalyst are very active materials for the abatement of ibuprofen by fenton like process both materials show very high activity but the higher abatement is obtained for different reaction conditions iron based materials evidenced better activity al low ph while copper based samples are more active at ph 5 moreover for zrfe a higher amount of catalyst 400 mg is required to optimize the ibp abatement while zrcu achieved better performance with 200 mg iron based catalysts require more severe conditions in order to achieve the best activity this may be due to a higher reducibility of the cuo species supported on zirconia compared to fe2o3 as evidenced in the tpr profiles thus allowing the redox cycle of copper to be activated under less critical conditions than that of iron but once activated the redox cycle of iron however is able to better degrade ibuprofen and this may be related to the presence of three subsequent reduction steps as discussed in section 3 1 another distinctive element between iron based and copper based catalysts is the stability after recycling while zrfe progressively loses its ability to degrade ibp copper based systems are very stable this may be related to the greater interaction of the organic degradation compounds formed during the reaction with fe3 with consequent poisoning of the catalyst 4 conclusion this study has shown that the developed catalysts with 7 5 wt iron and copper loadings over zirconia support possess very high and promising activities for ibp mineralization in heterogeneous fenton like process although both type of catalysts has the same supporting material iron loaded catalysts afford better activities at ph 3 while optimal ph for copper based catalysts is 5 the catalysts with optimal metal loadings of 7 5 wt are very stable under all processing conditions and metal loses are below the guidelines set by the environmental regulatory agency although copper based catalysts show lower activities their stability upon recycling is higher compared to iron based catalyst making them more promising for fenton like treatments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

opium pharmaceutical industry wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords electrocoagulation flotation advance oxidation process peroxone adsorption filter opium pharmaceutical industry semi industrial pilot scale 1 introduction with the increase of world population industrialization and urbanization the demand for a quality life is also increasing various industries are established to meet human needs which along with their benefits there are various types of problems including wastewater generation 1 3 the world will encounter various types of industrial wastewater which can produce many harmful effects such as cancer reproductive disorders and organ failure among them one of the most important wastewaters is pharmaceuticals industries wastewater 4 6 therefore pharmaceutical waste needs to be purified before being discharged to the environment 3 5 traditionally various technologies include solar photo fenton photolysis and photocatalysis advanced oxidation chemical and electrochemical coagulation activated sludges filtration adsorption chemical and electrocoagulation osmosis and membrane have been used to treat pharmaceutical wastewater 3 10 wastewater from the opium pharmaceutical industry may include natural semi synthetic and synthetic opioids such as morphine codeine thebaine hydrocodone oxycodone oxymorphone buprenorphine fentanyl and methadone tramadol some opium alkaloids are the most common in addition wastewater from these industries may include biodegradable organic substances non biodegradable organic and inorganic substances heavy metals and potential inhibitors which eventually enter the catchment area or groundwater in the form of landfill leachate 11 12 a literature review of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment of opium alkaloids shows that the studies on opium alkaloid effluents have been carried out mainly at istanbul technical university and tubtak research center almost all of these researches have been performed by biological and aeration methods or some chemical methods that none of these methods has been able to completely treat the opium wastewater 13 20 the problems of these methods in single step mode are the high operational cost and the inability of them to purification and remove all pollutants 21 23 due to the complex nature and or non biodegradable pharmaceutical industries a combined method was usually used for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment such as opium pharmaceutical industry wastewater electrocoagulation is a proven and cost effective technology to treat and remove most contaminants pollutants from water the use of this technology due to non use of chemicals short reaction time long lifetime of units easy maintain the ability to degrade resistant pollutants such as organic polyaromatic compounds less sludge production and lower costs are highly regarded by various industries compared with conventional biological and chemical processes 10 24 27 however some soluble organic compounds especially pharmaceuticals compounds such as opium alkaloids for complete removal may require additional treatment with advanced oxidation advanced oxidation cells are normally installed in wastewater and effluent treatment plant inline after electrocoagulation cells 27 30 the advanced oxidation reactors are effective as complementary electrocoagulation cells for complete wastewater treatment 27 35 advanced oxidation processes aops are used alone or in combination with other treatment processes such as physicochemical processes these cells may be fitted with different oxidant agents such as o3 h2o2 uv o3 uv h2o2 fenton etc or with the production of powerful oxidizing agents such as hydroxyl radicals during the electrolysis process among the aops peroxone the combination of ozone and hydrogen peroxide is as an advanced oxidation technique based on in situ production of hydroxyl radical oh by assisted reactions between o3 and h2o2 30 38 the literature study revealed that the combination of ozone with hydrogen peroxide has been successfully utilized for the efficient treatment of organic persistent pollutants 35 38 these advanced methods oxidize dissolved complex organic compounds sulfides and mercaptans etc which are not removed by electrocoagulation to carbon dioxide water nitrogen and simple salts 33 38 once these contaminants have been broken down or mineralized into simpler or smaller molecules by advanced purification processes they are easily and completely removed by conventional purification processes such as activated carbon filters 39 42 in this work for the first time we have developed a combined process including electrocoagulation peroxone and granular activated carbon gac absorption filter to treat opium

wastewater samples the raw wastewater samples used in the experiments were the raw wastewater generated from opium pharmaceutical factories the characteristics of raw opium alkaloid wastewater were variable throughout the study the ranges of these changes and the quality of raw wastewater of opium alkaloids before the purification process are presented in table 1 typical contaminants in this type of wastewater mainly include opium derivatives such as opium alkaloids methadone codeine phytin oxycodone thebaine morphine and buprenorphine etc the extraction of these alkaloids is carried out at different stages using organic solvents such as toluene methanol ethyl acetate hexane ethanol and acetic acid the chemical composition of wastewater is very complex and heavily polluted with very high cod and bod5 content and have an intense dark brown color 2 3 setups the proposed process for treating opium pharmaceutical wastewater consists of three stages electrocoagulation advanced oxidation peroxone and adsorption with granular activated carbon filters to achieve better and more realistic results we designed and implemented a semi industrial pilot plant that includes three wastewater treatment processes to complete the treatment of opium wastewater the initial evaluation of the electrocoagulation peroxone and gac adsorption treatment processes was determined by analyzing the cod tds tss and color pt co scale at different time intervals the optimal conditions of all the treatment processes electrocoagulation peroxone adsorption and combination of three stage are described in the next sections once the optimal conditions were found the raw water and treated wastewater samples were filtered and analyzed for cod color tds tss and ph as indicated in the standard methods procedures 43 the obtained data were used to determine the optimal ph current density and other operational conditions the details of each of these processes in a single stage and combined form will be discussed in the following sections 2 3 1 the ecf reactor a semi industrial pilot scale plant has been designed for opium wastewater treatment the first part of this pilot is the electrocoagulation flotation reactor which can reduce cod pollution by more than 60 70 of the initial value in designing the ecf reactor the parameters such as type of electrodes arrangements and the surface to volume ratio of electrodes and have been optimized the compact reactor of ecf has been designed and constructed at a lab and semi industrial pilot scale fig 1 part a and b respectively as shown in fig 1a the cell used in laboratory scale is a glass cube with a volume of 2 l containing eight iron plates with dimensions of 60 60 3 mm as anode and eight stainless steel plates 60 60 3 mm as a cathode the distance between the anodes and cathodes was 25 mm the main components of the semi pilot reactor are 1 electrolysis tank volume 200 l 2 anode eight iron plate dimension 400 250 3 mm effective surface area for each anode 2000 cm2 effective surface area about 1 6 m2 for eight anodes 3 cathode eight stainless steel plate dimension 400 250 3 mm 4 power supply the power supply used can be supported by stabilized currents and voltages ranging from 0 to 500 a and from 0 to 50 v respectively 5 pneumatic pump the pneumatic pump has been used for the uniform mixing of wastewater during the electrolysis the air is injected into the ecf reactor from the end of electrodes to improve the flotation process and flocs reach the surface of wastewater and floated 6 floc scrapers an automatic cleaner brush scraper or rake has been used to discharge floated flocs on the sewage surface when the volume of formed flocs reaches a certain amount it is discharged by the automatic brush to the sludge collecting tank a draining tube was installed at the bottom of the tank for cleaning the distance between the electrodes was adjusted to 50 mm the electrodes were connected to each other using a monopolar configuration and connected to terminals of the direct current power supply dc power supply the electrocoagulation flotation process was operated at ph values of 3 0 11 0 by with current densities of 10 0 12 5 15 0 20 0 and 25 0 ma cm2 the conductivity of the opium wastewater was between 17 6 and 21 6 ms and therefore there is no need to add supporting electrolytes for the ecf process 44 2 3 2 h2o2 o3 peroxone reactor the second part of the treatment system is the peroxone reactor which has been designed and constructed at both lab and semi industrial pilot scales fig 2 a b to optimize the effective parameters in the peroxone reactor on semi industrial scale first a cell on a laboratory scale is designed and fabricated and the operational parameters on ozonation and peroxone processes on it were investigated the cell used in the laboratory scale consists of a glass column with a diameter of 5 cm a height of 105 cm and an effective volume of 1000 ml was used for ozonation and peroxone processes in the ozonation process the ozone is injected into the column using an ozone generator model arda france with a production capacity of 3 g h 3000 mg l in a cell with a volume of 1 l and 1 h ozonation time and using a fine bubble air stone embedded in the bottom of the column the use of air stones causes better dispersion of ozone gas and increases the contact surface and contact time of ozone molecules and pollutants which leads to the higher efficiency of the peroxone and ozonation processes the main components of the semi pilot reactor are 1 peroxone tank volume 300 l pressurized tank with a height of 2 m 2 ozone generator this device can be produced 100 g h o3 3 h2o2 dosing pump rate and amount are controllable 4 diffuser and 5 hydrodynamic pump the ozone generator and peroxone reactor images are shown on a semi industrial scale in fig 2a b in the peroxone reactor a fine bubble diffuser is placed at the bottom of the reactor for the following purposes first the injected ozone gas is completely dissolved in the aqueous phase and the second the greater contact surface take place between molecules of ozone gas phase and pollutants liquid phase 44 48 ozone was generated using a corona discharge ozone generator fig 2c an oxygen generator is used to produce pure oxygen from the oxygen concentrator it will increase productivity much more than using dry air for the best performance simultaneously h2o2 36 w w and ozone was injected into the peroxone reactor with the injection rate of 3 l per hour and 100 g h for 45 min respectively to achieve maximum efficiency the electrocoagulated wastewater was introduced into the peroxone reactor and samples were taken from the reactor every 20 min after analyzing the effluent by cod and color the optimum time was selected for peroxone process at the end of the process the treated wastewater was held in a degassing tank for about 5 min to strip oxygen and residual ozone and then the effluent through a pump enters the post treatment step granular activated carbon filter based on the results the effluent color after this stage turns from bright green into a clear yellow color 2 3 3 granular activated carbon adsorption process gac adsorption process was used as a tried stage of the semi industrial pilot plant for opium wastewater treatment on a laboratory scale an adsorption column contains the granular activated carbon in the size range of 3 to 5 mm and adsorption capacity of 1050 mg g from part chemical corporation s walnut hard shell was used the adsorption column was made of glass with dimensions of 5 cm diameter 105 cm height and an effective working volume of 400 ml the column was filled with gac and silica so that at first about 10 cm of the column is filled with fine mesh silica this layer prevents the escape of fine carbon grains then about 80 cm of the filter was filled with granular activated carbon and on the layer of gac about 10 cm of silica with the coarse mesh was poured the gac adsorption column image is shown in fig 3 a the semi pilot reactor consists of an adsorption tank made of polycarbonate with dimensions of 60 cm diameter 185 cm height and volume of 523 l effective working volume of the reactor was 200 l the reactor is filled like what was described for the lab scale column at first about 40 cm of the tank is filled with fine mesh silica then about 1 m of the tank was filled with gac and on this layer of gac about 40 cm of silica with the coarse mesh is poured before filing the reactor gac must be soaked for 24 h and then dried by hot air after loading the tank with gac in order to degas the gac fill it with clean water and allow it to stand for 8 12 h the gac reactor image used in the semi pilot experiments is shown in fig 3b the wastewater after the electrocoagulation flotation and peroxone treatments flows downwards through the gac filters at an average flow rate of 0 4 m3 h then at specific times samples were taken for cod toc tds and color analysis finally gac reactor is periodically back washed with water at a flow rate of 0 8 m3 h for 5 min 2 4 analytical measurements the analytical measurements of operating parameters such as color cod toc and tds before and after the ecf treatment peroxone and gac adsorption filter processes were performed using the standard procedures of the american public health association apha 49 the percentage of color cod toc and tds removal efficiencies were calculated using the following equation 1 r c i c e c i 100 where ci and ce are the color cod toc and or tds concentrations in the inlet and the exit streams of the ec peroxone and gac adsorption filter processes respectively 49 the operating cost includes material mainly electrodes cost electrical energy cost labor maintenance and other costs in this work the operating cost is calculated based on electricity consumption costs chemical costs and electrodes costs 50 51 calculation of operating cost is expressed as 2 operating cost enc elc chc where chc is chemical consumption enc and elc are energy and electrode consumption respectively and are consumption quantities per m3 of wastewater treated the total electrical energy consumption of electrocoagulation peroxone and gac filter processes were calculated using the following equations 3 enc enc ec enc h 2 o 2 o3 enc gac the electrical energy consumption for the ec process was calculated using the following equation 4 en c ec uit v wh m 3 where enc ec is the energy consumption of ec process w h m3 u is cell voltage v i is current a t is ec time h and v is the volume of the treated wastewater m3 respectively the energy consumption for the peroxone process was calculated using the summation of electricity consumption of the ozone generator kw h m3 and the amount of hydrogen peroxide consumed according to faraday s law electrode material consumption and charge loading are calculated in the following equation 50 51 5 electrode consumption it m w fzv where f is faraday s constant 96 485c mol m w is the molecular weight of iron 56 g mol and z is the number of electron transfer z fe fe2 2 i is current a t is electrolysis time s the gac adsorption process s operating cost is related to activated carbon used to treat 1 m3 of opium wastewater besides 0 9 kg m3 lime was used for the ph adjustment process in this work three hydrodynamic pumps are used to transfer effluent to the tanks 2 5 the effect of adjusting the initial wastewater ph the initial ph has an essential effect on wastewater treatment 52 54 therefore it is necessary to use suitable chemicals for adjusting ph based on the types of pollutants or impurities the appropriate neutralizing or adjusting agent s selection depends on a series of factors including their cost transportation expense handling in the plant preparation for usage and investment in the facility storage safety and labor costs the most commonly used chemical for neutralization or alkalization of acidic wastewater is 50 sodium hydroxide however some advantages of lime such as producing fewer tds cost less than other adjusting agents and precipitate heavy metal contaminants have led to lime being used as a chemical to adjust the ph 43 44 52 55 the wastewater collection and maintenance pool s initial wastewater is transferred by a pump electrometer into a 1 m3 polyethylene tank then the ph of the wastewater was adjusted in the range 3 10 with lime or h2so4 and after the optimization of ph the opium wastewater was transmitted by a continuous flow pump into the ecf reactor fig 4 shows the semi industrial pilot scale designed for wastewater treatment of a pharmaceutical company 3 results and discussion 3 1 initial ph adjustment the opium wastewater is a complex matrix because of various solvents poly aromatic compounds opium alkaloids and acid base or buffers therefore the opium wastewater may have a wide range of initial ph 50 55 on the other hand the efficiency of electrocoagulation flotation and other treatment processes is significantly ph dependent 21 23 52 55 the initial ph of the raw wastewater that we were dealing with was about ph 4 5 6 0 the effect of initial ph was investigated on the initial wastewater solution in the range of 3 0 11 0 the effect of ph on the removal efficiency of cod color tds and tss is shown in fig 5 part i by increasing the ph from 3 0 to 8 0 the efficiency of cod color tds and tss removal of opium raw wastewater increased from 3 3 to 8 6 4 6 to 14 3 5 1 to 16 4 and 5 5 to 18 5 respectively and at the ph values higher than 8 0 these removal efficiencies decreased the effect of adding lime for increasing ph can be explained as follows that the alkaline phs favor the precipitation of most metal ions as insoluble solids 52 54 low ph levels can increase the solubility of heavy metals resulting in the release of metal cations into the water rather than being absorbed into the sediment 3 2 ecf treatment 3 2 1 effects of ph in this section the effect of ph on the removal efficiency during the electrocoagulation flotation process has been studied according to the literature in iron based electrocoagulation optimization of ph leads to higher efficiency and better performance 30 56 58 in this work the effect of ph on the ecf process was firstly studied in the laboratory scale reactor and then the optimum ph used for the semi pilot scale the effect of ph on the removal efficiency of cod color tds and tss is shown in fig 5 part ii by increasing the ph from 3 0 to 8 0 the efficiency of cod color tds and tss removal increased from 10 6 to 47 9 20 5 to 58 8 16 0 to 54 9 and 14 9 to 50 4 respectively on the other hand when the initial ph increased from 8 0 to 11 0 the cod removal decreased from 47 9 to 16 5 color removal decreased from 58 8 to 34 9 tds removal decreased from 54 9 to 28 6 and tss removal decreased from 50 4 to 24 7 fe oh 3 and fe oh 2 are the main species of fe3 hydrolysis reactions in acidic media ph 6 0 the fe ions produced on the surface of scarified electrodes are soluble and are not capable of absorbing the pollutants 56 59 in the alkaline media ph 9 0 the fe2 and fe3 ions precipitated and formed fe oh 2 and fe oh 3 based on the experimental results the ph 8 0 was selected as the optimum ph value for the ecf reactor in opium wastewater treatment 3 2 2 current density the effect of current density on the performance of ecf reactor has been studied the production rate of coagulant at the anode surface adjusts bubble production and the growth of flocs for adsorbing the pollutants can be controlled by changing current density 51 60 62 the experiments were carried out at ph 8 0 and operation time 0 30 min the removal efficiencies of these parameters versus operating time and current density are shown in fig 6 the increase of current density from 10 to 50 ma cm2 lead to a decrease in the operating time required and an increase in the removal efficiency of cod color tds and tss the increase of current density from 10 to 50 ma cm2 leads to an increase in the removal efficiencies of cod from 41 0 to 66 6 color from 38 1 to 72 8 tds from 41 7 to 69 6 and tss from 36 7 to 58 5 respectively fig 6 the increasing current density leads to an increase in coagulant production rate anodic dissolution of fe anode an increase in fe oh 3 s particles and thus an increase in the removal efficiency 58 64 moreover the bubble generation rate increased and the bubble size decreased with increasing the current densities these effects are beneficial for high pollutant removal by h2 g flotation 30 51 60 62 based on these results 25 ma cm2 was selected as the optimum current density in this study due to reduced operating costs the energy enc kwh m3 and electrode elc kg m3 consumptions calculated using eqs 2 5 are depicted in fig 7 i besides the amount of sludge generated during the ecf process increases from 0 87 to 5 1 kg m3 with increasing current density from 10 to 50 ma cm2 fig 7i changes in the operating costs as a function of the current density are illustrated in fig 7 part ii the variations in the operating costs were calculated based on m3 the operating costs at 10 50 ma cm2 were 1 90 9 55 m3 fig 7ii on the other hand the operating cost increased rapidly with increasing current density from 10 to 50 ma cm2 from the operating cost and removal efficiencies of cod color tds and tss points of view the fe anode is preferable since it lowered the operating cost significantly in the ecf process one should note that the current densities exceeding 50 0 ma cm2 were not investigated because the energy consumption and the sludge production would expand beyond a reasonable range while gaining a limited increase in the removal efficiency it should also be noted that at higher current densities heat generation unwanted reaction excess oxygen evaluation and cell voltage increase and as a result energy consumption will increase 60 62 3 3 peroxone treatment 3 3 1 effects of ph in this part the effect of ph on the performance of ozonation and peroxone combining ozone with hydrogen peroxide processes in opium wastewater treatment was investigated ozone molecules can be reacted with an organic compound via two different pathways first direct oxidation of pollutants and second indirect radical chain type reaction 44 48 65 66 the mechanism of ozonation depends on the ph and composition of the effluent in acidic media ozone molecules react directly with pollutants but at ph values higher than 7 0 ozone molecules decomposed and generated oh radicals since the oxidation potential of hydroxyl radicals is much higher than that of ozone molecules so indirect oxidation causes complete oxidation of organic compounds 44 48 65 67 the cod and color removal efficiencies at various initial phs in the ozonation process are shown in fig 8 part i as can be seen the cod removal of opium wastewaters increased from 8 7 at ph 3 to 20 at ph 8 and decreased to 6 6 at ph 12 also the color removal increased from 1 5 at ph 3 to 12 2 at ph 8 and decreased to 3 5 at ph 12 fig 8b part i the maximum cod and color removal in the ozonation process was observed at ph 8 0 according to the ozone decomposition model presented by shb model 68 in the acidic media ozone diffused into wastewater solution reacted with the pollutant in the ozonation experiments at ph 8 0 both oh radicals and ozone are the oxidizing agents hence a significant portion of cod was removed 37 47 48 69 the effect of different ph on the cod and color removal efficiencies in peroxone experiments is shown in figs 8 part ii these experiments are similar to the ozonation experiments except that 1000 mg l of h2o2 is added to the wastewater solution at the beginning of each experiment the effect of ph on the removal efficiency of peroxone process has a similar pattern to that of the ozonation process but the removal efficiency in this process has increased compared to the ozonation process as shown in fig 8a part ii the cod removal of opium wastewaters increased from 24 2 at ph 3 0 to 78 9 at ph 8 0 and decreased to 45 2 at ph 12 also the color removal of opium wastewaters increased from 11 2 at ph 3 0 to 38 3 at ph 8 0 and decreased to 13 5 at ph 12 fig 8b part ii comparison of peroxone experiments with ozone experiments showing significant progress in cod and color removal efficiencies when peroxone process was used this may be due to the increased production of reactive hydroxyl radicals at acidic and alkaline phs on the contrary there was a significantly lower removal efficiency possibly h2o2 or ho2 competes with opium alkaloids for ozone or scavenges radical species 34 38 61 70 finally according to the results of fig 8 parts i and 2 the optimized ph for peroxone experiments is ph 8 0 3 3 2 effect of ozonation time hydrogen peroxide dosage and h2o2 o3 ratio the effects of hydrogen peroxide dose ozonation time and the ratio of h2o2 o3 peroxone on cod and color removal performance were examined in a lab scale reactor the results indicated that the performance of peroxone is greatly dependent upon the h2o2 o3 ratio 70 these experiments were carried out to determine the synergistic effects between hydrogen peroxide and ozonation allowing for higher oxidation rates of organic compounds in this process ozone was supplied using an ozone generator in the concentration range of 3000 mg o3 l hydrogen peroxide 36 was fed from a diluted aqueous solution in the range of 150 1500 mg h2o2 l the h2o2 to o3 ratios varied from 0 05 to 0 5 to determine the optimum ratio the outlet effluents of the ecf stage at the original ph 8 0 were ozonated in a batch system for 60 min with a constant ozone concentration of 3000 mg l hydrogen peroxide doses 0 1500 mg l and molar ratios h2o2 o3 0 0 5 the results of ozonation time the dose of hydrogen peroxide and the h2o2 o3 ratio on the removal efficiency of cod and color are presented in fig 9 parts i and ii increasing the ozonation time significantly increased the degradation efficiency of organic pollutants in opium wastewaters the experiments indicated that the amount of cod decreased from 12 000 to 9090 mg l and color decreased from 1200 to 1000 mg l with increasing ozonation time from 0 min to 45 min with a constant concentration of 3000 mg l o3 fig 9a parts i and ii in other words the cod removal efficiency for 45 min of ozonation is 24 3 and the expected color removal is about 16 7 from the results shown in fig 9 part i it can be concluded that the application of higher ozonation time in the opium industrial wastewater more than 45 min does not have much effect on cod and color removal therefore the optimum time for the process of ozonation was considered to be 45 min the cod and color reduction curve in fig 9a parts i and ii shows that the initial reaction rate of o3 with the pollutants is more rapid but the oxidation rate decreases as the reaction proceeds fig 9a part ii shows that the initial rate of color removal is also very fast but gradually and with the continuing ozonation process the oxidation rate decreases in peroxone experiments different h2o2 dosages 150 1500 mg l were added to the optimized ozonation conditions 45 min ozonation ph 8 0 o3 constant concentration 3000 mg l the cod and color removal efficiency of the peroxone process in opium wastewater increases up to a maximum value by increasing the concentration of hydrogen peroxide from 150 to 900 mg l fig 9b parts i and ii fig 9a parts i and ii show that the cod and color removal efficiency with ozone alone were about 24 3 and 16 7 respectively however if the ozone is combined with hydrogen peroxide the cod and color removal efficiency increases up to a value of 84 2 and 62 3 respectively fig 9b parts i and ii the peroxone potency increases dramatically when 150 900 mg l of h2o2 was added to 3000 mg l ozone at optimum time 45 min ph 8 0 and h2o2 o3 ratio is increased from 0 05 to 0 3 and leads to that removal efficiency of cod and color increased from 36 5 to 84 2 and 27 2 to 62 3 respectively fig 9c parts i and ii the optimal h2o2 o3 ratio is around 0 3 the addition of hydrogen peroxide improves the cod removal efficiency in opium wastewater however adding more h2o2 lead to a decreased treatment rate 900 1500 mg l h2o2 and decreased cod and color removal efficiencies from 84 2 to 69 0 and 62 3 to 49 6 respectively adding h2o2 leads to oh radical formation which can explain the increased cod and color removal when 150 900 mg l h2o2 is initially added consequently increasing hydrogen peroxide concentration up to an optimum concentration enhanced opium effluents oxidation rate when the applied hydrogen peroxide dose is above the optimum value it acted as a radical scavenger and led to a decrease in the treatment rate and also decreasing removal efficiency of cod and color eq 6 55 71

scanning electron microscopy sem and fig 10 a shows the micrographs of the gac sample from the sem analysis it was found that there were holes caves and exhibits heterogeneous type pore openings with large pore size on the surface of the activated carbon which would have more surface area created for adsorption of contaminant these holes caves and pores are suitable places for the adsorption of pollutants on the activated carbon 72 the nitrogen adsorption desorption due to the relatively small diameter of the nitrogen molecule is often used at 77 k to explore porosity surface area and is also a standard method for the characterization of the porosity of carbon adsorbents fig 10 b shows the n2 adsorption isotherm of the gac which is classified as isotherm type v and has a characteristic of macroporous solids these results were obtained by applying the bet equation to n2 adsorption at 77 k and dr equation to n2 adsorption at 77 k it was found that the activated carbon had a remarkable bet surface area which was primarily contributed by macropores 73 74 the average pore diameter was 1276 67 a indicative of its macropores character the pore size distribution in the standard manner by using the bjh method also shows that the activated carbon was dominantly macropores fig 10 b the results of the bet analysis show that the granular activated carbon used as an adsorbent possessed appreciable narrow macro porosity the bet surface area of gac was found to be 716 16 m2 g langmuir surface area 558 69 m2 g bjh adsorption cumulative surface area 474 900 m2 g bjh adsorption cumulative volume of pores 0 793 cm3 g and the total pore volume is 0 990 cm3 g the ftir analysis is important instrumentation to identify some of the characteristic functional groups which are capable of adsorbing contaminants the ftir spectra of activated carbon used in the adsorption filter process are shown in fig 10 c as can be seen the presence of transmittance peaks at the wavenumbers 3335 cm 1 2922 cm 1 1656 1594 cm 1 1384 cm 1 and 1120 cm 1 are assigned to the different functional groups including oh ch aliphatic carbonyl or cc co alcohol acid and phenol respectively these specific functional groups displayed the presence of some adsorption peaks in the carbon actives particles which leads to enhance the adsorption properties of the adsorbent 75 3 4 2 effect of initial ph the effect of initial ph of effluent containing organic inorganic and heavy metals contaminants on the removal of residual cod color tds and tss by gac adsorption was studied as a complementary treatment to achieve maximal pollution elimination undoubtedly the ph plays an important role in the whole adsorption process and particularly on the adsorption capacity the ph also affects the surface charge of the adsorbents and the degree of ionization of the organic pollutants the protons and hydroxyl ions are adsorbed strongly and therefore the adsorption of other ions is affected by the ph of the solution 55 75 80 the ph change also affects the adsorptive process by dissociating functional groups on the adsorbent s active sites this subsequently leads to a change in reaction kinetics and equilibrium characteristics of the adsorption process it is common to observe that the surface adsorbs anions favorably at lower ph due to the presence of protons whereas the surface is active for the adsorption of cations at higher phs due to the deposition of hydroxyl ions likely the opium alkaloids and other pollutants have a high positive charge density at a lower ph 55 77 81 the charge positive or negative on gac surface is proportional to the ph of the solution to investigate the effect of ph on the removal rate of cod color tds and tss using a designed gac adsorption column a series of solutions with a volume of 400 ml from the outlet of the peroxone reactor with the values of 1875 mg l 450 5100 and 790 initial cod color tds and tss respectively at different phs 2 0 12 0 were placed in contact with 250 g of granular activated carbon for 30 min fig 11 part i shows the cod color tds and tss removal efficiencies of opium wastewater at different solution ph by gac adsorption process this figure also shows the high dependency of removal to the solution s ph the highest cod color tds and tss removal was achieved at ph 7 0 at ph values below 7 0 the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged surface and the positively charged opium alkaloids intermediates and other pollutants reduces the adsorption of these species 58 78 81 in the basic medium however the electric double layer polarity changes lower cod and color removal at this condition are due to excess hydroxyl ions competing with opium alkaloids intermediates for the adsorption 58 78 81 3 4 3 contact time the effect of contact time of effluent containing organic inorganic and heavy metals contaminants with granular activated carbon as adsorbent on the cod color tds and tss removals of opium wastewater during the adsorption process was investigated fig 11 part ii as shown cod color tds and tss removals are dependent on the contact time and increases with increasing contact time it was found that more than 50 of cod removal occurs in the first 10 min of contact time since the pollutants molecules must diffuse into the adsorbent s porous structure over a longer contact time the equilibrium time for opium alkaloids adsorption is reached to 30 min the cod color tds and tss removal efficiency using 250 g of gac increased after 30 min adsorption to 99 2 99 0 99 0 and 99 1 respectively also as can be seen from fig 11 part ii there was no significant increase in the removal of pollutants when the contact time increases beyond 30 min this suggests that after 30 min the maximum adsorption is attained and hence the amount of pollutants remains constant even with the increase of contact time 55 58 73 74 at the initial stage of adsorption vacant surface sites are available for adsorption after this stage the remaining vacant sites are challenging to be occupied probably caused by the repulsive forces between the adsorbed molecules and the bulk phase 55 58 66 81 83 according to the results of this study it can be concluded that after the combined treatment methods the real opium wastewater can be subjected to discharge to the environment safely the effect of adsorption cycles on gac regeneration was studied according to the accomplished experiments gac adsorption capacity for removing pollutants indicators from opium wastewater did not significantly decrease at the first 8 cycles of adsorption however the adsorption capacity of gac for removal of pollutants shows a slight decrease after the 8th cycle after the 15th cycle of adsorption to replenish the adsorptive capacity of gac a small amount of new gac was added to the adsorption column following the optimization of variables by fitting the experimental equilibrium data to describe the adsorption equilibrium of color onto gac the adsorption isotherms of the langmuir freundlich and sips were investigated and the respective information for each model and their applicability to understanding the concept of adsorption was examined 73 74 84 87 the results for these isotherm models demonstrate the removal of color according to r2 r2 0 9929 maximum adsorption capacity 1250 0 mg g reached in the langmuir isotherm and heterogeneity factor ns 0 95 in sips isotherm follows the langmuir isotherm model investigation of kinetics of adsorption was carried out by analyzing experimental data of color adsorption at different time 0 45 min intervals at optimum values all variables the effect of contact time on adsorption was investigated and the dependency of adsorption data to kinetic models of pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion were assessed 73 74 87 89 among kinetic models investigated considering the experimental data r2 and qe at various removal process times the adsorption of color follows the pseudo second order kinetic model the results of kinetic and isotherm studies of the adsorption process for removal of color onto gac are reported in table 2 3 5 analysis of the semi industrial pilot scale based on the results obtained in the lab scale experiments the semi industrial pilot plant is designed and manufactured this set up consists of an electrocoagulation reactor advanced oxidation peroxone unit and adsorption reactor fig 12 and fig 4 the performance of the treatment system for each reactor was evaluated in terms of the levels of cod color tds and tss the raw wastewater of a pharmaceutical company with the initial specifications reported in table 1 is continuously entered into the treatment system and after each treatment step is transferred to the next reactor by a pump with a special flow rate the effectiveness and reproducibility of each reactor s performance in treating opium wastewater at optimal conditions based on the results reported in the lab scale experiments are presented in tables 3 5 as shown in table 3 after treatment in the ecf reactor the concentration of cod color tds and tss of opium wastewater in the best conditions is reduced to 66 57 66 and 54 respectively in addition the following results were achieved for the peroxone reactor in the best operating conditions cod 81 color 55 tds 27 and tss 26 table 4 also as shown in table 5 the following results were obtained for the gac and sand filters under optimal operating conditions cod 96 color 99 tds 99 and tss 99 under optimal conditions the actual consumption of electrodes was 0 625 kg m3 and the energy consumption used by dc power supply in ecf reactor and ozone generator in proxcone reactor was about 15 7 kwh m3 the activated carbon and h2o2 are the main chemicals used in this work based on our calculations to treat 1 m3 of effluent 1 73 kg of active carbon and 0 5 l of h2o2 are used the results showed that the main operating costs for 1 m3 of wastewater treatment is about 5 5 us the quality of treated wastewater by high performance pilot scale ecf h2o2 o3 gac is compared with the raw opium pharmaceutical wastewater and is shown in table 6 the time required for the overall treatment of 1 m3 of the wastewater is about 120 min this is a short and acceptable time which leads to a reduction in operating costs as shown in table 6 this method can reduce cod tss color and tds to 96 99 99 and 99 respectively the ph of the treated water is also within the range approved by the environment organization fig 12 shows the color change of the opium wastewater at different treatment stages in semi industrial scale experiments as explained in section 2 2 wastewater samples the most important causes of high cod and bod5 and intense dark brown color in raw opium wastewater is the very complex chemical composition of this type of wastewater drugs opium derivatives reagents and solvents according to our results an effluent with such a quality have been almost completely treated so that the produced water has received the necessary standards for agricultural use from the environment organization of iran 4 conclusions a hybrid method consisting of three different components ecf h2o2 o3 gac treated has been used to treat opium wastewater initially detailed laboratory scale experiments were performed on opium wastewater based on the results of laboratory scale experiments the design and implementation of a semi industrial pilot plant have been carried out the purpose of creating such a system is to treat complex and persistent organic and inorganic pollutants of opium wastewater the results of cod color tds and tss removal efficiencies clearly show the efficiency of hybrid system ecf h2o2 o3 gac in both laboratory and semi industrial scales for the treatment of opium wastewater the main results of this study can be summarized as follows the combination of different methods leads to improving the flaws weaknesses of the individual processes enhancing the degradation rate removing the organic compounds and possibly reducing the operating costs of the integrated process the electrocoagulation flotation is an effective treatment process for opium wastewater treatment with a high amount of refractory persistent organics and intense color as a pre treatment stage this process reduces cod by more than 60 70 the combining of ecf and peroxone resulted in a 15 20 enhancement of removal efficiency than to the individual processes the contemporary presence of gac adsorption filter leads to further enhancement of the whole system efficiency obtaining a removal efficiency 20 25 higher than to the individual processes the output of ecf h2o2 o3 gac treating system is generally very satisfactory this system in both laboratory and semi industrial scales at 120 min operating time leads to a reduction of about 99 cod color tds and tss effluents from this method satisfy local discharge standards for cod and color parameters in general the most important advantages of this combination system include a no need for external addition of the chemicals

13267,the wastewater of an opium pharmaceutical industry was successfully treated using a combined process of electrocoagulation flotation ecf peroxone h2o2 o3 and adsorption filter of granular activated carbon gac in a three step operation ecf h2o2 o3 gac in a lab and semi industrial scales the effect of the operating parameters such as initial ph current density residence time injection dose of h2o2 the ratio of h2o2 o3 and time of adsorption process was optimized in both scales on the lab scale the removal efficiency of cod color tds tss electrical power consumption electrode consumption and operating costs have been studied in the ecf process the maximum removal efficiencies of cod color tds and tss were 64 60 61 and 50 respectively the optimum ph ozonation time hydrogen peroxide concentration and the ratio of h2o2 o3 in the peroxone process are 8 45 min 900 mg l 0 3 h2o2 o3 respectively after ecf and peroxone processes the maximum removal efficiencies of cod and color increased up to 84 and 62 and after the adsorption process the maximum removal efficiencies of cod color tds and tss increased up to 99 2 99 0 99 0 and 99 1 respectively the performance of each reactor in the semi industrial scale was also evaluated after the treatment operation in the ecf h2o2 o3 gac semi industrial pilot reactor the cod removal efficiency color tds and tss of opium wastewater reached 96 99 99 and 99 respectively the excellent performance as well as the low operating cost confirmed that this integrated system is highly applicable for the advanced treatment of opium pharmaceutical industry wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords electrocoagulation flotation advance oxidation process peroxone adsorption filter opium pharmaceutical industry semi industrial pilot scale 1 introduction with the increase of world population industrialization and urbanization the demand for a quality life is also increasing various industries are established to meet human needs which along with their benefits there are various types of problems including wastewater generation 1 3 the world will encounter various types of industrial wastewater which can produce many harmful effects such as cancer reproductive disorders and organ failure among them one of the most important wastewaters is pharmaceuticals industries wastewater 4 6 therefore pharmaceutical waste needs to be purified before being discharged to the environment 3 5 traditionally various technologies include solar photo fenton photolysis and photocatalysis advanced oxidation chemical and electrochemical coagulation activated sludges filtration adsorption chemical and electrocoagulation osmosis and membrane have been used to treat pharmaceutical wastewater 3 10 wastewater from the opium pharmaceutical industry may include natural semi synthetic and synthetic opioids such as morphine codeine thebaine hydrocodone oxycodone oxymorphone buprenorphine fentanyl and methadone tramadol some opium alkaloids are the most common in addition wastewater from these industries may include biodegradable organic substances non biodegradable organic and inorganic substances heavy metals and potential inhibitors which eventually enter the catchment area or groundwater in the form of landfill leachate 11 12 a literature review of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment of opium alkaloids shows that the studies on opium alkaloid effluents have been carried out mainly at istanbul technical university and tubtak research center almost all of these researches have been performed by biological and aeration methods or some chemical methods that none of these methods has been able to completely treat the opium wastewater 13 20 the problems of these methods in single step mode are the high operational cost and the inability of them to purification and remove all pollutants 21 23 due to the complex nature and or non biodegradable pharmaceutical industries a combined method was usually used for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment such as opium pharmaceutical industry wastewater electrocoagulation is a proven and cost effective technology to treat and remove most contaminants pollutants from water the use of this technology due to non use of chemicals short reaction time long lifetime of units easy maintain the ability to degrade resistant pollutants such as organic polyaromatic compounds less sludge production and lower costs are highly regarded by various industries compared with conventional biological and chemical processes 10 24 27 however some soluble organic compounds especially pharmaceuticals compounds such as opium alkaloids for complete removal may require additional treatment with advanced oxidation advanced oxidation cells are normally installed in wastewater and effluent treatment plant inline after electrocoagulation cells 27 30 the advanced oxidation reactors are effective as complementary electrocoagulation cells for complete wastewater treatment 27 35 advanced oxidation processes aops are used alone or in combination with other treatment processes such as physicochemical processes these cells may be fitted with different oxidant agents such as o3 h2o2 uv o3 uv h2o2 fenton etc or with the production of powerful oxidizing agents such as hydroxyl radicals during the electrolysis process among the aops peroxone the combination of ozone and hydrogen peroxide is as an advanced oxidation technique based on in situ production of hydroxyl radical oh by assisted reactions between o3 and h2o2 30 38 the literature study revealed that the combination of ozone with hydrogen peroxide has been successfully utilized for the efficient treatment of organic persistent pollutants 35 38 these advanced methods oxidize dissolved complex organic compounds sulfides and mercaptans etc which are not removed by electrocoagulation to carbon dioxide water nitrogen and simple salts 33 38 once these contaminants have been broken down or mineralized into simpler or smaller molecules by advanced purification processes they are easily and completely removed by conventional purification processes such as activated carbon filters 39 42 in this work for the first time we have developed a combined process including electrocoagulation peroxone and granular activated carbon gac absorption filter to treat opium pharmaceutical wastewater the purpose of this work is design development construct and application of high performance purification system for opium pharmaceutical wastewater treatment by a combination of electrocoagulation peroxone adsorption processes ecf h2o2 o3 gac 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical and instruments all chemicals including hydrochloric acid 37 sodium hydroxide 99 sulfuric acid 95 and hydrogen peroxide 36 were analytical reagent grade from sigma aldrich m sdn bhd malaysia the wastewater ph was measured using a ph meter az model 8689 taiwan and metrohm model 691 switzerland and was adjusted by adding appropriate lime amounts caco3 and h2so4 solutions the electrocoagulation at constant current electrolysis experiments was performed using a direct current power supply megatek mp 3005 china which provided stabilized currents and voltages ranging from 0 to 500 a and from 0 to 50 v respectively cod analyzer hach dr 2000 usa and cod reactor for digestion hach

wastewater samples the raw wastewater samples used in the experiments were the raw wastewater generated from opium pharmaceutical factories the characteristics of raw opium alkaloid wastewater were variable throughout the study the ranges of these changes and the quality of raw wastewater of opium alkaloids before the purification process are presented in table 1 typical contaminants in this type of wastewater mainly include opium derivatives such as opium alkaloids methadone codeine phytin oxycodone thebaine morphine and buprenorphine etc the extraction of these alkaloids is carried out at different stages using organic solvents such as toluene methanol ethyl acetate hexane ethanol and acetic acid the chemical composition of wastewater is very complex and heavily polluted with very high cod and bod5 content and have an intense dark brown color 2 3 setups the proposed process for treating opium pharmaceutical wastewater consists of three stages electrocoagulation advanced oxidation peroxone and adsorption with granular activated carbon filters to achieve better and more realistic results we designed and implemented a semi industrial pilot plant that includes three wastewater treatment processes to complete the treatment of opium wastewater the initial evaluation of the electrocoagulation peroxone and gac adsorption treatment processes was determined by analyzing the cod tds tss and color pt co scale at different time intervals the optimal conditions of all the treatment processes electrocoagulation peroxone adsorption and combination of three stage are described in the next sections once the optimal conditions were found the raw water and treated wastewater samples were filtered and analyzed for cod color tds tss and ph as indicated in the standard methods procedures 43 the obtained data were used to determine the optimal ph current density and other operational conditions the details of each of these processes in a single stage and combined form will be discussed in the following sections 2 3 1 the ecf reactor a semi industrial pilot scale plant has been designed for opium wastewater treatment the first part of this pilot is the electrocoagulation flotation reactor which can reduce cod pollution by more than 60 70 of the initial value in designing the ecf reactor the parameters such as type of electrodes arrangements and the surface to volume ratio of electrodes and have been optimized the compact reactor of ecf has been designed and constructed at a lab and semi industrial pilot scale fig 1 part a and b respectively as shown in fig 1a the cell used in laboratory scale is a glass cube with a volume of 2 l containing eight iron plates with dimensions of 60 60 3 mm as anode and eight stainless steel plates 60 60 3 mm as a cathode the distance between the anodes and cathodes was 25 mm the main components of the semi pilot reactor are 1 electrolysis tank volume 200 l 2 anode eight iron plate dimension 400 250 3 mm effective surface area for each anode 2000 cm2 effective surface area about 1 6 m2 for eight anodes 3 cathode eight stainless steel plate dimension 400 250 3 mm 4 power supply the power supply used can be supported by stabilized currents and voltages ranging from 0 to 500 a and from 0 to 50 v respectively 5 pneumatic pump the pneumatic pump has been used for the uniform mixing of wastewater during the electrolysis the air is injected into the ecf reactor from the end of electrodes to improve the flotation process and flocs reach the surface of wastewater and floated 6 floc scrapers an automatic cleaner brush scraper or rake has been used to discharge floated flocs on the sewage surface when the volume of formed flocs reaches a certain amount it is discharged by the automatic brush to the sludge collecting tank a draining tube was installed at the bottom of the tank for cleaning the distance between the electrodes was adjusted to 50 mm the electrodes were connected to each other using a monopolar configuration and connected to terminals of the direct current power supply dc power supply the electrocoagulation flotation process was operated at ph values of 3 0 11 0 by with current densities of 10 0 12 5 15 0 20 0 and 25 0 ma cm2 the conductivity of the opium wastewater was between 17 6 and 21 6 ms and therefore there is no need to add supporting electrolytes for the ecf process 44 2 3 2 h2o2 o3 peroxone reactor the second part of the treatment system is the peroxone reactor which has been designed and constructed at both lab and semi industrial pilot scales fig 2 a b to optimize the effective parameters in the peroxone reactor on semi industrial scale first a cell on a laboratory scale is designed and fabricated and the operational parameters on ozonation and peroxone processes on it were investigated the cell used in the laboratory scale consists of a glass column with a diameter of 5 cm a height of 105 cm and an effective volume of 1000 ml was used for ozonation and peroxone processes in the ozonation process the ozone is injected into the column using an ozone generator model arda france with a production capacity of 3 g h 3000 mg l in a cell with a volume of 1 l and 1 h ozonation time and using a fine bubble air stone embedded in the bottom of the column the use of air stones causes better dispersion of ozone gas and increases the contact surface and contact time of ozone molecules and pollutants which leads to the higher efficiency of the peroxone and ozonation processes the main components of the semi pilot reactor are 1 peroxone tank volume 300 l pressurized tank with a height of 2 m 2 ozone generator this device can be produced 100 g h o3 3 h2o2 dosing pump rate and amount are controllable 4 diffuser and 5 hydrodynamic pump the ozone generator and peroxone reactor images are shown on a semi industrial scale in fig 2a b in the peroxone reactor a fine bubble diffuser is placed at the bottom of the reactor for the following purposes first the injected ozone gas is completely dissolved in the aqueous phase and the second the greater contact surface take place between molecules of ozone gas phase and pollutants liquid phase 44 48 ozone was generated using a corona discharge ozone generator fig 2c an oxygen generator is used to produce pure oxygen from the oxygen concentrator it will increase productivity much more than using dry air for the best performance simultaneously h2o2 36 w w and ozone was injected into the peroxone reactor with the injection rate of 3 l per hour and 100 g h for 45 min respectively to achieve maximum efficiency the electrocoagulated wastewater was introduced into the peroxone reactor and samples were taken from the reactor every 20 min after analyzing the effluent by cod and color the optimum time was selected for peroxone process at the end of the process the treated wastewater was held in a degassing tank for about 5 min to strip oxygen and residual ozone and then the effluent through a pump enters the post treatment step granular activated carbon filter based on the results the effluent color after this stage turns from bright green into a clear yellow color 2 3 3 granular activated carbon adsorption process gac adsorption process was used as a tried stage of the semi industrial pilot plant for opium wastewater treatment on a laboratory scale an adsorption column contains the granular activated carbon in the size range of 3 to 5 mm and adsorption capacity of 1050 mg g from part chemical corporation s walnut hard shell was used the adsorption column was made of glass with dimensions of 5 cm diameter 105 cm height and an effective working volume of 400 ml the column was filled with gac and silica so that at first about 10 cm of the column is filled with fine mesh silica this layer prevents the escape of fine carbon grains then about 80 cm of the filter was filled with granular activated carbon and on the layer of gac about 10 cm of silica with the coarse mesh was poured the gac adsorption column image is shown in fig 3 a the semi pilot reactor consists of an adsorption tank made of polycarbonate with dimensions of 60 cm diameter 185 cm height and volume of 523 l effective working volume of the reactor was 200 l the reactor is filled like what was described for the lab scale column at first about 40 cm of the tank is filled with fine mesh silica then about 1 m of the tank was filled with gac and on this layer of gac about 40 cm of silica with the coarse mesh is poured before filing the reactor gac must be soaked for 24 h and then dried by hot air after loading the tank with gac in order to degas the gac fill it with clean water and allow it to stand for 8 12 h the gac reactor image used in the semi pilot experiments is shown in fig 3b the wastewater after the electrocoagulation flotation and peroxone treatments flows downwards through the gac filters at an average flow rate of 0 4 m3 h then at specific times samples were taken for cod toc tds and color analysis finally gac reactor is periodically back washed with water at a flow rate of 0 8 m3 h for 5 min 2 4 analytical measurements the analytical measurements of operating parameters such as color cod toc and tds before and after the ecf treatment peroxone and gac adsorption filter processes were performed using the standard procedures of the american public health association apha 49 the percentage of color cod toc and tds removal efficiencies were calculated using the following equation 1 r c i c e c i 100 where ci and ce are the color cod toc and or tds concentrations in the inlet and the exit streams of the ec peroxone and gac adsorption filter processes respectively 49 the operating cost includes material mainly electrodes cost electrical energy cost labor maintenance and other costs in this work the operating cost is calculated based on electricity consumption costs chemical costs and electrodes costs 50 51 calculation of operating cost is expressed as 2 operating cost enc elc chc where chc is chemical consumption enc and elc are energy and electrode consumption respectively and are consumption quantities per m3 of wastewater treated the total electrical energy consumption of electrocoagulation peroxone and gac filter processes were calculated using the following equations 3 enc enc ec enc h 2 o 2 o3 enc gac the electrical

s the gac adsorption process s operating cost is related to activated carbon used to treat 1 m3 of opium wastewater besides 0 9 kg m3 lime was used for the ph adjustment process in this work three hydrodynamic pumps are used to transfer effluent to the tanks 2 5 the effect of adjusting the initial wastewater ph the initial ph has an essential effect on wastewater treatment 52 54 therefore it is necessary to use suitable chemicals for adjusting ph based on the types of pollutants or impurities the appropriate neutralizing or adjusting agent s selection depends on a series of factors including their cost transportation expense handling in the plant preparation for usage and investment in the facility storage safety and labor costs the most commonly used chemical for neutralization or alkalization of acidic wastewater is 50 sodium hydroxide however some advantages of lime such as producing fewer tds cost less than other adjusting agents and precipitate heavy metal contaminants have led to lime being used as a chemical to adjust the ph 43 44 52 55 the wastewater collection and maintenance pool s initial wastewater is transferred by a pump electrometer into a 1 m3 polyethylene tank then the ph of the wastewater was adjusted in the range 3 10 with lime or h2so4 and after the optimization of ph the opium wastewater was transmitted by a continuous flow pump into the ecf reactor fig 4 shows the semi industrial pilot scale designed for wastewater treatment of a pharmaceutical company 3 results and discussion 3 1 initial ph adjustment the opium wastewater is a complex matrix because of various solvents poly aromatic compounds opium alkaloids and acid base or buffers therefore the opium wastewater may have a wide range of initial ph 50 55 on the other hand the efficiency of electrocoagulation flotation and other treatment processes is significantly ph dependent 21 23 52 55 the initial ph of the raw wastewater that we were dealing with was about ph 4 5 6 0 the effect of initial ph was investigated on the initial wastewater solution in the range of 3 0 11 0 the effect of ph on the removal efficiency of cod color tds and tss is shown in fig 5 part i by increasing the ph from 3 0 to 8 0 the efficiency of cod color tds and tss removal of opium raw wastewater increased from 3 3 to 8 6 4 6 to 14 3 5 1 to 16 4 and 5 5 to 18 5 respectively and at the ph values higher than 8 0 these removal efficiencies decreased the effect of adding lime for increasing ph can be explained as follows that the alkaline phs favor the precipitation of most metal ions as insoluble solids 52 54 low ph levels can increase the solubility of heavy metals resulting in the release of metal cations into the water rather than being absorbed into the sediment 3 2 ecf treatment 3 2 1 effects of ph in this section the effect of ph on the removal efficiency during the electrocoagulation flotation process has been studied according to the literature in iron based electrocoagulation optimization of ph leads to higher efficiency and better performance 30 56 58 in this work the effect of ph on the ecf process was firstly studied in the laboratory scale reactor and then the optimum ph used for the semi pilot scale the effect of ph on the removal efficiency of cod color tds and tss is shown in fig 5 part ii by increasing the ph from 3 0 to 8 0 the efficiency of cod color tds and tss removal increased from 10 6 to 47 9 20 5 to 58 8 16 0 to 54 9 and 14 9 to 50 4 respectively on the other hand when the initial ph increased from 8 0 to 11 0 the cod removal decreased from 47 9 to 16 5 color removal decreased from 58 8 to 34 9 tds removal decreased from 54 9 to 28 6 and tss removal decreased from 50 4 to 24 7 fe oh 3 and fe oh 2 are the main species of fe3 hydrolysis reactions in acidic media ph 6 0 the fe ions produced on the surface of scarified electrodes are soluble and are not capable of absorbing the pollutants 56 59 in the alkaline media ph 9 0 the fe2 and fe3 ions precipitated and formed fe oh 2 and fe oh 3 based on the experimental results the ph 8 0 was selected as the optimum ph value for the ecf reactor in opium wastewater treatment 3 2 2 current density the effect of current density on the performance of ecf reactor has been studied the production rate of coagulant at the anode surface adjusts bubble production and the growth of flocs for adsorbing the pollutants can be controlled by changing current density 51 60 62 the experiments were carried out at ph 8 0 and operation time 0 30 min the removal efficiencies of these parameters versus operating time and current density are shown in fig 6 the increase of current density from 10 to 50 ma cm2 lead to a decrease in the operating time required and an increase in the removal efficiency of cod color tds and tss the increase of current density from 10 to 50 ma cm2 leads to an increase in the removal efficiencies of cod from 41 0 to 66 6 color from 38 1 to 72 8 tds from 41 7 to 69 6 and tss from 36 7 to 58 5 respectively fig 6 the increasing current density leads to an increase in coagulant production rate anodic dissolution of fe anode an increase in fe oh 3 s particles and thus an increase in the removal efficiency 58 64 moreover the bubble generation rate increased and the bubble size decreased with increasing the current densities these effects are beneficial for high pollutant removal by h2 g flotation 30 51 60 62 based on these results 25 ma cm2 was selected as the optimum current density in this study due to reduced operating costs the energy enc kwh m3 and electrode elc kg m3 consumptions calculated using eqs 2 5 are depicted in fig 7 i besides the amount of sludge generated during the ecf process increases from 0 87 to 5 1 kg m3 with increasing current density from 10 to 50 ma cm2 fig 7i changes in the operating costs as a function of the current density are illustrated in fig 7 part ii the variations in the operating costs were calculated based on m3 the operating costs at 10 50 ma cm2 were 1 90 9 55 m3 fig 7ii on the other hand the operating cost increased rapidly with increasing current density from 10 to 50 ma cm2 from the operating cost and removal efficiencies of cod color tds and tss points of view the fe anode is preferable since it lowered the operating cost significantly in the ecf process one should note that the current densities exceeding 50 0 ma cm2 were not investigated because the energy consumption and the sludge production would expand beyond a reasonable range while gaining a limited increase in the removal efficiency it should also be noted that at higher current densities heat generation unwanted reaction excess oxygen evaluation and cell voltage increase and as a result energy consumption will increase 60 62 3 3 peroxone treatment 3 3 1 effects of ph in this part the effect of ph on the performance of ozonation and peroxone combining ozone with hydrogen peroxide processes in opium wastewater treatment was investigated ozone molecules can be reacted with an organic compound via two different pathways first direct oxidation of pollutants and second indirect radical chain type reaction 44 48 65 66 the mechanism of ozonation depends on the ph and composition of the effluent in acidic media ozone molecules react directly with pollutants but at ph values higher than 7 0 ozone molecules decomposed and generated oh radicals since the oxidation potential of hydroxyl radicals is much higher than that of ozone molecules so indirect oxidation causes complete oxidation of organic compounds 44 48 65 67 the cod and color removal efficiencies at various initial phs in the ozonation process are shown in fig 8 part i as can be seen the cod removal of opium wastewaters increased from 8 7 at ph 3 to 20 at ph 8 and decreased to 6 6 at ph 12 also the color removal increased from 1 5 at ph 3 to 12 2 at ph 8 and decreased to 3 5 at ph 12 fig 8b part i the maximum cod and color removal in the ozonation process was observed at ph 8 0 according to the ozone decomposition model presented by shb model 68 in the acidic media ozone diffused into wastewater solution reacted with the pollutant in the ozonation experiments at ph 8 0 both oh radicals and ozone are the oxidizing agents hence a significant portion of cod was removed 37 47 48 69 the effect of different ph on the cod and color removal efficiencies in peroxone experiments is shown in figs 8 part ii these experiments are similar to the ozonation experiments except that 1000 mg l of h2o2 is added to the wastewater solution at the beginning of each experiment the effect of ph on the removal efficiency of peroxone process has a similar pattern to that of the ozonation process but the removal efficiency in this process has increased compared to the ozonation process as shown in fig 8a part ii the cod removal of opium wastewaters increased from 24 2 at ph 3 0 to 78 9 at ph 8 0 and decreased to 45 2 at ph 12 also the color removal of opium wastewaters increased from 11 2 at ph 3 0 to 38 3 at ph 8 0 and decreased to 13 5 at ph 12 fig 8b part ii comparison of peroxone experiments with ozone experiments showing significant progress in cod and color removal efficiencies when peroxone process was used this may be due to the increased production of reactive hydroxyl radicals at acidic and alkaline phs on the contrary there was a significantly lower removal efficiency possibly h2o2 or ho2 competes with opium alkaloids for ozone or scavenges radical species 34 38 61 70 finally according to the results of fig 8 parts i and 2 the optimized ph for peroxone experiments is ph 8 0 3 3 2 effect of ozonation time hydrogen peroxide dosage and h2o2 o3 ratio the effects of hydrogen peroxide dose ozonation time and the ratio of h2o2 o3 peroxone on cod and color removal performance were examined in a lab scale reactor the results indicated that the performance of peroxone is greatly dependent upon the h2o2 o3 ratio 70 these experiments were carried out to determine the synergistic effects between hydrogen peroxide and ozonation allowing for higher oxidation rates of organic compounds in this process ozone was supplied using an ozone generator in the concentration range of 3000 mg o3 l hydrogen peroxide 36 was fed from a diluted aqueous solution in the range of 150 1500 mg h2o2 l the h2o2 to o3 ratios varied from 0 05 to 0 5 to determine the optimum ratio the outlet effluents of the ecf stage at the original ph 8 0 were ozonated in a batch system for 60 min with a constant ozone concentration of 3000 mg l hydrogen peroxide doses 0 1500 mg l and molar ratios h2o2 o3 0 0 5 the results of ozonation time the dose of hydrogen peroxide and the h2o2 o3 ratio on the removal efficiency of cod and color are presented in fig 9 parts i and ii increasing the ozonation time significantly increased the degradation efficiency of organic pollutants in opium wastewaters the experiments indicated that the amount of cod decreased from 12 000 to 9090 mg l and color decreased from 1200 to 1000 mg l with increasing ozonation time from 0 min to 45 min with a constant concentration of 3000 mg l o3 fig 9a parts i and ii in other words the cod removal efficiency for 45 min of ozonation is 24 3 and the expected color removal is about 16 7 from the results shown in fig 9 part i it can be concluded that the application of higher ozonation time in the opium industrial wastewater more than 45 min does not have much effect on cod and color removal therefore the optimum time for the process of ozonation was considered to be 45 min the cod and color reduction curve in fig 9a parts i and ii shows that the initial reaction rate of o3 with the pollutants is more rapid but the oxidation rate decreases as the reaction proceeds fig 9a part ii shows that the initial rate of color removal is also very fast but gradually and with the continuing ozonation process the oxidation rate decreases in peroxone experiments different h2o2 dosages 150 1500 mg l were added to the optimized ozonation conditions 45 min ozonation ph 8 0 o3 constant concentration 3000 mg l the cod and color removal efficiency of the peroxone process in opium wastewater increases up to a maximum value by increasing the concentration of hydrogen peroxide from 150 to 900 mg l fig 9b parts i and ii fig 9a parts i and ii show that the cod and color removal efficiency with ozone alone were about 24 3 and 16 7 respectively however if the ozone is combined with hydrogen peroxide the cod and color removal efficiency increases up to a value of 84 2 and 62 3 respectively fig 9b parts i and ii the peroxone potency increases dramatically when 150 900 mg l of h2o2 was added to 3000 mg l ozone at optimum time 45 min ph 8 0 and h2o2 o3 ratio is increased from 0 05 to 0 3 and leads to that removal efficiency of cod and color increased from 36 5 to 84 2 and 27 2 to 62 3 respectively fig 9c parts i and ii the optimal h2o2 o3 ratio is around 0 3 the addition of hydrogen peroxide improves the cod removal efficiency in opium wastewater however adding more h2o2 lead to a decreased treatment rate 900 1500 mg l h2o2 and decreased cod and color removal efficiencies from 84 2 to 69 0 and 62 3 to 49 6 respectively adding h2o2 leads to oh radical formation which can explain the increased cod and color removal when 150 900 mg l h2o2 is initially added consequently increasing hydrogen peroxide concentration up to an optimum concentration enhanced opium effluents oxidation rate when the applied hydrogen peroxide dose is above the optimum value it acted as a radical scavenger and led to a decrease in the treatment rate and also decreasing removal efficiency of cod and color eq 6 55 71 6 h 2 o 2 oh ho 2 h 2 o k 2 2 7 10 7 m 1 s 1 3 4 adsorption treatment 3 4 1 characterization of adsorbent the surface morphology of the activated carbon at different magnifications was examined using scanning electron microscopy sem and fig 10 a shows the micrographs of the gac sample from the sem analysis it was found that there were holes caves and exhibits heterogeneous type pore openings with large pore size on the surface of the activated carbon which would have more surface area created for adsorption of contaminant these holes caves and pores are suitable places for the adsorption of pollutants on the activated carbon 72 the nitrogen adsorption desorption due to the relatively small diameter of the nitrogen molecule is often used at 77 k to explore porosity surface area and is also a standard method for the characterization of the porosity of carbon adsorbents fig 10 b shows the n2 adsorption isotherm of the gac which is classified as isotherm type v and has a characteristic of macroporous solids these results were obtained by applying the bet equation to n2 adsorption at 77 k and dr equation to n2 adsorption at 77 k it was found that the activated carbon had a remarkable bet surface area which was primarily contributed by macropores 73 74 the average pore diameter was 1276 67 a indicative of its macropores character the pore size distribution in the standard manner by using the bjh method also shows that the activated carbon was dominantly macropores fig 10 b the results of the bet analysis show that the granular activated carbon used as an adsorbent possessed appreciable narrow macro porosity the bet surface area of gac was found to be 716 16 m2 g langmuir surface area 558 69 m2 g bjh adsorption cumulative surface area 474 900 m2 g bjh adsorption cumulative volume of pores 0 793 cm3 g and the total pore volume is 0 990 cm3 g the ftir analysis is important instrumentation to identify some of the characteristic functional groups which are capable of adsorbing contaminants the ftir spectra of activated carbon used in the adsorption filter process are shown in fig 10 c as can be seen the presence of transmittance peaks at the wavenumbers 3335 cm 1 2922 cm 1 1656 1594 cm 1 1384 cm 1 and 1120 cm 1 are assigned to the different functional groups including oh ch aliphatic carbonyl or cc co alcohol acid and phenol respectively these specific functional groups displayed the presence of some adsorption peaks in the carbon actives particles which leads to enhance the adsorption properties of the adsorbent 75 3 4 2 effect of initial ph the effect of initial ph of effluent containing organic inorganic and heavy metals contaminants on the removal of residual cod color tds and tss by gac adsorption was studied as a complementary treatment to achieve maximal pollution elimination undoubtedly the ph plays an important role in the whole adsorption process and particularly on the adsorption capacity the ph also affects the surface charge of the adsorbents and the degree of ionization of the organic pollutants the protons and hydroxyl ions are adsorbed strongly and therefore the adsorption of other ions is affected by the ph of the solution 55 75 80 the ph change also affects the adsorptive process by dissociating functional groups on the adsorbent s active sites this subsequently leads to a change in reaction kinetics and equilibrium characteristics of the adsorption process it is common to observe that the surface adsorbs anions favorably at lower ph due to the presence of protons whereas the surface is active for the adsorption of cations at higher phs due to the deposition of hydroxyl ions likely the opium alkaloids and other pollutants have a high positive charge density at a lower ph 55 77 81 the charge positive or negative on gac surface is proportional to the ph of the solution to investigate the effect of ph on the removal rate of cod color tds and tss using a designed gac adsorption column a series of solutions with a volume of 400 ml from the outlet of the peroxone reactor with the values of 1875 mg l 450 5100 and 790 initial cod color tds and tss respectively at different phs 2 0 12 0 were placed in contact with 250 g of granular activated carbon for 30 min fig 11 part i shows the cod color tds and tss removal efficiencies of opium wastewater at different solution ph by gac adsorption process this figure also shows the high dependency of removal to the solution s ph the highest cod color tds and tss removal was achieved at ph 7 0 at ph values below 7 0 the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged surface and the positively charged opium alkaloids intermediates and other pollutants reduces the adsorption of these species 58 78 81 in the basic medium however the electric double layer polarity changes lower cod and color removal at this condition are due to excess hydroxyl ions competing with opium alkaloids intermediates for the adsorption 58 78 81 3 4 3 contact time the effect of contact time of effluent containing organic inorganic and heavy metals contaminants with granular activated carbon as adsorbent on the cod color tds and tss removals of opium wastewater during the adsorption process was investigated fig 11 part ii as shown cod color tds and tss removals are dependent on the contact time and increases with increasing contact time it was found that more than 50 of cod removal occurs in the first 10 min of contact time since the pollutants molecules must diffuse into the adsorbent s porous structure over a longer contact time the equilibrium time for opium alkaloids adsorption is reached to 30 min the cod color tds and tss removal efficiency using 250 g of gac increased after 30 min adsorption to 99 2 99 0 99 0 and 99 1 respectively also as can be seen from fig 11 part ii there was no significant increase in the removal of pollutants when the contact time increases beyond 30 min this suggests that after 30 min the maximum adsorption is attained and hence the amount of pollutants remains constant even with the increase of contact time 55 58 73 74 at the initial stage of adsorption vacant surface sites are available for adsorption after this stage the remaining vacant sites are challenging to be occupied probably caused by the repulsive forces between the adsorbed molecules and the bulk phase 55 58 66 81 83 according to the results of this study it can be concluded that after the combined treatment methods the real opium wastewater can be subjected to discharge to the environment safely the effect of adsorption cycles on gac regeneration was studied according to the accomplished experiments gac adsorption capacity for removing pollutants indicators from opium wastewater did not significantly decrease at the first 8 cycles of adsorption however the adsorption capacity of gac for removal of pollutants shows a slight decrease after the 8th cycle after the 15th cycle of adsorption to replenish the adsorptive capacity of gac a small amount of new gac was added to the adsorption column following the optimization of variables by fitting the experimental equilibrium data to describe the adsorption equilibrium of color onto gac the adsorption isotherms of the langmuir freundlich and sips were investigated and the respective information for each model and their applicability to understanding the concept of adsorption was examined 73 74 84 87 the results for these isotherm models demonstrate the removal of color according to r2 r2 0 9929 maximum adsorption capacity 1250 0 mg g reached in the langmuir isotherm and heterogeneity factor ns 0 95 in sips isotherm follows the langmuir isotherm model investigation of kinetics of adsorption was carried out by analyzing experimental data of color adsorption at different time 0 45 min intervals at optimum values all variables the effect of contact time on adsorption was investigated and the dependency of adsorption data to kinetic models of pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion were assessed 73 74 87 89 among kinetic models investigated considering the experimental data r2 and qe at various removal process times the adsorption of color follows the pseudo second order kinetic model the results of kinetic and isotherm studies of the adsorption process for removal of color onto gac are reported in table 2 3 5 analysis of the semi industrial pilot scale based on the results obtained in the lab scale experiments the semi industrial pilot plant is designed and manufactured this set up consists of an electrocoagulation reactor advanced oxidation peroxone unit and adsorption reactor fig 12 and fig 4 the performance of the treatment system for each reactor was evaluated in terms of the levels of cod color tds and tss the raw wastewater of a pharmaceutical company with the initial specifications reported in table 1 is continuously entered into the treatment system and after each treatment step is transferred to the next reactor by a pump with a special flow rate the effectiveness and reproducibility of each reactor s performance in treating opium wastewater at optimal conditions based on the results reported in the lab scale experiments are presented in tables 3 5 as shown in table 3 after treatment in the ecf reactor the concentration of cod color tds and tss of opium wastewater in the best conditions is reduced to 66 57 66 and 54 respectively in addition the following results were achieved for the peroxone reactor in the best operating conditions cod 81 color 55 tds 27 and tss 26 table 4 also as shown in table 5 the following results were obtained for the gac and sand filters under optimal operating conditions cod 96 color 99 tds 99 and tss 99 under optimal conditions the actual consumption of electrodes was 0 625 kg m3 and the energy consumption used by dc power supply in ecf reactor and ozone generator in proxcone reactor was about 15 7 kwh m3 the activated carbon and h2o2 are the main chemicals used in this work based on our calculations to treat 1 m3 of effluent 1 73 kg of active carbon and 0 5 l of h2o2 are used the results showed that the main operating costs for 1 m3 of wastewater treatment is about 5 5 us the quality of treated wastewater by high performance pilot scale ecf h2o2 o3 gac is compared with the raw opium pharmaceutical wastewater and is shown in table 6 the time required for the overall treatment of 1 m3 of the wastewater is about 120 min this is a short and acceptable time which leads to a reduction in operating costs as shown in table 6 this method can reduce cod tss color and tds to 96 99 99 and 99 respectively the ph of the treated water is also within the range approved by the environment organization fig 12 shows the color change of the opium wastewater at different treatment stages in semi industrial scale experiments as explained in section 2 2 wastewater samples the most important causes of high cod and bod5 and intense dark brown color in raw opium wastewater is the very complex chemical composition of this type of wastewater drugs opium derivatives reagents and solvents according to our results an effluent with such a quality have been almost completely treated so that the produced water has received the necessary standards for agricultural use from the environment organization of iran 4 conclusions a hybrid method consisting of three different components ecf h2o2 o3 gac treated has been used to treat opium wastewater initially detailed laboratory scale experiments were performed on opium wastewater based on the results of laboratory scale experiments the design and implementation of a semi industrial pilot plant have been carried out the purpose of creating such a system is to treat complex and persistent organic and inorganic pollutants of opium wastewater the results of cod color tds and tss removal efficiencies clearly show the efficiency of hybrid system ecf h2o2 o3 gac in both laboratory and semi industrial scales for the treatment of opium wastewater the main results of this study can be summarized as follows the combination of different methods leads to improving the flaws weaknesses of the individual processes enhancing the degradation rate removing the organic compounds and possibly reducing the operating costs of the integrated process the electrocoagulation flotation is an effective treatment process for opium wastewater treatment with a high amount of refractory persistent organics and intense color as a pre treatment stage this process reduces cod by more than 60 70 the combining of ecf and peroxone resulted in a 15 20 enhancement of removal efficiency than to the individual processes the contemporary presence of gac adsorption filter leads to further enhancement of the whole system efficiency obtaining a removal efficiency 20 25 higher than to the individual processes the output of ecf h2o2 o3 gac treating system is generally very satisfactory this system in both laboratory and semi industrial scales at 120 min operating time leads to a reduction of about 99 cod color tds and tss effluents from this method satisfy local discharge standards for cod and color parameters in general the most important advantages of this combination system include a no need for external addition of the chemicals

aerobic condition has also been found to be efficient for psb technology 18 despite the many valuable discoveries made by existed researches little information is known about the effects of carbon to nitrogen ratio c to n ratio of wastewater and light oxygen condition on psb protein production c to n ratio is a basic feature of wastewater and can significantly influences the microbial growth and physiological processes 19 when focusing on protein production the effect of carbon to nitrogen ratio may be more significant because nitrogen is an essential element in protein on the other hand light oxygen condition can determine the metabolism of psb and therefore affect the protein production although there are many studies about light oxygen conditions they have not focused on protein production the aim of this study is to explore the effects of wastewater c to n ratio and light oxygen condition on psb protein production this study analyzed psb protein productivity pollutants removal efficiency amino acid composition of psb protein and key enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase activity in different conditions this study can clarify the effects of c to n ratio and light oxygen condition on psb protein production and provide specific regulation strategies for practical implementation of psb protein recovery technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 psb mixed culture psb mixed culture was used to produce protein from non toxic wastewater in this study it was firstly isolated from a local pond and has been effectively applied in wastewater treatment 20 the psb culture was mainly composed of ectothiorhodospira and detailed composition on family level was displayed in the supplementary file the psb culture was sub cultured in a thermostat shaker with rotation rate of 120 rpm and temperature of 26 30 c when inoculated to wastewater the psb culture was in logarithmic growth phase 2 2 wastewater wastewater used in this study was artificial sugar wastewater sugar wastewater has been proven to be suitable for psb 21 the formula of synthetic sugar wastewater was as follows sucrose 2 6 g l 1 malic acid 1 6 g l 1 nahco3 1 0 g l 1 mgso4 7h2o 0 2 g l 1 kh2po4 0 4 g l 1 and nh4 2so4 nahco3 served as ph buffer carbon source was calculated in terms of cod the initial cod was around 4000 mg l 1 the c to n ratio of wastewater was adjusted by changing the dosage of nh4 2so4 c to n ratio was calculated as the ratio of cod concentration and total nitrogen concentration c to n ratios in each experiment group were set as 0 5 1 5 10 15 20 50 and 100 this c to n ratio gradient was determined based on existed literature 22 and could cover most c n range of wastewaters nh4 2so4 dosages in each experiment group were 37 7 18 9 3 8 1 9 1 3 0 94 0 38 and 0 19 g l 1 respectively naoh was used to adjust wastewater ph to around 7 0 before experiment wastewater was uv disinfected to eliminate the interference of other bacteria 2 3 experiment setup all experiments were conducted in batch flasks were used as psb photoreactors and the working volume was 400 ml with 20 v v inoculation three light oxygen conditions were set in this work including light anaerobic dark aerobic and light aerobic in each batch the hydraulic retention time hrt was set as 72 h in light anaerobic condition 9 experimental groups were set wastewater c to n ratio 0 5 1 5 10 15 20 50 100 this c n range could cover most of wastewater each batch was conducted at least twice to guarantee the repeatability fluorescent lamps were used for lighting light intensity 1500 2000 lx dissolved oxygen do was kept below 0 2 mg l 1 by sealing in dark aerobic condition 3 experimental groups were set wastewater c to n ratio 5 15 50 this c n range was chosen based on results under light anaerobic condition tinfoil was used for shading dissolved oxygen do was kept between 2 and 3 mg l by placing bioreactors onto a shaker rotate rate 100 rpm in light aerobic condition 3 experiment groups were set wastewater c to n ratio 5 15 50 lighting condition was the same as light anaerobic experimental groups while oxygen condition was the same as dark aerobic experimental groups 2 4 analysis method samples were collected from reactors at 0 24 48 and 72 h the concentration of psb biomass was detected by optical density at 660 nm using spectrophotometer tu1900 beijing purkinje general instrument co the same below protein concentration was detected by lowry method 23 using assay kits buying from beijing leagene biotechnology co ltd samples were centrifuged 11 000 rpm for 10 min afterwards to obtain supernatant for water quality parameter analysis nh4 n was detected according to nessler reagent spectrophotometry cod was detected by apha standard method the activity of glutamate dehydrogenase gdh and glutamine synthetase gs were measured at 12 and 60 h by spectrophotometry 24 determination kits from suzhou keming biotechnology co ltd were used to extract gdh and gs from psb cells the activity of gdh and gs were reported as the rate of ammonia assimilation and the unit was nmol nh4 min 1 mg 1 cell amino acids were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography thermo fisher u3000 psb samples at 72 h were firstly hydrolyzed by 6 mol l 1 hcl for 24 h at 110 c hydrolysate was derivatized with phenyl isothiocyanate pitc and filtered with 0 45 Î¼m filter membrane chromatographic conditions were as follows injection volume was 10 Î¼l the chromatographic column was a c18 column 250 mm 4 6 mm mobile phase a was 0 1 mol l 1 sodium acetate and acetonitrile 93 7 v v and mobile phase b was acetonitrile and ultrapure aqueous 4 1 v v the elution gradient is described in supplementary file flow rate was 1 0 ml min 1 column temperature was 36 c detection wavelength of ultraviolet detector was 254 nm 2 5 data processing protein productivity and protein yield n were used in following discussions protein productivity referred to the amount of protein produced per day protein yield n refers to the conversion rate of protein from nh4 n protein yield n was calculated by equation y c72 c0 n0 n72 where n0 denoted nh4 n concentration at 0 h and n72 denoted nh4 n concentration at 72 h three parallel determinations were conducted for each sample and the average values were used to report experimental results in each figure error bar represented the standard deviation 3 results and discussions 3 1 psb growth and protein production 3 1 1 light anaerobic condition the protein production performance of psb in light anaerobic condition was firstly investigated generally light anaerobic condition is more conducive to psb s growth 25 according to fig 1 the highest biomass production 1605 mg l 1 was achieved at 72 h when c n was 20 when c to n ratio was within the range of 5 to 50 psb protein production varied slightly 601 9 to 656 2 mg l 1 the protein production however dropped visibly when c to n ratio exceeded 50 or fell below 5 because of this the effective c to n ratio for psb protein production was 5 50 nevertheless psb could grow in all test groups showing a wide workable influent c to n ratio range literatures also showed that psb could effectively treat wastewater and produce biomass in extremely low or high c n condition 13 26 this can be attributed to psb s flexible nitrogen metabolism pathways including nitrogen fixation nitrification and denitrification 27 in order to make subsequent researches more convenient wastewaters with c to n ratio of 5 15 and 50 were chosen in following experiments among these wastewater with c n of 5 can represent wastewater with low c n such as piggery wastewater and poultry wastewater 28 wastewater with c to n ratio of 50 can represent wastewater with high c n like brewery wastewater 29 while c n of 15 is a desired c n for conventional biological wastewater treatment amino acid composition is an important determinant of protein product quality in order to explore the effects of c to n ratio on psb amino acid composition the content of 16 amino acids were detected fig 2 shows the amino acid composition of psb protein produced from low medium and high c n level wastewaters for human body there are eight essential amino acids i e lysine tryptophan phenylalanine methionine threonine isoleucine leucine and valine the produced psb protein contained seven essential amino acids and the proportion of essential amino acids in protein was 39 8 42 0 which could meet the requirements of food or feed 7 trials have also proven that psb can partially replace fishmeal in aquaculture 30 this showed a high application value of psb protein through comparison it was found that the content of lys arg and glu were slightly higher at low c n while the content of met and leu were slightly higher at high c n but in general the amino acid composition of psb protein kept stable under various c to n ratio levels indicating that the quality of protein product kept stable 3 1 2 aerobic conditions the performance of psb protein production in aerobic conditions dark aerobic and light aerobic is displayed and discussed in this section as shown in fig 3 a c n 15 was the optimal for biomass growth however as shown in fig 3 b c n 5 was the optimal condition for protein production the amount of protein produced by psb reached 430 2 mg l 1 in dark aerobic condition and 623 1 mg l 1 in light aerobic condition at 72 h the productivity of protein decreased with the increase of c n this might be because the nitrogen source is relatively abundant in wastewater with lower c n in terms of protein production light aerobic condition was better than dark aerobic condition related research also found that light aerobic condition was more favorable for psb growth and pollutants removal 18 however light aerobic condition needs extra capital and operative expenditures for lighting 3 2 comparison among different light oxygen conditions psb protein production performance in above experimental groups low medium and high c to n ratio in all three kinds of light oxygen conditions are summarized in fig 4 protein content characterizes protein abundance in psb cells higher protein content is desired since it is convenient for down stream process such as protein extraction and purification 20 according to fig 4 a evidently in all light oxygen conditions psb from wastewater with lower c to n ratio possessed higher protein content when c to n ratio was lower nitrogen source was relatively more sufficient this could preliminarily explain the trend of protein content similar results have also been reported that psb protein content was significantly boosted in slurry with extremely low c n 13 nevertheless from the perspective of downstream processing the concentration of protein was too low around 1 g l 1 and enrichment process might be required 31 protein productivity represents the rate of protein production and is closely related to economic profit of protein recovery the following part focuses on comparing and discussing protein productivity in different conditions which is shown in fig 4 b light oxygen conditions and c to n ratio had significant effects p value 0 05 on the protein productivity according to analysis of variance in table s2 in the supplementary file in aerobic conditions lower c to n ratio was more favorable for psb protein production in light anaerobic condition c n of 15 was the optimal for protein production but the difference in protein productivity from wastewater with different c to n ratios were relatively slight generally the c to n ratio of domestic wastewaters is around 10 32 this c to n ratio can provide favorable condition for psb protein recovery technology based on fig 4 b a light oxygen condition regulation strategy for psb protein production can be proposed for wastewaters whose c to n ratio was 5 the psb protein productivity in light anaerobic dark aerobic and light aerobic conditions were 101 4 143 4 and 207 7 mg l 1 d 1 respectively therefore for wastewater with low c to n ratios aerobic conditions should be chosen to achieve higher protein productivity similarly aerobic conditions should also be chosen for wastewater with medium c to n ratio on the other hand for wastewater whose c to n ratio was 50 the protein productivity under light anaerobic dark aerobic and light aerobic conditions were 102 1 67 7 and 59 6 mg l 1 d 1 respectively thus for wastewater with high c to n ratio light anaerobic condition should be chosen this strategy can be supported by other research papers for livestock breeding wastewater low c n and soybean wastewater medium c n aerobic conditions were better than light anaerobic conditions 25 33 while for white spirit wastewater high c n light anaerobic condition was better than aerobic conditions 34 in order to explain why light anaerobic condition is better for wastewater with high c to n ratio while aerobic conditions are better for wastewater with low and medium c to n ratio the protein yield n were calculated and presented in fig 4 c protein yield n reflects the conversion rate from ammonia nitrogen to protein it is obviously that protein yield n in light anaerobic condition was higher than that in aerobic conditions the nitrogen removal by psb had two pathways i assimilation into cell and ii oxidization to n2 n2o 27 in aerobic condition nitrogen was more likely to be oxidized to n2 n2o and nitrogen assimilated by psb was less therefore in anaerobic conditions psb were more able to adapt to relative scarcity of nitrogen namely high c to n ratio as a consequence for wastewater with high c to n ratio light anaerobic condition achieved better protein outcome on the contrast for wastewater with low c to n ratio nitrogen source is relatively sufficient and thus aerobic conditions were better because of higher metabolic rate and more atp production 35 36 3 3 key enzyme activity related to protein synthesis nh4 is incorporated into amino acid molecule under the catalysis of glutamate dehydrogenase gdh and glutamine synthetase gs to further synthesize various proteins as shown in fig 5 a Î± ketoglutarate nh 4 nadph gdh glutamic acid nadp h 2 o glutamic acid nh 4 atp gs glutamine adp pi h the activities of gdh and gs were tested to illuminate the effects of c to n ratio on psb s metabolic process and the results were shown in fig 5 b generally the activity of gdh and gs were higher when c n was lower the total rate of nh4 incorporated into amino acid molecule was consistent with the protein productivity this result implied that lower c to n ratio could induce the synthesis of gdh and gs this inference was supported by jacob and monod s study which found that lactose induced the synthesis of related enzyme 37 in addition the enzyme activities of gdh and gs were higher in aerobic conditions than that in anaerobic condition this is consistent with related research 38 which found oxygen could boost activity of hexokinase phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase of psb further the activities of gs were generally much higher than gdh this declared that the main pathway of nh4 assimilation was the synthesis of glutamine rather than the synthesis of glutamic acid this might be because the content of glutamic acid in psb was relatively higher as shown in fig 2 thus suppressing the activity of gdh comparison of gdh and gs activities at 12 h and 60 h showed that key enzymes activity declined sharply over time this was because psb were in the logarithmic phase at 12 h and had high activity while psb were in the stationary phase at 60 h and had poor activity it can be concluded that in a continuous mode psb reactor the cell retention time analogous to solid retention time for activated sludge technologies should be short in order to obtain more protein products 3 4 pollutants removal performance pollutants cod and nh4 n removal performances of psb were summarized in table 1 the cod and nh4 n removal performances were similar to previous studies 39 40 psb could quickly remove pollutants from wastewaters with different c to n ratios however the nh4 n removal efficiency was not satisfactory when the wastewater c n was low which was because the influent contained too much nh4 n in light anaerobic condition cod removal performance varied slightly similar to protein productivity while in aerobic conditions cod removal performance was better when influent c n was lower generally pollutants removal was better in aerobic conditions and this was consistent with aforementioned discussion about enzyme activities 4 conclusion this study investigated the effects of wastewater c to n ratio and light oxygen condition on psb protein production in detail psb had a wide tolerance range of c to n ratio c n in the range of 5 50 was suitable for psb protein production within this range amino acid composition remained stable lower c n was more conducive to protein production which might because lower c n induced the synthesis of gdh and gs for wastewater with low c n ratio dark aerobic or light aerobic treatment conditions should be used while for wastewater with high c n ratio light anaerobic treatment conditions should be used the results of this study can contribute to implementation of psb protein recovery technology

products that can be recovered from wastewater among these protein has high market demand and relatively high market price 1 10 kg for crude protein in addition protein production from wastewater may relieve the stress of protein supply scarcity worldwide and is of great research value 5 especially using photosynthetic bacteria psb to produce protein from wastewater has great potentials psb are a cluster of protein rich microorganisms with a wide range of metabolic capabilities 6 previous studies have demonstrated that psb can treat various wastewater in suitable light oxygen conditions including domestic sewage 7 agricultural wastewater 8 piggery wastewater 9 food processing wastewater 10 etc from these wastewaters psb can produce protein efficiently obtaining high protein content 40 80 and high protein productivity 100 200 mg l 1 d 1 moreover psb protein recovery technology has the advantages of flexible implementation and strong adaptability 11 these studies have drawn a sketchy route map of psb protein production from non toxic wastewater previous studies showed many factors can affect the growth of psb including temperature ph value chemical components of wastewater light oxygen condition and hydraulic retention time 12 these factors can be divided into objective factors and subjective factors operational parameters for objective factors carbon source in terms of bod or cod and nitrogen source are the most important influencing factors yang et al found that high nh4 n concentration could enhance protein production content 90 13 meng et al revealed efficient carbon and nitrogen source range for psb growth and established kinetic model 14 15 hÃ¼lsen et al compared psb protein productivity from various agri industrial wastewaters 8 alloul et al studied the effects of carbon source type different volatile fatty acids on psb protein production 16 for operational parameters light oxygen condition is the most important for psb psb can perform photosynthesis aerobic respiration and anaerobic fermentation and their metabolic pathways can change with habitat changes 17 generally light anaerobic and dark aerobic are classical light oxygen conditions for psb

related to protein synthesis nh4 is incorporated into amino acid molecule under the catalysis of glutamate dehydrogenase gdh and glutamine synthetase gs to further synthesize various proteins as shown

consistent with the protein productivity this result implied that lower c to n ratio could induce the synthesis of gdh and gs this inference was supported by jacob and monod s study which found that lactose induced the synthesis of related enzyme 37 in addition the enzyme activities of gdh and gs were higher in aerobic conditions than that in anaerobic condition this is consistent with related research 38 which found oxygen could boost activity of hexokinase phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase of psb further the activities of gs were generally much higher than gdh this declared that the main pathway of nh4 assimilation was the synthesis of glutamine rather than the synthesis of glutamic acid this might be because the content of glutamic acid in psb was relatively higher as shown in fig 2 thus suppressing the activity of gdh comparison of gdh and gs activities at 12 h and 60 h showed that key enzymes activity declined sharply over time this was because psb were in the logarithmic phase at 12 h and had high activity while psb were in the stationary phase at 60 h and had poor activity it can be concluded that in a continuous mode psb reactor the cell retention time analogous to solid retention time for activated sludge technologies should be short in order to obtain more protein products 3 4 pollutants removal performance pollutants cod and nh4 n removal performances of psb were summarized in table 1 the cod and nh4 n removal performances were similar to previous studies 39 40 psb could quickly remove pollutants from wastewaters with different c to n ratios however the nh4 n removal efficiency was not satisfactory when the wastewater c n was low which was because the influent contained too much nh4 n in light anaerobic condition cod removal performance varied slightly similar to protein productivity while in aerobic conditions cod removal performance was better when influent c n was lower generally pollutants removal was better in aerobic conditions and this was consistent with aforementioned discussion about enzyme activities 4 conclusion this study investigated the effects of wastewater c to n ratio and light oxygen condition on psb protein production in detail psb had a wide tolerance range of c to n ratio c n in the range of 5 50 was suitable for psb protein production within this range amino acid composition remained stable lower c n was more conducive to protein production which might because lower c n induced the synthesis of gdh and gs for wastewater with low c n ratio dark aerobic or light aerobic treatment conditions should be used while for wastewater with high c n ratio light anaerobic treatment conditions should be used the results of this study can contribute to implementation of psb protein recovery technology

eps supernatant coexisting na fe3 and low concentration of mg2 0 54 mmol l increased alkaline phosphatase activity and sludge surface roughness and reduced specific surface area of sludge furthermore these coexisting ions increased eps concentration but did not change main compositions and functional groups of eps graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords metal ions salty wastewater a2o process nitrogen and phosphorus removal flocculation 1 introduction a large amount of salty wastewater containing na mg2 and fe3 are generated in industrial production and human life such as petroleum refining textiles process and seawater flushing 1 2 fe based flocculants such as fe2 so4 3 are often used as pretreatment agents to remove suspended solid in the process of sewage treatment and magnesium salts such as mgcl2 are often used as chemical precipitants to treat high concentration phosphorous wastewater na is produced when the flushing sea water enters the sewage treatment plant these metal ions entering activated sludge system can affect microbial activity removal efficiencies of pollutants and sludge flocculation na can promote the oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh and contribute to the synthesis of atp mg2 can promote glycolysis respiration and oxidative phosphorylation and it is a cofactor of citrate lyase isocitrate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase 3 4 fe3 as necessary trace metal ion for microbial growth is a component of cells and an activator of enzyme activity chen et al 5 found that high concentration of nacl 10 g l affected microorganisms metabolism and inhibited the nitrification of oxic sludge wang et al 6 concluded that when nacl salinity increased from 0 5 to 6 removal efficiencies of cod and nh4 n decreased from 98 and 97 to 33 and 30 respectively and the activity of nitrifying bacteria was inhibited li et al 7 found that removal efficiency of cod kept at about 90 when mg2 concentration was 0 and 10 mg l and its removal efficiency was not directly related to mg2 concentration however jeong and bae 8 found that ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob activity gradually decreased with the increase of mg2 concentration when mg2 concentration increased from 7 5 g l to 10 g l aob activity decreased to 11 3 from 4 7 respectively hu et al 9 found that low concentration of fe3 2 mg l contributed to the increase of biofilm activity and removal efficiency of cod but high concentration of fe3 16 mg l inhibited biofilm activity and reduced removal efficiency of cod when a fixed bed biofilm reactor was used to treat synthetic wastewater these studies mainly analyzed the effect of single metal ion on microbial activity and removal efficiencies of pollutants however interaction mechanism among multiple metal ions pollutants and microorganisms is unknown the effects of multiple coexisting metal ions on biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal are still unclear and the change of microbial activity needs further research and exploration under the action of complex metal ions sludge flocculation is an important factor affecting effluent quality and it is closely related to composition of extracellular polymeric substances eps eps is a macromolecular metabolite secreted by microorganisms and mainly composed of proteins polysaccharides humic acids nucleic acids and lipids it presents a rheological double layer structure outside cell wall its outer layer and inner layer are loosely bound extracellular polymeric lb eps and tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances tb eps respectively metal cations can neutralize negative charges on the surface of bacteria reduce electrostatic repulsion between cells and affect the formation adsorption and flocculation of sludge flocs 10 12 many scholars had studied the effect of single metal ion on the eps and sludge flocculation cui et al 13 and aribi and nakhla 14 found that excessive na reduced the size of sludge flocs and increased the porosity of eps matrix na could replace mg2 absorbed in the eps which destructed bridging action between divalent cations and eps and resulted in sludge deflocculation zhang et al 15 found that mg2 interacted with negatively charged eps to form a bridge which allowed cells to adhere to each other and thus promoted flocculation ifelebuegu and ojo 16 found that fe3 bridged between eps and tightly combined microbial cells which improved biological flocculation however li et al 17 believed that interaction between fe3 and eps could weaken the ability of sludge particles to form larger aggregates in summary these studies proved bridging action of one two kinds of metal ions between sludge floc and eps however the changes of sludge structure and properties were hardly studied under the coexisting of multiple metal ions the influencing mechanism of coexisting multiple metal ions on the eps and sludge flocculation was still unclear this study explored the effects of coexisting na mg2 and fe3 on removal efficiencies of cod tn and tp using a2o process and analyzed the distribution of alkaline phosphatase in the supernatant lb eps tb eps and pellet three dimension excitation emission matrix 3d eem and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir were used to investigate the change of structure and composition of eps scanning electron microscopy x ray energy dispersive analysis sem eds and specific surface area analyzer were used to illuminate the changes of sludge microstructure and elements the effect of multiple metal ions on sludge flocculation were clarified and their influencing mechanism on biological removal of nitrogen and phosphorus and microbial activity of sludge was revealed 2 materials and methods 2 1 a lab scale setup the inoculated activated sludge was taken from jilin city sewage treatment plant located in jilin city china a2o reactor was made of plexiglas with an effective volume of 48 l and its schematic diagram was shown in fig 1 effective volume of anaerobic zone anoxic zone and oxic zone was 12 12 and 24 l respectively and effective volume of vertical flow secondary sedimentation tank was 5 l the inside of the reactor was operated in a baffle mode the peristaltic pump was used to control a sludge return ratio of 70 and a nitrification liquid return ratio of 200 respectively the hrt was 8 h and the ph was 7 2 7 6 mixed liquid suspended solids mlss was 3000 4000 mg l after the reactor was operated stably na concentration was controlled at 0 5 g l and molar ratios of mg2 fe3 were adjusted at 3 5 and 7 respectively corresponding fe3 concentration was 0 18 mmol l and mg2 concentration was 0 54 0 9 and 1 26 mmol l respectively artificially simulated urban sewage was used and its main components were ch3coona 0 714 g l nh4cl 0 257 g l kh2po4 0 051 g l and cacl2 0 010 g l in addition to nacl fecl3 6h2o and mgso4 7h2o 2 2 analysis methods cod tn and tp were tested by multi parameter water quality meter 5b 3b v8 lanzhou lianhua environmental protection technology co ltd china the ph was detected using a mettler toledo ph meter five easy mettler toledo china eps was extracted by heat treatment method 18 pn and ps were determined by coomassie brilliant blue method and anthrone sulfuric acid method respectively 19 the components of eps were analyzed by 3d eem rf 6000 shimadzu corporation japan and their groups structure was detected by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is20 thermo fisher usa zeta potential was measured with a micro electrophoresis meter js94h2 shanghai zhongchen digital technology equipment co ltd china sludge contact angle was measured using contact angle meter sz camb1 shanghai xuanzhun instrument co ltd china and sludge flocculation was described by flocculation ability fa 20 specific surface area pore volume and pore diameter of sludge were measured by automatic specific surface area and micropore analyzer asap 2020m micro meritics company usa brunauer emmett telle bet method was used to calculate specific surface area of sludge and barrett joyner hallender bjh method was used to calculate pore diameter of sludge surface morphology and main elements of sludge were determined by sem eds jsm 6390a jeol company japan alkaline phosphatase was determined as follows 21 firstly sludge mixture was diluted from 2 ml to 8 ml with tris hcl ph 8 0 and then treated by ultrasound for 1 min secondly 2 ml of pnpp solution 0 1 was added into mixed solution and then heated in a water bath at 37 c for 1 h after complete mixture thirdly 2 ml of naoh solution 1 mol l was added to terminate the reaction at last the mixed solution was centrifuged at 3000 r min for 10 min and the supernatant absorbance was measured by an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer under 410 nm wavelength 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of na mg2 and fe3 on removal efficiencies of the pollutants the effects of na mg2 and fe3 on removal efficiencies of cod tn and tp are shown in fig 2 in the early operation stage 0 24 d removal efficiencies of cod tn and tp were stabilized at 93 84 and 87 respectively when metal ions were not added when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 3 removal efficiencies of cod tn and tp increased to 95 89 and 90 respectively under 0 5 g l of na concentration the coexisting na mg2 and fe3 promoted removal of cod tn and tp the respiration function of microorganisms was strengthened to adapt to new environment containing multiple metal ions low concentration of na promoted microbial respiration and mg2 played an important activator role on the synthesis of protein and nucleic acid 22 23 fe3 participated in the storage and transportation of molecular oxygen the reduction of ribonucleotides and electron transfer of microorganisms 24 when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 5 removal efficiencies of cod tn and tp showed a downward trend and dropped to 91 80 and 84 respectively furthermore when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 increased to 7 removal efficiencies of cod tn and tp continued to decrease to 88 75 and 77 respectively although mg2 was an inorganic salt necessary for the growth of microorganisms and it could stimulate the enzyme reaction related to the cell synthesis 15 the biological activity of the sludge decreased with the accumulation of mg2 fig 3 when mg2 concentration was too high it could significantly reduce the microbial respiration rate and some microorganisms died because they did not adapt to new environment 25 mg2 concentration exceeded the maximum demand of microorganisms after it was accumulated to a certain concentration the metal ions entering the microbial cell interacted with functional groups to change the cell structure and function 26 therefore high concentration of mg2 had a negative effect on the degradation of cod tn and tp alkaline phosphatase is a unique extracellular hydrolase removing phosphate groups of substrate by hydrolyzing phosphate monoesters the effects of na mg2 and fe3 on the distribution of alkaline phosphatase are shown in fig 3 distribution rule of alkaline phosphatase in anaerobic zone anoxic zone and oxic zone was always pellet tb eps lb eps supernatant regardless of metal ion concentration anupama et al 21 found that most of phosphatase was present in the pellet and phosphatase in the eps and supernatant represented about 30 of total phosphatase under 0 5 g l of na concentration alkaline phosphatases in the supernatant lb eps tb eps and pellet of anaerobic zone increased from 1 5 Î¼mol l h 10 56 Î¼mol l h 14 63 Î¼mol l h and 198 69 Î¼mol l h to 3 06 Î¼mol l h 17 44 Î¼mol l h 37 13 Î¼mol l h and 231 50 Î¼mol l h respectively when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 improved to 3 compared with no addition of metal ions the surface of microbial cells were negatively charged and metal ions were positively charged therefore low concentration of positively charged metal ions could neutralized negative charges on the surface of microorganisms which decreased the potential energy of the cell surface organic matter could freely enter the microbial cells under less charges 27 alkaline phosphatase could effectively perform hydrolysis which was beneficial to the pollutants degradation however when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 increased to 7 from 3 mg2 concentration was high and excessive cations were adsorbed on the surface of microorganisms which affected entry of organic matter into microbial cells and prevented alkaline phosphatase from hydrolyzing organic molecules and thus alkaline phosphatase in the supernatant lb eps tb eps and pellet of anaerobic zone declined to 0 56 Î¼mol l h 4 94 Î¼mol l h 8 06 Î¼mol l h and 109 31 Î¼mol l h from 1 19 Î¼mol l h 6 81 Î¼mol l h 10 56 Î¼mol l h and 193 06 Î¼mol l h respectively 3 2 the effects of na mg2 and fe3 on the eps and sludge flocculation 3 2 1 eps composition the effects of na mg2 and fe3 on the eps pn and ps are shown in fig 4 when na mg2 and fe3 were not added lb eps was 24 44 mg l 30 17 mg l and 25 09 mg l and tb eps was 28 28 mg l 33 47 mg l and 32 89 mg l in anaerobic zone anoxic zone and oxic zone respectively when na concentration was 0 5 g l and mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 3 lb eps increased to 37 61 mg l 42 20 mg l and 38 37 mg l and tb eps increased to 59 46 mg l 67 05 mg l and 64 44 mg l in anaerobic zone anoxic zone and oxic zone respectively pn and ps in lb eps and tb eps improved accordingly the addition of na mg2 and fe3 led to an increase of ion concentration difference between inside and outside of cells microorganisms could balance intracellular osmotic pressure through cell membranes secrete a large amount of extracellular substances such as pn and ps to adapt to the change of external environment and maintain normal metabolism 28 29 pn and ps contained anionic functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxyl and provided more binding sites for na mg2 and fe3 metal ions could effectively neutralize negative charges on the surface of sludge 30 31 when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 7 lb eps increased to 54 43 mg l 57 55 mg l and 55 91 mg l and tb eps increased to 79 39 mg l 90 34 mg l and 88 25 mg l in anaerobic zone anoxic zone and oxic zone respectively when the microorganisms were under stress environmental condition some cells could not adapt to the increase of metal ion concentration leading to the loss of metabolic activity the release of intracellular components and separation of plasmoids 32 33 removal efficiencies of the pollutants reduced with the increase of mole ratio of mg2 fe3 studies had found that high cation concentration might weaken internal bridge of the polymer and more eps was released into the environment 34 eps were closely related to sludge flocculation and the increase of eps could destroy the structure of sludge flocs destabilize sludge flocs and decrease sludge flocculation 35 36 the increase of mg2 concentration promoted the production of eps while excessive eps hindered substrate transportation and reduced mass transfer efficiency resulting in the reduction of cod tn and tp removal efficiencies and poor flocculation 37 it could be seen from figs 4 and 6 that lb eps and tb eps increased and fa decreased as the molar ratio of mg2 fe3 improved 3d eem of lb eps and tb eps in anaerobic sludge anoxic sludge and oxic sludge is shown in fig s1 under different concentration of na mg2 and fe3 the fluorescent parts of lb eps and tb eps were mainly visible region tyrosine like peak a 270 290 nm 300 325 nm and aromatic protein peak b 220 230 nm 330 350 nm in anaerobic zone coexisting na mg2 and fe3 resulted in blue shift of visible region tyrosine like peak a in the lb eps by 10 nm to em axis when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 3 under 0 5 g l of na concentration compared with no addition of metal ions this blue shift was related to the decrease of aromatic rings and conjugated bonds as well as the disappearance of special functional groups such as carbonyl hydroxyl and amino 38 when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 7 high concentration of mg2 resulted in blue shift of visible region tyrosine like peak a in the tb eps by 20 nm to em axis in anoxic zone the position of fluorescence peaks in the lb eps and tb eps remained unchanged when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 3 under 0 5 g l of na however visible region tyrosine like peak a in the tb eps was blue shifted by 10 nm to em axis when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 7 in oxic zone when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 3 and 7 visible region tyrosine like peak a in the tb eps was blue shifted 20 nm to em axis furthermore when the concentration of na remained unchanged and the molar ratio of mg2 fe3 increased there was a tendency to form humic acid ex em 330 370 420 460 nm in lb eps humic acid was difficult to be utilized by microorganisms and it could bind to the active center of the enzyme thereby inhibiting enzyme activity 39 the inhibition of enzyme activity could be shielded because metal ions and humic acid combined in the form of equivalent cation exchange the equivalent ion exchange capacity was directly proportional to the atomic number 40 41 combining fig 3 and fig s1 the increase of mg2 concentration had no obvious promotion effect on the enzyme activity because mg2 had a low atomic number and a weak shielding effect on humic acid 3 2 2 eps structure fig 5 shows ftir spectra of lb eps and tb eps in anaerobic sludge anoxic sludge and oxic sludge under different concentration of na mg2 and fe3 absorption peaks of lb eps and tb eps in anaerobic sludge anoxic sludge and oxic sludge were similar and their position did not change significantly regardless of metal ions concentration main groups were always hydroxyl amide i and coc and absorption peaks appeared at 3417 cm 1 1635 1658 cm 1 and 1074 1100 cm 1 respectively the broad absorption peak near 3414 cm 1 was formed by stretching vibration of hydroxyl group oh in carbohydrates and amino nh of protein 42 absorption peak at 1635 1658 cm 1 was amide i which belonged to co stretching vibration of Î² sheets in secondary structure of protein 43 absorption peak near 1074 1100 cm 1 was caused by coc stretching vibration which belonged to the structure of polysaccharide 44 in addition absorption peak near 1400 cm 1 was caused by co stretching vibration of carboxyl and oh deformation vibration of alcohol and phenol 45 the area with wavelength 1000 cm 1 was fingerprint area and characteristic peaks were mostly emitted by unsaturated bonds containing sulfur and phosphorus the addition of na mg2 and fe3 did not affect main group types of eps and their main components were always protein and polysaccharides however the peak intensity of hydroxyl amide i and coc in lb eps and tb eps in each zone improved with the increase of na mg2 and fe3 concentration further indicating that the addition of metal ions promoted the secretion of more pn and ps fig 4 3 2 3 sludge flocculation the effects of na mg2 and fe3 on sludge flocculation are shown in fig 6 at the initial operation stage sludge flocs were stable and sludge flocculation was good in different zone when metal ions were not added under 0 5 g l of na concentration zeta potential of anaerobic zone anoxic zone and oxic zone increased to 45 32 mv 42 75 mv and 43 54 mv from 49 38 mv 48 97 mv and 51 42 mv respectively when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 3 furthermore fa increased to 43 28 44 64 and 43 18 from 36 25 38 33 and 34 32 and contact angle increased to 74 77 and 73 from 67 72 and 66 respectively the addition of multiple metal ions neutralized the negative charges on the surface of the microorganisms increased the zeta potential and promoted the interaction between cells these negatively charged functional groups such as carboxyl groups could squeeze the loose structure of sludge through electrostatic interaction with na mg2 and fe3 enhanced the van der waals force between cells and enhanced the sludge flocculation 46 however when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 7 zeta potential of anaerobic zone anoxic zone and oxic zone dropped to 57 64 mv 53 38 mv and 60 02 mv respectively competition and rejection among metal cations were produced with the increase of molar ratio of mg2 fe3 the theory of compressed electric double layer believed that electrostatic repulsion between the metal ions increased when absolute value of zeta potential improved which hindered the flocculation of sludge 47 at this time the fa in the anaerobic zone anoxic zone and oxic zone decreased to 29 88 30 10 and 27 59 respectively and the contact angle declined to 61 63 and 60 respectively the affinity between cells was reduced resulting in loose sludge flocs and poor sludge flocculation 48 3 3 the effects of na mg2 and fe3 on the sludge structure 3 3 1 sludge specific surface area n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of sludge are shown in fig 7 the isotherms of sludge exhibited an anti s type and its isotherms were close to that of the type iv isotherm in international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac classification under different concentration of metal ions the curve increased slowly when p p 0 was low which indicated that there was less microporous structure in the sludge however when relative pressure p p 0 was in the range of 0 9 1 sludge isotherm in each zone rose sharply and n2 adsorption capacity increased significantly which indicated that the sludge contained macroporous structure and adsorption capacity of sludge increased the changes of specific surface area pore volume and pore diameter of sludge are shown in table 1 when metal ions were not added specific surface area of sludge in anaerobic zone anoxic zone and oxic zone was 13 56 m2 g 15 80 m2 g and 23 91 m2 g and total pore volume was 0 030 cm3 g 0 035 cm3 g and 0 040 cm3 g respectively under 0 5 g l of na concentration specific surface area of sludge in anaerobic zone anoxic zone and oxic zone decreased to 5 26 m2 g 5 36 m2 g and 11 21 m2 g and total pore volume reduced to 0 016 cm3 g 0 020 cm3 g and 0 033 cm3 g respectively when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 3 the addition of na mg and fe3 reduced specific surface area and total pore volume of sludge because of the combination of p and adsorption sites containing fe3 on the surface of sludge qiu et al 49 also showed that specific surface area of sludge after adsorbing phosphorus reduced by 48 2 however average pore size of sludge in anaerobic zone anoxic zone and oxic zone increased from 8 73 nm 8 91 nm and 8 33 nm to 12 52 nm 14 99 nm and 11 65 nm this might be due to gradual filling of small pores and gradual increase of large pores during adsorption process when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 7 specific surface area of anaerobic sludge anoxic sludge and oxic sludge increased to 12 57 m2 g 11 82 m2 g and 15 24 m2 g and total pore volume increased to 0 028 cm3 g 0 032 cm3 g and 0 037 cm3 g respectively however average pore diameter decreased to 10 39 nm 10 70 nm and 11 30 nm this might be because more metal ions reacted with the pollutants to form metal precipitates loaded on the surface of the sludge which blocked the pore structure of sludge and reduced average pore size of sludge 24 3 3 2 sludge surface morphology and element composition sem images of anaerobic sludge anoxic sludge and oxic sludge are shown in fig 8 when metal ions were not added sludge surface was rough and its structure was irregular under 0 5 g l of na sludge surface contained a lot of uneven structure when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 3 the addition of na mg2 and fe3 resulted in the aggregation of small particles into large and dense flocs which increased surface roughness and adsorption sites of sludge and improved removal efficiencies of nitrogen and phosphorus multiple coexisting metal ions promoted biological flocculation and changed sludge microstructure when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 7 sludge surface became smooth and sludge structure was loose internal pores of sludge became larger and sludge flocs were destroyed this might be because bridging action between mg2 and sludge decreased the compactness of sludge flocs 50 the distribution of na mg and fe elements in anaerobic anoxic and oxic sludge mapping are shown in fig s2 when metal ions were not added the signal of na mg and fe in the sludge was weak under 0 5 g l of na concentration the signal of na mg and fe in anaerobic anoxic and oxic sludge increased and thus their content improved when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 3 the increase of metal cations content neutralized negative charges on the surface of microorganisms which was conducive to the improvement of removal efficiencies of nitrogen and phosphorus and the increase of biological flocculation when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 7 elemental signal of na mg and fe in anaerobic anoxic and oxic sludge continued to increase these elements were adsorbed and accumulated in the sludge and thus their content increased however excessive metal ions increased extracellular osmotic pressure separated cytoplasmic wall and decreased flocculation of sludge 4 conclusions 1 low concentration of na mg2 and fe3 promoted the removal of cod tn and tp and enhanced sludge flocculation high concentration of mg2 led to the decrease of sludge flocculation and removal efficiencies of nitrogen and phosphorus under constant concentration of na and fe3 2 the distribution rule of alkaline phosphatases in anaerobic zone anoxic zone and oxic zone was always ranked as pellet tb eps lb eps supernatant high concentration of mg2 inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity under constant concentration of na and fe3 3 multiple coexisting metal ions increased eps content an appropriate concentration of eps promoted biological flocculation while excessive eps was not conducive to bioflocculation the addition of na mg2 and fe3 did not change the composition and functional groups of lb eps and tb eps and main groups were always hydroxyl amide i and coc however the coexisting na mg2 and fe3 changed the sludge microstructure high concentration of mg2 increased specific surface area of sludge under constant concentration of na and fe3 credit

under the coexisting of multiple metal ions the influencing mechanism of coexisting multiple metal ions on the eps and sludge flocculation was still unclear this study explored the effects of coexisting na mg2 and fe3 on removal efficiencies of cod tn and tp using a2o process and analyzed the distribution of alkaline phosphatase in the supernatant lb eps tb eps and pellet three dimension excitation emission matrix 3d eem and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir were used to investigate the change of structure and composition of eps scanning electron microscopy x ray energy

activated sludge was taken from jilin city sewage treatment plant located in jilin city china a2o reactor was made of plexiglas with an effective volume of 48 l and its schematic diagram was shown in

was operated in a baffle mode the peristaltic pump was used to control a sludge return ratio of 70 and a nitrification liquid return ratio of 200 respectively the hrt was 8 h and the ph was 7 2 7 6 mixed liquid suspended solids mlss was 3000 4000 mg l after the reactor was operated stably na concentration was controlled at 0 5 g l and molar ratios of mg2 fe3 were adjusted at 3 5 and 7 respectively corresponding fe3 concentration was 0 18 mmol l and mg2 concentration was 0 54 0 9 and 1 26 mmol l respectively artificially simulated urban sewage was used and its main components were ch3coona 0 714 g l nh4cl 0 257 g l kh2po4 0 051 g l and cacl2 0 010 g l in addition to nacl fecl3 6h2o and mgso4 7h2o 2 2 analysis methods cod tn and tp were tested by multi parameter water quality meter 5b 3b v8 lanzhou lianhua environmental protection technology co ltd china the ph was detected using a mettler toledo ph meter five easy mettler toledo china eps was extracted by heat treatment method 18 pn and ps were determined by coomassie brilliant blue method and anthrone sulfuric acid method respectively 19 the components of eps were analyzed by 3d eem rf 6000 shimadzu corporation japan and their groups structure was detected by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is20 thermo fisher usa zeta potential was measured with a micro electrophoresis meter js94h2 shanghai zhongchen digital technology equipment co ltd china sludge contact angle was measured using contact angle meter sz camb1 shanghai xuanzhun instrument co ltd china and sludge flocculation was described by flocculation ability fa 20 specific surface area pore volume and pore diameter of sludge were measured by automatic specific surface area and micropore analyzer asap 2020m micro meritics company usa brunauer emmett telle bet method was used to calculate specific surface area of sludge and barrett joyner hallender bjh method was used to calculate pore diameter of sludge surface morphology and main elements of sludge were determined by sem eds jsm 6390a jeol company japan alkaline phosphatase was determined as follows 21 firstly sludge mixture was diluted from 2 ml to 8 ml with tris hcl ph 8 0 and then treated by ultrasound for 1 min secondly 2 ml of pnpp solution 0 1 was added into mixed solution and then heated in a water bath at 37 c for 1 h after complete mixture thirdly 2 ml of naoh solution 1 mol l was added to terminate the reaction at last the mixed solution was centrifuged at 3000 r min for 10 min and the supernatant absorbance was measured by an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer under 410 nm wavelength 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of na mg2 and fe3 on removal efficiencies of the pollutants the effects of na mg2 and fe3 on removal efficiencies of cod tn and tp are shown in fig 2 in the early operation stage 0 24 d removal efficiencies of cod tn and tp were stabilized at 93 84 and 87 respectively when metal ions were not added when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 3 removal efficiencies of cod tn and tp increased to 95 89 and 90 respectively under 0 5 g l of na concentration the coexisting na mg2 and fe3 promoted removal of cod tn and tp the respiration function of microorganisms was strengthened to adapt to new environment containing multiple metal ions low concentration of na promoted microbial respiration and mg2 played an important activator role on the synthesis of protein and nucleic acid 22 23 fe3 participated in the storage and transportation of molecular oxygen the reduction of ribonucleotides and electron transfer of microorganisms 24 when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 5 removal efficiencies of cod tn and tp showed a downward trend and dropped to 91 80 and 84 respectively furthermore when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 increased to 7 removal efficiencies of cod tn and tp continued to decrease to 88 75 and 77 respectively although mg2 was an inorganic salt necessary for the growth of microorganisms and it could stimulate the enzyme reaction related to the cell synthesis 15 the biological activity of the sludge decreased with the accumulation of mg2 fig 3 when mg2 concentration was too high it could significantly reduce the microbial respiration rate and some microorganisms died because they did not adapt to new environment 25 mg2 concentration exceeded the maximum demand of microorganisms after it was accumulated to a certain concentration the metal ions entering the microbial cell interacted with functional groups to change the cell structure and function 26 therefore high concentration of mg2 had a negative effect on the degradation of cod tn and tp alkaline phosphatase is a unique extracellular hydrolase removing phosphate groups of substrate by hydrolyzing phosphate monoesters the effects of na mg2 and fe3 on the distribution of alkaline phosphatase are shown in fig 3 distribution rule of alkaline phosphatase in anaerobic zone anoxic zone and oxic zone was always pellet tb eps lb eps supernatant regardless of metal ion concentration anupama et al 21 found that most of phosphatase was present in the pellet and phosphatase in the eps and supernatant represented about 30 of total phosphatase under 0 5 g l of na concentration alkaline phosphatases in the supernatant lb eps tb eps and pellet of anaerobic zone increased from 1 5 Î¼mol l h 10 56 Î¼mol l h 14 63 Î¼mol l h and 198 69 Î¼mol l h to 3 06 Î¼mol l h 17 44 Î¼mol l h 37 13 Î¼mol l h and 231 50 Î¼mol l h respectively when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 improved to 3 compared with no addition of metal ions the surface of microbial cells were negatively charged and metal ions were positively charged therefore low concentration of positively charged metal ions could neutralized negative charges on the surface of microorganisms which decreased the potential energy of the cell surface organic matter could freely enter the microbial cells under less charges 27 alkaline phosphatase could effectively perform hydrolysis which was beneficial to the pollutants degradation however when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 increased to 7 from 3 mg2 concentration was high and excessive cations were adsorbed on the surface of microorganisms which affected entry of organic matter into microbial cells and prevented alkaline phosphatase from hydrolyzing organic molecules and thus alkaline phosphatase in the supernatant lb eps tb eps and pellet of anaerobic zone declined to 0 56 Î¼mol l h 4 94 Î¼mol l h 8 06 Î¼mol l h and 109 31 Î¼mol l h from 1 19 Î¼mol l h 6 81 Î¼mol l h 10 56 Î¼mol l h and 193 06 Î¼mol l h respectively 3 2 the effects of na mg2 and fe3 on the eps and sludge flocculation 3 2 1 eps composition the effects of na mg2 and fe3 on the eps pn and ps are shown in fig 4 when na mg2 and fe3 were not added lb eps was 24 44 mg l 30 17 mg l and 25 09 mg l and tb eps was 28 28 mg l 33 47 mg l and 32 89 mg l in anaerobic zone anoxic zone and oxic zone respectively when na concentration was 0 5 g l and mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 3 lb eps increased to 37 61 mg l 42 20 mg l and 38 37 mg l and tb eps increased to 59 46 mg l 67 05 mg l and 64 44 mg l in anaerobic zone anoxic zone and oxic zone respectively pn and ps in lb eps and tb eps improved accordingly the addition of na mg2 and fe3 led to an increase of ion concentration difference between inside and outside of cells microorganisms could balance intracellular osmotic pressure through cell membranes secrete a large amount of extracellular substances such as pn and ps to adapt to the change of external environment and maintain normal metabolism 28 29 pn and ps contained anionic functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxyl and provided more binding sites for na mg2 and fe3 metal ions could effectively neutralize negative charges on the surface of sludge 30 31 when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 7 lb eps increased to 54 43 mg l 57 55 mg l and 55 91 mg l and tb eps increased to 79 39 mg l 90 34 mg l and 88 25 mg l in anaerobic zone anoxic zone and oxic zone respectively when the microorganisms were under stress environmental condition some cells could not adapt to the increase of metal ion concentration leading to the loss of metabolic activity the release of intracellular components and separation of plasmoids 32 33 removal efficiencies of the pollutants reduced with the increase of mole ratio of mg2 fe3 studies had found that high cation concentration might weaken internal bridge of the polymer and more eps was released into the environment 34 eps were closely related to sludge flocculation and the increase of eps could destroy the structure of sludge flocs destabilize sludge flocs and decrease sludge flocculation 35 36 the increase of mg2 concentration promoted the production of eps while excessive eps hindered substrate transportation and reduced mass transfer efficiency resulting in the reduction of cod tn and tp removal efficiencies and poor flocculation 37 it could be seen from figs 4 and 6 that lb eps and tb eps increased and fa decreased as the molar ratio of mg2 fe3 improved 3d eem of lb eps and tb eps in anaerobic sludge anoxic sludge and oxic sludge is shown in fig s1 under different concentration of na mg2 and fe3 the fluorescent parts of lb eps and tb eps were mainly visible region tyrosine like peak a 270 290 nm 300 325 nm and aromatic protein peak b 220 230 nm 330 350 nm in anaerobic zone coexisting na mg2 and fe3 resulted in blue shift of visible region tyrosine like peak a in the lb eps by 10 nm to em axis when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 3 under 0 5 g l of na concentration compared with no addition of metal ions this blue shift was related to the decrease of aromatic rings and conjugated bonds as well as the disappearance of special functional groups such as carbonyl hydroxyl and amino 38 when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 7 high concentration of mg2 resulted in blue shift of visible region tyrosine like peak a in the tb eps by 20 nm to em axis in anoxic zone the position of fluorescence peaks in the lb eps and tb eps remained unchanged when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 3 under 0 5 g l of na however visible region tyrosine like peak a in the tb eps was blue shifted by 10 nm to em axis when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 7 in oxic zone when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 3 and 7 visible region tyrosine like peak a in the tb eps was blue shifted 20 nm to em axis furthermore when the concentration of na remained unchanged and the molar ratio of mg2 fe3 increased there was a tendency to form humic acid ex em 330 370 420 460 nm in lb eps humic acid was difficult to be utilized by microorganisms and it could bind to the active center of the enzyme thereby inhibiting enzyme activity 39 the inhibition of enzyme activity could be shielded because metal ions and humic acid combined in the form of equivalent cation exchange the equivalent ion exchange capacity was directly proportional to the atomic number 40 41 combining fig 3 and fig s1 the increase of mg2 concentration had no obvious promotion effect on the enzyme activity because mg2 had a low atomic number and a weak shielding effect on humic acid 3 2 2 eps structure fig 5 shows ftir spectra of lb eps and tb eps in anaerobic sludge anoxic sludge and oxic sludge under different concentration of na mg2 and fe3 absorption peaks of lb eps and tb eps in anaerobic sludge anoxic sludge and oxic sludge were similar and their position did not change significantly regardless of metal ions concentration main groups were always hydroxyl amide i and coc and absorption peaks appeared at 3417 cm 1 1635 1658 cm 1 and 1074 1100 cm 1 respectively the broad absorption peak near 3414 cm 1 was formed by stretching vibration of hydroxyl group oh in carbohydrates and amino nh of protein 42 absorption peak at 1635 1658 cm 1 was amide i which belonged to co stretching vibration of Î² sheets in secondary structure of protein 43 absorption peak near 1074 1100 cm 1 was caused by coc stretching vibration which belonged to the structure of polysaccharide 44 in addition absorption peak near 1400 cm 1 was caused by co stretching vibration of carboxyl and oh deformation vibration of alcohol and phenol 45 the area with wavelength 1000 cm 1 was fingerprint area and characteristic peaks were mostly emitted by unsaturated bonds containing sulfur and phosphorus the addition of na mg2 and fe3 did not affect main group types of eps and their main components were always protein and polysaccharides however the peak intensity of hydroxyl amide i and coc in lb eps and tb eps in each zone improved with the increase of na mg2 and fe3 concentration further indicating that the addition of metal ions promoted the secretion of more pn and ps fig 4 3 2 3 sludge flocculation the effects of na mg2 and fe3 on sludge flocculation are shown in fig 6 at the initial operation stage sludge flocs were stable and sludge flocculation was good in different zone when metal ions were not added under 0 5 g l of na concentration zeta potential of anaerobic zone anoxic zone and oxic zone increased to 45 32 mv 42 75 mv and 43 54 mv from 49 38 mv 48 97 mv and 51 42 mv respectively when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 3 furthermore fa increased to 43 28 44 64 and 43 18 from 36 25 38 33 and 34 32 and contact angle increased to 74 77 and 73 from 67 72 and 66 respectively the addition of multiple metal ions neutralized the negative charges on the surface of the microorganisms increased the zeta potential and promoted the interaction between cells these negatively charged functional groups such as carboxyl groups could squeeze the loose structure of sludge through electrostatic interaction with na mg2 and fe3 enhanced the van der waals force between cells and enhanced the sludge flocculation 46 however when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 7 zeta potential of anaerobic zone anoxic zone and oxic zone dropped to 57 64 mv 53 38 mv and 60 02 mv respectively competition and rejection among metal cations were produced with the increase of molar ratio of mg2 fe3 the theory of compressed electric double layer believed that electrostatic repulsion between the metal ions increased when absolute value of zeta potential improved which hindered the flocculation of sludge 47 at this time the fa in the anaerobic zone anoxic zone and oxic zone decreased to 29 88 30 10 and 27 59 respectively and the contact angle declined to 61 63 and 60 respectively the affinity between cells was reduced resulting in loose sludge flocs and poor sludge flocculation 48 3 3 the effects of na mg2 and fe3 on the sludge structure 3 3 1 sludge specific surface area n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of sludge are shown in fig 7 the isotherms of sludge exhibited an anti s type and its isotherms were close to that of the type iv isotherm in international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac classification under different concentration of metal ions the curve increased slowly when p p 0 was low which indicated that there was less microporous structure in the sludge however when relative pressure p p 0 was in the range of 0 9 1 sludge isotherm in each zone rose sharply and n2 adsorption capacity increased significantly which indicated that the sludge contained macroporous structure and adsorption capacity of sludge increased the changes of specific surface area pore volume and pore diameter of sludge are shown in table 1 when metal ions were not added specific surface area of sludge in anaerobic zone anoxic zone and oxic zone was 13 56 m2 g 15 80 m2 g and 23 91 m2 g and total pore volume was 0 030 cm3 g 0 035 cm3 g and 0 040 cm3 g respectively under 0 5 g l of na concentration specific surface area of sludge in anaerobic zone anoxic zone and oxic zone decreased to 5 26 m2 g 5 36 m2 g and 11 21 m2 g and total pore volume reduced to 0 016 cm3 g 0 020 cm3 g and 0 033 cm3 g respectively when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 3 the addition of na mg and fe3 reduced specific surface area and total pore volume of sludge because of the combination of p and adsorption sites containing fe3 on the surface of sludge qiu et al 49 also showed that specific surface area of sludge after adsorbing phosphorus reduced by 48 2 however average pore size of sludge in anaerobic zone anoxic zone and oxic zone increased from 8 73 nm 8 91 nm and 8 33 nm to 12 52 nm 14 99 nm and 11 65 nm this might be due to gradual filling of small pores and gradual increase of large pores during adsorption process when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 7 specific surface area of anaerobic sludge anoxic sludge and oxic sludge increased to 12 57 m2 g 11 82 m2 g and 15 24 m2 g and total pore volume increased to 0 028 cm3 g 0 032 cm3 g and 0 037 cm3 g respectively however average pore diameter decreased to 10 39 nm 10 70 nm and 11 30 nm this might be because more metal ions reacted with the pollutants to form metal precipitates loaded on the surface of the sludge which blocked the pore structure of sludge and reduced average pore size of sludge 24 3 3 2 sludge surface morphology and element composition sem images of anaerobic sludge anoxic sludge and oxic sludge are shown in fig 8 when metal ions were not added sludge surface was rough and its structure was irregular under 0 5 g l of na sludge surface contained a lot of uneven structure when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 3 the addition of na mg2 and fe3 resulted in the aggregation of small particles into large and dense flocs which increased surface roughness and adsorption sites of sludge and improved removal efficiencies of nitrogen and phosphorus multiple coexisting metal ions promoted biological flocculation and changed sludge microstructure when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 7 sludge surface became smooth and sludge structure was loose internal pores of sludge became larger and sludge flocs were destroyed this might be because bridging action between mg2 and sludge decreased the compactness of sludge flocs 50 the distribution of na mg and fe elements in anaerobic anoxic and oxic sludge mapping are shown in fig s2 when metal ions were not added the signal of na mg and fe in the sludge was weak under 0 5 g l of na concentration the signal of na mg and fe in anaerobic anoxic and oxic sludge increased and thus their content improved when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 3 the increase of metal cations content neutralized negative charges on the surface of microorganisms which was conducive to the improvement of removal efficiencies of nitrogen and phosphorus and the increase of biological flocculation when mole ratio of mg2 fe3 was 7 elemental signal of na mg and fe in anaerobic anoxic and oxic sludge continued to increase these elements were adsorbed and accumulated in the sludge and thus their content increased however excessive metal ions increased extracellular osmotic pressure separated cytoplasmic wall and decreased flocculation of sludge 4 conclusions 1 low concentration of na mg2 and fe3 promoted the removal of cod tn and tp and enhanced sludge flocculation high concentration of mg2 led to the decrease of sludge flocculation and removal efficiencies of nitrogen and phosphorus under constant concentration of na and fe3 2 the distribution rule of alkaline phosphatases in anaerobic zone anoxic zone and oxic zone was always ranked as pellet tb eps lb eps supernatant high concentration of mg2 inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity under constant concentration of na and fe3 3 multiple coexisting metal ions increased eps content an appropriate concentration of eps promoted biological flocculation while excessive eps was not conducive to bioflocculation the addition of na mg2 and fe3 did not change the composition and functional groups of lb eps and tb eps and main groups were always hydroxyl amide i and coc however the coexisting na mg2 and fe3 changed the sludge microstructure high concentration of mg2 increased specific surface area of sludge under constant concentration of na and fe3 credit
