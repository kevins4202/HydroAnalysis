chemical types and assesses the spatial distribution of the major ions the chemical data were collected from published articles 1968 2022 where the salinity tds exceeded 1 g l concentration based on the total alkalinity and ph the modified formula was used to estimate the concrete proportions of co3 2 and hco3 the lake s water chemical type was classified using boros and kolpakova 2018 classification criteria esri arcmap 10 2 gis software was used to analyze the spatial distributions of major ions new hydrological insight of the region following the critical review of the earv soda saline lakes the dominance of cations and anions followed the order na k ca2 mg2 and hco3 co3 cl so4 2 tanzania had the most soda chemical type lakes 20 followed by ethiopia 9 kenya 8 and uganda 4 soda saline lakes were the most common in tanzania 5 saline lakes were mostly found in uganda 4 tanzania 3 and ethiopia 1 except for afrera lake in north ethiopia and uganda western rift the concentration of na cl co3 ions and tds showed an increasing concentration gradient tendency from north to south in the eastern rift graphical abstract ga1 keywords salinity soda lake soda saline lake saline lake major cations major anions data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction inland saline waters have the same importance as freshwater in the world soda lakes are a particular type of inland saline lake characterized by permanent alkaline waters with ph values greater than 9 containing a high concentration of sodium na and carbonate species hco3 co3 2 as dominant dissolved ions and lower levels of alkaline earth metals ca2 mg2 boros and kolpakova 2018 grant and yu 2011 jones and deocampo 2003 the total alkalinity of the soda lake water as the sum of carbonate species charges is greater than the total charges of alkaline earth metal ions ca2 mg2 boros and kolpakova 2018 grant 2006 kempe and kazmierczak 2011 on the other hand soda lake waters often contain high amounts of chloride and varying concentration levels of sulfate and potassium schagerl and burian 2016 the formation of alkaline lake water is dependent on bicarbonate dominance and low concentrations of dissolved calcium and magnesium hco3 ca2 mg2 making it a far more stable and high ph environment on earth ph 9 distinguishing it from other inland saline waters which can be seasonally alkaline but not permanently as real soda lakes boros and kolpakova 2018 grant 2006 2004 alkaline lakes are found all over the world and are in very specific areas which seem to be related to active tectonics and volcanic belts grant and jones 2016 grant 2006 pecoraino et al 2015 most of the alkaline soda lakes are in the east african rift system ears the ears is divided into two sections the eastern and western rift valleys the eastern section of the rift valley runs from the north south of ethiopia through kenya to the central part of tanzania while the western rift extends from uganda rwanda and burundi and passes along the western and southwards of tanzania through malawi to mozambique oduor and katut 2016 olaka et al 2010 williams 2016 the east african soda lake easl was formed as a result of the african plate s tectonic split associated with volcanic eruptions which created a series of depressions with a hydrologically closed basin type no water outlet and streams flowing from the adjacent highlands and slopes ebinger et al 1993 in the tropical region of the ears evaporation is the main way water is lost hardie et al 1978 schagerl and renaut 2016 this is because of the high evapotranspiration low precipitation and closed type basin considerable numerous studies have been done on easl as they are probably the world s most productive lakes with high phytoplankton biomass and greater photosynthesis rates melack and kilham 1974 the higher temperatures in the tropics adequate nutrient supply and adequate inorganic carbon supply from its carbonate waters are the reasons for the higher productivity of the soda lakes grant 2004 oduor and schagerl 2007 wood and talling 1988 easl has important ecological recreational cultural and economic values although these rift soda lakes are rich in mineral resources they also provide special wildlife such as the little flamingo phoenicopterus minor and the cichlid alcolapia spp that adapts to harsh physical and chemical environments philip and mosha 2012 the ecosystem inhabitants of the alkaline lakes can indicate changes in climatic conditions however changing land use and mineral resource exploitation of these lakes threaten and damage the microbial ecology of these halophilic microorganisms the primary sources of ecological damage to these ecosystems are salinization sedimentation saltation mining urban development and pollution from both industrial and agricultural sources oduor and katut 2016 williams 2002 the contamination from pesticides insecticides and fertilizers transported by rain as runoff from agricultural activities contributes significantly to the damage to the water quality of the lakes and these unusual ecosystems kebede et al 2014 teklu et al 2018 yanda and madulu 2005 these important ecosystems of the world need to be protected as they are the source of the genetic pool in biotechnological applications enache et al 2017 ma et al 2010 the chemistry of the major ions of the inland soda saline lakes is important in classifying the chemical types of soda lakes and pans numerous studies have demonstrated different approaches to classifying alkaline water chemical types hammer 1978 classified saline waters into carbonate chloride and sulfate water types based on the dominance of anions and several subtypes combined with main cations such as sodium na calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 however the incorrect chemical type classification of inland soda saline lakes can result from a lack of precision in the use of these chemical terms especially when ph is primarily considered boros and kolpakova 2018 the study conducted by namsaraev et al 2010 misclassified lake khilganta southeastern transbaikalia as a soda lake using ph as the criteria for classifying water chemical type a metamorphic coefficient method developed by mg valyashko categorized inland reservoir waters as carbonate sulfate sodium or magnesium or chloride according to boros and kolpakova 2018 the valyashko method can be used as an indicator for soda brine chemical classification thus using it as the sole criterion for categorizing inland waters is insufficient it is insufficient to apply the valyashko method for the classification of water chemical types based on the co3 hco3 and mg2 ca2 species ratios in addition litchfield 2011 and timms et al 1986 classified saltwater chemical types based on the ranking of the main ions with 25 equivalent which is useful in identifying the chemical type of soda from various main combinations of ions in saltwater boros and kolpakova 2018 proposed a simple and accurate classification criterion for classifying the inland soda saline water type and suggested using terminology such as soda soda saline and saline for various types of saline water this classification by term helps to reduce the confusion between interdisciplinary studies and gives a better overview of the chemical properties of soda and alkaline water the easl are the famous and relatively well studied lakes around the globe the east african soda lake book written and edited by is described mainly the genesis geological setting and biodiversity of the halophilic organisms archaea viruses and bacteria but the chemical ion composition data for easl is scarce we believe that through this work a useful scientific database resource would be created by compiling the chemical ion data for the easl into a single comprehensive review enhancing understanding of classifying these lakes into their appropriate classes and evaluating their spatial distribution patterns this work reviewed the chemical ion compositions of the earv soda and saline inland waters into one comprehensive database classifying the lake s water chemical type using the most precise chemical classification proposed by boros and kolpakova 2018 and evaluated the spatial distribution patterns of the major ions 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area in this study various types of saline inland surface waters of the east african rift valley system were assessed including any type of lake with no direct linkage to the sea or ocean the ears is divided into two sections the eastern and western rift the eastern rift runs from the north south of ethiopia through kenya to the central part of tanzania while the western rift extends from uganda rwanda and burundi and passes along the western and southern parts of tanzania through malawi to mozambique for the eastern branch the salty inland waters came from the great rift valley system in ethiopia kenya and tanzania for the western branch the salty inland waters came from uganda where chemical ion data was available only published articles were used to obtain information on ion composition and the articles were selected without taking into account how the ions had previously been categorized the map processed by qgis 3 10 14 software of locations and geographical distribution of the inland saline waters evaluated in this study can be seen in fig 1 2 2 data collection and measurements in this comprehensive review the major ion chemical data na ca2 mg2 k hco3 co3 cl so4 2 and ph if available with ion data were obtained and compiled from the published articles from 1965 to 2022 with a minimum 1 g l total dissolved solids tds concentration threshold the data were obtained from peer reviewed articles reporting the chemical ion compositions of the easl as well as from the google scholar and isi web of science databases all available major ion data were collected on a regional geographical scale along the earv s soda lakes ethiopia kenya tanzania and uganda the mean values were used when multiple chemical data series were available for a particular lake e g the different depths times and seasons all of the data came from papers that were available to the public so their accuracy and ability to be replicated are different however all of the data were analyzed using the same standard method the major cations na k ca2 and mg2 were analyzed by icp ms chloride by argentometric titration carbonate and bicarbonate by alkalinity titration and sulfate by the turbidimetric titration method 2 3 analysis of data the major ions collected for the easl were used to classify water chemical types using the concentrations of the dominant ions based on a total amount of cations or anions higher than 25 equivalent percentage 25e boros and kolpakova 2018 the eqs 1 and 2 boros and kolpakova 2018 were used to calculate the equivalent percentage of cations and anions the dominance orders for cations and anions were identified separately eugster and hardie 1978 hammer 1978 estimation of carbonates excluding the possible uncertainty all the input ion concentration data was controlled and selected by a conventional ion balance percentage calculation according to eq 1 freeze and cherry 1979 with a 10 error limit singhal and gupta 1999 whereas a value greater than 10 is unacceptable 1 cations anions cations anions 100 where ions are in meq l units the concentration of bicarbonate hco3 was estimated by the advanced speciation method astm in waters where only total alkalinity methyl orange was available from the reference calculation which was based on the sample ph and total alkalinity according to well known theoretical relations as eq 2 rounds 2012 2 h c o 3 a l k 0 k w 10 p h 10 p h y 1 2 k 2 10 p h where alk0 total alkalinity meq l kw acid dissociation constant for water 1e 14 k2 second acid dissociation constant for h2co3 5 6e 11 ph ph of the sample γ activity coefficient for hco3 0 5 after pytkowicz 1975 the concentration of carbonate co3 can also be estimated by the astm with another specific function however the estimation of carbonate co3 2 was not reliable by this method rounds 2012 because acid base properties e g phosphate silicate ammonia etc must be present in significant concentrations in these multiple extreme alkaline lake water boros et al 2017 therefore carbonate was estimated by an empirical relationship between bicarbonate and carbonate by a significant eq 3 which was applied to regional representative data series from the carpathian basin austria hungary serbia where there are several characteristic soda lakes and pans boros et al 2014 the exact concentrations of carbonates hco3 co3 2 were derived from a regional data series of alkalinity titrations astm 2320 b with methyl red bromocresol and phenolphthalein indicators 3 co3 2 2 878e 7 5 438e 8 hco3 2 0 069 0 003 hco3 n 200 df 198 r2 0 901 p 0 0001 2 4 spatial analyses the geographic data analyses were performed by esri arcmap 10 2 gis software the global moran s i statistic was used to calculate spatial autocorrelation global moran s index based on feature locations and attribute values the graphical interpretation was made by qgis software 3 results the major ion chemical data na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 and co3 2 of the investigated easl were compiled from the original published articles and their details are tabulated in table 1 the highest ph 10 5 was recorded in lake ghama in tanzania while the lowest ph of 8 3 was recorded in lake kindai in tanzania the highest concentrations of sodium ions of 138 000 mg l were recorded in lake katwe in uganda while the lowest concentrations of 351 mg l were observed in lake chamo in ethiopia the potassium k ion was moderately higher after na ranging from 0 to 29 000 mg l the overall concentration of ca2 in easl was lower ranging from 0 to 61 mg l and the highest was recorded in lake kindai tanzania in most lakes mg2 ion concentrations were low and have been reported to range from 0 to 145 mg l the highest being recorded in lake gidabuid in tanzania the concentrations of cl ions ranged from 69 to 137 200 mg l the lowest for the lake silver sea and the highest for lake kasenyi sulfate ions were found to range from 0 0 to 85 600 mg l and the highest concentration was observed in lake kitaga at 85 600 mg l the bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co3 2 were the most dominant dissolved anions in most of the lakes the highest estimated concentrations of bicarbonate and carbonates were 131 179 mg l and 83 100 mg l respectively for lakes natron and murumuri the lowest concentrations of bicarbonate and carbonate were 159 mg l and 11 mg l for lake kindai tanzania na was found to be the most dominant dissolved cation in all lakes tables 2 and 3 accounting for approximately 90 of total dissolved cations with a mean of 21 333 mg l potassium k was the second element in the rank of the citation dominance sequence which contributes about 7 8 of the total dissolved cations with a mean of 1848 85 mg l thus together na and k account for more than 97 8 of the total dissolved cations in all lakes the higher contributions of these monovalent cations in the total cations of the rift valley lakes are also seen in fig 2 sum of cations vs na k indicating the dominance of the dissolved monovalent elements na and k over divalent elements ca2 and mg2 the proportions of calcium and magnesium were lower table 2 and in fig 3 total cations vs ca2 mg2 in all investigated lakes and their contributions to the total cations were 1 24 and 0 96 with a mean of 293 44 mg l and 3 193 mg l respectively thus the cation s dominance follows the following order na k ca2 mg2 bicarbonate and carbonate hco3 co3 2 proportions in the rift valley were higher than any other anions with a mean of 10 588 8 mg l and 8177 32 mg l which account for 45 8 of the total anions the rift valley lakes experienced higher concentrations of chloride ions with a mean of 14 596 9 mg l and contributed around 35 5 of the total anions the sulfate of the investigated rift valley soda lakes was the last in the anion dominance sequence with a mean of 7599 1 mg l accounting for 18 6 of the total anions the overall anion dominance sequence of the investigated easl was found in the following order hco3 co3 2 cl so4 2 fig 3 fig 3 a and 3 b show the relationships between the sum of monovalent elements na k and divalent elements to the sum of the major ions for the easl the graphs showed that the sum of the monovalent elements has a positive relationship with the sum of the cations and that divalent elements have a small contribution to the sum of the major ions therefore this confirms the dominance of the monovalent elements over divalent elements in the easl the contributions of hco3 co3 2 and cl to the sum of anions were shown in fig 4 a b the graph indicated a positive relationship between the sum hco3 co3 2 and cl to the total anions and thus confirms the dominance of these anions in the easl the ternary scatterplot fig 4a b for the chemical ion composition of the studied alkaline soda lakes indicated that na was the most dominant dissolved cation with an equivalent percentage of over 60 in all lakes the ca2 and mg2 equivalent percentages were lower than 25 in all lakes except lake bishoftu with exactly 25 e of mg the hco3 co3 2 ions were the most dominant anion and most of the lakes had more than 25 e except lakes ngozi kindai singida afrera kikorongo and kitanga with equivalent percentages below 25 therefore in these lakes other ions such as cl and so4 2 were dominant the values of the calculated spearman correlation coefficients of the major ions and tds are shown in table 3 the results showed significant positive correlations between the estimated tds and na and k but significant negative correlations with ca2 and no correlations with mg2 on the other hand there was a strong positive correlation between the calculated tds and the main anions of the lakes under study 3 1 water chemical type classification according to the percentage equivalent calculations table 4 of the collected chemical ions data 54 100 na was the dominant dissolved cation and first in the ranking of dominance cations as compared to any other cations with equivalent percentages greater than 25 and the k ions were second in the dominance sequence of cations although the equivalent percentage in all the lakes was below 25 ca2 and mg2 were the least dominant dissolved elements in all lakes accounting for less than 25 the carbon ion species hco3 co3 2 was the dominant dissolved anion in 41 lakes 76 and first in the rank of the anion s dominance sequence with an equivalent percentage greater than 25 thus this group was classified as a soda chemical type besides 23 25 of the total anions were dominated by cl and so4 2 ions in the other case 5 lakes 9 3 were found with hco3 co3 2 25 but less dominant anions therefore these lakes were categorized as soda saline chemical types also 8 lakes 14 7 were found with little brine features with hco3 co3 2 of 25 and this group was categorized as a saline water chemical type the water chemical types were identified boros and kolpakova 2018 by simplified classification categories as follows soda type na 25 e and first in the cation s dominance sequence hco3 co3 2 25 e and first in the anion s dominance sequence soda saline type na 25 e and first in the cation s dominance sequence hco3 co3 2 25 e and but not first in the anion s dominance sequence hco3 co3 2 than cl or so4 2 e saline type na 25 e and first in the cation s dominance sequence na than any other cation hco3 co3 2 25 e and cl or so4 2 is first in the anion s dominance sequence the geographic distribution of the recognized water chemical types across the ear was quite heterogeneous as shown in table 5 tanzania had most of the region s characteristic soda type lakes 46 7 followed by ethiopia 22 kenya 19 5 and uganda 9 8 soda saline water chemical types were most common in tanzania accounting for nearly 100 of all lakes studied most of the saline water chemical types were found in uganda 50 tanzania 37 5 and ethiopia 12 5 3 2 spatial distributions of na cl co3 2 and tds of easl regarding the spatial distribution of the investigated ions significant spatial autocorrelations were detected in the cases of na cl hco3 co3 2 ions and tds most of them have a north south increasing concentration gradient tendency in the eastern arm of the rift valley except for the northernmost afrera lake in ethiopia and uganda as a western branch of the rift valley figs 5 7 and appendix 1 fig 5 depicts the spatial distribution pattern of na and the results show that higher na concentrations were widely distributed in ugandan lakes followed by moderate concentrations near the tanzania kenya border particularly in lake natron and lake magad a similar moderate concentration distribution pattern was seen in lake manyara in tanzania in the other parts of the region most of the lake s concentrations were found to be in the range of 315 27 525 mg l the chloride distribution patterns for the easl are shown in fig 6 the results indicated that the highest concentrations were found in ugandan lakes and lake afrera in ethiopia moderate concentrations of chloride were seen in lakes natron and manyara in tanzania and lake magadi in kenya the other lakes displayed similar spatial distribution patterns ranging from 68 5 to 22 000 mg l fig 7 illustrates the spatial distribution patterns of carbonate in easl with the highest distribution patterns found in ugandan lakes and lake magad kenya lake bogoria and baringo in kenya had moderate distribution patterns ranging from 5950 to 83 100 mg l in another case the concentrations of the rest of the lakes ranged from 9 to 5950 mg l but they all had the same pattern of spatial distribution the regional patterns of the estimated salinity tds of the easl are shown in appendix 1 and the results indicate that ugandan lakes had the highest salinity value the moderate salinity values were found in ugandan lakes and between the tanzania and kenya borders in lakes natron and magad the same distribution patterns were seen in lake manyara tanzania and lake afrera ethiopia the rest of the lakes in the region had salinity values ranging between 1350 and 80 343 mg l 4 discussion the easl is characterized by high permanent alkalinity and ph which obviously can be accounted for by the hydrolysis of silicate minerals with high concentrations of na and hco3 co3 2 deocampo and jones 2013 the natural weathering process of the surrounding alkaline volcanic rocks and the tectonic geological background can explain the high ph values of rift valley lakes deocampo and jones 2013 kebede et al 1994 masresha et al 2011 nanyaro et al 1984 yuretich and cerling 1983 the easl experienced higher total alkalinity which can be explained by the dissolution of the soluble naturally occurring minerals chemical weathering of the parent rock materials and mineral bearing rock s interaction with runoff water adds up and contributes to the saline lake water s saline composition the original composition of the input water strongly influences the solute composition of the brine yechieli and wood 2002 the occurrence of high alkaline sodic characteristics is primarily due to an unbalanced initial stage of carbonate alkalinity and calcium hco3 2 ca2 mg2 caused by the weathering and dissolution of volcanic rocks chernet et al 2001 jones et al 1977 reported that most of the alkalinity comes from the hydrolysis of volcanic glass and lava this process creates high concentrations of na sio2 and hco3 in the dilute inflow of east african rift lakes the evaluated easl table 4 has a high na content ranging from 68 to 100 e and a lower ca2 and mg2 content 0 27 and 0 25 e respectively and the overall cation dominance sequence is na k ca2 mg2 the alkaline nature of the rocks along the earv explains these ion dominance patterns gaciri and davies 1993 ghiglieri et al 2012 the dissolution of alkaline rocks explains the dominance of na and k in easl the rift valley s mineral dominance includes nephelinite with nepheline na3kal4si4o16 augite anorthoclase and albite which release a lot of na and k during the weathering process ghiglieri et al 2012 makoba and muzuka 2019 regardless of the dominance of the monovalent elements over divalent elements na is in higher abundance compared to k the enrichment of na over k is well known because na is conservative species as its concentrations remain constant during the evaporation process while k can be removed by the adsorption process on the active surface of the lake deocampo 2004 eugster and jones 1979 kilham and cloke 1990 the significant loss of k due to clay mineral uptake during reverse weathering contributes to na dominance over k garrels and mackenzie 1967 mackenzie et al 1995 the parent materials dominance of na over k bearing minerals and the resistance of k feldspar to weathering processes could also explain the low k relative to na makoba and muzuka 2019 the early precipitation of calcite and dolomite minerals accounts for the lower contribution of ca2 and mg2 to the total cations of the easl deocampo 2004 eugster and jones 1979 kilham 1990 kilham and cloke 1990 getenet garcía ruiz et al 2022 getenet ot alora et al 2022 carbonate precipitation calcite magnesite reduces the concentrations of calcium and magnesium in water jobbágy et al 2017 consequently the loss of ca2 and mg2 ions due to the precipitation process results in higher na and hco3 co3 2 and high cl concentrations in water the lower solubility of calcium and magnesium salts in alkaline water as well as the accumulation of soluble salts favours the higher concentration of na while suppressing ca2 and mg2 in water chebotarev 1955 carbonates and bicarbonate ions were abundant in almost all of the rift valley soda lakes studied varying from 0 to 96 e the higher contributions of the carbonate and bicarbonate to the total anion can be explained by the chemical weathering of the rock minerals producing higher nahco3 in water gizaw 1996 jones et al 1977 the chemical reactions chemical weathering of carbon dioxide with the rock minerals produce higher bicarbonate ions fournier and truesdell 1970 the higher rate of carbon dioxide outgassing combined with acidic volcanic activities and geothermal activities in the region accounts for the higher bicarbonate content in the water gizaw 1996 the higher dominance of the cl ions can be caused by the high precipitation rate and trona depositions bicarbonate depletion and chloride enrichment in brines which occur in conjunction with an increase in chlorinity eugster and jones 1979 eugster 1970 kaufman et al 1990 the conservative nature of the cl over the higher range makes it remain in the solutions even under high evaporation rates at this stage na is removed but not cl as the halite product remains below the saturation level even when chloride concentrations reach extremely high levels the spring s water concentrated by evaporation discharges water into the lakes alkaline hot springs recharge seasonal runoff and dissolution of host volcanic bedrock contribute to the higher dominance of cl in easl kaufman et al 1990 pecoraino et al 2015 renaut et al 2021 the sulfate ion is less dominant among the anions in the easl as it contributes about 18 6 of the total anions the microbial reduction of sulfate ions to sulfide during organic matter degradation and loss of sulfate by sorption on the surface accounts for the sulfate ion content in rift valley soda lakes dunnette et al 1985 kilham 1984 also the so4 2 content is caused by anthropogenic activities such as sewage effluent discharge and fertilizer residual jiang et al 2009 the sulfate ion level is also associated with the dissolution of the gypsum minerals awaleh et al 2022 based on the water chemical type classification of the investigated lakes tables 4 and 5 we found that the soda water chemical type is more dominant in the region contributing about 75 9 distinguished by the dominant na among the cations with greater than 25 equivalent percentages and the dominant hco co3 as the most dominant ions with an equivalent percentage greater than 25 among the anion the dominance of the soda water chemical type over soda saline and saline in the ears justifies the dominance of dissolved na and hco co3 in the earv lakes furthermore we found that 14 8 of the investigated lakes are characterized by the saline water chemical type with dominant na among the cation and dominant cl among the anions and 9 3 are characterized by the soda saline group with na being the dominant cation and first in the rank of the cation dominance sequence and hco co3 with greater than 25 equivalent percentage but not first in the rank of the anion dominance sequence the spatial distribution pattern of na cl estimated co3 ions and tds figs 5 7 and appendix 1 has shown the north south tanzania kenya border increasing concentration gradient tendency in the eastern rift except for afrera lake in north ethiopia and uganda in the western rift the active volcanic and tectonic area most lakes are of volcanic and tectonic origin arid to semiarid climatic conditions the dominance of the volcanic rocks in the regions alkaline hot spring recharge and deep underground water connectivity below the rift valley contribute to the north south increasing concentration gradient tendency of na cl estimated co3 2 ions and tds in the eastern rift eugster 1970 fazi et al 2018 schagerl and renaut 2016 the spatially outlying high salinity and chloride for lake afrera in ethiopia is caused most likely by the tectonic magmatic hydrothermal event that occurred 7800 years ago in the area causing a sudden increase in the salinity level of the lake gasse et al 1974 the intersection location of the afrera lake features parallel and closer to the red sea is prone to earthquake occurrences also attributed to the distribution pattern of salinity bonatti et al 2017 the current depositions of the halite minerals and evaporation could be the reasons for the higher spatial distribution patterns of chloride in lake afrera similarly the same distribution pattern for salinity and chloride was seen in ugandan lakes these outlying distribution patterns can be explained by local productive saline springs discharging into these lakes and evaporative concentrations of the mineral water springs contributing to the significant amounts of cl and salinity arad and morton 1969 mungoma 1990 the chemical weathering of the igneous rocks also contributes to the higher spatial distribution patterns of sodium and carbonate garrels and mackenzie 1967 the tanzania kenya border especially lake natron and magad experienced a moderate concentration of cl and salinity but a higher proportion of carbonates a similar spatial distribution pattern for the cl and salinity was seen in lake manyara evaporative concentrations atmospheric input volcanic activity and chemical weathering of the mineral bearing rocks caused the spatial distribution patterns of salinity and chloride deocampo and renaut 2016 zaitsev and keller 2006 the spatial distribution maps for na and estimated co3 2 figs 5 and 7 showed significantly higher and moderate distributions of na and co3 2 in ugandan lakes this higher distribution pattern was similar to the results reported by kasedde et al 2014 the evaporative concentrations small alkaline springs connecting to the lakes and chemical weathering of the igneous rocks contribute to the higher spatial distribution patterns of na and co3 2 garrels and mackenzie 1967 kasedde et al 2014 similarly both higher and moderate spatial distribution patterns of na were seen in lakes manyara natron and magad while the higher spatial distributions of co3 2 were seen in lake magad and the moderate spatial distributions in lake bogoria and baringo kenya chemical weathering of rock minerals evaporative deposits atmospheric inputs and excessive evaporation of lake water account for the spatial distribution patterns of sodium and carbonate deocampo and renaut 2016 nielsen 1999 vincens and casanova 1987 the higher spatial distributions of major ions in the east african rift valley lakes may result in freshwater and soil salinization the dissolved salt intrusions into the land and climate change are probably the main environmental drivers for freshwater and soil salinization in the rift valley regions salinization is the most serious threat to freshwater ecosystems affecting the quality and provisioning of water and related ecosystem services all over the world and potentially leading to freshwater scarcity in the regions 5 conclusions this regional review compiled the ionic composition data from 54 inland soda and saline waters of the easl into a single comprehensive database making it the first and most comprehensive regional chemical review in the area the equivalent percentage calculations of the ions data revealed the following dominance sequence of major cations and major anions na k ca2 mg2 and hco3 co3 2 cl so4 2 the simplified exact classification method of the water chemical type helped us to classify easl for the investigated lakes 75 were classified as soda water chemical type 9 3 were classified as soda saline lakes and 15 7 were classified as saline water chemical type the modified formula for estimating the carbonate and bicarbonate based on the total alkalinity and ph is useful to determine the concrete carbonate and bicarbonate concentrations in water therefore the modified method will be of great benefit in determining precisely how much carbonate and bicarbonate concentrations are present in water the spatial distribution patterns of na cl co3 2 ions and tds in the eastern rift showed an increasing concentration gradient tendency from north to south except for afrera lake in north ethiopia and uganda western rift the intrusion of dissolved salts into the land by rift valley soda saline lakes is an environmental driver in an increasing trend of salinization of the soil and freshwater and this will probably result in a decrease in the region s freshwater resources credit authorship

chemical types and assesses the spatial distribution of the major ions the chemical data were collected from published articles 1968 2022 where the salinity tds exceeded 1 g l concentration based on the total alkalinity and ph the modified formula was used to estimate the concrete proportions of co3 2 and hco3 the lake s water chemical type was classified using boros and kolpakova 2018 classification criteria esri arcmap 10 2 gis software was used to analyze the spatial distributions of major ions new hydrological insight of the region following the critical review of the earv soda

saline lake major cations major anions data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction inland saline waters have the same importance as freshwater in the world soda lakes are a particular type of inland saline lake characterized by permanent alkaline waters with ph values greater than 9 containing a high concentration of sodium na and carbonate species hco3 co3 2 as dominant dissolved ions and lower levels of alkaline earth metals ca2 mg2 boros and kolpakova 2018 grant and yu 2011 jones and deocampo 2003 the total alkalinity of the soda lake water as the sum of carbonate species charges is greater than the total charges of alkaline earth metal ions ca2 mg2 boros and kolpakova 2018 grant 2006 kempe and kazmierczak 2011 on the other hand soda lake waters often contain high amounts of chloride and varying concentration levels of sulfate and potassium schagerl and burian 2016 the formation of alkaline lake water is dependent on bicarbonate dominance and low concentrations of dissolved calcium and magnesium hco3 ca2 mg2 making it a far more stable and high ph environment on earth ph 9 distinguishing it from other inland saline waters which can be seasonally alkaline but not permanently as real soda lakes boros and kolpakova 2018 grant 2006 2004 alkaline lakes are found all over the world and are in very specific areas which seem to be related to active tectonics and volcanic belts grant and jones 2016 grant 2006 pecoraino et al 2015 most of the alkaline soda lakes are in the east african rift system ears the ears is divided into two sections the eastern and western rift valleys the eastern section of the rift valley runs from the north south of ethiopia through kenya to the central part of tanzania while the western rift extends from uganda rwanda and burundi and passes along the western and southwards of tanzania through malawi to mozambique oduor and katut 2016 olaka et al 2010 williams 2016 the east african soda lake easl was formed as a result of the african plate s tectonic split associated with volcanic eruptions which created a series of depressions with a hydrologically closed basin type no water outlet and streams flowing from the adjacent highlands and slopes ebinger et al 1993 in the tropical region of the ears evaporation is the main way water is lost hardie et al 1978 schagerl and renaut 2016 this is because of the high evapotranspiration low precipitation and closed type basin considerable numerous studies have been done on easl as they are probably the world s most productive lakes with high phytoplankton biomass and greater photosynthesis rates melack and kilham 1974 the higher temperatures in the tropics adequate nutrient supply and adequate inorganic carbon supply from its carbonate waters are the reasons for the higher productivity of the soda lakes grant 2004 oduor and schagerl 2007 wood and talling 1988 easl has important ecological recreational cultural and economic values although these rift soda lakes are rich in mineral resources they also provide special wildlife such as the little flamingo phoenicopterus minor and the cichlid alcolapia spp that adapts to harsh physical and chemical environments philip and mosha 2012 the ecosystem inhabitants of the alkaline lakes can indicate changes in climatic conditions however changing land use and mineral resource exploitation of these lakes threaten and damage the microbial ecology of these halophilic microorganisms the primary sources of ecological damage to these ecosystems are salinization sedimentation saltation mining urban development and pollution from both industrial and agricultural sources oduor and katut 2016 williams 2002 the contamination from pesticides insecticides and fertilizers transported by rain as runoff from agricultural activities contributes significantly to the damage to the water quality of the lakes and these unusual ecosystems kebede et al 2014 teklu et al 2018 yanda and madulu 2005 these important ecosystems of the world need to be protected as they are the source of the genetic pool in biotechnological applications enache et al 2017 ma et al 2010 the chemistry of the major ions of the inland soda saline lakes is important in classifying the chemical types of soda lakes and pans numerous studies have demonstrated different approaches to classifying alkaline water chemical types hammer 1978 classified saline waters into carbonate chloride and sulfate water types based on the dominance of anions and several subtypes combined with main cations such as sodium na calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 however the incorrect chemical type classification of inland soda saline lakes can result from a lack of precision in the use of these chemical terms especially when ph is primarily considered boros and kolpakova 2018 the study conducted by namsaraev et al 2010 misclassified lake khilganta southeastern transbaikalia as a soda lake using ph as the criteria for classifying water chemical type a metamorphic coefficient method developed by mg valyashko categorized inland reservoir waters as carbonate sulfate sodium or magnesium or chloride according to boros and kolpakova 2018 the valyashko method can be used as an indicator for soda brine chemical classification thus using it as the sole criterion for categorizing inland waters is insufficient it is insufficient to apply the valyashko method for the classification of water chemical types based on the co3 hco3 and mg2 ca2 species ratios in addition litchfield 2011 and timms et al 1986 classified saltwater chemical types based on the ranking of the main ions with 25 equivalent which is useful in identifying the chemical type of soda from various main combinations of ions in saltwater boros and kolpakova 2018 proposed a simple and accurate classification criterion for classifying the inland soda saline water type and suggested using terminology such as soda soda saline and saline for various types of saline water this classification by term helps to reduce the confusion between interdisciplinary studies and gives a better overview of the chemical properties of soda and alkaline water the easl are the famous and relatively well studied lakes around the globe the east african soda lake book written and edited by is described mainly the genesis geological setting and biodiversity of the halophilic organisms archaea viruses and bacteria but the chemical ion composition data for easl is scarce we believe that through this work a useful scientific database resource would be created by compiling the chemical ion data for the easl into a single comprehensive review enhancing understanding of classifying these lakes into their appropriate classes and evaluating their spatial distribution patterns this work reviewed the chemical ion compositions of the earv soda and saline inland waters into one comprehensive database classifying the lake s water chemical type using the most precise chemical classification proposed by boros and kolpakova 2018 and evaluated the spatial distribution patterns of the major ions 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area in this study various types of saline inland surface waters of the east african rift valley system were assessed including any type of lake with no direct linkage to the sea or ocean the ears is divided into two sections the eastern and western rift the eastern rift runs from the north south of ethiopia through kenya to the central part of tanzania while the western rift extends from uganda rwanda and burundi and passes along the western and southern parts of tanzania through malawi to mozambique for the eastern branch the salty inland waters came from the great rift valley system in ethiopia kenya and tanzania for the western branch the salty inland waters came from uganda where chemical ion data was available only published articles were used to obtain information on ion composition and the articles were selected without taking into account how the ions had previously been categorized the map processed by qgis 3 10 14 software of locations and geographical distribution of the inland saline waters evaluated in this study can be seen in fig 1 2 2 data collection and measurements in this comprehensive review the major ion chemical data na ca2 mg2 k hco3 co3 cl so4 2 and ph if available with ion data were obtained and compiled from the published articles from 1965 to 2022 with a minimum 1 g l total dissolved solids tds concentration threshold the data were obtained from peer reviewed articles reporting the chemical ion compositions of the easl as well as from the google scholar and isi web of science databases all available major ion data were collected on a regional geographical scale along the earv s soda lakes ethiopia kenya tanzania and uganda the mean values were used when multiple chemical data series were available for a particular lake e g the different depths times and seasons all of the data came from papers that were available to the public so their accuracy and ability to be replicated are different however all of the data were analyzed using the same standard method the major cations na k ca2 and mg2 were analyzed by icp ms chloride by argentometric titration carbonate and bicarbonate by alkalinity titration and sulfate by the turbidimetric titration method 2 3 analysis of data the major ions collected for the easl were used to classify water chemical types using the concentrations of the dominant ions based on a total amount of cations or anions higher than 25 equivalent percentage 25e boros and kolpakova 2018 the eqs 1 and 2 boros and kolpakova 2018 were used to calculate the equivalent percentage of cations and anions the dominance orders for cations and anions were identified separately eugster and hardie 1978 hammer 1978 estimation of carbonates excluding the possible uncertainty all the input ion concentration data was controlled and selected by a conventional ion balance percentage calculation according to eq 1 freeze and cherry 1979 with a 10 error limit singhal and gupta 1999 whereas a value greater than 10 is unacceptable 1 cations anions cations anions 100 where ions are in meq l units the concentration of bicarbonate hco3 was estimated by the advanced speciation method astm in waters where only total alkalinity methyl orange was available from the reference calculation which was based on the sample ph and total alkalinity according to well known theoretical relations as eq 2 rounds 2012 2 h c o 3 a l k 0 k w 10 p h 10 p h y 1 2 k 2 10 p h where alk0 total alkalinity meq l kw acid dissociation constant for water 1e 14 k2 second acid dissociation constant for h2co3 5 6e 11 ph ph of the sample γ activity coefficient for hco3 0 5 after pytkowicz 1975 the concentration of carbonate co3 can also be estimated by the astm with another specific function however the estimation of carbonate co3 2 was not reliable by this method rounds 2012 because acid base properties e g phosphate silicate ammonia etc must be present in significant concentrations in these multiple extreme alkaline lake water boros et al 2017 therefore carbonate was estimated by an empirical relationship between bicarbonate and carbonate by a significant eq 3 which was applied to regional representative data series from the carpathian basin austria hungary serbia where there are several characteristic soda lakes and pans boros et al 2014 the exact concentrations of carbonates hco3 co3 2 were derived from a regional data series of alkalinity titrations astm 2320 b with methyl red bromocresol and phenolphthalein indicators 3 co3 2 2 878e 7 5 438e 8 hco3 2 0 069 0 003 hco3 n 200 df 198 r2 0 901 p 0 0001 2 4 spatial analyses the geographic data analyses were performed by esri arcmap 10 2 gis software the global moran s i statistic was used to calculate spatial autocorrelation global moran s index based on feature locations and attribute values the graphical interpretation was made by qgis software 3 results the major ion chemical data na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 and co3 2 of the investigated easl were compiled from the original published articles and their details are tabulated in table 1 the highest ph 10 5 was recorded in lake ghama in tanzania while the lowest ph of 8 3 was recorded in lake kindai in tanzania the highest concentrations of sodium ions of 138 000 mg l were recorded in lake katwe in uganda while the lowest concentrations of 351 mg l were observed in lake chamo in ethiopia the potassium k ion was moderately higher after na ranging from 0 to 29 000 mg l the overall concentration of ca2 in easl was lower ranging from 0 to 61 mg l and the highest was recorded in lake kindai tanzania in most lakes mg2 ion concentrations were low and have been reported to range from 0 to 145 mg l the highest being recorded in lake gidabuid in tanzania the concentrations of cl ions ranged from 69 to 137 200 mg l the lowest for the lake silver sea and the highest for lake kasenyi sulfate ions were found to range from 0 0 to 85 600 mg l and the highest concentration was observed in lake kitaga at 85 600 mg l the bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co3 2 were the most dominant dissolved anions in most of the lakes the highest estimated concentrations of bicarbonate and carbonates were 131 179 mg l and 83 100 mg l respectively for lakes natron and murumuri the lowest concentrations of bicarbonate and carbonate were 159 mg l and 11 mg l for lake kindai tanzania na was found to be the most dominant dissolved cation in all lakes tables 2 and 3 accounting for approximately 90 of total dissolved cations with a mean of 21 333 mg l potassium k was the second element in the rank of the citation dominance sequence which contributes about 7 8 of the total dissolved cations with a mean of 1848 85 mg l thus together na and k account for more than 97 8 of the total dissolved cations in all lakes the higher contributions of these monovalent cations in the total cations of the rift valley lakes are also seen in fig 2 sum of cations vs na k indicating the dominance of the dissolved monovalent elements na and k over divalent elements ca2 and mg2 the proportions of calcium and magnesium were lower table 2 and in fig 3 total cations vs ca2 mg2 in all investigated lakes and their contributions to the total cations were 1 24 and 0 96 with a mean of 293 44 mg l and 3 193 mg l respectively thus the cation s dominance follows the following order na k ca2 mg2 bicarbonate and carbonate hco3 co3 2 proportions in the rift valley were higher than any other anions with a mean of 10 588 8 mg l and 8177 32 mg l which account for 45 8 of the total anions the rift valley lakes experienced higher concentrations of chloride ions with a mean of 14 596 9 mg l and contributed around 35 5 of the total anions the sulfate of the investigated rift valley soda lakes was the last in the anion dominance sequence with a mean of 7599 1 mg l accounting for 18 6 of the total anions the overall anion dominance sequence of the investigated easl was found in the following order hco3 co3 2 cl so4 2 fig 3 fig 3 a and 3 b show the relationships between the sum of monovalent elements na k and divalent elements to the sum of the major ions for the easl the graphs showed that the sum of the monovalent elements has a positive relationship with the sum of the cations and that divalent elements have a small contribution to the sum of the major ions therefore this confirms the dominance of the monovalent elements over divalent elements in the easl the contributions of hco3 co3 2 and cl to the sum of anions were shown in fig 4 a b the graph indicated a positive relationship between the sum hco3 co3 2 and cl to the total anions and thus confirms the dominance of these anions in the easl the ternary scatterplot fig 4a b for the chemical ion composition of the studied alkaline soda lakes indicated that na was the most dominant dissolved cation with an equivalent percentage of over 60 in all lakes the ca2 and mg2 equivalent percentages were lower than 25 in all lakes except lake bishoftu with exactly 25 e of mg the hco3 co3 2 ions were the most dominant anion and most of the lakes had more than 25 e except lakes ngozi kindai singida afrera kikorongo and kitanga with equivalent percentages below 25 therefore in these lakes other ions such as cl and so4 2 were dominant the values of the calculated spearman correlation coefficients of the major ions and tds are shown in table 3 the results showed significant positive correlations between the estimated tds and na and k but significant negative correlations with ca2 and no correlations with mg2 on the other hand there was a strong positive correlation between the calculated tds and the main anions of the lakes under study 3 1 water chemical type classification according to the percentage equivalent calculations table 4 of the collected chemical ions data 54 100 na was the dominant dissolved cation and first in the ranking of dominance cations as compared to any other cations with equivalent percentages greater than 25 and the k ions were second in the dominance sequence of cations although the equivalent percentage in all the lakes was below 25 ca2 and mg2 were the least dominant dissolved elements in all lakes accounting for less than 25 the carbon ion species hco3 co3 2 was the dominant dissolved anion in 41 lakes 76 and first in the rank of the anion s dominance sequence with an equivalent percentage greater than 25 thus this group was classified as a soda chemical type besides 23 25 of the total anions were dominated by cl and so4 2 ions in the other case 5 lakes 9 3 were found with hco3 co3 2 25 but less dominant anions therefore these lakes were categorized as soda saline chemical types also 8 lakes 14 7 were found with little brine features with hco3 co3 2 of 25 and this group was categorized as a saline water chemical type the water chemical types were identified boros and kolpakova 2018 by simplified classification categories as follows soda type na 25 e and first in the cation s dominance sequence hco3 co3 2 25 e and first in the anion s dominance sequence soda saline type na 25 e and first in the cation s dominance sequence hco3 co3 2 25 e and but not first in the anion s dominance sequence hco3 co3 2 than cl or so4 2 e saline type na 25 e and first in the cation s dominance sequence na than any other cation hco3 co3 2 25 e and cl or so4 2 is first in the anion s dominance sequence the geographic distribution of the recognized water chemical types across the ear was quite heterogeneous as shown in table 5 tanzania had most of the region s characteristic soda type lakes 46 7 followed by ethiopia 22 kenya 19 5 and uganda 9 8 soda saline water chemical types were most common in tanzania accounting for nearly 100 of all lakes studied most of the saline water chemical types were found in uganda 50 tanzania 37 5 and ethiopia 12 5 3 2 spatial distributions of na cl co3 2 and tds of easl regarding the spatial distribution of the investigated ions significant spatial autocorrelations were detected in the cases of na cl hco3 co3 2 ions and tds most of them have a north south increasing concentration gradient tendency in the eastern arm of the rift valley except for the northernmost afrera lake in ethiopia and uganda as a western branch of the rift valley figs 5 7 and appendix 1 fig 5 depicts the spatial distribution pattern of na and the results show that higher na concentrations were widely distributed in ugandan lakes followed by moderate concentrations near the tanzania kenya border particularly in lake natron and lake magad a similar moderate concentration distribution pattern was seen in lake manyara in tanzania in the other parts of the region most of the lake s concentrations were found to be in the range of 315 27 525 mg l the chloride distribution patterns for the easl are shown in fig 6 the results indicated that the highest concentrations were found in ugandan lakes and lake afrera in ethiopia moderate concentrations of chloride were seen in lakes natron and manyara in tanzania and lake magadi in kenya the other lakes displayed similar spatial distribution patterns ranging from 68 5 to 22 000 mg l fig 7 illustrates the spatial distribution patterns of carbonate in easl with the highest distribution patterns found in ugandan lakes and lake magad kenya lake bogoria and baringo in kenya had moderate distribution patterns ranging from 5950 to 83 100 mg l in another case the concentrations of the rest of the lakes ranged from 9 to 5950 mg l but they all had the same pattern of spatial distribution the regional patterns of the estimated salinity tds of the easl are shown in appendix 1 and the results indicate that ugandan lakes had the highest salinity value the moderate salinity values were found in ugandan lakes and between the tanzania and kenya borders in lakes natron and magad the same distribution patterns were seen in lake manyara tanzania and lake afrera ethiopia the rest of the lakes in the region had salinity values ranging between 1350 and 80 343 mg l 4 discussion the easl is characterized by high permanent alkalinity and ph which obviously can be accounted for by the hydrolysis of silicate minerals with high concentrations of na and hco3 co3 2 deocampo and jones 2013 the natural weathering process of the surrounding alkaline volcanic rocks and the tectonic geological background can explain the high ph values of rift valley lakes deocampo and jones 2013 kebede et al 1994 masresha et al 2011 nanyaro et al 1984 yuretich and cerling 1983 the easl experienced higher total alkalinity which can be explained by the dissolution of the soluble naturally occurring minerals chemical weathering of the parent rock materials and mineral bearing rock s interaction with runoff water adds up and contributes to the saline lake water s saline composition the original composition of the input water strongly influences the solute composition of the brine yechieli and wood 2002 the occurrence of high alkaline sodic characteristics is primarily due to an unbalanced initial stage of carbonate alkalinity and calcium hco3 2 ca2 mg2 caused by the weathering and dissolution of volcanic rocks chernet et al 2001 jones et al 1977 reported that most of the alkalinity comes from the hydrolysis of volcanic glass and lava this process creates high concentrations of na sio2 and hco3 in the dilute inflow of east african rift lakes the evaluated easl table 4 has a high na content ranging from 68 to 100 e and a lower ca2 and mg2 content 0 27 and 0 25 e respectively and the overall cation dominance sequence is na k ca2 mg2 the alkaline nature of the rocks along the earv explains these ion dominance patterns gaciri and davies 1993 ghiglieri et al 2012 the dissolution of alkaline rocks explains the dominance of na and k in easl the rift valley s mineral dominance includes nephelinite with nepheline na3kal4si4o16 augite anorthoclase and albite which release a lot of na and k during the weathering process ghiglieri et al 2012 makoba and muzuka 2019 regardless of the dominance of the monovalent elements over divalent elements na is in higher abundance compared to k the enrichment of na over k is well known because na is conservative species as its concentrations remain constant during the evaporation process while k can be removed by the adsorption process on the active surface of the lake deocampo 2004 eugster and jones 1979 kilham and cloke 1990 the significant loss of k due to clay mineral uptake during reverse weathering contributes to na dominance over k garrels and mackenzie 1967 mackenzie et al 1995 the parent materials dominance of na over k bearing minerals and the resistance of k feldspar to weathering processes could also explain the low k relative to na makoba and muzuka 2019 the early precipitation of calcite and dolomite minerals accounts for the lower contribution of ca2 and mg2 to the total cations of the easl deocampo 2004 eugster and jones 1979 kilham 1990 kilham and cloke 1990 getenet garcía ruiz et al 2022 getenet ot alora et al 2022 carbonate precipitation calcite magnesite reduces the concentrations of calcium and magnesium in water jobbágy et al 2017 consequently the loss of ca2 and mg2 ions due to the precipitation process results in higher na and hco3 co3 2 and high cl concentrations in water the lower solubility of calcium and magnesium salts in alkaline water as well as the accumulation of soluble salts favours the higher concentration of na while suppressing ca2 and mg2 in water chebotarev 1955 carbonates and bicarbonate ions were abundant in almost all of the rift valley soda lakes studied varying from 0 to 96 e the higher contributions of the carbonate and bicarbonate to the total anion can be explained by the chemical weathering of the rock minerals producing higher nahco3 in water gizaw 1996 jones et al 1977 the chemical reactions chemical weathering of carbon dioxide with the rock minerals produce higher bicarbonate ions fournier and truesdell 1970 the higher rate of carbon dioxide outgassing combined with acidic volcanic activities and geothermal activities in the region accounts for the higher bicarbonate content in the water gizaw 1996 the higher dominance of the cl ions can be caused by the high precipitation rate and trona depositions bicarbonate depletion and chloride enrichment in brines which occur in conjunction with an increase in chlorinity eugster and jones 1979 eugster 1970 kaufman et al 1990 the conservative nature of the cl over the higher range makes it remain in the solutions even under high evaporation rates at this stage na is removed but not cl as the halite product remains below the saturation level even when chloride concentrations reach extremely high levels the spring s water concentrated by evaporation discharges water into the lakes alkaline hot springs recharge seasonal runoff and dissolution of host volcanic bedrock contribute to the higher dominance of cl in easl kaufman et al 1990 pecoraino et al 2015 renaut et al 2021 the sulfate ion is less dominant among the anions in the easl as it contributes about 18 6 of the total anions the microbial reduction of sulfate ions to sulfide during organic matter degradation and loss of sulfate by sorption on the surface accounts for the sulfate ion content in rift valley soda lakes dunnette et al 1985 kilham 1984 also the so4 2 content is caused by anthropogenic activities such as sewage effluent discharge and fertilizer residual jiang et al 2009 the sulfate ion level is also associated with the dissolution of the gypsum minerals awaleh et al 2022 based on the water chemical type classification of the investigated lakes tables 4 and 5 we found that the soda water chemical type is more dominant in the region contributing about 75 9 distinguished by the dominant na among the cations with greater than 25 equivalent percentages and the dominant hco co3 as the most dominant ions with an equivalent percentage greater than 25 among the anion the dominance of the soda water chemical type over soda saline and saline in the ears justifies the dominance of dissolved na and hco co3 in the earv lakes furthermore we found that 14 8 of the investigated lakes are characterized by the saline water chemical type with dominant na among the cation and dominant cl among the anions and 9 3 are characterized by the soda saline group with na being the dominant cation and first in the rank of the cation dominance sequence and hco co3 with greater than 25 equivalent percentage but not first in the rank of the anion dominance sequence the spatial distribution pattern of na cl estimated co3 ions and tds figs 5 7 and appendix 1 has shown the north south tanzania kenya border increasing concentration gradient tendency in the eastern rift except for afrera lake in north ethiopia and uganda in the western rift the active volcanic and tectonic area most lakes are of volcanic and tectonic origin arid to semiarid climatic conditions the dominance of the volcanic rocks in the regions alkaline hot spring recharge and deep underground water connectivity below the rift valley contribute to the north south increasing concentration gradient tendency of na cl estimated co3 2 ions and tds in the eastern rift eugster 1970 fazi et al 2018 schagerl and renaut 2016 the spatially outlying high salinity and chloride for lake afrera in ethiopia is caused most likely by the tectonic magmatic hydrothermal event that occurred 7800 years ago in the area causing a sudden increase in the salinity level of the lake gasse et al 1974 the intersection location of the afrera lake features parallel and closer to the red sea is prone to earthquake occurrences also attributed to the distribution pattern of salinity bonatti et al 2017 the current depositions of the halite minerals and evaporation could be the reasons for the higher spatial distribution patterns of chloride in lake afrera similarly the same distribution pattern for salinity and chloride was seen in ugandan lakes these outlying distribution patterns can be explained by local productive saline springs discharging into these lakes and evaporative concentrations of the mineral water springs contributing to the significant amounts of cl and salinity arad and morton 1969 mungoma 1990 the chemical weathering of the igneous rocks also contributes to the higher spatial distribution patterns of sodium and carbonate garrels and mackenzie 1967 the tanzania kenya border especially lake natron and magad experienced a moderate concentration of cl and salinity but a higher proportion of carbonates a similar spatial distribution pattern for the cl and salinity was seen in lake manyara evaporative concentrations atmospheric input volcanic activity and chemical weathering of the mineral bearing rocks caused the spatial distribution patterns of salinity and chloride deocampo and renaut 2016 zaitsev and keller 2006 the spatial distribution maps for na and estimated co3 2 figs 5 and 7 showed significantly higher and moderate distributions of na and co3 2 in ugandan lakes this higher distribution pattern was similar to the results reported by kasedde et al 2014 the evaporative concentrations small alkaline springs connecting to the lakes and chemical weathering of the igneous rocks contribute to the higher spatial distribution patterns of na and co3 2 garrels and mackenzie 1967 kasedde et al 2014 similarly both higher and moderate spatial distribution patterns of na were seen in lakes manyara natron and magad while the higher spatial distributions of co3 2 were seen in lake magad and the moderate spatial distributions in lake bogoria and baringo kenya chemical weathering of rock minerals evaporative deposits atmospheric inputs and excessive evaporation of lake water account for the spatial distribution patterns of sodium and carbonate deocampo and renaut 2016 nielsen 1999 vincens and casanova 1987 the higher spatial distributions of major ions in the east african rift valley lakes may result in freshwater and soil salinization the dissolved salt intrusions into the land and climate change are probably the main environmental drivers for freshwater and soil salinization in the rift valley regions salinization is the most serious threat to freshwater ecosystems affecting the quality and provisioning of water and related ecosystem services all over the world and potentially leading to freshwater scarcity in the regions 5 conclusions this regional review compiled the ionic composition data from 54 inland soda and saline waters of the easl into a single comprehensive database making it the first and most comprehensive regional chemical review in the area the equivalent percentage calculations of the ions data revealed the following dominance sequence of major cations and major anions na k ca2 mg2 and hco3 co3 2 cl so4 2 the simplified exact classification method of the water chemical type helped us to classify easl for the investigated lakes 75 were classified as soda water chemical type 9 3 were classified as soda saline lakes and 15 7 were classified as saline water chemical type the modified formula for estimating the carbonate and bicarbonate based on the total alkalinity and ph is useful to determine the concrete carbonate and bicarbonate concentrations in water therefore the modified method will be of great benefit in determining precisely how much carbonate and bicarbonate concentrations are present in water the spatial distribution patterns of na cl co3 2 ions and tds in the eastern rift showed an increasing concentration gradient tendency from north to south except for afrera lake in north ethiopia and uganda western rift the intrusion of dissolved salts into the land by rift valley soda saline lakes is an environmental driver in an increasing trend of salinization of the soil and freshwater and this will probably result in a decrease in the region s freshwater resources credit authorship

7711,study region robit bata and dengeshita watersheds upper blue nile basin ethiopia study focus sustainable development of groundwater in the ethiopian highlands requires recharge measurements the water table fluctuation wtf method has been used to measure recharge lateral flow in sloping hillside aquifers violates the assumptions on which the original wtf method is based we modified the original wtf method to include lateral flow controlled by gravity new hydrological insights previously it was shown that the sum of recharge over the travel time in a sloping aquifer is equal to the base flow since recharge cannot be measured directly the recharge calculated with the modified wtf method was tested using baseflow measurement in two contrasting highland watersheds robit bata and dengeshita where groundwater depth and streamflow data were monitored from 2015 to 2018 baseflow was determined with the one parameter digital filter technique predicted and observed monthly baseflow agreed well with r2 0 9 and rmse 20 mm during calibration and validation recharge in robit bata in which the aquifer underlays 55 of the watershed was 293 mm a 1 of 1378 mm a 1 precipitation in dengeshita where the entire watershed has an aquifer the average annual recharge was 525 mm a 1 of 1550 mm a 1 our findings indicate that the modified wtf method is simple and practical for determining aquifer recharge for highlands and other sloping aquifers graphical abstract ga1 keywords baseflow groundwater recharge water table fluctuation sloping aquifer ethiopian highlands data

moreover access to groundwater and per capita food production are threatened by the change in climate funk and brown 2009 groundwater is recharged by water percolating downwards from the root zone chen and teegavarapu 2020 and part of the recharge will be baseflow that originates from groundwater storage baseflow can therefore potentially be a proxy for groundwater recharge sanz and recio 2011 zomlot et al 2015 risser et al 2009 used a long term average baseflow to estimate recharge in east central pennsylvania and recommended some adjustments for evapotranspiration in addition zomlot et al 2015 showed baseflow could reasonably approximate recharge dependent on watershed characteristics however when evapotranspiration losses from riparian vegetation are significant base flow cannot be a proxy for recharge due to pumping from groundwater rutledge 2005 wittenberg et al 2019 in monsoon climates when the soil is at field capacity during the rain phase all vegetation transpires at the potential rate and pumping does not affect the groundwater water balance alemie et al 2019 estimating recharge to shallow groundwater in unconfined sloping aquifers is complicated due to the complex

displacement methods chen and teegavarapu 2020 jassas and merkel 2014 kung et al 2013 the water table fluctuation method is widely used to quantify groundwater recharge from the time series of groundwater level records taken from unconfined aquifers healy and cook 2002 and will be adapted for use in sloping aquifers in this study recharge calculated with the original water table fluctuation wtf method using water levels in wells is simple white 1932 ophocleous 1991 however it does not accurately measure the recharge in an aquifer because the method assumes that lateral flow is negligible the sideways movement of groundwater i e lateral flow above the sloping impermeable layer at a relatively shallow depth is a significant drainage of groundwater recharged in sloping aquifers alemie et al 2019 tilahun et al 2020 once lateral flow exits the aquifer towards a stream it is called baseflow modifying the standard wtf method to include lateral flow would be attractive to calculate recharge in these areas adaptions to the wtf method to include lateral flow were made by guillaumot et al 2022 by introducing the lateral flow as a boundary condition in the 1 d groundwater flow equation heppner et al 2007 developed master recession curve mrc for each well in which they related the lateral flow with the groundwater table height the lateral flow was calculated as the product of the drainable porosity and the rate of the groundwater table decline during periods without rainfall this method was subsequently used successfully in catchments in germany jie et al 2011 the usa delin et al 2007 nimmo et al 2015 and poland gumuła kawęcka et al 2022 the mrc method developed by heppner et al 2007 inherently assumes that the water table height drives the lateral flow and that gravity effects are negligible therefore the mrc method is only valid in plains and should be adapted to the ethiopian highlands where gravity is the main component of the hydraulic gradient alemie et al 2019 and tilaun et al 2020 documented the role of gravity in lateral flow of the ethiopian highalnds moreover in a monsoon climate with a distinct dry and wet season the water table is below its maximum level when the rain phase ends preventing to calculate the lateral flow for the shallow groundwater table depths when constructing the mrc in addition both recharge and drainage happen at the same time in monsoonal climate unlike the temperate climate fiorotto and caroni 2013 since the aquifers in the highlands are much smaller than in the plains we apply the wtf method over the entire aquifer in this way we can use the baseflow as a proxy for the lateral flow and the average water table rise from the aquifer as a measure of the recharge streamflow data can be obtained by installing a weir streamflow records are also available in ethiopia for most medium to large watersheds baseflow can be obtained from streamflow in addition groundwater table observations are relatively easily obtained from hand dug wells by employing citizen science rigler et al 2022 many hand dug wells exist in the ethiopian highland areas with aquifers therefore the main objective of this study was to quantify and derive an accurate method to estimate shallow groundwater recharge in the volcanic sub humid and humid ethiopian highlands with sloping aquifers based on readily available data such as water table depth and baseflow the developed method will make it possible to assess the physical impact of land degradation climate change and increasing acreage of eucalyptus trees enku et al 2020 mhiret et al 2019 on groundwater recharge from observed streamflow records and groundwater table measurements 2 the two watersheds the two watersheds in the sub humid and humid ethiopian highlands are located in the lake tana basin the 57 km2 dengeshita watershed and the 9 km2 robit bata watershed fig 1 dengeshita is located about 80 km southwest of bahir dar city and drains into a perennial stream called the brantie river that flows to gilgel abbay river in the lake tana basin the elevation of the dengeshita watershed ranges from 2037 to 2436 m a s l the climate is sub tropical with an average annual rainfall of 1660 mm a 1 during the study period from 2015 to 2018 the average temperature ranged from 13 to 23 c the brantie river receives a contribution from spring flow originating at a geographical coordinate of 11 29 n and 36 87 e the robit bata watershed is about 30 km northeast of bahir dar the elevation ranges from 1800 to 2030 m a s l the average annual rainfall was 1377 mm over the study period the average temperature ranged from 14 c to 30 c the river in the watershed that drains into lake tana flows from june to january the river was dry from january to may cropland is the main land use in both watersheds with 65 of the land in the dengeshita watershed and 74 in the robit bata watershed sishu et al 2021 cereal crops maize sorghum millet and teff and vegetables onion garlic cabbage potato tomato and pepper were cultivated in dengeshita 18 is grassland and 14 has eucalyptus trees the remaining 3 is a mix of wasteland roads and homesteads robit bata has 5 grassland 4 eucalyptus and 13 irrigated horticultural land and the remaining land uses are roads and homesteads shallow groundwater hand dug wells are common in both watersheds and were constructed by farmers tilahun et al 2020 walker et al 2019 the wells have been used for domestic water supply in the dry phase wells are used for irrigation on 13 of the land in robit bata and 1 in dengeshita manual water lifting technologies such as pulleys ropes and washers are widely used to lift water from wells forty one percent of the dengeshita watershed has a 0 4 slope robit bata is more sloping with only 18 of the slopes between 0 and 4 sishu et al 2021 the soil texture of the topsoil in both watersheds was clay loam the geology of the dengeshita watershed consists of weathered quaternary basalt regolith above the massive basalt bedrock formation with sand and gravel superficial materials in the flood plains nigate et al 2016 walker et al 2019 the regolith is overlain by red soils all over the watershed which is more lithic and clayey with depth and other superficial materials underlying the flood plains which are often brown fig s1 the transmissivity of this quaternary basalt ranges from 100 to 200 m2 day bceom 1999 in robit bata quaternary basalt is the geological unity overlain by the dominant quaternary lacustrine and alluvial deposits where the aquifer is located nigate et al 2016 the transmissivity of these deposits is 700 m2 day bceom 1999 the wide hillslope area with limited soil water storage is covered by red soils of limited tillage depth thickness of 30 cm fig s1 3 material and methods this study was conducted to estimate shallow groundwater recharge in the ethiopian highlands and was tested in two experimental watersheds i e the dengeshita watershed and the robit bata watershed the groundwater recharge in each watershed was computed from groundwater level measurement using the water table fluctuation wtf method modified to include lateral flow discharge measurements were used to estimate the baseflow using digital filtering techniques 3 1 data collection precipitation in dengeshita the rainfall records for four years 2015 2018 were obtained from the dangila meteorological station 5 km from the watershed in robit bata precipitation data were obtained from the national meteorological agency nma of the zenzelima weather station located 3 4 km from the watershed streamflow discharge streamflow rates at the watershed outlets were obtained from daily stage measurements from 2015 to 2018 the streamflow stage heights were collected by installing manual staff gauges at the watershed outlets local data collectors were hired to measure the daily streamflow stage every morning during storm events stage measurements were conducted at 10 minute intervals to determine the peak discharge the surface flow velocities were measured during each stage using the float method and were multiplied by 0 9 to determine the average flow velocity a coefficient of 0 9 was taken from uhunmwangho et al 2018 for smooth river beds the cross sectional areas were multiplied by the average flow velocities to estimate the river flow flow rating curves stage versus discharge were developed from these data and used to convert the stage measurement to streamflow rate using a power equation the total streamflow rates were divided by the entire watershed area to obtain the flow rates in depth groundwater level a total of 23 hand dug wells in dengeshita and 29 hand dug wells in robit bata watersheds were monitored fig 1 for their water level fluctuations during the study period from 2015 to 2018 the selected wells were located in areas where the wells were concentrated groundwater levels were monitored daily in the rain phase and weekly in the dry phase in 2015 2016 and 2017 in the early morning before farmers extracted water in the dengeshita watershed in robit bata weekly groundwater table levels were monitored in 2015 2016 and 2017 in 2018 monthly groundwater levels were recorded in both watersheds the groundwater depths ranged from 3 m near the stream to 21 m on the upper slopes in the dengeshita watershed while it ranged from 6 m to 19 m in the robit bata watershed the main limitation of the wtf approach in estimating the recharge is the uncertainty in the exact value of specific yield delottier et al 2018 here we calibrate the specific yield for the first year using previously reported specific yields as the starting point a specific yield of 0 065 cm3 cm 3 was assumed for groundwater wells in the dengeshita watershed by yenehun et al 2020 it was computed using a water balance approach related to groundwater level rise only and thus likely overestimates the specific yield as the lateral flow was not considered walker et al 2019 and gowing et al 2020 found a value of 0 08 cm3 cm 3 for the same watershed based on pump tests of 11 wells at the same location with some at deeper depth the average for the robit bata wells reported by tilahun et al 2020 was 0 045 cm3 cm 3 it was the average drainable porosities of soil samples taken near the water table at the time of the well installation 3 1 1 baseflow and baseflow index baseflow from the available streamflow data can be estimated by applying a variety of methods such as the web based hydrograph analysis tool what alemie et al 2019 bahrami et al 2019 bayou et al 2021 eckhardt 2008 hung vu and merkel 2019 kang et al 2019 bflow chen and teegavarapu 2020 eckhardt 2008 hydrograph separation program hysep kang et al 2019 manual hydrograph separation method bahrami et al 2019 partitioning computer program part eckhardt 2008 kang et al 2019 models of all models the bflow one parameter digital filter method is the simplest arnold et al 1995 is reliable kang et al 2022 and is realistic according to nathan and mcmahon 1990 who tested the model on 122 catchments in new south wales and victoria australia finally the method is ideal for developing countries with limited streamflow data ahiablame et al 2013 andualem et al 2021 the bflow single parameter recursive digital filter technique was initially used in signal analysis and processing the high frequency signal interpreted as filtered runoff is calculated first chapman 1999 1 q t β q t 1 1 β 2 q t q t 1 where q t is the filtered surface runoff at the t time step q t is the original streamflow and β is the filter parameter q t 1 is the streamflow at time t 1 the base flow b t can then be calculated as 2 b t q t q t the filter passes over the streamflow three times backward forward and backward keeping the baseflow filter parameter β in this study we used β 0 925 that was considered by nathan and mcmahon 1990 and gave the most realistic baseflow estimates based on 122 catchments the annual baseflow index bfi was calculated as the quotient of the yearly total base flow and total streamflow over the same period singh et al 2019 for the monthly base flow indices monthly totals were used 3 1 2 groundwater recharge 3 1 2 1 standard wtf method the groundwater recharge has been calculated using the original water level fluctuation wtf method white 1932 it was originally applied to the escalante valley aquifer of utah and the positive water level fluctuation to calculate the groundwater recharge as discussed above the method assumes that lateral flow is negligible 3a r s y h t for h t 0 3b r 0 for h t 0 where r t is the recharge to the aquifer m day over the aquifer area s y is the specific yield h is the change in spatially averaged water table height yimam et al 2021 observed that recharge estimated using eq 3 in the ethiopian highland matched closely with the swat simulations by worqlul et al 2019 this result was expected since swat and the original wtf method have equivalent assumptions for groundwater walker et al 2019 concluded based on twenty five wells that the wtf method calculated recharge was overestimated 3 1 2 2 developing the wtf method for sloping aquifers in the ethiopian highlands the hillsides and valley bottoms are sloping and lateral flow cannot be neglected especially if daily or longer water table measurements are used alemie et al 2019 tilahun et al 2020 moreover due to its volcanic origin the geology is extremely variable and the entire watershed may not be underlain by an aquifer fig s1 to derive the wtf method for aquifers in the ethiopian highlands we start with a simple mass balance for the average water table change in the hillslope aquifer by neglecting evaporation and percolation through faults in the basalt 4 s y h t t a q r q t a w q w b t a q where a q is the aquifer area a w is the area of the watershed q w b t is the baseflow measured at the outlet expressed in depth units per unit time m day r q is the recharge per unit area on the aquifer portion of the aquifer h t is the average water table height of the entire aquifer at time t neglecting evaporation during the rain phase is justified because the rootzone is near or above field capacity and satisfies the evaporative demand in our conceptualization any percolation in the basalt faults that does not surface in the watershed is considered unaccounted water at the outlet this uncounted water is converted to an equivalent portion of the watershed not underlain by the aquifer in the non aquifer part of the watershed rainfall infiltrates or becomes direct runoff when the soil is saturated the infiltrated water is subsequently lost by evapotranspiration or deep percolation eq 4 can be rearranged to become an explicit function of the recharge r as 5 r q t a q s y h t t a w q w b t a q alemie et al 2019 employed the method of characteristics to derive an equation for baseflow from hillslopes by assuming the convective term due to gravity dominates the diffusivity term over time scales over one day under these conditions the hydraulic gradient equals the slope of the restricting layer they showed that baseflow could be written as the average recharge over the travel time t d from the top of the aquifer to the point of interest viz 6 q w b t a q a w t d t t d t 1 r q t note that the ratio of aquifer area to watershed area is introduced in eq 6 because both baseflow and recharge are expressed in volume of water per unit time per unit area the total area for the baseflow since it is measured at the outlet is the watershed area and for the recharge it is the aquifer area substituting eq 6 into eq 5 gives 7 r q t a q s y h t t a q t d t t d t 1 r q t a w when measurements are perfect and there are no other losses from the aquifer r q t will not be negative as can be seen from eq 5 since for r q t 0 the change in the water table is equal to the outflow adjusted for the areas therefore the wtf can be formulated for sloping aquifers as follows 8a r q t a q s y h t t 1 t d t t d t 1 r q t a w for h t 0 8b r q t 0 for h t 0 thus the recharge on day t for sloping aquifers can be determined as the average spatial change in water table height on day t plus the recharge calculated earlier for the previous days averaged over the travel time 3 1 2 3 evaluation of the modified wtf method we cannot test the calculated recharge directly since only a few time consuming techniques measure recharge directly steenhuis et al 1985 an indirect approach to test the recharge for sloping aquifers is using eq 6 which indicates that the average recharge over the subsurface flow travel time should equal the base flow we integrate eq 4 to get eq 9 to find these parameters 9 h h o s y a q r q t dt a w q b t a q since there is no carry over of groundwater from one year to the next and h h o at the end of the hydrologic year the cumulative recharge should equal the cumulative baseflow this allows us to find the parameters of the specific yield and travel time which is part of r t and the portion of the watershed underlain by the aquifer using eq 9 the specific yield and the area ratios are correlated in the equation but they are physically constrained and that the aquifer area ratio is actually the parameter that determines the baseflow and specific yield can be referred from literatures if there are no prior knowledge for calibration we used the hydrologic year 2015 from may 2015 to april 2016 to find the specific yield travel time and the aquifer portion for the two watersheds then we used the remainder of the data hydrologic years 2016 may 2016 to april 2017 2017 may 2017 to april 2018 and 2018 may 2018 to dec 2018 for validation the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean squared error rmse were selected chicco et al 2021 to determine the correlation and errors between cumulative observed baseflow and cumulative predicted baseflow using eq 6 to evaluate the new modified wtf method 4 results the daily rainfall discharge and separated baseflow hydrograph are shown in fig 2 the precipitation and discharge started earlier in dengeshita than in robit bata for both watersheds the baseflow is increasing in time until august when the rainfalls become less frequent the baseflow start to decrease 4 1 annual precipitation discharge and baseflow the annual streamflow and baseflow in both watersheds increased with greater annual rainfall table 1 the average yearly rainfall in robit bata was 1378 mm a 1 and in dengeshita 1550 mm a 1 it resulted on average in 577 mm a 1 streamflow and 259 mm a 1 baseflow in robit bata and 903 mm a 1 streamflow of which 519 mm a 1 was baseflow nearly 60 of the discharge was baseflow in dengeshita average annual baseflow index of 0 57 table 1 in robit bata the baseflow was 44 of the discharge 4 2 monthly baseflow index the monthly baseflow index is presented with the corresponding monthly rainfall in table 2 for both dengeshita and robit bata watersheds in the dengeshita watershed the baseflow was more than 50 of the streamflow during the dry season during 2015 from october to april the baseflow index ranged from 54 to 78 for the same period from 2016 to 2018 the baseflow contribution to the total streamflow ranged from 50 to 100 the baseflow was the greatest portion of the streamflow in march from 2016 to 2018 when it was about 100 during the rainfall season may to september the baseflow index was around 50 of the total flow the baseflow in the robit bata watershed was from 10 to 80 during the rain phase the baseflow index in the dry season was in the range of 40 80 the flow was not observed in the stream from january to may in 2015 the streamflow measurement was stopped in early november so baseflow data were unavailable for two months before the stream dried up 4 3 time series of groundwater level data in fig 3 the average groundwater depth of the dengeshita watershed is presented for three well depth ranges less than 5 m between 5 m and 10 m and greater than 10 m robit bata has two depth ranges 5 10 m and above 10 m the difference is due to the depth of the bedrock bedrock is 6 19 m deep in the robit bata and 3 21 m in the dengeshita in general the water level fluctuation rose towards the ground surface from the beginning of the rain phase until the end of the rains and then declined in the dengeshita watershed fig 3a the groundwater table was near the ground surface during the rainfall phase for shallow wells near the stream 5 m depth deeper water tables mostly located on the upper slopes vary over a greater depth than shallow wells when it gets dry the water level drops to around 4 m for wells less than 5 m in depth 8 m for wells between 5 m and 10 m and 12 m for wells greater than 10 m in depth on average the base level h0 is 8 m in dengeshita similar groundwater table fluctuations were observed in the robit bata watershed for the rainfall phase and dry periods fig 3b the average water level fluctuation between drying and wetting was 3 5 m in robot bata the water level drops to 6 m and 11 m for wells 5 10 m and above 10 m depths respectively this leads to an average base level depth of 8 5 m 4 4 calculated shallow groundwater recharge the first step in finding the baseflow and recharge relationship is finding the values of the aquifer portion of the watershed and the specific yield with the aid of eq 9 which states that on an annual basis the observed recharge should equal the observed baseflow the calibration to fit observed baseflow with calculated baseflow using eq 6 in the 2015 hydrologic year produced specific yields of 0 05 and 0 06 cm3 cm3 for dengeshita and robit bata watersheds respectively it is within the range of previous reports in the watersheds table 3 observed specific yields varied between 0 045 cm3 cm3 tilahun et al 2020 and 0 08 cm3 cm3 walker et al 2019 gowing et al 2020 previous studies showed that a sloping aquifer underlays the entire dengeshita watershed sishu et al 2021 between 50 and 60 of the watershed in robit bata consisted of a hillslope aquifer tilahun et al 2020 with these calibration parameters the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 97 for robit bata and 0 91 for dengeshita root mean squared error was less than 16 mm for robit and less than 22 mm in dengeshita fig 4 shows the scatter plot of observed and predicted baseflow with the coefficient of determination during validation for the period from 2016 to 2018 hydrologic years the baseflow was used to calculate recharge using eq 9 of modified wtf the calculated annual shallow groundwater recharges based on the 23 monitoring wells in the dengeshita watershed were 447 557 and 573 mm a 1 for 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively the three year calculated average recharge was 525 mm a 1 the annual calculated groundwater recharges for robit bata for the three consecutive years starting in 2015 based on the measured water table levels of 29 monitoring wells were 352 253 and 275 mm a 1 the three year average recharge was 293 mm the 2018 calculation was excluded as the monthly water level data underestimates baseflow and recharge estimation 4 5 baseflow and groundwater recharge relationship the annual plotted data for the hydrologic years starting at the beginning of the rain phase in fig 4 indicated a reasonable agreement for the input parameters in table 3 the last hydrologic year beginning in april 2018 was excluded for both watersheds because monthly data did not allow quantification of the recharge as will be discussed later the 2015 hydrologic year in robit bata ended on 1 november 2015 because the streamflow was not measured after october the annual recharge and baseflow in mm per entire watershed to the shallow aquifer was much larger in dengeshita than in robit bata because the rainfall and the aquifer portion were greater in dengeshita fig 6 shows the average cumulative precipitation cumulatively calculated baseflow based on the modified wtf method and cumulative observed baseflow for each of the four hydrologic years the calculations were done in the hydrologic year in general the fit between the cumulative observed and predicted baseflow was good except for the 2018 rain phase when only monthly groundwater table data were available the monthly data could not represent the water table fluctuations during the month and therefore underestimated the recharge and consequently the base flow in 2015 not all observed baseflow data in robit bata were available so only the portion for which the data is available is shown in the dengeshita watershed the stream was perennial the baseflow started exceeding the wtf recharge in september and at the end of the year the cumulative baseflow was 510 mm and the modified wtf recharge was nearly equal at 525 mm fig 6a it is consistent with a previous study by sishu et al sishu et al 2021 they showed that the water balance for the dengeshita watershed closed i e the sum of evapotranspiration and discharge equals the rainfall thus for these conditions as explained above the annual baseflow should equal the yearly wtf recharge for rabit bata only about 55 of the area contributed baseflow and became equal to the recharge 5 discussion 5 1 baseflow we used baseflow for the recharge calculations the amount of baseflow in a watershed depends on the watershed characteristics and the method used to calculate the baseflow brodie and hostetler 2005 fig 5 shows that the baseflow calculated from digital filtration and the modified wtf method fit reasonably well it is however helpful to compare our calculated baseflow with others in the lake tana basin table 5 for example the amount of baseflow estimated using the eckhardt method for the major sub basins of the blue nile basin ribb gummara megech and gilgel abay by abiy et al 2016 ranged from 350 to 717 mm a 1 using the usgs software part baseflow in ribb and gummara were estimated as 119 and 561 mm a 1 with their baseflow index at the river outlet as 35 and 59 respectively according to andualem et al 2021 the gumara watershed has more baseflow discharge and groundwater recharge than the ribb watershed the small amount of baseflow in the rib is caused by the fact the that the water balance does not close zimale et al 2018 due to water lost through faults to the adjacent takeze basin adem et al 2020 considering that an aquifer underlies only 55 of the robit bata watershed our baseflow index of 44 in table 2 is close to that of gumura which includes recharge from upstream areas that are underlain by aquifers and that surfaces in the lower portions of the watershed in the kilti watershed close to the dengeshita watershed gowing et al 2020 reported 214 mm as baseflow from dry season streamflow measurement the order of magnitude is similar to our estimate in table 2 if one adds baseflow estimates during dry months from october to april the corresponding base flow index reported from kilit was 52 which is approximately similar to our estimates of 57 for dengeshita in addition our findings of the monthly base flow index were found to decrease with the corresponding increase in precipitation indicating that runoff increases in the watershed drive saturation excess as compared with the increment in baseflow found at the watershed outlet resulting in the increased runoff than baseflow yimam et al 2019 besides both baseflow and streamflow variations increased with increasing precipitation fig 2a and fig 2b the two year 2017 and 2018 mean annual baseflow estimated for the dengeshita watershed according to sishu et al 2021 was 782 mm 84 of total streamflow according to our study the four year 2015 2018 mean annual baseflow 511 mm was around 57 of the total discharge the basic difference is that a greater portion of the subsurface flow was included in sishu et al 2021 which occurred during and shortly after the runoff event 5 2 groundwater recharge it is generally understood that the long term water withdrawal of aquifers is sustainable when the recharge equals groundwater withdrawals this argument is valid for large aquifers with a minimal slope where the hydraulic gradient is independent of the landscape slope such as in the north china plain steenhuis and yang 2021 or large delta areas along the coast under these conditions the baseflow from the aquifer is small compared to its inputs sustainability and recharge in the sloping aquifers discussed here are much more complex as seen in fig 7 where the cumulative recharge and baseflow together with the groundwater storage are plotted the storage was calculated based on the aquifer averaged water table depth h in fig 3 which was expressed as a depth of the whole watershed and subtracted from ho which was the maximum groundwater level depth from the surface of the wells during the dry phase initially in the rain phase the water storage increases proportional to the recharge but then the storage drops rapidly as the baseflow increases thus there is very little recharge left as storage in the aquifer three to four months after the rain phase ends the storage in robit bata was similar to tilahun et al 2020 5 3 evaluating the modified water table fluctuation wtf method in this manuscript the original wtf method was modified the original water level fluctuation wtf method eq 3 assumes that the lateral flow can be neglected in the recharge calculation obviously that is not the case for the sloping hillside aquifers and will underpredict the annual recharge as shown in table 4 and is not correlated with the baseflow monthly fig 8 the underprediction with the original wtf in the dengeshita watershed was around 55 of the observed baseflow using the same specific yield as in table 3 for the hydrologic years of 2015 2018 the 2018 2019 prediction in fig 6 was even less because monthly observation cannot sufficiently represent the groundwater table fluctuations the recharge prediction with the original wtf approach in table 4 in the robit bata was closer to the observed baseflow measurements if the aquifer would underlie the entire watershed however this is not the case tilahun et al 2020 showed that the aquifer underlay 52 of the watershed in this study the calibration showed that 55 of the watershed had an aquifer the modified wtf method predicted the observed baseflow well except for 2015 in robit bata table 4 the reason for the disagreement in 2015 was that baseflow measurements were not taken in november and december even though the river was flowing the mean annual recharge calculated with the modified wtf method was 293 mm a 1 in robit bata and 525 mm a 1 in dengeshita our calculated recharge in robit bata is within the recharge in the ethiopian highlands as stated by kebede 2013 of less than 400 mm a 1 however in dengeshita our calculated recharge was greater than 400 mm a 1 likely because the rainfall in dengishita is high the entire watershed has an aquifer groundwater recharge was also reported for both watersheds by worqlul et al 2019 using swat and was from 247 to 317 mm a 1in robit bata and from 284 to 456 mm a 1 in dangishita table 5 our calculated recharge was close to swat in robit bata and greater in dengeshita the swat model assumes that the entire watershed has an aquifer for the model to fit the discharge at the outlet to that observed the recharge is underestimated in dangishita in robit bata the agreement is better because a too small recharge value offsets the too large watershed area higher groundwater recharge of about 800 mm a 1 was reported in the alluvial deposited aquifer with a very flat slope 0 1 slope in the fogera plain close to the robit bata watershed by enku et al 2017 in the plain the direct runoff is less than in the sloping watershed hence a large portion of the rainfall becomes recharge gowing et al 2020 used the original wtf method and found as expected a smaller recharge 350 mm a 1 than our calculated value in the same dangishita area 5 4 caution to specific yield a specific yield s y is an important variable in converting water table height into the amount of groundwater recharge healy and cook 2002 estimation of s y needs caution in the water table fluctuation approach in this study we found s y values of 5 in robit bata and 6 in dangishita table 3 gowing et al 2020 and walker et al 2019 reported a specific yield of 0 09 in the area around dengeshita while yenehun et al 2020 found specific yields ranging from 0 03 to 0 62 with an average of 0 044 based on distinct increases in groundwater levels in the area of robit bata abera beyene et al 2019 estimated very varied values that range from 0 038 to 0 22 using various methods such as moisture tension texture method and mechanical analysis and the heterogeneous soil across fields likely caused the wide range a moisture tension approach by tilahun et al 2020 in robit bata was estimated at around 0 045 our estimates of 0 06 in this study are within the ranges of previous works as the soils are clayey sy values for alluvial deposits range from 1 to 10 mean 6 as bradford and acreman 2003 reported using smaller values of s y for recharge estimation and sustainable use of groundwater is recommended by healy and cook 2002 6 conclusions the challenge with the original water table fluctuation method is that it is assumed that lateral flow is negligible and the aquifer is continuous and underlies the entire area these assumptions are not valid in the ethiopian highland where lateral flow is not insignificant and aquifers can only be found in part of the watershed with deep soils this study was conducted to modify the original water table fluctuation method to estimate recharge and baseflow from available groundwater level and streamflow data a key assumption in the model development is that the sum of recharge over the travel time to the stream in a sloping aquifer equals the base flow the recharge calculated with the modified wtf method was tested using baseflow measurement in two contrasting highland watersheds robit bata and dengeshita where groundwater depth and streamflow data were monitored from 2015 2018 the recharge predictions of around 300 mm a 1 for robit bata and just over 500 mm a 1 for dengeshita seemed reasonable and portions of the watershed underlain by the aquifer approximately half of the robit bata watershed and the entire dengeshita watershed the new approach to determining recharge is valid for other highland and sloping watersheds where water level and streamflow data are available or could be measured with citizens who derive water from wells funding the study was

7711,study region robit bata and dengeshita watersheds upper blue nile basin ethiopia study focus sustainable development of groundwater in the ethiopian highlands requires recharge measurements the water table fluctuation wtf method has been used to measure recharge lateral flow in sloping hillside aquifers violates the assumptions on which the original wtf method is based we modified the original wtf method to include lateral flow controlled by gravity new hydrological insights previously it was shown that the sum of recharge over the travel time in a sloping aquifer is equal to the base flow since recharge cannot be measured directly the recharge calculated with the modified wtf method was tested using baseflow measurement in two contrasting highland watersheds robit bata and dengeshita where groundwater depth and streamflow data were monitored from 2015 to 2018 baseflow was determined with the one parameter digital filter technique predicted and observed monthly baseflow agreed well with r2 0 9 and rmse 20 mm during calibration and validation recharge in robit bata in which the aquifer underlays 55 of the watershed was 293 mm a 1 of 1378 mm a 1 precipitation in dengeshita where the entire watershed has an aquifer the average annual recharge was 525 mm a 1 of 1550 mm a 1 our findings indicate that the modified wtf method is simple and practical for determining aquifer recharge for highlands and other sloping aquifers graphical abstract ga1 keywords baseflow groundwater recharge water table fluctuation sloping aquifer ethiopian highlands data

moreover access to groundwater and per capita food production are threatened by the change in climate funk and brown 2009 groundwater is recharged by water percolating downwards from the root zone chen and teegavarapu 2020 and part of the recharge will be baseflow that originates from groundwater storage baseflow can therefore potentially be a proxy for groundwater recharge sanz and recio 2011 zomlot et al 2015 risser et al 2009 used a long term average baseflow to estimate recharge in east central pennsylvania and recommended some adjustments for evapotranspiration in addition zomlot et al 2015 showed baseflow could reasonably approximate recharge dependent on watershed characteristics however when evapotranspiration losses from riparian vegetation are significant base flow cannot be a proxy for recharge due to pumping from groundwater rutledge 2005 wittenberg et al 2019 in monsoon climates when the soil is at field capacity during the rain phase all vegetation transpires at the potential rate and pumping does not affect the groundwater water balance alemie et al 2019 estimating recharge to shallow groundwater in unconfined sloping aquifers is complicated due to the complex

displacement methods chen and teegavarapu 2020 jassas and merkel 2014 kung et al 2013 the water table fluctuation method is widely used to quantify groundwater recharge from the time series of groundwater level records taken from unconfined aquifers healy and cook 2002 and will be adapted for use in sloping aquifers in this study recharge calculated with the original water table fluctuation wtf method using water levels in wells is simple white 1932 ophocleous 1991 however it does not accurately measure the recharge in an aquifer because the method assumes that lateral flow is negligible the sideways movement of groundwater i e lateral flow above the sloping impermeable layer at a relatively shallow depth is a significant drainage of groundwater recharged in sloping aquifers alemie et al 2019 tilahun et al 2020 once lateral flow exits the aquifer towards a stream it is called baseflow modifying the standard wtf method to include lateral flow would be attractive to calculate recharge in these areas adaptions to the wtf method to include lateral flow were made by guillaumot et al 2022 by introducing the lateral flow as a boundary condition in the 1 d groundwater flow equation heppner et al 2007 developed master recession curve mrc for each well in which they related the lateral flow with the groundwater table height the lateral flow was calculated as the product of the drainable porosity and the rate of the groundwater table decline during periods without rainfall this method was subsequently used successfully in catchments in germany jie et al 2011 the usa delin et al 2007 nimmo et al 2015 and poland gumuła kawęcka et al 2022 the mrc method developed by heppner et al 2007 inherently assumes that the water table height drives the lateral flow and that gravity effects are negligible therefore the mrc method is only valid in plains and should be adapted to the ethiopian highlands where gravity is the main component of the hydraulic gradient alemie et al 2019 and tilaun et al 2020 documented the role of gravity in lateral flow of the ethiopian highalnds moreover in a monsoon climate with a distinct dry and wet season the water table is below its maximum level when the rain phase ends preventing to calculate the lateral flow for the shallow groundwater table depths when constructing the mrc in addition both recharge and drainage happen at the same time in monsoonal climate unlike the temperate climate fiorotto and caroni 2013 since the aquifers in the highlands are much smaller than in the plains we apply the wtf method over the entire aquifer in this way we can use the baseflow as a proxy for the lateral flow and the average water table rise from the aquifer as a measure of the recharge streamflow data can be obtained by installing a weir streamflow records are also available in ethiopia for most medium to large watersheds baseflow can be obtained from streamflow in addition groundwater table observations are relatively easily obtained from hand dug wells by employing citizen science rigler et al 2022 many hand dug wells exist in the ethiopian highland areas with aquifers therefore the main objective of this study was to quantify and derive an accurate method to estimate shallow groundwater recharge in the volcanic sub humid and humid ethiopian highlands with sloping aquifers based on readily available data such as water table depth and baseflow the developed method will make it possible to assess the physical impact of land degradation climate change and increasing acreage of eucalyptus trees enku et al 2020 mhiret et al 2019 on groundwater recharge from observed streamflow records and groundwater table measurements 2 the two watersheds the two watersheds in the sub humid and humid ethiopian highlands are located in the lake tana basin the 57 km2 dengeshita watershed and the 9 km2 robit bata watershed fig 1 dengeshita is located about 80 km southwest of bahir dar city and drains into a perennial stream called the brantie river that flows to gilgel abbay river in the lake tana basin the elevation of the dengeshita watershed ranges from 2037 to 2436 m a s l the climate is sub tropical with an average annual rainfall of 1660 mm a 1 during the study period from 2015 to 2018 the average temperature ranged from 13 to 23 c the brantie river receives a contribution from spring flow originating at a geographical coordinate of 11 29 n and 36 87 e the robit bata watershed is about 30 km northeast of bahir dar the elevation ranges from 1800 to 2030 m a s l the average annual rainfall was 1377 mm over the study period the average temperature ranged from 14 c to 30 c the river in the watershed that drains into lake tana flows from june to january the river was dry from january to may cropland is the main land use in both watersheds with 65 of the land in the dengeshita watershed and 74 in the robit bata watershed sishu et al 2021 cereal crops maize sorghum millet and teff and vegetables onion garlic cabbage potato tomato and pepper were cultivated in dengeshita 18 is grassland and 14 has eucalyptus trees the remaining 3 is a mix of wasteland roads and homesteads robit bata has 5 grassland 4 eucalyptus and 13 irrigated horticultural land and the remaining land uses are roads and homesteads shallow groundwater hand dug wells are common in both watersheds and were constructed by farmers tilahun et al 2020 walker et al 2019 the wells have been used for domestic water supply in the dry phase wells are used for irrigation on 13 of the land in robit bata and 1 in dengeshita manual water lifting technologies such as pulleys ropes and washers are widely used to lift water from wells forty one percent of the dengeshita watershed has a 0 4 slope robit bata is more sloping with only 18 of the slopes between 0 and 4 sishu et al 2021 the soil texture of the topsoil in both watersheds was clay loam the geology of the dengeshita watershed consists of weathered quaternary basalt regolith above the massive basalt bedrock formation with sand and gravel superficial materials in the flood plains nigate et al 2016 walker et al 2019 the regolith is overlain by red soils all over the watershed which is more lithic and clayey with depth and other superficial materials underlying the flood plains which are often brown fig s1 the transmissivity of this quaternary basalt ranges from 100 to 200 m2 day bceom 1999 in robit bata quaternary basalt is the geological unity overlain by the dominant quaternary lacustrine and alluvial deposits where the aquifer is located nigate et al 2016 the transmissivity of these deposits is 700 m2 day bceom 1999 the wide hillslope area with limited soil water storage is covered by red soils of limited tillage depth thickness of 30 cm fig s1 3 material and methods this study was conducted to estimate shallow groundwater recharge in the ethiopian highlands and was tested in two experimental watersheds i e the dengeshita watershed and the robit bata watershed the groundwater recharge in each watershed was computed from groundwater level measurement using the water table fluctuation wtf method modified to include lateral flow discharge measurements were used to estimate the baseflow using digital filtering techniques 3 1 data collection precipitation in dengeshita the rainfall records for four years 2015 2018 were obtained from the dangila meteorological station 5 km from the watershed in robit bata precipitation data were obtained from the national meteorological agency nma of the zenzelima weather station located 3 4 km from the watershed streamflow discharge streamflow rates at the watershed outlets were obtained from daily stage measurements from 2015 to 2018 the streamflow stage heights were collected by installing manual staff gauges at the watershed outlets local data collectors were hired to measure the daily streamflow stage every morning during storm events stage measurements were conducted at 10 minute intervals to determine the peak discharge the surface flow velocities were measured during each stage using the float method and were multiplied by 0 9 to determine the average flow velocity a coefficient of 0 9 was taken from uhunmwangho et al 2018 for smooth river beds the cross sectional areas were multiplied by the average flow velocities to estimate the river flow flow rating curves stage versus discharge were developed from these data and used to convert the stage measurement to streamflow rate using a power equation the total streamflow rates were divided by the entire watershed area to obtain the flow rates in depth groundwater level a total of 23 hand dug wells in dengeshita and 29 hand dug wells in robit bata watersheds were monitored fig 1 for their water level fluctuations during the study period from 2015 to 2018 the selected wells were located in areas where the wells were concentrated groundwater levels were monitored daily in the rain phase and weekly in the dry phase in 2015 2016 and 2017 in the early morning before farmers extracted water in the dengeshita watershed in robit bata weekly groundwater table levels were monitored in 2015 2016 and 2017 in 2018 monthly groundwater levels were recorded in both watersheds the groundwater depths ranged from 3 m near the stream to 21 m on the upper slopes in the dengeshita watershed while it ranged from 6 m to 19 m in the robit bata watershed the main limitation of the wtf approach in estimating the recharge is the uncertainty in the exact value of specific yield delottier et al 2018 here we calibrate the specific yield for the first year using previously reported specific yields as the starting point a specific yield of 0 065 cm3 cm 3 was assumed for groundwater wells in the dengeshita watershed by yenehun et al 2020 it was computed using a water balance approach related to groundwater level rise only and thus likely overestimates the specific yield as the lateral flow was not considered walker et al 2019 and gowing et al 2020 found a value of 0 08 cm3 cm 3 for the same watershed based on pump tests of 11 wells at the same location with some at deeper depth the average for the robit bata wells reported by tilahun et al 2020 was 0 045 cm3 cm 3 it was the average drainable porosities of soil samples taken near the water table at the time of the well installation 3 1 1 baseflow and baseflow index baseflow from the available streamflow data can be estimated by applying a variety of methods such as the web based hydrograph analysis tool what alemie et al 2019 bahrami

1995 is reliable kang et al 2022 and is realistic according to nathan and mcmahon 1990 who tested the model on 122 catchments in new south wales and victoria australia finally the method is ideal for developing countries with limited streamflow data ahiablame et al 2013 andualem et al 2021 the bflow single parameter recursive digital filter technique was initially used in signal analysis and processing the high frequency signal interpreted as filtered runoff is calculated first chapman 1999 1 q t β q t 1 1 β 2 q t q t 1 where q t is the filtered surface runoff at the t time step q t is the original streamflow and β is the filter parameter q t 1 is the streamflow at time t 1 the base flow b t can then be calculated as 2 b t q t q t the filter passes over the streamflow three times backward forward and backward keeping the baseflow filter parameter β in this study we used β 0 925 that was considered by nathan and mcmahon 1990 and gave the most realistic baseflow estimates based on 122 catchments the annual baseflow index bfi was calculated as the quotient of the yearly total base flow and total streamflow over the same period singh et al 2019 for the monthly base flow indices monthly totals were used 3 1 2 groundwater recharge 3 1 2 1 standard wtf method the groundwater recharge has been calculated using the original water level fluctuation wtf method white 1932 it was originally applied to the escalante valley aquifer of utah and the positive water level fluctuation to calculate the groundwater recharge as discussed above the method assumes that lateral flow is negligible 3a r s y h t for h t 0 3b r 0 for h t 0 where r t is the recharge to the aquifer m day over the aquifer area s y is the specific yield h is the change in spatially averaged water table height yimam et al 2021 observed that recharge estimated using eq 3 in the ethiopian highland matched closely with the swat simulations by worqlul et al 2019 this result was expected since swat and the original wtf method have equivalent assumptions for groundwater walker et al 2019 concluded based on twenty five wells that the wtf method calculated recharge was overestimated 3 1 2 2 developing the wtf method for sloping aquifers in the ethiopian highlands the hillsides and valley bottoms are sloping and lateral flow cannot be neglected especially if daily or longer water table measurements are used alemie et al 2019 tilahun et al 2020 moreover due to its volcanic origin the geology is extremely variable and the entire watershed may not be underlain by an aquifer fig s1 to derive the wtf method for aquifers in the ethiopian highlands we start with a simple mass balance for the average water table change in the hillslope aquifer by neglecting evaporation and percolation through faults in the basalt 4 s y h t t a q r q t a w q w b t a q where a q is the aquifer area a w is the area of the watershed q w b t is the baseflow measured at the outlet expressed in depth units per unit time m day r q is the recharge per unit area on the aquifer portion of the aquifer h t is the average water table height of the entire aquifer at time t neglecting evaporation during the rain phase is justified because the rootzone is near or above field capacity and satisfies the evaporative demand in our conceptualization any percolation in the basalt faults that does not surface in the watershed is considered unaccounted water at the outlet this uncounted water is converted to an equivalent portion of the watershed not underlain by the aquifer in the non aquifer part of the watershed rainfall infiltrates or becomes direct runoff when the soil is saturated the infiltrated water is subsequently lost by evapotranspiration or deep percolation eq 4 can be rearranged to become an explicit function of the recharge r as 5 r q t a q s y h t t a w q w b t a q alemie et al 2019 employed the method of characteristics to derive an equation for baseflow from hillslopes by assuming the convective term due to gravity dominates the diffusivity term over time scales over one day under these conditions the hydraulic gradient equals the slope of the restricting layer they showed that baseflow could be written as the average recharge over the travel time t d from the top of the aquifer to the point of interest viz 6 q w b t a q a w t d t t d t 1 r q t note that the ratio of aquifer area to watershed area is introduced in eq 6 because both baseflow and recharge are expressed in volume of water per unit time per unit area the total area for the baseflow since it is measured at the outlet is the watershed area and for the recharge it is the aquifer area substituting eq 6 into eq 5 gives 7 r q t a q s y h t t a q t d t t d t 1 r q t a w when measurements are perfect and there are no other losses from the aquifer r q t will not be negative as can be seen from eq 5 since for r q t 0 the change in the water table is equal to the outflow adjusted for the areas therefore the wtf can be formulated for sloping aquifers as follows 8a r q t a q s y h t t 1 t d t t d t 1 r q t a w for h t 0 8b r q t 0 for h t 0 thus the recharge on day t for sloping aquifers can be determined as the average spatial change in water table height on day t plus the recharge calculated earlier for the previous days averaged over the travel time 3 1 2 3 evaluation of the modified wtf method we cannot test the calculated recharge directly since only a few time consuming techniques measure recharge directly steenhuis et al 1985 an indirect approach to test the recharge for sloping aquifers is using eq 6 which indicates that the average recharge over the subsurface flow travel time should equal the base flow we integrate eq 4 to get eq 9 to find these parameters 9 h h o s y a q r q t dt a w q b t a q since there is no carry over of groundwater from one year to the next and h h o at the end of the hydrologic year the cumulative recharge should equal the cumulative baseflow this allows us to find the parameters of the specific yield and travel time which is part of r t and the portion of the watershed underlain by the aquifer using eq 9 the specific yield and the area ratios are correlated in the equation but they are physically constrained and that the aquifer area ratio is actually the parameter that determines the baseflow and specific yield can be referred from literatures if there are no prior knowledge for calibration we used the hydrologic year 2015 from may 2015 to april 2016 to find the specific yield travel time and the aquifer portion for the two watersheds then we used the remainder of the data hydrologic years 2016 may 2016 to april 2017 2017 may 2017 to april 2018 and 2018 may 2018 to dec 2018 for validation the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean squared error rmse were selected chicco et al 2021 to determine the correlation and errors between cumulative observed baseflow and cumulative predicted baseflow using eq 6 to evaluate the new modified wtf method 4 results the daily rainfall discharge and separated baseflow hydrograph are shown in fig 2 the precipitation and discharge started earlier in dengeshita than in robit bata for both watersheds the baseflow is increasing in time until august when the rainfalls become less frequent the baseflow start to decrease 4 1 annual precipitation discharge and baseflow the annual streamflow and baseflow in both watersheds increased with greater annual rainfall table 1 the average yearly rainfall in robit bata was 1378 mm a 1 and in dengeshita 1550 mm a 1 it resulted on average in 577 mm a 1 streamflow and 259 mm a 1 baseflow in robit bata and 903 mm a 1 streamflow of which 519 mm a 1 was baseflow nearly 60 of the discharge was baseflow in dengeshita average annual baseflow index of 0 57 table 1 in robit bata the baseflow was 44 of the discharge 4 2 monthly baseflow index the monthly baseflow index is presented with the corresponding monthly rainfall in table 2 for both dengeshita and robit bata watersheds in the dengeshita watershed the baseflow was more than 50 of the streamflow during the dry season during 2015 from october to april the baseflow index ranged from 54 to 78 for the same period from 2016 to 2018 the baseflow contribution to the total streamflow ranged from 50 to 100 the baseflow was the greatest portion of the streamflow in march from 2016 to 2018 when it was about 100 during the rainfall season may to september the baseflow index was around 50 of the total flow the baseflow in the robit bata watershed was from 10 to 80 during the rain phase the baseflow index in the dry season was in the range of 40 80 the flow was not observed in the stream from january to may in 2015 the streamflow measurement was stopped in early november so baseflow data were unavailable for two months before the stream dried up 4 3 time series of groundwater level data in fig 3 the average groundwater depth of the dengeshita watershed is presented for three well depth ranges less than 5 m between 5 m and 10 m and greater than 10 m robit bata has two depth ranges 5 10 m and above 10 m the difference is due to the depth of the bedrock bedrock is 6 19 m deep in the robit bata and 3 21 m in the dengeshita in general the water level fluctuation rose towards the ground surface from the beginning of the rain phase until the end of the rains and then declined in the dengeshita watershed fig 3a the groundwater table was near the ground surface during the rainfall phase for shallow wells near the stream 5 m depth deeper water tables mostly located on the upper slopes vary over a greater depth than shallow wells when it gets dry the water level drops to around 4 m for wells less than 5 m in depth 8 m for wells between 5 m and 10 m and 12 m for wells greater than 10 m in depth on average the base level h0 is 8 m in dengeshita similar groundwater table fluctuations were observed in the robit bata watershed for the rainfall phase and dry periods fig 3b the average water level fluctuation between drying and wetting was 3 5 m in robot bata the water level drops to 6 m and 11 m for wells 5 10 m and above 10 m depths respectively this leads to an average base level depth of 8 5 m 4 4 calculated shallow groundwater recharge the first step in finding the baseflow and recharge relationship is finding the values of the aquifer portion of the watershed and the specific yield with the aid of eq 9 which states that on an annual basis the observed recharge should equal the observed baseflow the calibration to fit observed baseflow with calculated baseflow using eq 6 in the 2015 hydrologic year produced specific yields of 0 05 and 0 06 cm3 cm3 for dengeshita and robit bata watersheds respectively it is within the range of previous reports in the watersheds table 3 observed specific yields varied between 0 045 cm3 cm3 tilahun et al 2020 and 0 08 cm3 cm3 walker et al 2019 gowing et al 2020 previous studies showed that a sloping aquifer underlays the entire dengeshita watershed sishu et al 2021 between 50 and 60 of the watershed in robit bata consisted of a hillslope aquifer tilahun et al 2020 with these calibration parameters the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 97 for robit bata and 0 91 for dengeshita root mean squared error was less than 16 mm for robit and less than 22 mm in dengeshita fig 4 shows the scatter plot of observed and predicted baseflow with the coefficient of determination during validation for the period from 2016 to 2018 hydrologic years the baseflow was used to calculate recharge using eq 9 of modified wtf the calculated annual shallow groundwater recharges based on the 23 monitoring wells in the dengeshita watershed were 447 557 and 573 mm a 1 for 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively the three year calculated average recharge was 525 mm a 1 the annual calculated groundwater recharges for robit bata for the three consecutive years starting in 2015 based on the measured water table levels of 29 monitoring wells were 352 253 and 275 mm a 1 the three year average recharge was 293 mm the 2018 calculation was excluded as the monthly water level data underestimates baseflow and recharge estimation 4 5 baseflow and groundwater recharge relationship the annual plotted data for the hydrologic years starting at the beginning of the rain phase in fig 4 indicated a reasonable agreement for the input parameters in table 3 the last hydrologic year beginning in april 2018 was excluded for both watersheds because monthly data did not allow quantification of the recharge as will be discussed later the 2015 hydrologic year in robit bata ended on 1 november 2015 because the streamflow was not measured after october the annual recharge and baseflow in mm per entire watershed to the shallow aquifer was much larger in dengeshita than in robit bata because the rainfall and the aquifer portion were greater in dengeshita fig 6 shows the average cumulative precipitation cumulatively calculated baseflow based on the modified wtf method and cumulative observed baseflow for each of the four hydrologic years the calculations were done in the hydrologic year in general the fit between the cumulative observed and predicted baseflow was good except for the 2018 rain phase when only monthly groundwater table data were available the monthly data could not represent the water table fluctuations during the month and therefore underestimated the recharge and consequently the base flow in 2015 not all observed baseflow data in robit bata were available so only the portion for which the data is available is shown in the dengeshita watershed the stream was perennial the baseflow started exceeding the wtf recharge in september and at the end of the year the cumulative baseflow was 510 mm and the modified wtf recharge was nearly equal at 525 mm fig 6a it is consistent with a previous study by sishu et al sishu et al 2021 they showed that the water balance for the dengeshita watershed closed i e the sum of evapotranspiration and discharge equals the rainfall thus for these conditions as explained above the annual baseflow should equal the yearly wtf recharge for rabit bata only about 55 of the area contributed baseflow and became equal to the recharge 5 discussion 5 1 baseflow we used baseflow for the recharge calculations the amount of baseflow in a watershed depends on the watershed characteristics and the method used to calculate the baseflow brodie and hostetler 2005 fig 5 shows that the baseflow calculated from digital filtration and the modified wtf method fit reasonably well it is however helpful to compare our calculated baseflow with others in the lake tana basin table 5 for example the amount of baseflow estimated using the eckhardt method for the major sub basins of the blue nile basin ribb gummara megech and gilgel abay by abiy et al 2016 ranged from 350 to 717 mm a 1 using the usgs software part baseflow in ribb and gummara were estimated as 119 and 561 mm a 1 with their baseflow index at the river outlet as 35 and 59 respectively according to andualem et al 2021 the gumara watershed has more baseflow discharge and groundwater recharge than the ribb watershed the small amount of baseflow in the rib is caused by the fact the that the water balance does not close zimale et al 2018 due to water lost through faults to the adjacent takeze basin adem et al 2020 considering that an aquifer underlies only 55 of the robit bata watershed our baseflow index of 44 in table 2 is close to that of gumura which includes recharge from upstream areas that are underlain by aquifers and that surfaces in the lower portions of the watershed in the kilti watershed close to the dengeshita watershed gowing et al 2020 reported 214 mm as baseflow from dry season streamflow measurement the order of magnitude is similar to our estimate in table 2 if one adds baseflow estimates during dry months from october to april the corresponding base flow index reported from kilit was 52 which is approximately similar to our estimates of 57 for dengeshita in addition our findings of the monthly base flow index were found to decrease with the corresponding increase in precipitation indicating that runoff increases in the watershed drive saturation excess as compared with the increment in baseflow found at the watershed outlet resulting in the increased runoff than baseflow yimam et al 2019 besides both baseflow and streamflow variations increased with increasing precipitation fig 2a and fig 2b the two year 2017 and 2018 mean annual baseflow estimated for the dengeshita watershed according to sishu et al 2021 was 782 mm 84 of total streamflow according to our study the four year 2015 2018 mean annual baseflow 511 mm was around 57 of the total discharge the basic difference is that a greater portion of the subsurface flow was included in sishu et al 2021 which occurred during and shortly after the runoff event 5 2 groundwater recharge it is generally understood that the long term water withdrawal of aquifers is sustainable when the recharge equals groundwater withdrawals this argument is valid for large aquifers with a minimal slope where the hydraulic gradient is independent of the landscape slope such as in the north china plain steenhuis and yang 2021 or large delta areas along the coast under these conditions the baseflow from the aquifer is small compared to its inputs sustainability and recharge in the sloping aquifers discussed here are much more complex as seen in fig 7 where the cumulative recharge and baseflow together with the groundwater storage are plotted the storage was calculated based on the aquifer averaged water table depth h in fig 3 which was expressed as a depth of the whole watershed and subtracted from ho which was the maximum groundwater level depth from the surface of the wells during the dry phase initially in the rain phase the water storage increases proportional to the recharge but then the storage drops rapidly as the baseflow increases thus there is very little recharge left as storage in the aquifer three to four months after the rain phase ends the storage in robit bata was similar to tilahun et al 2020 5 3 evaluating the modified water table fluctuation wtf method in this manuscript the original wtf method was modified the original water level fluctuation wtf method eq 3 assumes that the lateral flow can be neglected in the recharge calculation obviously that is not the case for the sloping hillside aquifers and will underpredict the annual recharge as shown in table 4 and is not correlated with the baseflow monthly fig 8 the underprediction with the original wtf in the dengeshita watershed was around 55 of the observed baseflow using the same specific yield as in table 3 for the hydrologic years of 2015 2018 the 2018 2019 prediction in fig 6 was even less because monthly observation cannot sufficiently represent the groundwater table fluctuations the recharge prediction with the original wtf approach in table 4 in the robit bata was closer to the observed baseflow measurements if the aquifer would underlie the entire watershed however this is not the case tilahun et al 2020 showed that the aquifer underlay 52 of the watershed in this study the calibration showed that 55 of the watershed had an aquifer the modified wtf method predicted the observed baseflow well except for 2015 in robit bata table 4 the reason for the disagreement in 2015 was that baseflow measurements were not taken in november and december even though the river was flowing the mean annual recharge calculated with the modified wtf method was 293 mm a 1 in robit bata and 525 mm a 1 in dengeshita our calculated recharge in robit bata is within the recharge in the ethiopian highlands as stated by kebede 2013 of less than 400 mm a 1 however in dengeshita our calculated recharge was greater than 400 mm a 1 likely because the rainfall in dengishita is high the entire watershed has an aquifer groundwater recharge was also reported for both watersheds by worqlul et al 2019 using swat and was from 247 to 317 mm a 1in robit bata and from 284 to 456 mm a 1 in dangishita table 5 our calculated recharge was close to swat in robit bata and greater in dengeshita the swat model assumes that the entire watershed has an aquifer for the model to fit the discharge at the outlet to that observed the recharge is underestimated in dangishita in robit bata the agreement is better because a too small recharge value offsets the too large watershed area higher groundwater recharge of about 800 mm a 1 was reported in the alluvial deposited aquifer with a very flat slope 0 1 slope in the fogera plain close to the robit bata watershed by enku et al 2017 in the plain the direct runoff is less than in the sloping watershed hence a large portion of the rainfall becomes recharge gowing et al 2020 used the original wtf method and found as expected a smaller recharge 350 mm a 1 than our calculated value in the same dangishita area 5 4 caution to specific yield a specific yield s y is an important variable in converting water table height into the amount of groundwater recharge healy and cook 2002 estimation of s y needs caution in the water table fluctuation approach in this study we found s y values of 5 in robit bata and 6 in dangishita table 3 gowing et al 2020 and walker et al 2019 reported a specific yield of 0 09 in the area around dengeshita while yenehun et al 2020 found specific yields ranging from 0 03 to 0 62 with an average of 0 044 based on distinct increases in groundwater levels in the area of robit bata abera beyene et al 2019 estimated very varied values that range from 0 038 to 0 22 using various methods such as moisture tension texture method and mechanical analysis and the heterogeneous soil across fields likely caused the wide range a moisture tension approach by tilahun et al 2020 in robit bata was estimated at around 0 045 our estimates of 0 06 in this study are within the ranges of previous works as the soils are clayey sy values for alluvial deposits range from 1 to 10 mean 6 as bradford and acreman 2003 reported using smaller values of s y for recharge estimation and sustainable use of groundwater is recommended by healy and cook 2002 6 conclusions the challenge with the original water table fluctuation method is that it is assumed that lateral flow is negligible and the aquifer is continuous and underlies the entire area these assumptions are not valid in the ethiopian highland where lateral flow is not insignificant and aquifers can only be found in part of the watershed with deep soils this study was conducted to modify the original water table fluctuation method to estimate recharge and baseflow from available groundwater level and streamflow data a key assumption in the model development is that the sum of recharge over the travel time to the stream in a sloping aquifer equals the base flow the recharge calculated with the modified wtf method was tested using baseflow measurement in two contrasting highland watersheds robit bata and dengeshita where groundwater depth and streamflow data were monitored from 2015 2018 the recharge predictions of around 300 mm a 1 for robit bata and just over 500 mm a 1 for dengeshita seemed reasonable and portions of the watershed underlain by the aquifer approximately half of the robit bata watershed and the entire dengeshita watershed the new approach to determining recharge is valid for other highland and sloping watersheds where water level and streamflow data are available or could be measured with citizens who derive water from wells funding the study was

7712,study region the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba china study focus using hourly rain gauge data and cmorph data we use the duration dependent generalized extreme value d gev model and the scaling invariant gev model inferred by the bayesian hierarchical model to derive the intensity duration frequency idf characteristics of extreme precipitation in gba and adjust their uncertainties new hydrological insights for the region the gev location and scale parameters of idf curves in gba show similar spatial distribution and the higher resolution cmorph can capture more local details than rain gauge data meanwhile compared with the rain gauge data cmorph produces significantly lower rainfall intensity of storms with short durations which leads to large uncertainties of idf curves derived from cmorph for the short duration rainfall additionally the uncertainties of idf curves can be substantially reduced by using the scaling invariant model that was inferred by the bayesian hierarchical model compared with the ordinary d gev method therefore the bayesian inference is suggested to be adopted for regional estimation of idf curves especially for regions of limited sub daily gauge data graphical abstract ga1 keywords extreme precipitation intensity duration frequency curves duration dependent gev scaling invariant bayesian hierarchical model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the water holding capacity of air will increase with global warming trenberth 2011 and the increase in evaporation and atmospheric humidity has led to increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events and thus the increased risk of various hydro meteorological disasters allan and soden 2008 lenderink and van meijgaard 2010 floods luo et al 2018 landslides tichavsky et al 2019 debris flows segoni et al 2015 and urban waterlogging wang et al 2021 caused by heavy rainfall may lead to significant damage to dams stormwater drainage systems and other infrastructures resulting in a large number of human casualties huge economic losses and a series of social consequences ipcc et al 2013 rainfall intensity duration frequency idf curves are of prime importance for the design of hydraulic engineering water resources planning and hydrological research lima et al 2018 idf curves are also widely used in infrastructure design storm related hazard prevention and drainage management to determine the design of storm simonovic et al 2016 an accurate and reliable estimation of the rainfall intensity shown in the points on the idf curves is important for risk management accordingly reliable estimates of probabilities of extreme precipitation and their associated uncertainties are of great concern overeem et al 2008 the intensity of extreme precipitation events can be estimated with a given duration and return period by analyzing the relationship between the intensity duration and frequency of observed rainfall data koutsoyiannis et al 1998 idf curves derived from limited station rainfall data of long duration e g daily were usually extended to show the features of rainfall with a short duration for stormwater management amatya et al 2021 brown et al 1996 courty et al 2019 prodanovic and simonovic 2007 and serve as a reference for the design of flood protection structures de paola et al 2014 although there might be large uncertainty in estimated rainfall intensity there usually are not sufficient long term sub daily rain gauge records for the reliable estimate of idf curves especially in developing countries where most rain gauges are designed to record daily rainfall koutsoyiannis et al 1998 lumbroso et al 2011 furthermore the rain gauge stations were also sparse spatially kidd et al 2017 so it is common to use nearby rain gauges to generate local idf curves given the spatial nature of extreme precipitation events of short durations the idf curves vary greatly thus the accuracy of idf curves derived from spatially interpolated rainfall decreases significantly with distance from the rain gauge location therefore it is necessary to use rainfall datasets with a high spatial and temporal resolution e g the remote sensing retrievals from the climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph other than gauge observations to obtain reliable regional idf relationships which can provide a reference for the design of infrastructure in regions where rainfall data are scarce or uncertain to address the lack of hourly rainfall records at some stations many studies have explored the scale invariant characteristics of rainfall intensity and duration based on the fractal mathematics deidda et al 1999 harris et al 2001 koutsoyiannis et al 1998 marsan et al 1996 marta et al 2009 menabde et al 1999 nguyen et al 1998 and developed some scale invariant generalized extreme value gev distribution models to derive idf curves bougadis and adamowski 2006 yeo et al 2020 both theoretical and empirical evidence support the use of the gev distribution to quantify the risks associated with extreme hydrological events coles et al 2001 papalexiou et al 2013 and many studies on idf curves have used the gev distribution to model annual maximum precipitation events coles et al 2001 fowler and kilsby 2003 overeem et al 2008 yeo et al 2020 in extreme value analysis the uncertainty evaluation is crucial but the conventional idf analysis method does not provide the uncertainty information ignoring the uncertainty may bring about a failure risk of significant infrastructure which is based on design idf curves there are two diverse theoretical frameworks for assessing the uncertainty of idf parameters the first one is the frequentist framework in which the idf model parameters are scalars and their uncertainties are derived from the bootstrapping of the datasets analyzed hailegeorgis et al 2013 overeem et al 2008 the second one is the bayesian framework which considers the idf model parameters as random variables lehmann et al 2013 muller et al 2008 the choice of the different frameworks will have an impact on the estimation of idf uncertainty and some studies found that the bayesian framework can better estimate the idf uncertainty mélèse et al 2018 due to the complexity of computing the posterior distribution of parameters few attempts have been made to apply the bayesian method to extreme value analysis before the introduction of the markov chain monte carlo mcmc methodology gelfand and smith 1990 based on metropolis hastings algorithm with the steady development of the bayesian inference technique some studies have been conducted to estimate idf relationship based on the bayesian framework lima et al 2016 2018 van 2015 2018 here we used the bayesian framework to derive idf curves for the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba region in this study gba is located in the coastal areas of guangdong province china which is not only affected by frequent typhoons heavy rainstorms and other extreme weather events but also threatened by a series of subsequent disasters such as waterlogging landslides and mudslides gba is the largest and most populated urban area among the four largest bay areas in the world it is of great practical significance to reveal the spatiotemporal characteristics of extreme precipitation on the sub daily scale which is more sensitive to global warming to decrease the hazardous risk related to extreme precipitation however due to the lack of long term sub daily gauge rainfall data he et al 2022 qiang et al 2020 few studies were focused on the idf curves in the gba and their uncertainties as well in this paper we aim to construct idf curves using the ordinary duration dependent gev d gev method and the scaling invariant bayesian hierarchical model sibhm based on two regional sub daily rainfall datasets including the station gauged and the remote sensing retrievals from the cmorph technique the performance of the sibhm in estimating the characteristics of idf curves and reducing their uncertainties for the gba is evaluated by comparing the parameters estimated from the two methods to the best of our knowledge this study is the very early one to assess the regional sub daily idf characteristics using the gridded precipitation dataset and the sibhm method the remaining of this study is organized as follows the study region and rainfall data used are described in section 2 the methodology of the d gev model and the sibhm are introduced in section 3 in section 4 we display the results and their discussion including spatial variability of parameters and rainfall intensity maps for various return periods and the idf curves created by the two methods section 5 gives the conclusions of this study 2 study area and data 2 1 study area gba is located in the guangdong province of china fig 1a gba comprises 9 cities namely guangzhou shenzhen zhuhai foshan huizhou dongguan zhongshan jiangmen zhaoqing hong kong and macao fig 1b with a total area of around 56 000 km2 it is one of the most open and economically dynamic regions in china gba is in the southern part of the monsoon region in eastern china resulting of the east asia summer monsoon rainstorms floods super typhoons heat waves and other meteorological disasters frequently occur here for example typhoon hato made landfall near zhuhai on august 23 2017 causing severe storm surges and heavy rainstorms the maximum storm surge and sea level recorded at zhuhai station were 2 79 and 6 14 m respectively and the regional rainfall was 150 300 mm hko 2020 2 2 data hourly rainfall data from 26 rain gauge stations distributed across the gba are used in this study which is offered by the cma guangzhou joint research center for atmospheric sciences with support from the guangdong meteorological bureau the locations of these stations are shown in fig 1c gba is in south china so its rainy season usually lasts from may to august and extreme precipitation events often occur during this period our study focuses on the summer may to august of 1998 2014 when both satellite derived rainfall and rain gauge data are available to derive characteristics of regional idf curves of high spatial resolutions we also used and assess the cmorph v1 0 precipitation dataset which is a satellite only retrieval data product generated by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration joyce et al 2004 joyce and xie 2011 cmorph data are available between 60 n and 60 s at a spatial resolution of 0 0728 8 km at the equator and with a temporal interval of half hour from january 1998 to the present we chose cmorph for the supplementary analyses because of its high spatial and temporal resolution and its permissive usage license given that the sparse infrequent or short term rainfall data from the hourly gauged observations would make it difficult to generate robust idf curves courty et al 2019 when estimating idf curves the annual maximum series of hourly rainfall intensity is usually used table 1 is the basic statistics of rainfall data for gaoyao guangzhou doumen and shenzhen which will be used in the subsequent analysis the annual maximum rainfall intensity for different durations is obtained by the sliding window method 3 methods we used the ordinary d gev model and the scaling invariant bayesian hierarchical model sibhm which are both introduced in the following to derive the idf curves for rain gauge stations or grids in cmorph for both the rain gauge and cmorph data we analyzed the idf curves individually for all 26 gauges or grids by the ordinary d gev model fig 1 however due to the high computation demand of the sibhm method which estimates idf parameters for all stations or grids simultaneously we analyzed the idf curves for the 9 gauges or grids located in large cities by the sibhm method to better show the spatial patterns of idf characteristics and compare them between the two datasets and between the two methods applied the ordinary kriging oliver and webster 2015 is used to interpolate the results derived from the rain gauges or grids 3 1 ordinary d gev model intensity duration frequency idf curves describe the relationship between rainfall intensity and duration in a specific return period the general idf relationship can be formulated as a separable function of duration and return period koutsoyiannis et al 1998 1 i d t r a t r d θ h where i is the rainfall intensity d is the duration in hours and t r is the return period a t r is the function of t r which can be determined by the probability distribution function of the maximum rainfall intensity in addition h is the hershfield factor hershfield 1962 used for the correction of measurement frequency θ and h are non negative coefficients with θ 0 0 h 1 eq 1 indicates that in a given return period rainfall intensity decreases with the increase of rainfall duration since the gev distribution is theoretically established for extreme case modeling it has been widely used in the estimation of idf curves in this study we are based on a d gev model which is defined following koutsoyiannis et al 1998 we assume that the annual maximum rainfall intensity of any site over duration d d 1 2 3 24 h follows the gev distribution well 2 i d gev μ d σ d ξ d and the cumulative probability distribution of rainfall intensity x is given as follows coles et al 2001 koutsoyiannis 2009 3 f x μ σ ξ exp 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ where f x denotes a family of functions with three parameters 1 ξ x μ σ 0 with location parameter μ scale parameter σ 0 and shape parameter ξ μ and σ depend on duration while ξ is always keep constant hence eq 3 can be written as a duration dependent generalized extreme value d gev distribution 4 f x d μ d σ d ξ θ h exp 1 ξ x σ d d θ h μ d σ d 1 ξ parameters in the d gev method eq 4 can be inferred by the maximum likelihood method in this study we used the functions provided by the idf package in r to estimate the idf relationship ulrich et al 2020 3 2 the scaling invariant bayesian hierarchical model sibhm it is equivalent to linking idf curves at two different durations d and d 0 based on the scale invariant theory if eq 1 is expressed as blanchet et al 2016 5 i d t r i d 0 t r d θ d 0 θ h in addition the dependence of the location μ scale σ and shape ξ parameters on duration can be shown as blanchet et al 2016 nguyen et al 1998 6 μ d μ d 0 d θ d 0 θ h 7 σ d σ d 0 d θ d 0 θ h 8 ξ d ξ d 0 eqs 6 8 imply that the location μ and scale σ parameters are duration dependent in the gev scaling model while the shape parameter remains constant and is independent of time scale coles et al 2001 nadarajah et al 1998 since the scaling relationships of μ and σ are straight lines in a logarithmic plot the log transformed of eqs 6 and 7 can be presented as 9 log μ d log μ d 0 h log d θ d 0 θ 10 log σ d log σ d 0 h log d θ d 0 θ urban infrastructure is mainly designed based on sub daily idf curves courty et al 2019 so we often pay more attention to rainfall intensity at sub daily time scales consequently despite the choices of d and d 0 can be arbitrary d 0 d 24 24 hour is usually assumed to obtain the parameters μ and σ on shorter scales blanchet et al 2016 muller et al 2008 the parameters in this scaling invariant idf model are inferred from the bayesian hierarchical model in the bayesian hierarchical framework we need to set prior distributions for gev parameters according to the existing information such as the experience and historical data eqs 8 9 and 10 describe the relationship between the moments of the gev distribution at different durations therefore the prior distributions of the three parameters can be assumed as lima et al 2018 11 log μ d n α h log d θ d 24 θ τ μ 2 12 log σ d n β h log d θ d 24 θ τ σ 2 13 ξ d n ξ τ ξ 2 where n represents the normal distribution which with respective mean and variance α log μ d 24 and β log σ d 24 are gev location and scale parameters with rainfall duration of 24 h respectively θ 0 and 0 h 1 are scaling coefficients ξ is the average shape parameter of diverse durations τ μ 2 τ σ 2 and τ ξ 2 are the variance associated with their respective scaling processes in addition to obtain more information and make the parameters of the prior distribution hyperparameters more accurate it is also necessary to set the hyperprior distribution to efficiently estimate the idf parameters in a regional way h θ α and β need to be estimated for each rain gauge separately and independently while the remaining hyperparameters ξ τ μ 2 τ σ 2 τ ξ 2 are estimated by considering the whole dataset involving all gauge stations in a pooled regional way the specific settings of hyperparameters are discussed in lima et al 2018 finally the joint posterior distribution of the complete parameter set is shown as 14 p r θ i r 1 n j 1 t r d 1 24 g e v i d j r μ d r σ d r ξ d r n log μ d r α r h r log d θ r d 24 θ r τ μ 2 n log σ d r β r h r log d θ r d 24 θ r τ σ 2 n ξ d r ξ τ ξ 2 n α r 0 10 6 n β r

total number of rainfall gauges the subscripts r and j are rainfall gauge and year respectively t r denotes the total number of years for rainfall gauge d is the rainfall duration and d 24 24 hour besides the three gev parameters μ σ and ξ vary with rainfall duration and gauge stations b a b represents the beta distribution with lower bound a and upper bound b u is the uniform distribution and its associated upper and lower bound intervals inv gamma is the inverse gamma distribution adopted to show the prior distributions of the gev shape and scale parameters according to the bayesian theorem the calculation of posterior distribution involves normalization factors for the parameter set θ it is difficult to integrate its posterior distribution whereas the markov chain monte carlo mcmc method has been widely used for systematic random sampling from a high dimensional probability distribution in this study with reference to the code provided by lima et al 2018 the simulation is carried out by calling the openbugs in r through the r2winbugs package mcmc needs several iterations before approaching the stable distribution commonly which is called the warm up phase or burn in period we usually discard samples collected in the burn in period and retain the samples collected after the markov chain converges to the stable distribution in addition to reduce the autocorrelation of samples the thinning interval between consecutive observations needs to be set two groups of bayesian simulations are carried out using cmorph and rain gauge data respectively during the simulation we set up 9 chains per group each for 20 000 iterations discarding the first 10 000 iterations the burn in period is set to the first half iterations one sample is taken every 50 iterations in the remaining 10 000 iterations the thinning rate is set to 50 thus each chain resulted in 200 10 000 50 samples and the sample size of the posterior distribution of each parameter is 1800 9 chains finally based on 9 runs of the metropolis hastings algorithm we access the convergence of posterior distributions intuitively using the gelman s r ˆ convergence criteria gelman et al 2013 where r ˆ value should keep below 1 1 almost all r ˆ values obtained from the two sets of data used for simulation are less than 1 01 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial variability of the location and scale parameters estimated by ordinary d gev we use cmorph and rain gauge data in 24 durations 1 24 h of gba respectively and use maximum likelihood estimation mle coles et al 2001 to estimate ordinary d gev parameters the location parameter μ and scale parameter σ are used to describe the entire intensity frequency distribution for a given d 24 h the shape parameter ξ is not considered here because the distribution is not sensitive to the rainfall duration the gev parameters and their spatial distribution can be interpreted relatively easily from the maps of gev parameters μ and σ shown in fig 2 μ represents the center of the distribution and describes the shift of the distribution in each direction of the horizontal axis σ is the distribution of the data around μ and as σ increases the distribution becomes more spread out higher σ indicates an increase in variability of the distribution and places with high σ are more prone to extreme precipitation events fig 2 presents the spatial variations of gev location and scale parameters in gba figs 2a and 2b figs 2c and 2d were derived from the cmorph and rain gauge data respectively the pattern of the location parameters μ of cmorph fig 2a shows that the high value zones of μ are concentrated in the south middle and west of jiangmen and the southwest of zhuhai the μ values over northern guangzhou and western and eastern huizhou are also significantly higher than those in their surrounding regions the low value zones of μ are more concentrated in the estuary of the pearl river namely the east of zhongshan zhuhai hong kong and shenzhen from the pattern of μ obtained from rain gauge data fig 2c the μ value over coastal cities in gba is distinctly higher than that of inland cities showing the distribution pattern of southeast high northwest low the largest discrepancy between figs 2a and 2c is located at the pearl river estuary which may result from the precipitation bias of the cmorph data chen et al 2018 noted that cmorph underestimates the rainfall intensity near the coastline of south china compared with the rain gauge data figs 2b and 2d show the spatial pattern of scale parameter σ obtained by using cmorph and rain gauge data respectively the σ spatial distributions obtained from the two datasets show a similar spatial pattern as μ the high σ value is usually accompanied by high σ values which is consistent with the findings of wang and xuan 2021 for great britain and australia since the spatial distribution of σ can roughly reflect the expected geographic pattern of extreme precipitation regions that show high rainfall intensity is often observed with a high occurrence probability of extreme precipitation in gba the rainfall spatial distribution in guangdong is affected by land sea contrast local topography the influence of tropical cyclones and other convective systems resulting in the local rainstorm as well chen et al 2018 he et al 2022 the orientation of the coastal mountains in guangdong is almost parallel to the coastline which is favorable for the converging and lifting of the water vapor from the south china sea and thereby increasing the rainfall intensity heavy storms contributed a large part of the rainfall amount over guangdong particularly over coasts and the windward side of mountains there are three rainstorm centers in guangdong including fogang in qingyuan enping in yangjiang and haifeng in shanwei rainfall in these three regions is long lasting and strong which can easily lead to extreme precipitation the north of guangzhou the south of jiangmen and the east of huizhou are near these three rainstorm centers corresponding to the spatial distribution of the high value zones of the two parameters shown by cmorph figs 2a and 2b as expected the high resolution cmorph captures finer details of the spatial distribution of extreme precipitation than rain gauge data 4 2 spatial variability of intensity under various return periods across rainfall durations fig 3 displays the spatial distributions of the 2 50 and 100 year return periods for 1 and 24 hour rainfall intensity obtained from the fitted gev distribution from the ordinary d gev model figs 3a and 3b are estimated using cmorph and surface rain gauge data respectively fig 3 shows that as the duration increases from 1 to 24 h the spatial distribution of rainfall intensity under 2 and 50 year return periods are different but the spatial distribution of rainfall intensity under 50 and 100 year return periods are similar as expected under the same return period the shorter the rainfall duration the greater the rainfall intensity while under the same rainfall duration the longer the return period the higher the rainfall intensity for the results of cmorph fig 3a f considering the 2 year return period the high value zones at 1 h duration are found in the north of guangzhou and the southwest of jiangmen the spatial distribution of rainfall intensity in gba is similar to the distribution of μ shown in fig 2a precipitation events that occur on average every two years are quite common and they tend to occur frequently with the increase in rainfall duration to 24 h fig 3d the spatial distribution of high value zones is still found in southwest jiangmen however the north of guangzhou which shows high intensity of the 2 year return period does not show high intensity of the 100 year return period focusing on the 50 year return period the high value zones at 1 h duration are found not only in the southwest of jiangmen but also in the east of huizhou and the junction of huizhou and shenzhen while they extend and become more significant at 24 h duration fig 3e the high value zone in the map represents areas in gba where maximum rainfall intensities concentrate and where extreme precipitation events are most likely to occur the range of low value zones at the 50 year return period is much larger than that at the 2 year return period the results of the 100 year return period are consistent with those at the 50 year return period except that the zone of low values at the 100 year return period is larger than that at the 50 year return period under the same rainfall duration the finding fits the definition of return period because probability theory suggests that for an event with a return period of 50 years the probability of at least one such occurring within 50 years is 63 6 atomic energy regulatory board of india 2008 precipitation events that occur on average every 50 years are rare in one s lifetime and centennial return period precipitation events are even rarer for the results of rain gauge data fig 3g l considering the 2 year return period the high value zones at both 1 h and 24 h duration are found in the southwest of jiangmen and the estuary of the pearl river the spatial distribution of rainfall intensity is also similar to the distribution of σ shown in fig 2d in the case of 24 h duration focusing on the 50 and 100 year return periods the high value zones at 1 h duration are found in dongguan and the north of huizhou when the duration comes to 24 h the high value zones extend to the whole river network of the pearl river delta compared with figs 3a f and 3g l the high value zone of rainfall intensity obtained by cmorph deviates from the rain gauge station in addition cmorph underestimated the rainfall intensity of gba particularly in the estuary of the pearl river this is especially true for a short duration d 1 h at the 2 year return period the minimum rainfall intensity of rain gauge data was 2 26 times that of cmorph and the 50 year and 100 year return periods are 2 33 and 2 4 times respectively the maximum rainfall intensity of rain gauge data is also larger than that of cmorph the significant underestimate of extreme rainfall intensity by the cmorph precipitation data shows a somewhat systematic bias should be further corrected before that it is applied for the risk management of gba storms and the cmorph algorithm should be improved to retrieve precipitation rate for regions such as gba 4 3 posterior distributions and scaling of gev parameters estimated by the sibhm model four rainfall gauges in gba a gaoyao b guangzhou c doumen and d shenzhen see location in fig 1c are randomly selected from the full set of 9 gauges for the result presentation relationships between three gev parameters μ σ and ξ and rainfall duration are obtained by fitting duration dependent idf with the ordinary d gev model and the scaling invariant model inferred by the bayesian hierarchical model fig 4 shows the scaling of the location parameter μ with the rainfall duration 1 24 h derived from the ordinary d gev and the sibhm the 95 credible interval was obtained from the bayesian posterior distribution in the four selected gauges for both cmorph and rain gauge data all the point estimates of ordinary d gev are within the credible interval and μ obtained by both methods shows a monotone nonlinear relationship with the rainfall duration although μ increases with the decreases of duration the credible interval range can quantify the uncertainty the spread of the credible interval in fig 4 gets wider as duration decreases indicating that shorter duration has greater uncertainty in rainfall characteristics fig 5 shows the relation between the scale parameter σ and rainfall duration for the same gauges evaluated for μ shown in fig 4 a nonlinear relationship between σ and rainfall duration which is similar to μ and rainfall duration is also found likewise here the spread of the credible interval also gets wider with the decrease of rainfall duration nevertheless for σ the point estimates from the ordinary d gev are not all in the credible interval range therefore σ reveals weaker linear scaling and higher uncertainty than μ the sibhm model derived a much more smooth scaling of μ and σ than the ordinary d gev method which indicates that sibhm can show more scaling features of parameters due to its explicit consideration of scale invariances of idf parameters to the rainfall duration the results of the shape parameter ξ are different from the parameters μ and σ fig 6 there is no obvious correlation between ξ and rainfall duration no scaling in ξ which is consistent with eq 8 in addition the scaling of the bayesian estimates ξ is quite distinct from those of ordinary d gev since most of the estimated points from the ordinary d gev model do not fall inside the credible intervals obtained from the sibhm since ξ represents where most of the data lies and thus governs the tail heaviness of the distribution ξ 0 ξ 0 and ξ 0 correspond to fréchet gumbel and weibull distributions respectively high volatility in ξ derived from the ordinary d gev could result in large estimation uncertainty of rainfall intensity at various rainfall duration many studies have shown that it is difficult to precisely estimate ξ because it is affected by both record length and geographical location e g elevation overeem et al 2008 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 ragulina and reitan 2017 which should be further explored in future studies figs 7a and 7b show the sibhm posterior distributions of h and θ for the entire set of 9 gauges respectively figs 7c and 7d show the relationship between h and α h and θ respectively the left and right columns of fig 7 show the results derived from the cmorph and rain gauge data respectively it can be seen from fig 7c that h and α are not consistently related across the 9 gauges but the spread of the posterior distribution of α for a given gauge is weakly associated with its corresponding distribution of h however fig 7d shows a strong and consistent correlation between h and θ across the 9 gauges all the results in fig 7 are similar to what lima et al 2018 found for south korea which indicates that the parameters of h and θ derived from the sibhm generally show significant differences between different regions 4 4 intensity duration frequency curves for gauge sites to compare how idf curves produced by the sibhm differ from those curves obtained from the ordinary d gev method we draw idf curves based on the mean posterior estimates of μ σ and ξ simulated by the sibhm the results of these two methods are displayed in fig 8 for the selected rain gauges 1 guangzhou and 2 shenzhen which are two of the largest cities in china the idf curves are drawn from both cmorph and rain gauge data during the flood season from 1998 to 2014 the result provides the projected intensities of annual rainfall maxima used for 1 24 h duration at 25 10 20 50 and 100 year return periods from fig 8 we can see that the longer the return period the greater will be the rainfall intensity rainfall intensity gets lower when the rainfall duration increases overall rainfall intensity estimated by sibhm is so close to that by the ordinary d gev especially at long rainfall durations and return periods the greatest differences seem to occur at short durations and large return periods where the rainfall intensity is extremely high indicating a greater uncertainty of parameter estimation for the shorter rainfall duration the development of the d gev method is relatively mature and the minimum length of the rainfall data to calculate the idf curves are suggested to be more than 30 years for having a high statistical significance even though in engineering practice the minimum value of 10 years was used by environment and climate change canada to develop idf curves for engineering practice due to a lack of long term rain gauge data for small sample analyses in this study some stations show unstable parameters of idf curves using the mle estimate which is also indicated by previous analyses on the gev parameter distribution of storms over various regions in the world martins and stedinger 2000 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 therefore it is inevitable to have large uncertainties in the idf estimation and the d gev estimate could be unstable and show large differences from those of other advanced methods e g sibhm note that the ordinary d gev method does not consider the possible scaling in the gev parameters across various durations so it naturally results in more unstable than methods considering scaling such as the sibhm moreover compared with the region independent ordinary d gev method inferred by the maximum likelihood estimates the regional inference of idf parameters by the sibhm pooling all information from all stations can significantly improve the parameter estimates for different datasets at the same gauge the rainfall intensity of idf curves obtained by cmorph is significantly lower than that of rain gauge data and the underestimation of shenzhen is more obvious than that of guangzhou this may be because shenzhen is closer to the sea than guangzhou as mentioned above cmorph is weak in representing rainfall intensity near the coastline 5 summary and conclusions based on the generalized extreme value distribution two different methods the ordinary gev model inferred by the maximum likelihood estimation method and the scaling invariant gev model inferred by the bayesian hierarchical model are used to describe the idf characteristics in gba the results illustrate that the gev location μ and scale σ parameters of idf curves in gba show similar spatial distribution where a high μ is usually accompanied by a high σ indicating those areas showing higher rainfall intensity are often observed with a higher occurrence probability of extreme precipitation more specifically the coastal areas of gba are more prone to extreme precipitation than inland areas in addition the higher resolution cmorph can capture more local details than rain gauge data by analyzing the period maps of rainfall intensity at the 1 h and 24 h durations in different return periods we found that the areas showing the maximum rainfall intensity and the most frequent extreme precipitation events in gba are mainly located in the coastal regions and huizhou considering both the ordinary d gev and the bayesian estimates no scaling of shape parameters was observed and the scaling properties of the gev location and scale parameters with rainfall duration in our study cities were consistent with the previous research lima et al 2018 the obvious difference between the ordinary d gev idf and sibhm idf estimates results from the reduced uncertainty benefiting from the scaling estimation in sibhm the comparison between the sibhm and the ordinary d gev model on observed rain gauge data shows that the sibhm can describe the rainfall characteristics well although there are great differences in rainfall intensity of short duration between the two models due to the large uncertainty and data samples of rainfall of short duration in theory the bayesian model considers the scaling invariant property of rainfall in the formula and uses more information from various duration to estimate parameters which is indeed able to better adjust the uncertainty of data however the key to reliable gev parameter estimation is to use longer time series while our analyses only use a relatively short rainfall time series which may well miss many extreme events we fully compared the results of the two datasets and found that cmorph is inherently biased and uncertain in representing extreme rainfall intensity compared with the rain gauge data cmorph underestimates the rainfall intensity near the coastal region of gba especially for the pearl river delta our analyses adopted the gev distribution function to describe the probability density distributions of annual maximum rainfall intensity but some studies generally believe that the pearson ⅲ distribution and the gumbel distribution should be more suitable for china therefore the latter two probability distributions need to be used for further comparative studies in addition much of the existing infrastructure is designed assuming a stationary climate but global warming will affect extreme precipitation events wang et al 2019 zhang and villarini 2017 therefore the stationarity assumption may no longer hold it is necessary to quantify the impact of climate changes on idf curves to employ non stationary idf curves in future

7712,study region the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba china study focus using hourly rain gauge data and cmorph data we use the duration dependent generalized extreme value d gev model and the scaling invariant gev model inferred by the bayesian hierarchical model to derive the intensity duration frequency idf characteristics of extreme precipitation in gba and adjust their uncertainties new hydrological insights for the region the gev location and scale parameters of idf curves in gba show similar spatial distribution and the higher resolution cmorph can capture more local details than rain gauge data meanwhile compared with the rain gauge data cmorph produces significantly lower rainfall intensity of storms with short durations which leads to large uncertainties of idf curves derived from cmorph for the short duration rainfall additionally the uncertainties of idf curves can be substantially reduced by using the scaling invariant model that was inferred by the bayesian hierarchical model compared with the ordinary d gev method therefore the bayesian inference is suggested to be adopted for regional estimation of idf curves especially for regions of limited sub daily gauge data graphical abstract ga1 keywords extreme precipitation intensity duration frequency curves duration dependent gev scaling invariant bayesian hierarchical model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the water holding capacity of air will increase with global warming trenberth 2011 and the increase in evaporation and atmospheric humidity has led to increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events and thus the increased risk of various hydro meteorological disasters allan and soden 2008 lenderink and van meijgaard 2010 floods luo et al 2018 landslides tichavsky et al 2019 debris flows segoni et al 2015 and urban waterlogging wang et al 2021 caused by heavy rainfall may lead to significant damage to dams stormwater drainage systems and other infrastructures resulting in a large number of human casualties huge economic losses and a series of social consequences ipcc et al 2013 rainfall intensity duration frequency idf curves are of prime importance for the design of hydraulic engineering water resources planning and hydrological research lima et al 2018 idf curves are also widely used in infrastructure design storm related hazard prevention and drainage management to determine the design of storm simonovic et al 2016 an accurate and reliable estimation of the rainfall intensity shown in the points on the idf curves is important for risk management accordingly reliable estimates of probabilities of extreme precipitation and their associated uncertainties are of great concern overeem et al 2008 the intensity of extreme precipitation events can be estimated with a given duration and return period by analyzing the relationship between the intensity duration and frequency of observed rainfall data koutsoyiannis et al 1998 idf curves derived from limited station rainfall data of long duration e g daily were usually extended to show the features of rainfall with a short duration for stormwater management amatya et al 2021 brown et al 1996 courty et al 2019 prodanovic and simonovic 2007 and serve as a reference for the design of flood protection structures de paola et al 2014 although there might be large uncertainty in estimated rainfall intensity there usually are not sufficient long term sub daily rain gauge records for the reliable estimate of idf curves especially in developing countries where most rain gauges are designed to record daily rainfall koutsoyiannis et al 1998 lumbroso et al 2011 furthermore the rain gauge stations were also sparse spatially kidd et al 2017 so it is common to use nearby rain gauges to generate local idf curves given the spatial nature of extreme precipitation events of short durations the idf curves vary greatly thus the accuracy of idf curves derived from spatially interpolated rainfall decreases significantly with distance from the rain gauge location therefore it is necessary to use rainfall datasets with a high spatial and temporal resolution e g the remote sensing retrievals from the climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph other than gauge observations to obtain reliable regional idf relationships which can provide a reference for the design of infrastructure in regions where rainfall data are scarce or uncertain to address the lack of hourly rainfall records at some stations many studies have explored the scale invariant characteristics of rainfall intensity and duration based on the fractal mathematics deidda et al 1999 harris et al 2001 koutsoyiannis et al 1998 marsan et al 1996 marta et al 2009 menabde et al 1999 nguyen et al 1998 and developed some scale invariant generalized extreme value gev distribution models to derive idf curves bougadis and adamowski 2006 yeo et al 2020 both theoretical and empirical evidence support the use of the gev distribution to quantify the risks associated with extreme hydrological events coles et al 2001 papalexiou et al 2013 and many studies on idf curves have used the gev distribution to model annual maximum precipitation events coles et al 2001 fowler and kilsby 2003 overeem et al 2008 yeo et al 2020 in extreme value analysis the uncertainty evaluation is crucial but the conventional idf analysis method does not provide the uncertainty information ignoring the uncertainty may bring about a failure risk of significant infrastructure which is based on design idf curves there are two diverse theoretical frameworks for assessing the uncertainty of idf parameters the first one is the frequentist framework in which the idf model parameters are scalars and their uncertainties are derived from the bootstrapping of the datasets analyzed hailegeorgis et al 2013 overeem et al 2008 the second one is the bayesian framework which considers the idf model parameters as random variables lehmann et al 2013 muller et al 2008 the choice of the different frameworks will have an impact on the estimation of idf uncertainty and some studies found that the bayesian framework can better estimate the idf uncertainty mélèse et al 2018 due to the complexity of computing the posterior distribution of parameters few attempts have been made to apply the bayesian method to extreme value analysis before the introduction of the markov chain monte carlo mcmc methodology gelfand and smith 1990 based on metropolis hastings algorithm with the steady development of the bayesian inference technique some studies have been conducted to estimate idf relationship based on the bayesian framework lima et al 2016 2018 van 2015 2018 here we used the bayesian framework to derive idf curves for the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba region in this study gba is located in the coastal areas of guangdong province china which is not only affected by frequent typhoons heavy rainstorms and other extreme weather events but also threatened by a series of subsequent disasters such as waterlogging landslides and mudslides gba is the largest and most populated urban area among the four largest bay areas in the world it is of great practical significance to reveal the spatiotemporal characteristics of extreme precipitation on the sub daily scale which is more sensitive to global warming to decrease the hazardous risk related to extreme precipitation however due to the lack of long term sub daily gauge rainfall data he et al 2022 qiang et al 2020 few studies were focused on the idf curves in the gba and their uncertainties as well in this paper we aim to construct idf curves using the ordinary duration dependent gev d gev method and the scaling invariant bayesian hierarchical model sibhm based on two regional sub daily rainfall datasets including the station gauged and the remote sensing retrievals from the cmorph technique the performance of the sibhm in estimating the characteristics of idf curves and reducing their uncertainties for the gba is evaluated by comparing the parameters estimated from the two methods to the best of our knowledge this study is the very early one to assess the regional sub daily idf characteristics using the gridded precipitation dataset and the sibhm method the remaining of this study is organized as follows the study region and rainfall data used are described in section 2 the methodology of the d gev model and the sibhm are introduced in section 3 in section 4 we display the results and their discussion including spatial variability of parameters and rainfall intensity maps for various return periods and the idf curves created by the two methods section 5 gives the conclusions of this study 2 study area and data 2 1 study area gba is located in the guangdong province of china fig 1a gba comprises 9 cities namely guangzhou shenzhen zhuhai foshan huizhou dongguan zhongshan jiangmen zhaoqing hong kong and macao fig 1b with a total area of around 56 000 km2 it is one of the most open and economically dynamic regions in china gba is in the southern part of the monsoon region in eastern china resulting of the east asia summer monsoon rainstorms floods super typhoons heat waves and other meteorological disasters frequently occur here for example typhoon hato made landfall near zhuhai on august 23 2017 causing severe storm surges and heavy rainstorms the maximum storm surge and sea level recorded at zhuhai station were 2 79 and 6 14 m respectively and the regional rainfall was 150 300 mm hko 2020 2 2 data hourly rainfall data from 26 rain gauge stations distributed across the gba are used in this study which is offered by the cma guangzhou joint research center for atmospheric sciences with support from the guangdong meteorological bureau the locations of these stations are shown in fig 1c gba is in south china so its rainy season usually lasts from may to august and extreme precipitation events often occur during this period our study focuses on the summer may to august of 1998 2014 when both satellite derived rainfall and rain gauge data are available to derive characteristics of regional idf curves of high spatial resolutions we also used and assess the cmorph v1 0 precipitation dataset which is a satellite only retrieval data product generated by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration joyce et al 2004 joyce and xie 2011 cmorph data are available between 60 n and 60 s at a spatial resolution of 0 0728 8 km at the equator and with a temporal interval of half hour from january 1998 to the present we chose cmorph for the supplementary analyses because of its high spatial and temporal resolution and its permissive usage license given that the sparse infrequent or short term rainfall data from the hourly gauged observations would make it difficult to generate robust idf curves courty et al 2019 when estimating idf curves the annual maximum series of hourly rainfall intensity is usually used table 1 is the basic statistics of rainfall data for gaoyao guangzhou doumen and shenzhen which will be used in the subsequent analysis the annual maximum rainfall intensity for different durations is obtained by the sliding window method 3 methods we used the ordinary d gev model and the scaling invariant bayesian hierarchical model sibhm which are both introduced in the following to derive the idf curves for rain gauge stations or grids in cmorph for both the rain gauge and cmorph data we analyzed the idf curves individually for all 26 gauges or grids by the ordinary d gev model fig 1 however due to the high computation demand of the sibhm method which estimates idf parameters for all stations or grids simultaneously we analyzed the idf curves for the 9 gauges or grids located in large cities by the sibhm method to better show the spatial patterns of idf characteristics and compare them between the two datasets and between the two methods applied the ordinary kriging oliver and webster 2015 is used to interpolate the results derived from the rain gauges or grids 3 1 ordinary d gev model intensity duration frequency idf curves describe the relationship between rainfall intensity and duration in a specific return period the general idf relationship can be formulated as a separable function of duration and return period koutsoyiannis et al 1998 1 i d t r a t r d θ h where i is the rainfall intensity d is the duration in hours and t r is the return period a t r is the function of t r which can be determined by the probability distribution function of the maximum rainfall intensity in addition h is the hershfield factor hershfield 1962 used for the correction of measurement frequency θ and h are non negative coefficients with θ 0 0 h 1 eq 1 indicates that in a given return period rainfall intensity decreases with the increase of rainfall duration since the gev distribution is theoretically established for extreme case modeling it has been widely used in the estimation of idf curves in this study we are based on a d gev model which is defined following koutsoyiannis et al 1998 we assume that the annual maximum rainfall intensity of any site over duration d d 1 2 3 24 h follows the gev distribution well 2 i d gev μ d σ d ξ d and the cumulative probability distribution of rainfall intensity x is given as follows coles et al 2001 koutsoyiannis 2009 3 f x μ σ ξ exp 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ where f x denotes a family of functions with three parameters 1 ξ x μ σ 0 with location parameter μ scale parameter σ 0 and shape parameter ξ μ and σ depend on duration while ξ is always keep constant hence eq 3 can be written as a duration dependent generalized extreme value d gev distribution 4 f x d μ d σ d ξ θ h exp 1 ξ x σ d d θ h μ d σ d 1 ξ parameters in the d gev method eq 4 can be inferred by the maximum likelihood method in this study we used the functions provided by the idf package in r to estimate the idf relationship ulrich et al 2020 3 2 the scaling invariant bayesian hierarchical model sibhm it is equivalent to linking idf curves at two different durations d and d 0 based on the scale invariant theory if eq 1 is expressed as blanchet et al 2016 5 i d t r i d 0 t r d θ d 0 θ h in addition the dependence of the location μ scale σ and shape ξ parameters on duration can be shown as blanchet et al 2016 nguyen et al 1998 6 μ d μ d 0 d θ d 0 θ h 7 σ d σ d 0 d θ d 0 θ h 8 ξ d ξ d 0 eqs 6 8 imply that the location μ and scale σ parameters are duration dependent in the gev scaling model while the shape parameter remains constant and is independent of time scale coles et al 2001 nadarajah et al 1998 since the scaling relationships of μ and σ are straight lines in a logarithmic plot the log transformed of eqs 6 and 7 can be presented as 9 log μ d log μ d 0 h log d θ d 0 θ 10 log σ d log σ d 0 h log d θ d 0 θ urban infrastructure is mainly designed based on sub daily idf curves courty et al 2019 so we often pay more attention to rainfall intensity at sub daily time scales consequently despite the choices of d and d 0 can be arbitrary d 0 d 24 24 hour is usually assumed to obtain the parameters μ and σ on shorter scales blanchet et al 2016 muller et al 2008 the parameters in this scaling invariant idf model are inferred from the bayesian hierarchical model in the bayesian hierarchical framework we need to set prior distributions for gev parameters according to the existing information such as the experience and historical data eqs 8 9 and 10 describe the relationship between the moments of the gev distribution at different durations therefore the prior distributions of the three parameters can be assumed as lima et al 2018 11 log μ d n α h log d θ d 24 θ τ μ 2 12 log σ d n β h log d θ d 24 θ τ σ 2 13 ξ d n ξ τ ξ 2 where n represents the normal distribution which with respective mean and variance α log μ d 24 and β log σ d 24 are gev location and scale parameters with rainfall duration of 24 h respectively θ 0 and 0 h 1 are scaling coefficients ξ is the average shape parameter of diverse durations τ μ 2 τ σ 2 and τ ξ 2 are the variance associated with their respective scaling processes in addition to obtain more information and make the parameters of the prior distribution hyperparameters more accurate it is also necessary to set the hyperprior distribution to efficiently estimate the idf parameters in a regional way h θ α and β need to be estimated for each rain gauge separately and independently while the remaining hyperparameters ξ τ μ 2 τ σ 2 τ ξ 2 are estimated by considering the whole dataset involving all gauge stations in a pooled regional way the specific settings of hyperparameters are discussed in lima et al 2018 finally the joint posterior distribution of the complete parameter set is shown as 14 p r θ i r 1 n j 1 t r d 1 24 g e v i d j r μ d r σ d r ξ d r n log μ d r α r h r log d θ r d 24 θ r τ μ 2 n log σ d r β r h r log d θ r d 24 θ r τ σ 2 n ξ d r ξ τ ξ 2 n α r 0 10 6 n β r

total number of rainfall gauges the subscripts r and j are rainfall gauge and year respectively t r denotes the total number of years for rainfall gauge d is the rainfall duration and d 24 24 hour besides the three gev parameters μ σ and ξ vary with rainfall duration and gauge stations b a b represents the beta distribution with lower bound a and upper bound b u is the uniform distribution and its associated upper and lower bound intervals inv gamma is the inverse gamma distribution adopted to show the prior distributions of the gev shape and scale parameters according to the bayesian theorem the calculation of posterior distribution involves normalization factors for the parameter set θ it is difficult to integrate its posterior distribution whereas the markov chain monte carlo mcmc method has been widely used for systematic random sampling from a high dimensional probability distribution in this study with reference to the code provided by lima et al 2018 the simulation is carried out by calling the openbugs in r through the r2winbugs package mcmc needs several iterations before approaching the stable distribution commonly which is called the warm up phase or burn in period we usually discard samples collected in the burn in period and retain the samples collected after the markov chain converges to the stable distribution in addition to reduce the autocorrelation of samples the thinning interval between consecutive observations needs to be set two groups of bayesian simulations are carried out using cmorph and rain gauge data respectively during the simulation we set up 9 chains per group each for 20 000 iterations discarding the first 10 000 iterations the burn in period is set to the first half iterations one sample is taken every 50 iterations in the remaining 10 000 iterations the thinning rate is set to 50 thus each chain resulted in 200 10 000 50 samples and the sample size of the posterior distribution of each parameter is 1800 9 chains finally based on 9 runs of the metropolis hastings algorithm we access the convergence of posterior distributions intuitively using the gelman s r ˆ convergence criteria gelman et al 2013 where r ˆ value should keep below 1 1 almost all r ˆ values obtained from the two sets of data used for simulation are less than 1 01 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial variability of the location and scale parameters estimated by ordinary d gev we use cmorph and rain gauge data in 24 durations 1 24 h of gba respectively and use maximum likelihood estimation mle coles et al 2001 to estimate ordinary d gev parameters the location parameter μ and scale parameter σ are used to describe the entire intensity frequency distribution for a given d 24 h the shape parameter ξ is not considered here because the distribution is not sensitive to the rainfall duration the gev parameters and their spatial distribution can be interpreted relatively easily from the maps of gev parameters μ and σ shown in fig 2 μ represents the center of the distribution and describes the shift of the distribution in each direction of the horizontal axis σ is the distribution of the data around μ and as σ increases the distribution becomes more spread out higher σ indicates an increase in variability of the distribution and places with high σ are more prone to extreme precipitation events fig 2 presents the spatial variations of gev location and scale parameters in gba figs 2a and 2b figs 2c and 2d were derived from the cmorph and rain gauge data respectively the pattern of the location parameters μ of cmorph fig 2a shows that the high value zones of μ are concentrated in the south middle and west of jiangmen and the southwest of zhuhai the μ values over northern guangzhou and western and eastern huizhou are also significantly higher than those in their surrounding regions the low value zones of μ are more concentrated in the estuary of the pearl river namely the east of zhongshan zhuhai hong kong and shenzhen from the pattern of μ obtained from rain gauge data fig 2c the μ value over coastal cities in gba is distinctly higher than that of inland cities showing the distribution pattern of southeast high northwest low the largest discrepancy between figs 2a and 2c is located at the pearl river estuary which may result from the precipitation bias of the cmorph data chen et al 2018 noted that cmorph underestimates the rainfall intensity near the coastline of south china compared with the rain gauge data figs 2b and 2d show the spatial pattern of scale parameter σ obtained by using cmorph and rain gauge data respectively the σ spatial distributions obtained from the two datasets show a similar spatial pattern as μ the high σ value is usually accompanied by high σ values which is consistent with the findings of wang and xuan 2021 for great britain and australia since the spatial distribution of σ can roughly reflect the expected geographic pattern of extreme precipitation regions that show high rainfall intensity is often observed with a high occurrence probability of extreme precipitation in gba the rainfall spatial distribution in guangdong is affected by land sea contrast local topography the influence of tropical cyclones and other convective systems resulting in the local rainstorm as well chen et al 2018 he et al 2022 the orientation of the coastal mountains in guangdong is almost parallel to the coastline which is favorable for the converging and lifting of the water vapor from the south china sea and thereby increasing the rainfall intensity heavy storms contributed a large part of the rainfall amount over guangdong particularly over coasts and the windward side of mountains there are three rainstorm centers in guangdong including fogang in qingyuan enping in yangjiang and haifeng in shanwei rainfall in these three regions is long lasting and strong which can easily lead to extreme precipitation the north of guangzhou the south of jiangmen and the east of huizhou are near these three rainstorm centers corresponding to the spatial distribution of the high value zones of the two parameters shown by cmorph figs 2a and 2b as expected the high resolution cmorph captures finer details of the spatial distribution of extreme precipitation than rain gauge data 4 2 spatial variability of intensity under various return periods across rainfall durations fig 3 displays the spatial distributions of the 2 50 and 100 year return periods for 1 and 24 hour rainfall intensity obtained from the fitted gev distribution from the ordinary d gev model figs 3a and 3b are estimated using cmorph and surface rain gauge data respectively fig 3 shows that as the duration increases from 1 to 24 h the spatial distribution of rainfall intensity under 2 and 50 year return periods are different but the spatial distribution of rainfall intensity under 50 and 100 year return periods are similar as expected under the same return period the shorter the rainfall duration the greater the rainfall intensity while under the same rainfall duration the longer the return period the higher the rainfall intensity for the results of cmorph fig 3a f considering the 2 year return period the high value zones at 1 h duration are found in the north of guangzhou and the southwest of jiangmen the spatial distribution of rainfall intensity in gba is similar to the distribution of μ shown in fig 2a precipitation events that occur on average every two years are quite common and they tend to occur frequently with the increase in rainfall duration to 24 h fig 3d the spatial distribution of high value zones is still found in southwest jiangmen however the north of guangzhou which shows high intensity of the 2 year return period does not show high intensity of the 100 year return period focusing on the 50 year return period the high value zones at 1 h duration are found not only in the southwest of jiangmen but also in the east of huizhou and the junction of huizhou and shenzhen while they extend and become more significant at 24 h duration fig 3e the high value zone in the map represents areas in gba where maximum rainfall intensities concentrate and where extreme precipitation events are most likely to occur the range of low value zones at the 50 year return period is much larger than that at the 2 year return period the results of the 100 year return period are consistent with those at the 50 year return period except that the zone of low values at the 100 year return period is larger than that at the 50 year return period under the same rainfall duration the finding fits the definition of return period because probability theory suggests that for an event with a return period of 50 years the probability of at least one such occurring within 50 years is 63 6 atomic energy regulatory board of india 2008 precipitation events that occur on average every 50 years are rare in one s lifetime and centennial return period precipitation events are even rarer for the results of rain gauge data fig 3g l considering the 2 year return period the high value zones at both 1 h and 24 h duration are found in the southwest of jiangmen and the estuary of the pearl river the spatial distribution of rainfall intensity is also similar to the distribution of σ shown in fig 2d in the case of 24 h duration focusing on the 50 and 100 year return periods the high value zones at 1 h duration are found in dongguan and the north of huizhou when the duration comes to 24 h the high value zones extend to the whole river network of the pearl river delta compared with figs 3a f and 3g l the high value zone of rainfall intensity obtained by cmorph deviates from the rain gauge station in addition cmorph underestimated the rainfall intensity of gba particularly in the estuary of the pearl river this is especially true for a short duration d 1 h at the 2 year return period the minimum rainfall intensity of rain gauge data was 2 26 times that of cmorph and the 50 year and 100 year return periods are 2 33 and 2 4 times respectively the maximum rainfall intensity of rain gauge data is also larger than that of cmorph the significant underestimate of extreme rainfall intensity by the cmorph precipitation data shows a somewhat systematic bias should be further corrected before that it is applied for the risk management of gba storms and the cmorph algorithm should be improved to retrieve precipitation rate for regions such as gba 4 3 posterior distributions and scaling of gev parameters estimated by the sibhm model four rainfall gauges in gba a gaoyao b guangzhou c doumen and d shenzhen see location in fig 1c are randomly selected from the full set of 9 gauges for the result presentation relationships between three gev parameters μ σ and ξ and rainfall duration are obtained by fitting duration dependent idf with the ordinary d gev model and the scaling invariant model inferred by the bayesian hierarchical model fig 4 shows the scaling of the location parameter μ with the rainfall duration 1 24 h derived from the ordinary d gev and the sibhm the 95 credible interval was obtained from the bayesian posterior distribution in the four selected gauges for both cmorph and rain gauge data all the point estimates of ordinary d gev are within the credible interval and μ obtained by both methods shows a monotone nonlinear relationship with the rainfall duration although μ increases with the decreases of duration the credible interval range can quantify the uncertainty the spread of the credible interval in fig 4 gets wider as duration decreases indicating that shorter duration has greater uncertainty in rainfall characteristics fig 5 shows the relation between the scale parameter σ and rainfall duration for the same gauges evaluated for μ shown in fig 4 a nonlinear relationship between σ and rainfall duration which is similar to μ and rainfall duration is also found likewise here the spread of the credible interval also gets wider with the decrease of rainfall duration nevertheless for σ the point estimates from the ordinary d gev are not all in the credible interval range therefore σ reveals weaker linear scaling and higher uncertainty than μ the sibhm model derived a much more smooth scaling of μ and σ than the ordinary d gev method which indicates that sibhm can show more scaling features of parameters due to its explicit consideration of scale invariances of idf parameters to the rainfall duration the results of the shape parameter ξ are different from the parameters μ and σ fig 6 there is no obvious correlation between ξ and rainfall duration no scaling in ξ which is consistent with eq 8 in addition the scaling of the bayesian estimates ξ is quite distinct from those of ordinary d gev since most of the estimated points from the ordinary d gev model do not fall inside the credible intervals obtained from the sibhm since ξ represents where most of the data lies and thus governs the tail heaviness of the distribution ξ 0 ξ 0 and ξ 0 correspond to fréchet gumbel and weibull distributions respectively high volatility in ξ derived from the ordinary d gev could result in large estimation uncertainty of rainfall intensity at various rainfall duration many studies have shown that it is difficult to precisely estimate ξ because it is affected by both record length and geographical location e g elevation overeem et al 2008 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 ragulina and reitan 2017 which should be further explored in future studies figs 7a and 7b show the sibhm posterior distributions of h and θ for the entire set of 9 gauges respectively figs 7c and 7d show the relationship between h and α h and θ respectively the left and right columns of fig 7 show the results derived from the cmorph and rain gauge data respectively it can be seen from fig 7c that h and α are not consistently related across the 9 gauges but the spread of the posterior distribution of α for a given gauge is weakly associated with its corresponding distribution of h however fig 7d shows a strong and consistent correlation between h and θ across the 9 gauges all the results in fig 7 are similar to what lima et al 2018 found for south korea which indicates that the parameters of h and θ derived from the sibhm generally show significant differences between different regions 4 4 intensity duration frequency curves for gauge sites to compare how idf curves produced by the sibhm differ from those curves obtained from the ordinary d gev method we draw idf curves based on the mean posterior estimates of μ σ and ξ simulated by the sibhm the results of these two methods are displayed in fig 8 for the selected rain gauges 1 guangzhou and 2 shenzhen which are two of the largest cities in china the idf curves are drawn from both cmorph and rain gauge data during the flood season from 1998 to 2014 the result provides the projected intensities of annual rainfall maxima used for 1 24 h duration at 25 10 20 50 and 100 year return periods from fig 8 we can see that the longer the return period the greater will be the rainfall intensity rainfall intensity gets lower when the rainfall duration increases overall rainfall intensity estimated by sibhm is so close to that by the ordinary d gev especially at long rainfall durations and return periods the greatest differences seem to occur at short durations and large return periods where the rainfall intensity is extremely high indicating a greater uncertainty of parameter estimation for the shorter rainfall duration the development of the d gev method is relatively mature and the minimum length of the rainfall data to calculate the idf curves are suggested to be more than 30 years for having a high statistical significance even though in engineering practice the minimum value of 10 years was used by environment and climate change canada to develop idf curves for engineering practice due to a lack of long term rain gauge data for small sample analyses in this study some stations show unstable parameters of idf curves using the mle estimate which is also indicated by previous analyses on the gev parameter distribution of storms over various regions in the world martins and stedinger 2000 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 therefore it is inevitable to have large uncertainties in the idf estimation and the d gev estimate could be unstable and show large differences from those of other advanced methods e g sibhm note that the ordinary d gev method does not consider the possible scaling in the gev parameters across various durations so it naturally results in more unstable than methods considering scaling such as the sibhm moreover compared with the region independent ordinary d gev method inferred by the maximum likelihood estimates the regional inference of idf parameters by the sibhm pooling all information from all stations can significantly improve the parameter estimates for different datasets at the same gauge the rainfall intensity of idf curves obtained by cmorph is significantly lower than that of rain gauge data and the underestimation of shenzhen is more obvious than that of guangzhou this may be because shenzhen is closer to the sea than guangzhou as mentioned above cmorph is weak in representing rainfall intensity near the coastline 5 summary and conclusions based on the generalized extreme value distribution two different methods the ordinary gev model inferred by the maximum likelihood estimation method and the scaling invariant gev model inferred by the bayesian hierarchical model are used to describe the idf characteristics in gba the results illustrate that the gev location μ and scale σ parameters of idf curves in gba show similar spatial distribution where a high μ is usually accompanied by a high σ indicating those areas showing higher rainfall intensity are often observed with a higher occurrence probability of extreme precipitation more specifically the coastal areas of gba are more prone to extreme precipitation than inland areas in addition the higher resolution cmorph can capture more local details than rain gauge data by analyzing the period maps of rainfall intensity at the 1 h and 24 h durations in different return periods we found that the areas showing the maximum rainfall intensity and the most frequent extreme precipitation events in gba are mainly located in the coastal regions and huizhou considering both the ordinary d gev and the bayesian estimates no scaling of shape parameters was observed and the scaling properties of the gev location and scale parameters with rainfall duration in our study cities were consistent with the previous research lima et al 2018 the obvious difference between the ordinary d gev idf and sibhm idf estimates results from the reduced uncertainty benefiting from the scaling estimation in sibhm the comparison between the sibhm and the ordinary d gev model on observed rain gauge data shows that the sibhm can describe the rainfall characteristics well although there are great differences in rainfall intensity of short duration between the two models due to the large uncertainty and data samples of rainfall of short duration in theory the bayesian model considers the scaling invariant property of rainfall in the formula and uses more information from various duration to estimate parameters which is indeed able to better adjust the uncertainty of data however the key to reliable gev parameter estimation is to use longer time series while our analyses only use a relatively short rainfall time series which may well miss many extreme events we fully compared the results of the two datasets and found that cmorph is inherently biased and uncertain in representing extreme rainfall intensity compared with the rain gauge data cmorph underestimates the rainfall intensity near the coastal region of gba especially for the pearl river delta our analyses adopted the gev distribution function to describe the probability density distributions of annual maximum rainfall intensity but some studies generally believe that the pearson ⅲ distribution and the gumbel distribution should be more suitable for china therefore the latter two probability distributions need to be used for further comparative studies in addition much of the existing infrastructure is designed assuming a stationary climate but global warming will affect extreme precipitation events wang et al 2019 zhang and villarini 2017 therefore the stationarity assumption may no longer hold it is necessary to quantify the impact of climate changes on idf curves to employ non stationary idf curves in future

7713,study region the ca river basin is located in the north central coast area of vietnam study focus this study aims to develop a deep learning framework that is both effective and straightforward in order to forecast water levels in the ca river basin in advance of multiple time steps for the event scales we have thoroughly studied and assessed two deep learning models dlms long short term memory lstm and gated recurrent unit gru for their capacity to forecast water levels focusing on various aspects such as the influence of sequence length or the impact of hyperparameter selection besides two data scenarios were established using hydrological data from eight severe floods between 2007 and 2019 to examine the effect of input variables on model performance water level data was employed for both the scenarios s1 and s2 whereas precipitation data was used only in s2 the cross validation technique was used dynamically to address the issue of limited data the inputs were reformatted as tensors and were then randomly divided into subsets this flexible tuning preserved the sequential nature of the hydrological data while enabling the dlms to be trained efficiently new hydrological insights for the region the findings revealed that both the models exhibited equally excellent performances the nse of the lstm model varies from 0 999 0 971 compared to 0 998 0 974 of the gru model corresponding to forecast cases from one to four time steps ahead this indicated that the use of multiple input data types s2 contrary to only one date type s1 does not necessarily improve the forecasting performance lstm gru models with one hidden layer are adequate for delivering high performance while minimizing the data processing time graphical abstract effect of two different data scenarios on the performance of lstm and gru models in terms of a nse and b mae ga1 keywords ca river basin cross validation extreme flood lstm gru data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change has increased the severity of precipitation events leading to more floods lehmann et al 2015 floods are among the most destructive natural catastrophes resulting in human deaths and significant economic damage fernandez et al 2016 as the frequency of floods is expected to increase worldwide alfieri et al 2017 it is critical to have an effective streamflow prediction system that can deal with timely and efficient water resource planning and irrigation options flood hazard assessment release timing and other objectives sit et al 2020 previous studies have applied various model types to enhance streamflow forecasting accuracy several stochastic models that have been employed for such tasks e g autoregressive moving average prado et al 2020 are based on time series however the various sources of uncertainties involved in hydrological prediction imply that the models cannot accurately predict the nonstationary and nonlinear features of the hydrological datasets shortridge et al 2016 the nonlinear dependency of streamflow prediction on hydro meteorological and anthropogenic factors causes significant unpredictability in geographical and temporal terms xiao et al 2019 zounemat kermani et al 2021 consequently there has been a variety of interests in streamflow forecasting that has drawn attention from scientists worldwide with the application of data driven approaches e g neural networks farfán et al 2020 wavelet transform kisi and cimen 2011 extreme gradient boosting xgboost nguyen et al 2021 and lstm alizadeh et al 2021 le et al 2019b in recent decades ghimire et al 2021 demonstrated that ai driven models are better than stochastic models in terms of modeling processes machine learning ml models which include support vector machine svm phan and nguyen 2020 genetic algorithm ga danandeh mehr 2018 random forest rf zahura and goodall 2022 artificial neural networks anns makwana and tiwari 2014 tamiru and dinka 2021 and specialized dlms kratzert et al 2018 le et al 2021b are widely used to investigate the nonlinear dynamics of hydrological time series xu and liang 2021 owing to their capacity to acquire sequential dependencies dlms have recently been presented as a better prototype of ml for handling time series data liu et al 2020 the most frequently used dlm for streamflow forecasting applications is the lstm form of a recurrent neural network rnn le et al 2019b yang et al 2020 although the superiority of dlms particularly lstm has been demonstrated in several previous studies on hydrologic prediction ho et al 2022 kao et al 2020 kratzert et al 2019 xiang et al 2020 the event scale has not yet witnessed the spread of these models this can be explained by the fact that dlms tend to obtain better stability and efficiency if a sufficiently large amount of input data is collected both in terms of the number of samples and the variables involved in other words these data must be sequential and continuously observed over a long period of time for event scales in which floods referring to peak floods typically occur over a few hours to several days collecting a large number of consecutive samples is not practical cross validation is a widely used strategy in ml to address such issues of limited data however applying cv is not often done for situations involving time series data or lstm based models since it has the potential to eliminate the sequential properties that are present in the input data in this study we focused on the performance of event scale streamflow forecasting several flexible adjustments to the input data structure were performed to address the shortcomings before applying the cv technique to the lstm model in addition to investigating the performance of the lstm model on the event scale we conducted a comparison with the gru model another well known architecture for dealing with time series data challenges we chose the ca river watershed one of the largest and most important river systems of vietnam as a case study because it has attracted considerable attention from the vietnamese government for the substantial annual budget spent on flood mitigation measures jica 2012 several people have perished in the catastrophic floods in the preceding decades ca river streamflow forecasting systems will enhance flood protection and disaster relief as well as the development and utilization of integrated water resources researchers have employed a variety of approaches to obtain useful information for flood management in the ca river basin dung et al 2021 phuong et al 2019 in comparison few studies in the ca river basin focus on multi time ahead flood prediction using ml techniques as a result the primary goals of this research are as follows 1 development of an efficient predictive deep learning framework for event scale water level forecasting in the ca river basin 2 comprehensive evaluation of the event scale multi time step ahead streamflow forecasting ability of two dlms lstm and gru 3 investigation of the importance and influence of input variables on the predictability and performance of the lstm gru models and 4 review of the impact of selecting hyperparameters and the optimal sequence length in the lstm gru for event scale forecasting issues eight flooding events were used for training and evaluating the models and their performance was quantified using four statistical indicators the findings of this research may help improve the understanding of the behavior and performance of the algorithms used for a range of event scale prediction tasks as well as to comprehend the impact of input variables on the predictive capacity of dlms the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the characteristics of the research region and includes hydro meteorological data in addition to the methodology proposed data scenarios and quantitative criteria section 3 provides a detailed presentation of the study s findings and analysis this section also presents an overview of the predictive performance of lstm gru models for the event scale problem as well as remarks on the significance of the selected input variables finally section 4 summarizes the research 2 materials and methods 2 1 study basin and data description the ca river basin situated in the north central coast region is one of vietnam s nine largest river basins this is an international river watershed with a total river length of approximately 531 km and covers a catchment size of 28 830 km2 of which approximately 18 800 km2 are inside vietnam territory and accounts for 65 2 of the entire basin area it originates in lao pdr and travels northwest southeast through most of nghe an province before joining sub branches from ha tinh province and pouring into the east sea via the cua hoi river mouth the ca river basin has various climatic and hydrological flow characteristics owing to its extensive expanse as a result the rainy season typically lasts from may to october in the upstream regions and from august to november in the downstream areas the average annual rainfall in the downstream region varies from 1700 to 1800 mm due to the weather variability the ca river flood season is divided into two distinct flooding phases pre season flooding and main season flooding events pre season floods are defined as those that occur around may and june owing to the vigorous activity of the northern hemisphere and southwest monsoons meanwhile main season floods because of heavy rainfall were identified between september and october flood statistics for the ca river basin indicate that extreme floods that cause severe inundation frequently occur in august in the upstream area and september in the central and downstream mainly because of prolonged heavy rains and tropical storms each flood lasts from 10 to 14 days wreaking havoc and substantially impairing the socio economic development of the whole region for floods that cause large scale inundation in urban areas in the lower ca river basin vinh city the observed flood peaks on the main branches often do not appear simultaneously this may be the reason for the modest efficiency of flood flow forecasting by the regulators the lower ca river is densely inhabited of which vinh city with a population of 545 180 in 2018 serves as the socio economic center of the north central region this study was conducted on the lower ca river a relatively sensitive and frequently flooded area in the provinces of ha tinh and nghe an the research area is depicted in fig 1 and table 1 provides details about several floods causing large scale inundation in the lower ca river to construct an effective real time flood warning platform for the lower ca river which has a high urban population the cho trang hydrological station located on the lam river was selected as the target station for this study located approximately 29 km from the east sea from the cua hoi river mouth cho trang station can be affected by the tidal water level in several cases this hydrological station is prevalently utilized in flood warning systems for vinh city because its strategic geographical location makes it ideal for establishing a flood warning system for the city nguyen 2021 in addition the data mined were the hourly observed water levels and precipitation at nine hydro meteorological stations during extreme flood events recorded between 2007 and 2019 these data were retrieved from the national center for hydro meteorological forecasting in the north central region of vietnam fig 1 and table 2 indicate the geographical locations of these hydro meteorological stations accordingly observed data from eight extreme flood events that caused large scale inundation in the urban area were identified between 2007 and 2019 of which each flood event lasted for 10 days brief information on the flood events is described in table 3 2 2 methods 2 2 1 lstm neural network according to the categorization of deep learning algorithms lstm is a specific type of rnn that belongs to the supervised learning category although this architecture was first introduced in the late 1990s by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 it has been widely used in the recent decade owing to rapid developments in computer science as a result lstm has demonstrated its superiority in handling time series data tasks salehinejad et al 2018 and in the hydrology domain le et al 2019a the scheme of the memory block in lstm is illustrated in fig 2 at any given time t step each lstm memory block is connected through two main components the hidden state and the cell state the hidden state or short term memory holds the output information in the memory cell h t as input to the next memory cell h t 1 the cell state c t known as long term memory is where critical information is stored for a prolonged period the outcome values of the cell state and hidden state in each lstm memory block are determined using the following equations 1 f t σ u f x t w f h t 1 2 i t σ u i x t w i h t 1 3 o t σ u o x t w o h t 1 4 n t t a n h u n x t w n h t 1 5 c t f t c t 1 i t n t 6 h t o t tanh c t where at the given time step t x t y t are the input data and output values n t represents the candidate of the cell state f t i t o t represent outcomes of the forget gate input gate and output gate respectively u w are weight matrices σ represents a sigmoid function tanh is the hyperbolic tangent function and represents the element wise multiplication 2 2 2 gru neural network in addition to the lstm network architecture the gru architecture first introduced by cho et al 2014 also identified as an evolutionary form of standard rnns conceptually both the lstm and gru architectures are designed to overcome the weaknesses of rnns in addressing the vanishing gradient problem when working with long term dependencies by adding gate mechanisms chung et al 2014 a diagram of the memory block in the gru architecture is shown in fig 3 instead of using three gate layers as in the lstm the operating mechanism of the gru architecture is a combination of only two gate layers or two vectors the update gate and the reset gate kostadinov 2017 the update gate has the same operating mechanism as the forget gate and input gate in lstm where it is decided whether the information of cell state h t 1 should be updated the reset gate with a similar role as the forget gate a modified version of lstm determines the amount of past information to leave behind or forget the following formulas determine each gru memory cell s output values h t cell state 7 z t σ u z x t w z h t 1 8 r t σ u r x t w r h t 1 9 h t t a n h u h x t r t w h h t 1 10 h t 1 z t h t z t h t 1 where at a given time step t z t r t represent the outcomes of the update and reset gates h t means the candidate of the gru cell compared to the lstm the gru model made a few changes in the structure to simplify the number of internal parameters and be easier to train accordingly the output information of each gru block is a single quantity instead of consisting of two separate components hidden and cell states as in the lstm block the outcome value of each gru cell is transmitted directly to the next cell without the need for any control the output gate controls the outcome values of each lstm cell and this information is then transferred to the next cell with such a design the gru model can reduce computational resources while still providing performance competitive with lstm for sequential data problems cahuantzi et al 2021 2 2 3 cross validation cv technique cv is a popular training approach in ml for assessing the model performance it is beneficial for ml issues where the number of collected data samples is limited brownlee 2018 at the theoretical level this technique randomly splits the available dataset into k sub datasets of equal size the k 1 datasets are exploited for the training while the last dataset is utilized as unseen data for validation pedregosa et al 2011 the ml models will finish the training after undergoing a total of k times of validation as above where each validation is conducted on a different dataset the model performance can then be estimated as the average of k times of cv on the entire dataset this is also the reason that this technique is known as a k fold cv despite their popularity in ml they do not yet seem universally applied to problems involving time series data and the hydrological field according to le et al 2021b the complexity of the sequential properties might be one of the primary reasons why the cv technique is not of considerable interest in time series issues especially in flood forecasting to forecast streamflow during extreme flood events the cv technique was used in this study to overcome the drawback of the number of collected samples the data collected from the eight major flood events between 2007 and 2019 were divided into two independent and non overlapping sections the first section is the water level data record of seven flood events that caused large scale inundation of the lower ca river for seven years including 2007 2008 2010 2011 2016 2018 and 2019 the remaining dataset was the water level data from the 2013 event which was exploited to evaluate the model performance on an independent dataset objectively this year the lower ca river suffered significant losses in terms of both human and socio economic factors a schematic of the training and validation processes using the cv technique is depicted in fig 4 2 3 primary components of model 2 3 1 scenarios in addition to comprehensively analyzing the performance of the two dlms lstm and gru in water level forecasting problems during typical flood events this study aims to investigate the aspects that might impact the performance of data driven predictive models critical elements of interest include the characterization of the data data preprocessing and rational selection of the internal hyperparameters of the dlm first two data scenarios were recommended to assess the influence of data types on the event scale forecasting performance of the two dlms these scenarios were designed based on the availability of the datasets and their impact on the ca river system the first scenario s1 comprised only water level information at seven stations including the target station assuming that the multi hour ahead water levels at the objective gauge station could be forecasted based solely on information about water level changes recorded in the past at the measurement stations in the remaining scenario s2 information on precipitation was considered coupled with data on the water level there are nine data input variables for this scenario corresponding to the observed data series at hydro meteorological stations including two ground based rainfall gauge stations and seven water level gauge stations as in the first scenario in the next stage the available raw data from seven flood events mentioned in section 2 1 and section 2 2 3 underwent a preprocessing step to adjust the input data s size and format instead of simply utilizing observed data at any time t in the matrix form of 1 k with k as the number of observed variables we mined the data availability in previous observation steps to format them as the matrix of j k here j refers to the number of previous adjacent observations of interest in dlms j is the sequence length of input at any given time step based on the study of le et al 2021b the sequence length is a parameter that directly influences the operability and training time of the dlms for this study where event scale flow forecasting is preferred two values of j are recommended 4 and 8 in terms of powers of 2 the operational design of the input data of the two recommended scenarios

length of the formatted input or the number of previous observations of gauge stations in this study the values of j were 4 and 8 2 3 2 model hyperparameters the hyperparameters of the two models lstm and gru are set comparably to fairly and thoroughly evaluate the efficacy of the two dlms in prediction cases at an event scale matching the two recommended scenarios the recommended number of processing units in each lstm gru block is a power of 2 and varies from 16 to 128 in addition we utilized only one hidden layer for all models in this study this can be explained by research done by le et al 2021b as the use of multiple hidden layers in lstm gru models does not enhance their performance in the streamflow prediction task as mentioned above this study applied the cv technique flexibly to achieve model stability and overcome the issue of limited data these inputs underwent a random shuffle and were divided into seven subsets corresponding to seven folds for training however before the randomization process was implemented all the collected data from the seven flood events observed data at any time step were reformatted into two dimensional arrays of size j k as discussed in section 2 3 1 scenarios the reformatting of observations at any time step t from a matrix of size 1 k to a matrix of size j k is intended to preserve the sequential characteristics of time series data in events regarding the training process the adam algorithm with a learning rate of 0 001 was the optimization algorithm coupled with the mean square error mse loss function in this study kingma and ba 2014 in addition the number of computation iterations or the number of epochs per fold was set to 500 finally several machine learning techniques such as early stopping and model checkpoints have been established to ensure the most effective learning process and the necessary information during this process is saved this work was developed in the python programming language rossum 1995 and made use of several open source ml libraries including keras chollet et al 2015 and tensorflow abadi et al 2015 besides dlms are deployed on pcs with hardware configurations including processors of amd ryzen 7 3700x ram of 32 gb and graphics cards of nvidia geforce gtx 1660 supper 2 4 performance metrics in this study four criteria were used to quantify the predictive ability of dlms these are extensively employed statistical indicators to determine the correlation and inaccuracy of hydrological models these include mean absolute error mae nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and kling gupta

respectively 3 results and discussion the results presented in this section represent the model test steps the flood event of 2013 which had not been used before was exploited to evaluate the multi time step predictive performance of the trained dlms the competitive performance of the lstm and gru models was quantified using four metrics mae nse kge and smape the influence of hydrological data characteristics on event scale predictability is also of interest detailed information about the results of the dlms for the specific cases of the two scenarios is described in appendices 1 and 2 3 1 effect of data types it is essential to conduct various tests in hydrological modeling research to improve the effectiveness and accuracy of dlms first we analyzed the performance of the two models in terms of their ability to handle various types of data statistical information regarding the performance of the models in the forecasting cases corresponding to the two scenarios is described briefly in table 4 and visually in fig 5 the numbers presented in this section are the average values of the statistical criteria for each model and forecasting case details can be found in appendices 1 and 2 according to the results in tables 4 and 5 the first scenario based models indicated better performance than the second scenario based models in all four prediction cases and for most of the statistical criteria mentioned in addition consistency in the trend of performance variation of the models is recorded through the average statistical indicators in table 4 and the prediction errors of these models seem to increase as the forecast times are increased fig 5 illustrates the superiority of s1 lstm and s1 gru over the other models in the forecast cases in accordance with the average statistics the s1 lstm with kge 0 988 and smape 1 0 exhibited the best performance whereas the s2 gru with kge 0 985 and smape 1 1 exhibited poorer performance among the models for 1 h ahead forecast in the event of a one hour ahead forecast the nse and kge values are close to the ideal threshold of 1 0 for both scenarios in other words the effect of the data type on model performance is not obvious this effect type of input data is more pronounced in the event of a four hour prediction where the s2 lstm and s2 gru models exhibit slightly lower performance compared with s1 based models the corresponding kge values for s2 lstm and s2 gru in this case were nearly 0 95 compared to approximately 0 97 for the s1 lstm and s1 gru models in general both the offered data scenarios have proven their advantages when providing dlms with an adequate amount of necessary information about the specific properties of the predictor variables yielding impressive forecasting results despite employing a blend of water level and precipitation information s2 exhibited no improvement in performance when compared to s1 just water level one reason may be that the data correlation coefficient of precipitation is significantly lower than that of the water level in the context of hydrological time series forecasting a high correlation of the input data could help dlms learn nonlinear relationships better alternatively dlms may have learned sufficient necessary information from the number of input variables water level data thus adding rainfall data does not make much sense in this case 3 2 effect of sequence length to further analyze how input data types affect model performance the effect of sequence length cannot be overlooked because it is one of the key reasons for the gap between observed and forecasted data to systematically evaluate the influence of sequence length on the prediction model this parameter was specified with varied values for lstm gru models to estimate the water level from one hour to four hours of lead time several quantitative statistics are briefly presented in table 5 see appendices 1 and 2 figs 6 7 visualize a performance comparison of the two models for the scenarios from the analytical data reported in table 5 it is clear that both lstm and gru presented a remarkable performance for all mentioned computation cases at cho trang station the performance of these models tends to decline as the required prediction time increases in the event of s1 the variation between the observed and forecasted water levels of the two models l4 lstm and l8 lstm for one hour in advance were 0 023 m and 0 027 m in terms of mae respectively meanwhile the performance of gru is slightly worse than that of lstm under the same conditions as the input data and sequence length the mae values are in turn 0 039 m and 0 029 m for l4 gru and l8 gru a more intuitive view of the effect of sequence length on water level forecasting results for multiple time steps in the future is presented in fig 6 in general the developed models demonstrate their advantages for forecasting cases the difference in the analyzed values is not considerable however the lstm model seems slightly more efficient than the gru for s1 the nse values of the four prediction cases ranged from well above 0 982 0 999 for l4 lstm and approximately 0 977 0 999 for l8 lstm the corresponding representative values for the gru model ranged from 0 982 to 0 998 and from just under 0 977 0 999 for l4 gru and l8 gru respectively in addition the effect of sequence length was recognized in the case of s2 which included precipitation data during the model training process fig 6b when the sequence length value is assigned as 4 the difference in performance between the lstm and gru is almost nonexistent the gap between the two models begins to emerge when the specified sequence length is doubled particularly in the case of long range forecasting with nse values of 0 9651 and 0 9692 for l8 lstm and l8 gru respectively a similar development is witnessed in fig 7 where statistical criteria such as kge and smape are considered the use of multiple data types adding precipitation data for s2 and complicating the model training process increasing the sequence length from 4 to 8 did not improve the performance of dlms in contrast the performance of these models is lower in some instances specifically the kge values of l8 lstm and l8 gru in the four hour ahead forecasting in terms of s2 are 0 9437 and 0 9408 respectively the corresponding figures for smape are 5 67 and 5 17 respectively from the above analysis we can conclude that sequence length has a certain influence on the hydrological forecasting capabilities of the lstm gru models particularly in the case of precipitation data utilized to forecast streamflow characteristics at a selected location if the water level is predicted to be one or two hours in advance the effect of the sequence length is negligible the choice of sequence length size depends closely on a particular issue in terms of computational resources a sequence length of four instead of eight is recommended in this study or similar studies with event scale because this saves considerable time in the training process 3 3 effect of hyperparameters in addition to assessing the influence of data characteristics and sequence length on model performance the effects of hyperparameters number of computational units per hidden layer on forecasting accuracy with various time steps in the near future are also examined quantitatively based on the analysis above it can be said that s1 exhibits better performance than s2 therefore we chose s1 to further investigate this hyperparameter s potential influence on the final forecasting results in this section as mentioned in section 2 3 2 the number of units per hidden layer selected for examination ranged from 16 to 128 in terms of powers of 2 table 6 summarizes the best quantitative outcomes the values in table 6 revealed a slight variation between the observed and forecasted water levels as mae values range between 0 019 and 0 089 m and the smape values are only about 0 67 4 06 for all four prediction cases a development trend is identified in the case of nse and kge where the correlation coefficients measuring the effectiveness of the predictive models reached exceptional values amounting to well above 0 98 and 0 97 respectively when forecasting four hours in advance in addition the statistical outcomes for each specific forecasting case in table 6 also show consistent agreement with the statistical values in tables 4 and 5 where the average values per prediction case were analyzed in most reported cases both dlms performed well at the recommended number of units of these 32 and 64 were the most prevalent values compared to 16 and 128 respectively see details in appendices 1 and 2 the preceding analysis and discussion revealed that the number of units per hidden layer is a hyperparameter that affects the performance of the lstm gru models and the processing time of mathematical operations the performance difference is insignificant when this parameter is assigned a variable value from 16 to 128 or even a larger value for multiple hour ahead streamflow forecasting minimizing the computation time and model complexity while maintaining high performance is preferred 3 4 quantification of peak forecast error at the event scale where changes in water levels can fluctuate hourly it is essential for management agencies to predict flood peak times and magnitudes accurately in the historic flood of 2013 the highest observed flood peak was recorded at the cho trang station at 2 00 a m on 18 october and the water level was up to 4 17 m a comparison of the hydrological charts for specific forecasting cases is illustrated in figs 8 and 9 table 7 provides the statistical findings of the water level forecast for this period corresponding to cases s1 l4 of interest figs 8 and 9 show the forecasted and observed data series during the 2013 flood event for s1 l4 in fig 8 refers to the outcome of the streamflow forecast for one hour ahead while the case of the four hour forward projection is shown in fig 9 table 7 further clarifies that the two lstm gru models performed equally well considering the flood peak the relative error values reported in all four forecasting cases were 1 1 with no noticeable difference in performance between lstm and gru this is a low error threshold compared to the current flood operation forecast for the ca river basin in addition to the magnitude the hydrographic plots illustrate that the predicted flood peak from the lstm gru models occurred simultaneously with the observed flood peak confirming the effectiveness of the proposed models and dlms in the event scale streamflow forecasting problem 3 5 comparison with previous studies owing to advances in computational science the application of ml in hydrological forecasting is becoming increasingly prevalent nguyen et al 2021 investigated the performance of four ml models in multistep ahead water level prediction for the jungrang basin of the han river korea two hybrid models based on a combination of the xgboost model and evolution algorithms genetic and differential were compared with the two tree based ml models rf and cart classification and registration tree according to this study the two xgboost based models exhibit higher performance than the two tree based models the nse coefficient xgboost based models ranged from 0 974 to 0 800 corresponding to one to four hour prediction situations in advance in another study nguyen et al 2022 the capacity of several ml algorithms to predict streamflow at the event scale was examined these algorithms include multiple linear regression bayesian additive regression tree bart svm and ga the key predictor variables used in these models were water level and precipitation data based on the information reported in this study the ga bart model was identified to be the best with the nse values matching four forecasted cases one to four hours ahead in the range 0 96 0 67 in addition han and morrison 2022 introduced a dlm lstm s2s in which lstm was coupled with a sequence to sequence structure to enhance streamflow prediction in the russian river watershed in california usa with this configuration the lstm s2s model outperformed the national water model in producing hourly forecasts with lead times varying from 1 to 18 h the performance of this model runs between 0 96 0 81 for short term projections from 1 4 h in terms of the nse criterion several other studies have attempted to improve hourly streamflow forecasting performance by proposing hybrid ml models such as the wavelet transform ann wann for the achankovil river in india alexander et al 2018 the polynomial network model gs gmdh for the bow river in canada elkurdy et al 2021 and gru model for the geum river in korea le et al 2021a the performance statistics of several ml models for short term streamflow forecasting are presented in table 8 most of the research cited above has proven the exceptional ability of ml models to offer accurate short term predictions in general the predictive performance of data driven models can be influenced by various elements including the ml algorithm employed predictor variables used properties of the data series gathered and geographical location of the research region for flood events wherein flood peaks may occur in a short time from a few hours to a few days enhancing the performance of streamflow forecasting has always been a challenge for academics according to the figures in this paper the proposed approach considerably improves the predictive performance of the dlms compared to previous studies the nse coefficients of the lstm gru models were in the range 0 999 0 979 equating to a level of error smape in the range 1 0 4 1 4 conclusions this study comprehensively analyzed the effectiveness of two dlms lstm and gru in a multistep ahead streamflow prediction task on the event scale level where hourly forecasting is of interest the following are some of the primary findings 1 the performance gap in the two designs is virtually insignificant in all prediction cases and even in both the offered data scenarios 2 the influence of hydrological data properties on model performance was thoroughly investigated scenario s1 which focuses solely on water level data has a minor advantage over scenario s2 which incorporates water level and precipitation data this could be because of a discrepancy in the correlation between the predictor variables and the targeted station which refers to rainfall and water level data precipitation is a random variable despite being measured over time as time series data 3 the lstm gru models with one hidden layer were adequate for providing excellent performance in hydrological prediction tasks the number of computational units per hidden layer should be between 16 and 64 in terms of powers of two increasing this value does not enhance model performance but it improves the complexity of the mathematical operations and consumes substantially longer to train these findings are consistent with prior research on daily streamflow forecasting performed by le et al 2021b 4 in flood events where the processing time is critical for forecasting we prioritize minimizing the amount of computation while attaining optimal performance therefore the recommended sequence length is four for a multistep event scale flood forecasting problem in advance 5 to preserve the sequential characteristics of the water level data the input data were flexibly reformatted before the cv technique was used to randomly separate the entire input set into seven subsets as described in section 2 3 2 in addition dlms may be developed to provide estimates with further periods such as 6 or 9 h ahead in the scope of this study we only present short term forecast results at the flood event scale corresponding to forecast cases from one hour to four hours ahead even though dlms have proven their effectiveness in hydrological forecasting tasks a few limitations are still present in this study lstm gru models are generally developed to provide highly accurate predictions for one or a few particular sites thus they do not yet interpret the physical processes of flow as in rainfall runoff models in addition several other data types that play crucial roles in hydrological models such as climate soil and topographic data have not been considered therefore hybrid models that can account for the rainfall runoff process to a certain extent may be a trend for future research the ca river basin significantly impacts the socio economic development of vietnam s north central area therefore providing highly reliable hydrological forecasting information during flood events is a crucial and challenging task for local management agencies because floods in tributaries frequently occur at different times the findings of this study could be a valuable reference source for the north central regional hydro meteorological center for enhancing flood forecasting and management capacity of the ca river as well as other river basins in vietnam and globally credit

7713,study region the ca river basin is located in the north central coast area of vietnam study focus this study aims to develop a deep learning framework that is both effective and straightforward in order to forecast water levels in the ca river basin in advance of multiple time steps for the event scales we have thoroughly studied and assessed two deep learning models dlms long short term memory lstm and gated recurrent unit gru for their capacity to forecast water levels focusing on various aspects such as the influence of sequence length or the impact of hyperparameter selection besides two data scenarios were established using hydrological data from eight severe floods between 2007 and 2019 to examine the effect of input variables on model performance water level data was employed for both the scenarios s1 and s2 whereas precipitation data was used only in s2 the cross validation technique was used dynamically to address the issue of limited data the inputs were reformatted as tensors and were then randomly divided into subsets this flexible tuning preserved the sequential nature of the hydrological data while enabling the dlms to be trained efficiently new hydrological insights for the region the findings revealed that both the models exhibited equally excellent performances the nse of the lstm model varies from 0 999 0 971 compared to 0 998 0 974 of the gru model corresponding to forecast cases from one to four time steps ahead this indicated that the use of multiple input data types s2 contrary to only one date type s1 does not necessarily improve the forecasting performance lstm gru models with one hidden layer are adequate for delivering high performance while minimizing the data processing time graphical abstract effect of two different data scenarios on the performance of lstm and gru models in terms of a nse and b mae ga1 keywords ca river basin cross validation extreme flood lstm gru data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change has increased the severity of precipitation events leading to more floods lehmann et al 2015 floods are among the most destructive natural catastrophes resulting in human deaths and significant economic damage fernandez et al 2016 as the frequency of floods is expected to increase worldwide alfieri et al 2017 it is critical to have an effective streamflow prediction system that can deal with timely and efficient water resource planning and irrigation options flood hazard assessment release timing and other objectives sit et al 2020 previous studies have applied various model types to enhance streamflow forecasting accuracy several stochastic models that have been employed for such tasks e g autoregressive moving average prado et al 2020 are based on time series however the various sources of uncertainties involved in hydrological prediction imply that the models cannot accurately predict the nonstationary and nonlinear features of the hydrological datasets shortridge et al 2016 the nonlinear dependency of streamflow prediction on hydro meteorological and anthropogenic factors causes significant unpredictability in geographical and temporal terms xiao et al 2019 zounemat kermani et al 2021 consequently there has been a variety of interests in streamflow forecasting that has drawn attention from scientists worldwide with the application of data driven approaches e g neural networks farfán et al 2020 wavelet transform kisi and cimen 2011 extreme gradient boosting xgboost nguyen et al 2021 and lstm alizadeh et al 2021 le et al 2019b in recent decades ghimire et al 2021 demonstrated that ai driven models are better than stochastic models in terms of modeling processes machine learning ml models which include support vector machine svm phan and nguyen 2020 genetic algorithm ga danandeh mehr 2018 random forest rf zahura and goodall 2022 artificial neural networks anns makwana and tiwari 2014 tamiru and dinka 2021 and specialized dlms kratzert et al 2018 le et al 2021b are widely used to investigate the nonlinear dynamics of hydrological time series xu and liang 2021 owing to their capacity to acquire sequential dependencies dlms have recently been presented as a better prototype of ml for handling time series data liu et al 2020 the most frequently used dlm for streamflow forecasting applications is the lstm form of a recurrent neural network rnn le et al 2019b yang et al 2020 although the superiority of dlms particularly lstm has been demonstrated in several previous studies on hydrologic prediction ho et al 2022 kao et al 2020 kratzert et al 2019 xiang et al 2020 the event scale has not yet witnessed the spread of these models this can be explained by the fact that dlms tend to obtain better stability and efficiency if a sufficiently large amount of input data is collected both in terms of the number of samples and the variables involved in other words these data must be sequential and continuously observed over a long period of time for event scales in which floods referring to peak floods typically occur over a few hours to several days collecting a large number of consecutive samples is not practical cross validation is a widely used strategy in ml to address such issues of limited data however applying cv is not often done for situations involving time series data or lstm based models since it has the potential to eliminate the sequential properties that are present in the input data in this study we focused on the performance of event scale streamflow forecasting several flexible adjustments to the input data structure were performed to address the shortcomings before applying the cv technique to the lstm model in addition to investigating the performance of the lstm model on the event scale we conducted a comparison with the gru model another well known architecture for dealing with time series data challenges we chose the ca river watershed one of the largest and most important river systems of vietnam as a case study because it has attracted considerable attention from the vietnamese government for the substantial annual budget spent on flood mitigation measures jica 2012 several people have perished in the catastrophic floods in the preceding decades ca river streamflow forecasting systems will enhance flood protection and disaster relief as well as the development and utilization of integrated water resources researchers have employed a variety of approaches to obtain useful information for flood management in the ca river basin dung et al 2021 phuong et al 2019 in comparison few studies in the ca river basin focus on multi time ahead flood prediction using ml techniques as a result the primary goals of this research are as follows 1 development of an efficient predictive deep learning framework for event scale water level forecasting in the ca river basin 2 comprehensive evaluation of the event scale multi time step ahead streamflow forecasting ability of two dlms lstm and gru 3 investigation of the importance and influence of input variables on the predictability and performance of the lstm gru models and 4 review of the impact of selecting hyperparameters and the optimal sequence length in the lstm gru for event scale forecasting issues eight flooding events were used for training and evaluating the models and their performance was quantified using four statistical indicators the findings of this research may help improve the understanding of the behavior and performance of the algorithms used for a range of event scale prediction tasks as well as to comprehend the impact of input variables on the predictive capacity of dlms the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the characteristics of the research region and includes hydro meteorological data in addition to the methodology proposed data scenarios and quantitative criteria section 3 provides a detailed presentation of the study s findings and analysis this section also presents an overview of the predictive performance of lstm gru models for the event scale problem as well as remarks on the significance of the selected input variables finally section 4 summarizes the research 2 materials and methods 2 1 study basin and data description the ca river basin situated in the north central coast region is one of vietnam s nine largest river basins this is an international river watershed with a total river length of approximately 531 km and covers a catchment size of 28 830 km2 of which approximately 18 800 km2 are inside vietnam territory and accounts for 65 2 of the entire basin area it originates in lao pdr and travels northwest southeast through most of nghe an province before joining sub branches from ha tinh province and pouring into the east sea via the cua hoi river mouth the ca river basin has various climatic and hydrological flow characteristics owing to its extensive expanse as a result the rainy season typically lasts from may to october in the upstream regions and from august to november in the downstream areas the average annual rainfall in the downstream region varies from 1700 to 1800 mm due to the weather variability the ca river flood season is divided into two distinct flooding phases pre season flooding and main season flooding events pre season floods are defined as those that occur around may and june owing to the vigorous activity of the northern hemisphere and southwest monsoons meanwhile main season floods because of heavy rainfall were identified between september and october flood statistics for the ca river basin indicate that extreme floods that cause severe inundation frequently occur in august in the upstream area and september in the central and downstream mainly because of prolonged heavy rains and tropical storms each flood lasts from 10 to 14 days wreaking havoc and substantially impairing the socio economic development of the whole region for floods that cause large scale inundation in urban areas in the lower ca river basin vinh city the observed flood peaks on the main branches often do not appear simultaneously this may be the reason for the modest efficiency of flood flow forecasting by the regulators the lower ca river is densely inhabited of which vinh city with a population of 545 180 in 2018 serves as the socio economic center of the north central region this study was conducted on the lower ca river a relatively sensitive and frequently flooded area in the provinces of ha tinh and nghe an the research area is depicted in fig 1 and table 1 provides details about several floods causing large scale inundation in the lower ca river to construct an effective real time flood warning platform for the lower ca river which has a high urban population the cho trang hydrological station located on the lam river was selected as the target station for this study located approximately 29 km from the east sea from the cua hoi river mouth cho trang station can be affected by the tidal water level in several cases this hydrological station is prevalently utilized in flood warning systems for vinh city because its strategic geographical location makes it ideal for establishing a flood warning system for the city nguyen 2021 in addition the data mined were the hourly observed water levels and precipitation at nine hydro meteorological stations during extreme flood events recorded between 2007 and 2019 these data were retrieved from the national center for hydro meteorological forecasting in the north central region of vietnam fig 1 and table 2 indicate the geographical locations of these hydro meteorological stations accordingly observed data from eight extreme flood events that caused large scale inundation in the urban area were identified between 2007 and 2019 of which each flood event lasted for 10 days brief information on the flood events is described in table 3 2 2 methods 2 2 1 lstm neural network according to the categorization of deep learning algorithms lstm is a specific type of rnn that belongs to the supervised learning category although this architecture was first introduced in the late 1990s by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 it has been widely used in the recent decade owing to rapid developments in computer science as a result lstm has demonstrated its superiority in handling time series data tasks salehinejad et al 2018 and in the hydrology domain le et al 2019a the scheme of the memory block in lstm is illustrated in fig 2 at any given time t step each lstm memory block is connected through two main components the hidden state and the cell state the hidden state or short term memory holds the output information in the memory cell h t as input to the next memory cell h t 1 the cell state c t known as long term memory is where critical information is stored for a prolonged period the outcome values of the cell state and hidden state in each lstm memory block are determined using the following equations 1 f t σ u f x t w f h t 1 2 i t σ u i x t w i h t 1 3 o t σ u o x t w o h t 1 4 n t t a n h u n x t w n h t 1 5 c t f t c t 1 i t n t 6 h t o t tanh c t where at the given time step t x t y t are the input data and output values n t represents the candidate of the cell state f t i t o t represent outcomes of the forget gate input gate and output gate respectively u w are weight matrices σ represents a sigmoid function tanh is the hyperbolic tangent function and represents the element wise multiplication 2 2 2 gru neural network in addition to the lstm network architecture the gru architecture first introduced by cho et al 2014 also identified as an evolutionary form of standard rnns conceptually both the lstm and gru architectures are designed to overcome the weaknesses of rnns in addressing the vanishing gradient problem when working with long term dependencies by adding gate mechanisms chung et al 2014 a diagram of the memory block in the gru architecture is shown in fig 3 instead of using three gate layers as in the lstm the operating mechanism of the gru architecture is a combination of only two gate layers or two vectors the update gate and the reset gate kostadinov 2017 the update gate has the same operating mechanism as the forget gate and input gate in lstm where it is decided whether the information of cell state h t 1 should be updated the reset gate with a similar role as the forget gate a modified version of lstm determines the amount of past information to leave behind or forget the following formulas determine each gru memory cell s output values h t cell state 7 z t σ u z x t w z h t 1 8 r t σ u r x t w r h t 1 9 h t t a n h u h x t r t w h h t 1 10 h t 1 z t h t z t h t 1 where at a given time step t z t r t represent the outcomes of the update and reset gates h t means the candidate of the gru cell compared to the lstm the gru model made a few changes in the structure to simplify the number of internal parameters and be easier to train accordingly the output information of each gru block is a single quantity instead of consisting of two separate components hidden and cell states as in the lstm block the outcome value of each gru cell is transmitted directly to the next cell without the need for any control the output gate controls the outcome values of each lstm cell and this information is then transferred to the next cell with such a design the gru model can reduce computational resources while still providing performance competitive with lstm for sequential data problems cahuantzi et al 2021 2 2 3 cross validation cv technique cv is a popular training approach in ml for assessing the model performance it is beneficial for ml issues where the number of collected data samples is limited brownlee 2018 at the theoretical level this technique randomly splits the available dataset into k sub datasets of equal size the k 1 datasets are exploited for the training while the last dataset is utilized as unseen data for validation pedregosa et al 2011 the ml models will finish the training after undergoing a total of k times of validation as above where each validation is conducted on a different dataset the model performance can then be estimated as the average of k times of cv on the entire dataset this is also the reason that this technique is known as a k fold cv despite their popularity in ml they do not yet seem universally applied to problems involving time series data and the hydrological field according to le et al 2021b the complexity of the sequential properties might be one of the primary reasons why the cv technique is not of considerable interest in time series issues especially in flood forecasting to forecast streamflow during extreme flood events the cv technique was used in this study to overcome the drawback of the number of collected samples the data collected from the eight major flood events between 2007 and 2019 were divided into two independent and non overlapping sections the first section is the water level data record of seven flood events that caused large scale inundation of the lower ca river for seven years including 2007 2008 2010 2011 2016 2018 and 2019 the remaining dataset was the water level data from the 2013 event which was exploited to evaluate the model performance on an independent dataset objectively this year the lower ca river suffered significant losses in terms of both human and socio economic factors a schematic of the training and validation processes using the cv technique is depicted in fig 4 2 3 primary components of model 2 3 1 scenarios in addition to comprehensively analyzing the performance of the two dlms lstm and gru in water level forecasting problems during typical flood events this study aims to investigate the aspects that might impact the performance of data driven predictive models critical elements of interest include the characterization of the data data preprocessing and rational selection of the internal hyperparameters of the dlm first two data scenarios were recommended to assess the influence of data types on the event scale forecasting performance of the two dlms these scenarios were designed based on the availability of the datasets and their impact on the ca river system the first scenario s1 comprised only water level information at seven stations including the target station assuming that the multi hour ahead water levels at the objective gauge station could be forecasted based solely on information about water level changes recorded in the past at the measurement stations in the remaining scenario s2 information on precipitation was considered coupled with data on the water level there are nine data input variables for this scenario corresponding to the observed data series at hydro meteorological stations including two ground based rainfall gauge stations and seven water level gauge stations as in the first scenario in the next stage the available raw data from seven flood events mentioned in section 2 1 and section 2 2 3 underwent a preprocessing step to adjust the input data s size and format instead of simply utilizing observed data at any time t in the matrix form of 1 k with k as the number of observed variables we mined the data availability in previous observation steps to format them as the matrix of j k here j refers to the number of previous adjacent observations of interest in dlms j is the sequence length of input at any given time step based on the study of le et al 2021b the sequence length is a parameter that directly influences the operability and training time of the dlms for this study where event scale flow forecasting is preferred two values of j are recommended 4 and 8 in terms of powers of 2 the operational design of the input data of the two recommended scenarios in vector form is illustrated in eqs 11 and 12 respectively 11 x t w t j 1 1 w t j 1 2 w t j 1 3 w t j 1 4 w t j 1 5 w t j 1 6 w t j 1 7 w t 1 1 w t 1 2 w t 1 3 w t 1 4 w t 1 5 w t 1 6 w t 1 7 w t 0 1

length of the formatted input or the number of previous observations of gauge stations in this study the values of j were 4 and 8 2 3 2 model hyperparameters the hyperparameters of the two models lstm and gru are set comparably to fairly and thoroughly evaluate the efficacy of the two dlms in prediction cases at an event scale matching the two recommended scenarios the recommended number of processing units in each lstm gru block is a power of 2 and varies from 16 to 128 in addition we utilized only one hidden layer for all models in this study this can be explained by research done by le et al 2021b as the use of multiple hidden layers in lstm gru models does not enhance their performance in the streamflow prediction task as mentioned above this study applied the cv technique flexibly to achieve model stability and overcome the issue of limited data these inputs underwent a random shuffle and were divided into seven subsets corresponding to seven folds for training however before the randomization process was implemented all the collected data from the seven flood events observed data at any time step were reformatted into two dimensional arrays of size j k as discussed in section 2 3 1 scenarios the reformatting of observations at any time step t from a matrix of size 1 k to a matrix of size j k is intended to preserve the sequential characteristics of time series data in events regarding the training process the adam algorithm with a learning rate of 0 001 was the optimization algorithm coupled with the mean square error mse loss function in this study kingma and ba 2014 in addition the number of computation iterations or the number of epochs per fold was set to 500 finally several machine learning techniques such as early stopping and model checkpoints have been established to ensure the most effective learning process and the necessary information during this process is saved this work was developed in the python programming language rossum 1995 and made use of several open source ml libraries including keras chollet et al 2015 and tensorflow abadi et al 2015 besides dlms are deployed on pcs with hardware configurations including processors of amd ryzen 7 3700x ram of 32 gb and graphics cards of nvidia geforce gtx 1660 supper 2 4 performance metrics in this study four criteria were used to quantify the predictive ability of dlms these are extensively employed statistical indicators to determine the correlation and inaccuracy of hydrological models these include mean absolute error mae nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and kling gupta

respectively 3 results and discussion the results presented in this section represent the model test steps the flood event of 2013 which had not been used before was exploited to evaluate the multi time step predictive performance of the trained dlms the competitive performance of the lstm and gru models was quantified using four metrics mae nse kge and smape the influence of hydrological data characteristics on event scale predictability is also of interest detailed information about the results of the dlms for the specific cases of the two scenarios is described in appendices 1 and 2 3 1 effect of data types it is essential to conduct various tests in hydrological modeling research to improve the effectiveness and accuracy of dlms first we analyzed the performance of the two models in terms of their ability to handle various types of data statistical information regarding the performance of the models in the forecasting cases corresponding to the two scenarios is described briefly in table 4 and visually in fig 5 the numbers presented in this section are the average values of the statistical criteria for each model and forecasting case details can be found in appendices 1 and 2 according to the results in tables 4 and 5 the first scenario based models indicated better performance than the second scenario based models in all four prediction cases and for most of the statistical criteria mentioned in addition consistency in the trend of performance variation of the models is recorded through the average statistical indicators in table 4 and the prediction errors of these models seem to increase as the forecast times are increased fig 5 illustrates the superiority of s1 lstm and s1 gru over the other models in the forecast cases in accordance with the average statistics the s1 lstm with kge 0 988 and smape 1 0 exhibited the best performance whereas the s2 gru with kge 0 985 and smape 1 1 exhibited poorer performance among the models for 1 h ahead forecast in the event of a one hour ahead forecast the nse and kge values are close to the ideal threshold of 1 0 for both scenarios in other words the effect of the data type on model performance is not obvious this effect type of input data is more pronounced in the event of a four hour prediction where the s2 lstm and s2 gru models exhibit slightly lower performance compared with s1 based models the corresponding kge values for s2 lstm and s2 gru in this case were nearly 0 95 compared to approximately 0 97 for the s1 lstm and s1 gru models in general both the offered data scenarios have proven their advantages when providing dlms with an adequate amount of necessary information about the specific properties of the predictor variables yielding impressive forecasting results despite employing a blend of water level and precipitation information s2 exhibited no improvement in performance when compared to s1 just water level one reason may be that the data correlation coefficient of precipitation is significantly lower than that of the water level in the context of hydrological time series forecasting a high correlation of the input data could help dlms learn nonlinear relationships better alternatively dlms may have learned sufficient necessary information from the number of input variables water level data thus adding rainfall data does not make much sense in this case 3 2 effect of sequence length to further analyze how input data types affect model performance the effect of sequence length cannot be overlooked because it is one of the key reasons for the gap between observed and forecasted data to systematically evaluate the influence of sequence length on the prediction model this parameter was specified with varied values for lstm gru models to estimate the water level from one hour to four hours of lead time several quantitative statistics are briefly presented in table 5 see appendices 1 and 2 figs 6 7 visualize a performance comparison of the two models for the scenarios from the analytical data reported in table 5 it is clear that both lstm and gru presented a remarkable performance for all mentioned computation cases at cho trang station the performance of these models tends to decline as the required prediction time increases in the event of s1 the variation between the observed and forecasted water levels of the two models l4 lstm and l8 lstm for one hour in advance were 0 023 m and 0 027 m in terms of mae respectively meanwhile the performance of gru is slightly worse than that of lstm under the same conditions as the input data and sequence length the mae values are in turn 0 039 m and 0 029 m for l4 gru and l8 gru a more intuitive view of the effect of sequence length on water level forecasting results for multiple time steps in the future is presented in fig 6 in general the developed models demonstrate their advantages for forecasting cases the difference in the analyzed values is not considerable however the lstm model seems slightly more efficient than the gru for s1 the nse values of the four prediction cases ranged from well above 0 982 0 999 for l4 lstm and approximately 0 977 0 999 for l8 lstm the corresponding representative values for the gru model ranged from 0 982 to 0 998 and from just under 0 977 0 999 for l4 gru and l8 gru respectively in addition the effect of sequence length was recognized in the case of s2 which included precipitation data during the model training process fig 6b when the sequence length value is assigned as 4 the difference in performance between the lstm and gru is almost nonexistent the gap between the two models begins to emerge when the specified sequence length is doubled particularly in the case of long range forecasting with nse values of 0 9651 and 0 9692 for l8 lstm and l8 gru respectively a similar development is witnessed in fig 7 where statistical criteria such as kge and smape are considered the use of multiple data types adding precipitation data for s2 and complicating the model training process increasing the sequence length from 4 to 8 did not improve the performance of dlms in contrast the performance of these models is lower in some instances specifically the kge values of l8 lstm and l8 gru in the four hour ahead forecasting in terms of s2 are 0 9437 and 0 9408 respectively the corresponding figures for smape are 5 67 and 5 17 respectively from the above analysis we can conclude that sequence length has a certain influence on the hydrological forecasting capabilities of the lstm gru models particularly in the case of precipitation data utilized to forecast streamflow characteristics at a selected location if the water level is predicted to be one or two hours in advance the effect of the sequence length is negligible the choice of sequence length size depends closely on a particular issue in terms of computational resources a sequence length of four instead of eight is recommended in this study or similar studies with event scale because this saves considerable time in the training process 3 3 effect of hyperparameters in addition to assessing the influence of data characteristics and sequence length on model performance the effects of hyperparameters number of computational units per hidden layer on forecasting accuracy with various time steps in the near future are also examined quantitatively based on the analysis above it can be said that s1 exhibits better performance than s2 therefore we chose s1 to further investigate this hyperparameter s potential influence on the final forecasting results in this section as mentioned in section 2 3 2 the number of units per hidden layer selected for examination ranged from 16 to 128 in terms of powers of 2 table 6 summarizes the best quantitative outcomes the values in table 6 revealed a slight variation between the observed and forecasted water levels as mae values range between 0 019 and 0 089 m and the smape values are only about 0 67 4 06 for all four prediction cases a development trend is identified in the case of nse and kge where the correlation coefficients measuring the effectiveness of the predictive models reached exceptional values amounting to well above 0 98 and 0 97 respectively when forecasting four hours in advance in addition the statistical outcomes for each specific forecasting case in table 6 also show consistent agreement with the statistical values in tables 4 and 5 where the average values per prediction case were analyzed in most reported cases both dlms performed well at the recommended number of units of these 32 and 64 were the most prevalent values compared to 16 and 128 respectively see details in appendices 1 and 2 the preceding analysis and discussion revealed that the number of units per hidden layer is a hyperparameter that affects the performance of the lstm gru models and the processing time of mathematical operations the performance difference is insignificant when this parameter is assigned a variable value from 16 to 128 or even a larger value for multiple hour ahead streamflow forecasting minimizing the computation time and model complexity while maintaining high performance is preferred 3 4 quantification of peak forecast error at the event scale where changes in water levels can fluctuate hourly it is essential for management agencies to predict flood peak times and magnitudes accurately in the historic flood of 2013 the highest observed flood peak was recorded at the cho trang station at 2 00 a m on 18 october and the water level was up to 4 17 m a comparison of the hydrological charts for specific forecasting cases is illustrated in figs 8 and 9 table 7 provides the statistical findings of the water level forecast for this period corresponding to cases s1 l4 of interest figs 8 and 9 show the forecasted and observed data series during the 2013 flood event for s1 l4 in fig 8 refers to the outcome of the streamflow forecast for one hour ahead while the case of the four hour forward projection is shown in fig 9 table 7 further clarifies that the two lstm gru models performed equally well considering the flood peak the relative error values reported in all four forecasting cases were 1 1 with no noticeable difference in performance between lstm and gru this is a low error threshold compared to the current flood operation forecast for the ca river basin in addition to the magnitude the hydrographic plots illustrate that the predicted flood peak from the lstm gru models occurred simultaneously with the observed flood peak confirming the effectiveness of the proposed models and dlms in the event scale streamflow forecasting problem 3 5 comparison with previous studies owing to advances in computational science the application of ml in hydrological forecasting is becoming increasingly prevalent nguyen et al 2021 investigated the performance of four ml models in multistep ahead water level prediction for the jungrang basin of the han river korea two hybrid models based on a combination of the xgboost model and evolution algorithms genetic and differential were compared with the two tree based ml models rf and cart classification and registration tree according to this study the two xgboost based models exhibit higher performance than the two tree based models the nse coefficient xgboost based models ranged from 0 974 to 0 800 corresponding to one to four hour prediction situations in advance in another study nguyen et al 2022 the capacity of several ml algorithms to predict streamflow at the event scale was examined these algorithms include multiple linear regression bayesian additive regression tree bart svm and ga the key predictor variables used in these models were water level and precipitation data based on the information reported in this study the ga bart model was identified to be the best with the nse values matching four forecasted cases one to four hours ahead in the range 0 96 0 67 in addition han and morrison 2022 introduced a dlm lstm s2s in which lstm was coupled with a sequence to sequence structure to enhance streamflow prediction in the russian river watershed in california usa with this configuration the lstm s2s model outperformed the national water model in producing hourly forecasts with lead times varying from 1 to 18 h the performance of this model runs between 0 96 0 81 for short term projections from 1 4 h in terms of the nse criterion several other studies have attempted to improve hourly streamflow forecasting performance by proposing hybrid ml models such as the wavelet transform ann wann for the achankovil river in india alexander et al 2018 the polynomial network model gs gmdh for the bow river in canada elkurdy et al 2021 and gru model for the geum river in korea le et al 2021a the performance statistics of several ml models for short term streamflow forecasting are presented in table 8 most of the research cited above has proven the exceptional ability of ml models to offer accurate short term predictions in general the predictive performance of data driven models can be influenced by various elements including the ml algorithm employed predictor variables used properties of the data series gathered and geographical location of the research region for flood events wherein flood peaks may occur in a short time from a few hours to a few days enhancing the performance of streamflow forecasting has always been a challenge for academics according to the figures in this paper the proposed approach considerably improves the predictive performance of the dlms compared to previous studies the nse coefficients of the lstm gru models were in the range 0 999 0 979 equating to a level of error smape in the range 1 0 4 1 4 conclusions this study comprehensively analyzed the effectiveness of two dlms lstm and gru in a multistep ahead streamflow prediction task on the event scale level where hourly forecasting is of interest the following are some of the primary findings 1 the performance gap in the two designs is virtually insignificant in all prediction cases and even in both the offered data scenarios 2 the influence of hydrological data properties on model performance was thoroughly investigated scenario s1 which focuses solely on water level data has a minor advantage over scenario s2 which incorporates water level and precipitation data this could be because of a discrepancy in the correlation between the predictor variables and the targeted station which refers to rainfall and water level data precipitation is a random variable despite being measured over time as time series data 3 the lstm gru models with one hidden layer were adequate for providing excellent performance in hydrological prediction tasks the number of computational units per hidden layer should be between 16 and 64 in terms of powers of two increasing this value does not enhance model performance but it improves the complexity of the mathematical operations and consumes substantially longer to train these findings are consistent with prior research on daily streamflow forecasting performed by le et al 2021b 4 in flood events where the processing time is critical for forecasting we prioritize minimizing the amount of computation while attaining optimal performance therefore the recommended sequence length is four for a multistep event scale flood forecasting problem in advance 5 to preserve the sequential characteristics of the water level data the input data were flexibly reformatted before the cv technique was used to randomly separate the entire input set into seven subsets as described in section 2 3 2 in addition dlms may be developed to provide estimates with further periods such as 6 or 9 h ahead in the scope of this study we only present short term forecast results at the flood event scale corresponding to forecast cases from one hour to four hours ahead even though dlms have proven their effectiveness in hydrological forecasting tasks a few limitations are still present in this study lstm gru models are generally developed to provide highly accurate predictions for one or a few particular sites thus they do not yet interpret the physical processes of flow as in rainfall runoff models in addition several other data types that play crucial roles in hydrological models such as climate soil and topographic data have not been considered therefore hybrid models that can account for the rainfall runoff process to a certain extent may be a trend for future research the ca river basin significantly impacts the socio economic development of vietnam s north central area therefore providing highly reliable hydrological forecasting information during flood events is a crucial and challenging task for local management agencies because floods in tributaries frequently occur at different times the findings of this study could be a valuable reference source for the north central regional hydro meteorological center for enhancing flood forecasting and management capacity of the ca river as well as other river basins in vietnam and globally credit

7714,study region northern part of china npc study focus along with rapid economic development and population growth the npc has been identified as a water scarcity hotspot previous studies attributed the intensified water scarcity primarily to increasing human water withdrawal over the npc in the 20th century however water withdrawal has stagnated since the beginning of 21st century which raises a question of whether the trend of water scarcity changes particularly when considering the contribution of water availability that is subject to climate variability based on the water stress index wsi we detected the trends of water scarcity by a piecewise linear regression approach and investigated their associated drivers in the npc by using survey based datasets and hydro climate model simulations new hydrological insights for the region results show that the trends of wsi changed from positive to negative after 2001 increased water withdrawal was the dominant factor for the aggravated water scarcity before 2001 however as the rising precipitation offsets the effect of increasing evapotranspiration climate change has increased water availability and become the major contributor to the alleviated water scarcity during 2001 2020 furthermore future projections suggest that climate change would further alleviate future water scarcity over the npc by increasing water availability the results suggest the growing role of climate change in affecting water scarcity which are significant for guiding regional water policy making graphical abstract ga1 keywords water

hydrological projections simulation was obtained from the inter sectoral impact model inter comparison project phase 2b via the website https data isimip org 1 introduction water scarcity is a lack of water resources and inability to meet water demand for human livelihood economic development or environmental sustainability oki and kanae 2006 rockström et al 2009 water scarcity has become a serious global issue which may lead to severe consequences on both natural environment and human society such as crop production reduction drinking water shortage and water quality degradation mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 porkka et al 2016 which may impede regional sustainable development well understanding of the changes in water scarcity and driving factors could provide a basis for developing effective adaptation strategies to cope with future water scarcity along with china s rapid economic development and population growth water scarcity in the northern part of china npc is a widely recognized crisis ma et al 2020 huang et al 2021a current water scarcity assessments are mostly based on simulations of water availability and withdrawal from large scale hydrological models which consider the impacts of both climate change and human activities hanasaki et al 2013 hejazi et al 2014 water stress index wsi defined as the ratio of water withdrawal to water availability is widely used to assess water scarcity conditions liu et al 2017 previous model based studies have agreed that water scarcity has widespreadly intensified in the 20th century over the npc wada et al 2011 liu et al 2019 however human water withdrawal estimates from large scale hydrological models were often based on macroscale socioeconomic dataset and might underestimate the effects from technological factors and water conservancy measures leading to biased water scarcity trends huang et al 2018 based on statistical records deceleration of human water withdrawal was detected in china during 1965 2013 due to improvements in irrigation efficiency and water saving technologies zhou et al 2020 thus there is considerable uncertainty as to whether water scarcity in the npc has increased continuously to present day the question whether there is a turning point in trend of water scarcity still needs investigation water scarcity was often interpreted from the perspectives of availability and withdrawal sides in terms of drivers kummu et al 2010 the limited water availability due to low precipitation and its uneven spatial and temporal distributions have been identified as natural driving factors of water scarcity in the npc schewe et al 2014 the inefficient and large irrigation water use and rapidly growing domestic and industrial water use have intensified the conflicts between natural water availability and human water demand cai 2008 sun et al 2017 huang et al 2019 previous studies mostly attributed the water scarcity intensification in the npc primarily to human water withdrawal due to its rapid increasing trend arising from population growth socioeconomic development agricultural expansion and urbanization liu et al 2019 li et al 2020 however the chinese government has taken policy interventions to provide a more stringent constraint to approach a peak of water withdrawal since 2012 human water withdrawal has stagnated or even decreased in a number of river basins over the npc since the beginning of 21st century wang et al 2017 these indicate that the impacts of water withdrawal on water scarcity trend could be less significant which raises a question whether the dominant drivers have changed as another important driver besides water withdrawal climate change induced water availability has great effects on water scarcity gosling and arnell 2016 ashraf et al 2019 munia et al 2020 climate change led to warming temperature and compounding changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration et thus affected both surface water and groundwater availability further leading to changes in water scarcity zhai et al 2005 zhai and tao 2017 konapala et al 2020 recent studies have proven that precipitation in some basins of the northern china shows an increasing trend in the 21st century li et al 2016 guan et al 2021 it is possible that the impacts of climate change induced water availability on water scarcity trend over the npc become more important than water withdrawal especially in the 21st century thus there is an urgent need to assess the relative contribution of water availability to water scarcity change against water withdrawal and detect the dominant factor of water scarcity across different time periods which not only helps to better understanding the mechanism behind water scarcity evolution but also is of great significance for guiding regional water related policy making to this end this study provided a spatially explicit assessment of water scarcity over the npc the historical assessment was performed at administrative divisions scale by using statistics based water withdrawal and water availability datasets during 1965 2020 which provided more realistic water scarcity estimation than that only based on model simulations we first presented the spatial analysis of water scarcity trends in the npc and applied a piecewise linear regression model to detect the changes in trends then the relative contributions of water withdrawal and water availability to water scarcity trends were examined across different time periods particularly how the impacts of water availability on water scarcity evolved over time from the past to future climate change scenarios was evaluated this study could augment our understanding of water scarcity and help to address the sustainable development goals sdg target 6 4 un 2021 which would be useful for regional water scarcity adaptation 2 study area the npc 73 135 e 31 54 n is located in the northern china which includes fifteen provinces with 159 administrative prefectures fig 1a total area of the npc is 5640 000 km2 accounting for about 58 of total areas of china the npc lies in a temperate continental and monsoon climate zone and its most part belongs to arid or semi arid regions precipitation has large spatial variation within the whole study area with average annual precipitation ranging from 80 mm in the northwest to 1100 mm in the southeast of the npc precipitation showed decreasing trend before the year 2001 in monsoon areas but showed an increasing trend in the western part of the npc while precipitation has increased in the 21st century fig s1 the mean annual temperature during 1965 2020 ranges spatially from 4 15 over the npc and it increases from north to south as a result of the decrease in latitude the mean annual temperature in qinghai also below zero due to high altitudes fig 1c temperature also increased significantly during 1965 2020 with the high latitude areas experiencing the most significant increase fig s1 annual average evapotranspiration ranging from 50 to 800 mm and runoff ranging from 5 to 450 mm showed similar spatial distribution with that of precipitation fig 1d e with water flux decreasing from the southeast to the northwest of the npc the npc is currently facing serious problems of water scarcity due to its arid and semi arid climate conditions and growth in socioeconomic activities jiang 2009 rapid expansion of irrigation agriculture brings large amounts of irrigation water demand while population growth and socioeconomic development lead to increase in domestic and industrial water withdrawal especially during the late 20th century zhou et al 2020 conflicts for water use among sectors have become more serious zhou et al 2019 and environmental water requirement has been deprived leading to severe ecological degradation problems such in the north china plain huang et al 2015 and the heihe river basin li et al 2022 in addition the imbalance between lacking fresh water resources and large human water demand over the npc would become more complex under climate change impacts and ongoing water management measures 3 data and methods 3 1 water scarcity assessment wsi defined as the ratio of water withdrawal to water availability is a proper way to assess regional water scarcity wsi can measure the amount of water used and relates it to the available renewable water resources representing the imbalance between human water withdrawal and natural water availability in a target region over a specific time period and has been applied in a number of studies liu et al 2017 veldkamp et al 2017 greve et al 2018 the larger wsi value the severer water scarcity condition is in this study the annual wsi was calculated at administrative prefectural scale 1 w s i w w w a where ww was the sum of water withdrawal for agricultural industrial and domestic sectors wa was the sum of groundwater and surface water availability after removing the environmental flow requirement efr that was used to maintain the river ecosystem in a desired environmental condition based on the report from the ministry of water resources of china mwrc and literatures efr accounted for about 20 of total natural water availability over the huang huai hai region cai 2008 liu et al 2016 pastor et al 2014 estimated that the proportion of efr to annual flow did not show strong spatially differences over the npc thus we assumed that 20 of natural water availability should be used to maintain ecological integrity which was consistent with previous studies e g sun et al 2022 finally based on annual water availability and water withdrawal estimates at prefectural scale water scarcity in the npc was assessed 3 2 historical water withdrawal and water availability dataset annual water withdrawal during 1965 2013 at prefectural scale in the npc was obtained from a newly developed national long term water withdrawal dataset of china zhou et al 2020 this dataset collected and harmonized the sectoral water withdrawal records and surveys led by mwrc and finally estimated the water withdrawals for agricultural irrigation industrial and domestic sectors at prefectural scale the water withdrawal data during 2014 2020 was estimated by disaggregating the nbsc national bureau of statistics of china water withdrawal data http www stats gov cn english statisticaldata annualdata from provincial scale to prefectural scale based on the prefecture level water withdrawal estimates from zhou et al 2020 thus annual sectoral water withdrawals for 1965 2020 at prefectural scale for the npc were generated for water scarcity assessments the trend of water withdrawal is mainly affected by socioeconomic drivers such as socioeconomic development stage population growth rate and water saving techniques zhou et al 2020 sun et al 2019 which would reflect the impacts of socioeconomic activities on water scarcity annual total runoff has been widely treated as an indicator of renewable water resources in water scarcity assessment yin et al 2017 liu et al 2019 which finally becomes water resources in the rivers lakes and groundwater aquifers and is available for humans in this study natural total runoff consisting of the surface and subsurface runoff which is mainly affected by climate condition was considered as water availability in this study the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model simulations provided gridded estimates of annual water availability both subsurface and surface runoff for the period 1965 2012 at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 which have been well validated with gauge measurements across china zhang et al 2014 however the uncertainties of water availability simulation by hydrological models were usually large hattermann et al 2017 thus we used the annual provincial level natural water availability records for the period 2003 2012 from nbsc to bias correct the vic simulations at grid scale a multiplicative adjustment method was applied to remove bias from the vic model simulations ho et al 2012 2 wa corr t wa vic t wa obs wa vic where wa corr t was the bias corrected surface water groundwater availability at grid scale wa vic t was the surface water groundwater availability simulated by vic at grid scale and wa obs and wa vic were the annual average of nbsc reported and vic simulated water availability during 2003 2012 at provincial scale respectively we further compiled the reported provincial level water availability for the period 2013 2020 from nbsc and downscaled them to prefectural scale based on the grid scale vic simulations during 1965 2012 finally the water availability dataset that merged survey data and model simulations was generated at prefectural scale over the npc during 1965 2020 3 3 historical climate datasets annual precipitation and temperature over the npc were obtained from a 0 25 0 25 meteorological dataset cn05 during 1961 2020 which was constructed on the basis of over 2400 meteorological stations in china the cn05 data has been extensively applied to climate model evaluation and long term climatic analysis wu and gao 2013 global et dataset during 2001 2020 was obtained from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam v3 6a which combined a wide range of multi satellite observations and reanalysis data to estimate actual evaporation through a process based methodology miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 gleam based et showed good agreements with observations from chinese flux observation and research network yang et al 2017 and was more consistent with the gauge observations than the global land data assimilation system gldas version 2 0 dataset over china bai and liu 2018 the precipitation temperature and et datasets were aggregated from grid scale to prefecture and province scales to assess the climate change impacts on water availability in the recent two decades 3 4 project climate change impacts on water availability and water scarcity under different emission scenarios future projections of water availability i e surface and subsurface runoff in hydrological simulation over the npc were obtained from the inter sectoral impact model inter comparison project phase 2b isimip2b frieler et al 2017 isimip 2b was design to quantify the climate change effects based on a strong mitigation pathway and a business as usual pathway to provide tailored impact projections for the ipcc special report on global warming of 1 5 c and the representative concentration pathway rcp rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 were chosen ipcc 2018 rcp2 6 is the lowest emission scenario within coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 and aims to limit the increase of global mean temperature to 2 c above pre industrial levels which needs substantial changes in energy use and emission reduction and would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change van vuuren et al 2011 rcp6 0 is a climate policy intervention scenario i e without explicit policies designed to reduce emissions in which total radiative forcing level reaches a value of 6 w m2 at stabilization after 2100 masui et al 2011 future projection under a no mitigation baseline scenario rcp6 0 and the strong mitigation scenario rcp2 6 would provide the best scientific basis for political discussions about mitigation and adaptation measures following the isimip2b protocol future water availability simulations were performed by four global hydrological models ghms namely h08 hanasaki et al 2008a 2008b lpjml rost et al 2008 pcr globwb van beek et al 2011 and watergap2 müller schmied et al 2014 at half degree spatial resolution for the period 2006 2099 forced by climate projection from four general circulation models gcms namely gfdl esm 2 m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc5 under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 as this study mainly addresses the impacts from water availability under climate change the projections with fixed socioeconomic conditions of the year 2005 from isimip2b were selected furthermore simulation of surface water and groundwater availability by ghms were bias corrected by using the annual provincial level natural water availability records for the period 2006 2020 from nbsc similar to correction during the historical period shown in eq 2 then the bias corrected gridded water availability projections during 2006 2099 were aggregated to prefectural scale to ensure that inter annual variability of water availability does not dominate the signal of water scarcity the 31 year moving averages were computed for water scarcity assessment and the center year of the 31 year moving average was used to denote the 31 year period in order to assess the impacts of future climate projections under rcps on water availability and water scarcity this study assumed that prefectural water withdrawal for the future period 2021 2099 kept constant as the annual average values of 2011 2020 3 5 piecewise linear regression approach for trend analysis because one of the primary objectives in this study was to detect the changes in water scarcity trends among different periods a piecewise linear regression plr approach was applied to assess the turning points of annual wsi series over the npc following wang et al 2011 zhou et al 2020 reported that two turning points were detected for water withdrawal trends in china thus we adopted plr with two turning points to assess wsi series for the npc during 1965 2020 as follows 3 wsi β 0 β 1 t ε t t 1 β 0 β 1 t β 2 t t 1 ε t 1 t t 2 β 0 β 1 t β 2 t t 1 β 3 t t 2 ε t 2 t where t was year wsi was annual series during 1965 2020 for the npc t 1 and t 2 were the turning points of wsi trend and β 0 β 1 β 2 and β 3 were regression coefficients and ε was the residual of the regression the slope of wsi was β 1 before the year t 1 β 1 β 2 during the period from t 1 to t 2 and β 1 β 2 β 3 after the year t 2 a p value less than 0 1 was considered significant for the regression of wsi 3 6 quantify the contributions of water withdrawal and water availability to water scarcity change a decomposition method was developed to quantify the relative contributions of water withdrawal and water availability to the changes in water scarcity here wsi was measured as the ratio of water withdrawal ww to water availability wa denoting eq 1 as g w w w a w w w a we can express the total differential equation as 4 d w s i d t g w w d w w d t g w a d w a d t as and g w a w w w a 2 these substitution into eq 4 leads to 5 d w s i d t 1 w a d w w d t w w w a 2 d w a d t we divide this equation using w s i w w w a and obtain the following equation 6 d w s i d t w s i d w w d t w w d w a d t w a usually the proportional change rate r x of a quantity x t can be defined as 7 r x d x x d t therefore the proportional change rate of wsi r wsi can be expressed as the relative contributions from water withdrawal r ww and water availability r wa 8 r w s i r w w r w a the proportional change rate of variables i e wsi ww and wa for a certain period was calculated using a linear regression normalized by the corresponding long term average values leng et al 2019 thus based on the annual time series of wsi water withdrawal ww and water availability wa we applied the above decomposition method to quantify the contributions of water withdrawal and water availability to the change rate of water scarcity for each prefecture and the npc as a whole when compared the relative contribution from water withdrawal and water availability the dominant factor that affected water scarcity change was detected 4 results 4 1 the spatiotemporal distribution of historical water scarcity in the npc water scarcity over the npc has become a serious issue during 1965 2020 in terms of the spatial distribution fig 2a it was found that severe water scarcity wsi 0 8 was mainly found in areas with large population or intense irrigated cropland e g beijing tianjin hebei ningxia gansu shanxi and xinjiang the largest wsi was found in ningxia with the magnitude of wsi larger than 20 comparing the magnitudes of wsi between the 2010 s and the 1960 s fig 2b it was evident that water scarcity increased significantly in most the areas over the npc large intensification of water scarcity with the relative change larger than 100 mainly occurred in the north china plain and the northeast china e g the henan shanxi hebei heilongjiang and jilin in addition wsi decreased in beijing xinjiang and a part of gansu and qinghai which indicated slight alleviations of water scarcity condition during 1965 2020 4 2 trend and attribution analysis of water scarcity in the npc during 1965 2020 water scarcity in the npc intensified significantly during 1965 2020 with wsi increasing from 0 29 in 1965 0 48 in the 2010 s fig 3a when applying the piecewise linear regression approach to annual wsi series of the npc two turning points i e 1976 and 2001 p 0 01 were detected and three sub periods were divided namely p1 1965 1976 p2 1976 2001 and p3 2001 2020 the increasing trend of wsi was significant before 1976 with the magnitude of 0 0141 year 1 and it decreased to 0 0047 year 1 during 1976 2001 then the trend of wsi turn into negative i e 0 0050 year 1 after 2001 indicating that water scarcity in the npc was alleviated during 2001 2020 to assess the major contributor of changes in water scarcity trends over the whole npc the relative contributions of water withdrawal and water availability to water scarcity change over three sub periods were further quantified fig 3 wsi increased significantly during p1 with the relative change rate of 44 95 where water withdrawal and water availability contributed to 50 78 and 4 80 of changes in wsi respectively fig 3d and table s1 this indicated that growing water withdrawal was the mainly reason for the rapidly aggravated water scarcity before 1976 increased water withdrawal during 1976 2001 also led to moderate increase of wsi and the contribution from water availability was not significant furthermore the deceleration of water scarcity of the npc during p2 were mainly attributed to slowing down of increasing trend in water withdrawal which decreased from 6 23 km3 year 2 in p1 to 1 67 km3 year 2 in p2 fig 3c however water availability showed a significant increasing trend with a rate of 2 86 km3 year 2 during 2001 2020 fig 3b which contributed to a 12 84 of decrease in wsi together with the effects from decreased water withdrawal by about 5 24 water scarcity was alleviated in the npc after 2001 increasing water availability dominated changes in water scarcity than decreasing water withdrawal during 2001 2020 in general when taken the npc as a whole expansion in water withdrawal led to significant intensification of water scarcity before 2001 while water scarcity was mainly alleviated by increased water availability after 2001 fig 4 showed the trends and proportional change rate of wsi at prefectural scale during three sub periods about 84 of prefectures experienced increasing wsi before 1976 as shown in fig 4a significant increase in wsi with the slope 0 03 year 1 occurred in some areas of the northwest china e g ningxia and gansu and the north china plain e g hebei beijing henan and shandong while wsi showed negative trends in the inner mongolia and qinghai provinces during p1 despite that wsi showed an increasing trend in 76 of prefectures during 1976 2001 trends of wsi slowed down during p2 in 57 of total prefectures when compared with that in p1 the slowdown of increasing trend of wsi in p2 was mainly found in shanxi and the north china plain negative trends of wsi during p2 occurred in beijing tianjin xinjiang northern part of henan and shandong fig 4b in terms of the third sub period i e 2001 2020 water scarcity was alleviated in 70 of total prefectures and significant alleviation was found in the northeastern china the north china plain and the northwestern china the relative contributions of water withdrawal and water availability to water scarcity change for the three sub periods over 1965 2020 were separated fig 5 and the dominant driving factor of water scarcity change was further identified fig 6 it is found that increasing water withdrawal has dominated the heightened water scarcity for 75 and 53 of prefectures during p1 and p2 respectively significant growth in water withdrawal contributed up to 60 increase of wsi in the north china plain liaoning and shaanxi during p1 and in the heilongjiang jilin inner mongolia and ningxia during p2 figs s2 and 5 for example large increasing trend of water withdrawal resulted in intensifying water scarcity in spite of increasing water availability in shandong before the year 2001 decreased water withdrawal led to water scarcity alleviation for 24 of prefectures during p3 such as hebei shandong and ningxia in terms of the effects from water availability changes in water scarcity were dominated by water availability in 25 of prefectures during p1 fig 6 increasing water availability from climate change led to decreased wsi in the inner mongolia and qinghai during 1965 1976 figs s3 and 5 water availability played more critical role in water scarcity change over water withdrawal in 40 of prefectures during p2 and among them 23 and 17 of prefectures experienced intensified and alleviated water scarcity condition respectively however changes in wsi over 70 of prefectures were more likely to be affected by water availability during 2001 2020 significant decrease in water availability intensified water scarcity condition over henan and shandong during p3 water scarcity was alleviated by increasing water availability in 48 of prefectures e g the heilongjiang jilin and gansu in summary water withdrawal was the dominant factor for aggravated water scarcity in the npc before 2001 in most of prefectures over the npc while increasing water availability has greatly alleviated water scarcity during 2001 2020 4 3 climate change impacts on water availability during 2001 2020 the results above highlighted the increasing role of water availability on water scarcity change during 1965 2020 and increasing water availability was the dominant contributor to water scarcity alleviation in recent two decades this study used the natural runoff as water availability which was mainly affected by the compound effects from precipitation and et under climate change we further assessed the trends of precipitation and et during the recent two decades fig 7 it shows that precipitation over the npc had an increasing rate of 3 32 mm year during 2001 2020 precipitation showed an increasing trend in 80 of prefectures over the npc and the magnitudes of increasing trend were more than 5 mm year in heilongjiang jilin liaoning shanxi and shaanxi provinces where water availability increased significantly during p3 on the other hand air temperature showed significant increasing trends and the warming air temperature has led to rising et in about 93 of prefectures figs 7 and s1 the most significant increasing trend of et was found in hebei and shanxi provinces however the rising precipitation offset the effect of increasing et to some extent resulted in increasing water availability especially in beijing heilongjiang jilin and shanxi alleviating water scarcity over these areas 4 4 effects of water availability change on future water scarcity this study further assessed the effects of future water availability change on water scarcity over the npc based on water availability projections under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 from multiple ghms the spatial distribution of water scarcity in 2080 under these two climate scenarios would be similar to that in 2010 with severe water scarcity occurring in the hebei henan ningxia and gansu when taken the npc as whole wsi would decrease by 6 24 from 0 47 in 2021 0 43 in 2080 under rcp2 6 but would not show significant changes under rcp6 0 fig 8 this was mainly attributed to that future climate would increase water availability by 6 66 and 2 36 under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 respectively fig s4 spatially significant alleviation of future water scarcity 15 by increasing water availability would be found in hebei shanxi shaanxi ningxia henan and shandong provinces under rcp2 6 however future climate projection under rcp6 0 would lead to decrease of water availability in henan province and further aggravate its water scarcity by about 15 during 2021 2080 water scarcity would be alleviated by increasing water availability in hebei shanxi and inner mongolia under rcp6 0 the results suggested that climate change mitigation actions would promote regional water scarcity alleviation over the npc 5 discussion this study carried out an assessment of water scarcity for the npc at administrative prefectural scale by merging model simulated and survey based water withdrawal and water availability datasets during 1965 2020 unlike previous studies focused on the quantification of long term trends or changes in water scarcity this study visualized the turning points in water scarcity trends and further assessed the relative contributions from water withdrawal and water availability below we further discussed the mechanism behind the trends and attribution of water scarcity in the npc the implication of results for policy makers as well as future potential improvement 5 1 decadal changes in the trends of water scarcity over the npc this study found that water scarcity over the npc intensified considerably during 1965 2020 which agreed with the previous results at global scale wada et al 2011 huang et al 2021b country scale liu et al 2019 and local scale wang et al 2009 zhuo et al 2016 however the alleviation of water scarcity in the npc during recent decades is different from the results by large scale hydrological model simulations which suggested that water scarcity would continue to increase with climate change and socioeconomic development from the past to the future greve et al 2018 liu et al 2019 huang et al 2021b this caught the importance of application of survey based water withdrawal and water availability dataset in the water scarcity assessment sun et al 2017 and also suggested the future directions that large scale hydrological models should integrate the effects of technological change in water use water conservancy projects as well as ongoing policies to reduce the uncertainty in water withdrawal simulation and projection huang et al 2018 5 2 attribution of water scarcity changes the significant increase of water scarcity before 1976 in the npc was mainly attributed to rapid growth in human water withdrawal due to the expansion of irrigated areas and rapid industrial growth human water withdrawal increased by more than 30 and further led to intensified water scarcity in most of prefectures and the npc as a whole as a result of potential of expansion in irrigated agriculture irrigated water withdrawal continued to increase during 1976 2001 over the northeast china and the middle reaches of the yellow river basin zhou et al 2020 together with the growth in industrial water withdrawal water scarcity increased significantly during this period however the application of multiple water conservancy measures including water quota system water pricing reform and water saving and recycling technologies the north china plain has promoted the deceleration and decrease of water withdrawal after 1976 cai 2008 jägermeyr et al 2015 precipitation over the north china plain and the middle reaches of the yellow river has shown downward trend during 1976 2001 huang et al 2016 which further led to less water availability and aggravated water scarcity conditions while in xinjiang increasing water availability resulted in significantly mitigation of water scarcity condition zhai et al 2005 when it came to recent two decades increasing human water withdrawal has reached or even exceeded environmental limit especially in areas with arid hydroclimatic conditions or highly concentrated human activities e g the north china plain and the tarim river basin feng et al 2018 necessary water conservation efforts must be taken to address the water scarcity issue and sustain ecosystem services for instance appropriate agricultural managements including improvement in engineering water saving technologies optimal planting structure and production scale have been widely adopted over the npc zhao and chen 2014 zhang et al 2019 li et al 2021 by implementing these policies and measures the utilization coefficient of irrigation water has increased from 0 35 in the 1980 s to 0 55 in 2019 for the industrial sectors policy interventions like upgrading power generation technologies improvement in air cooling and seawater cooling technologies also reduced the absolute volumes of thermoelectric freshwater withdrawals gu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 technological innovations resulted in decrease of the per capita water withdrawal of urban households during 1992 2012 cai et al 2019 the above measures and strategies from both policy and technology perspective greatly increased water use efficiency during past two decades long and pijanowski 2017 zhou et al 2020 however improving water use efficiency do not necessarily mean mitigation in water scarcity since there is a complex relationship between scarcity and efficiency varghese et al 2013 merli et al 2016 for example unver et al 2017 reported that human might use the water they save due to increased water use efficiency to expand production and freire gonzález 2019 also presented that improving water use efficiency would result in a rebound effect on water scarcity in spain this study found that total water withdrawal increased significantly during 2001 2020 over the northeast china and the relative decrease of water withdrawal in the north china plain was slight when compared with it increasing trend in the 1970 s because of this rebound effect total water withdrawal in the npc would maintain at a threshold and the effects of improving water use efficiency on water scarcity mitigation was not evident however we found that precipitation increased significantly in the npc during past two decades and offset the increase in et leading to enhanced water availability which was consistent with previous studies li et al 2016 li and chen 2021 guan et al 2021 when comparing the relative contribution of water availability to water scarcity against water withdrawal this study elaborated the dominant contributor of climate change induced water availability to water scarcity alleviation during recent two decades 5 3 uncertainty in water scarcity assessment and attribution we acknowledged that there were a few deficiencies that may introduce uncertainties into water scarcity assessment firstly the application of both water withdrawal and water consumption datasets was suggested in water scarcity assessment which could provide more important information to address the sdgs vanham et al 2018 this study only adopted the survey based water withdrawal due to the absence of water consumption dataset which would overestimate water scarcity as return flow would be reused by human furthermore water availability used in this study included sub surface and surface runoff simulated by vic which was biased corrected by survey based records from nbsc however both vic model and nbsc didn t consider additional water resources from inter basin water transfer projects and deep aquifers yin et al 2020 reported that the south to north water diversion project in china would significantly alleviate water scarcity in the npc and groundwater level stayed stable or even recovery in the north china plain after the operation of the south to north water diversion project long et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 groundwater pumping from deep aquifers in the plain and piedmont regions of north china has also proved to be a large component feng et al 2013 thus not taking into account inter basin water transfer and groundwater pumping from deep aquifers would lead to overestimation of water scarcity in the npc which should be considered in future assessment moreover human activities which let out pollutant and waste into rivers would affect water quality and reduce the available water resources in the downstream areas ma et al 2020 van vliet et al 2021 future assessment should take water quality into consideration to avoid an underestimation of downstream water scarcity liu et al 2016 in addition efr was assumed to be 20 of total water availability in this study but more spatial and temporal explicit details of efr should be considered because of various hydrological regimes and ecosystem functions pastor et al 2014 veldkamp et al 2017 liu et al 2021 in terms of the water scarcity change attribution a decomposition method was developed to quantify the relative contributions of water withdrawal and water availability to the proportional change rate of wsi this decomposition method was developed from definition of wsi by total differential equation and widely used in attribution analysis yang et al 2014 leng et al 2019 however we calculated the proportional change rate of the variable i e wsi ww and wa for a certain period by using a linear regression normalized by the corresponding average values despite that the linear regression models show high significance level p 0 01 it is still hard for linear regression model to represent the real change of the variables which would bring uncertainties in the respective contributions of water withdrawal and water availability to water scarcity change table s1 an improved method to accurately estimate the contribution of different factors to water scarcity evolution is suggested in the future furthermore changing trend of water availability only accounts for climate change impacts without the consideration of socioeconomic activities previous study reported that climate change was the dominant factor to long term change of annual water availability as compared with socioeconomic activities ficklin et al 2018 liu et al 2019 but the effects of socioeconomic activities on water availability trend should be considered in the future especially in some regions with significant variations of water withdrawal ashraf et al 2019 5 4 broader implications for coping with regional water scarcity a series of policy interventions have been conducted to address the water scarcity issue over the npc from the withdrawal side the most stringent water resources management system also called the three red lines policy which promulgated in 2012 to established total water use control and water use efficiency control provided a more stringent constraint to approach a peak of water withdrawal by 700 km3 year 1 in 2035 and achieved an increase of irrigation water use efficiency to above 0 6 a series of strategies were adopted to reduce water withdrawal and improve water use efficiency e g water saving irrigation development strategy water price reform and application of air cooling and seawater cooled technologies zhang et al 2018 li et al 2021 in terms of water availability china has constructed lots of projects to divert water resources from water abundant regions to water scarce regions since the 1950 s and the design capacity of the inter basin water transfer projects has reached 48 5 billion m3 yr 1 by 2016 sun et al 2021 direct water supply quota has been established to ensure minimum environmental flow requirements in the water scarce catchments e g the yellow river basin cai and rosegrant 2004 wang et al 2019 we assessed that water scarcity showed a decreasing trend in the recent two decades over the npc which indicated that the above policies have achieved remarkable progresses in addition we noted the main contributor to water scarcity alleviation was climate change induced increase in water availability rather than water saving policies during the recent two decades in terms of future trends we assumed that the total freshwater withdrawal over the npc would keep consistent at current level and projected a slight alleviation of water scarcity by increasing water availability under the strong mitigation scenario rcp2 6 however uncertainties and potential water scarcity risks would still occur since water saving technologies have been widely adopted at current stage the potential for further water conservation would be limited zhou et al 2020 rapid urbanization would promote economic growth and human income leading to the increase in domestic water use hao et al 2019 li et al 2020 furthermore future climate and human interventions would change the amount and distribution of natural water availability schewe et al 2014 veldkamp et al 2017 future extreme events e g flood and drought would become more frequent under climate hirabayashi et al 2013 yuan et al 2019 which also increased the difficulty in safe water supply therefore further adaptation measures should be considered to relieve water scarcity under future changing environment from both withdrawal and availability sides firstly it still requires a stricter implementation of water withdrawal caps or quotas for each sector i e agricultural industrial and domestic at both the administrative scale and catchment levels from both technology and policy sides then unconventional water resources e g sea water and water supply techniques e g renewable groundwater exploitation and utilization inter basin water transfer projects should be developed moreover policymakers should deploy more coordinated climate water strategies achieving carbon neutrality which could not only increase regional water availability but also potentially reduce human water use and thereby alleviate water scarcity liu et al 2022 in addition virtual water trade is a potential solution for water scarcity over the npc the northern water scarce regions should import water intensive products from the southern regions or from the international trade chain instead of producing them by themselves zhao et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 6 conclusions this study presented an assessment of the trends in water scarcity over the npc at administrative prefectural scale from the past to the future based on survey records and hydroclimatic simulations we highlighted the turning points of water scarcity trends and detected their dominant drivers across different periods by separating the relative contribution of water withdrawal and water availability results showed that severe water scarcity was mainly found in prefectures with large population or intense irrigated cropland and water scarcity intensified in most areas over the npc during the period 1965 2020 furthermore wsi over the npc showed a significant increasing trend during 1965 2001 but this increasing trend slowed down after 1976 particularly water scarcity was alleviated during recent two decades due to the negative trend of wsi attribution analysis showed that increased water withdrawal was the dominant factor for the aggravated water scarcity before 2001 but climate change induced increase in water availability became the major contributor to alleviate water scarcity than water withdrawal during 2001 2020 future projections also suggested that future climate changes would further increase water availability and alleviate water scarcity in the npc our research suggests a growing control of climate change on regional water scarcity alleviation aligning with the un sdgs that aimed to mitigate water scarcity the findings of this study highlight the mechanism behind water scarcity evolution over the npc and suggest that climate change impacts should be considered

the intensified water scarcity primarily to increasing human water withdrawal over the npc in the 20th century however water withdrawal has stagnated since the beginning of 21st century which raises a question of whether the trend of water scarcity changes particularly when considering the contribution of water availability that is subject to climate variability based on the water stress index wsi we detected the trends of water scarcity by a piecewise linear regression approach and investigated their associated drivers in the npc by using survey based datasets and hydro climate model simulations new hydrological insights for the region results show that the trends of wsi changed from positive to negative after 2001 increased water withdrawal was the dominant factor for the aggravated water scarcity before 2001 however as the rising precipitation offsets the effect of increasing evapotranspiration climate change has increased water availability and become the major contributor to the alleviated water scarcity during 2001 2020 furthermore future projections suggest that climate change would further alleviate future water scarcity over the npc by increasing water availability the results suggest the growing role of climate change in affecting water scarcity which are significant for guiding regional water policy making graphical abstract ga1 keywords water

water resources and inability to meet water demand for human livelihood economic development or environmental sustainability oki and kanae 2006 rockström et al 2009 water scarcity has become a serious global issue which may lead to severe consequences on both natural environment and human society such as crop production reduction drinking water shortage and water quality degradation mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 porkka et al 2016 which may impede regional sustainable development well understanding of the changes in water scarcity and driving factors could provide a basis for developing effective adaptation strategies to cope with future water scarcity along with china s rapid economic development and population growth water scarcity in the northern part of china npc is a widely recognized crisis ma et al 2020 huang et al 2021a current water scarcity assessments are mostly based on simulations of water availability and withdrawal from large scale hydrological models which consider the impacts of both climate change and human activities hanasaki et al 2013 hejazi et al 2014 water stress index wsi defined as the ratio of water withdrawal to water availability is widely used to assess water scarcity conditions liu et al 2017 previous model based studies have agreed that water scarcity has widespreadly intensified in the 20th century over the npc wada et al 2011 liu et al 2019 however human water withdrawal estimates from large scale hydrological models were often based on macroscale socioeconomic dataset and might underestimate the effects from technological factors and water conservancy measures leading to biased water scarcity trends huang et al 2018 based on statistical records deceleration of human water withdrawal was detected in china during 1965 2013 due to improvements in irrigation efficiency and water saving technologies zhou et al 2020 thus there is considerable uncertainty as to whether water scarcity in the npc has increased continuously to present day the question whether there is a turning point in trend of water scarcity still needs investigation water scarcity was often interpreted from the perspectives of availability and withdrawal sides in terms of drivers kummu et al 2010 the limited water availability due to low precipitation and its uneven spatial and temporal distributions have been identified as natural driving factors of water scarcity in the npc schewe et al 2014 the inefficient and large irrigation water use and rapidly growing domestic and industrial water use have intensified the conflicts between natural water availability and human water demand cai 2008 sun et al 2017 huang et al 2019 previous studies mostly attributed the water scarcity intensification in the npc primarily to human water withdrawal due to its rapid increasing trend arising from population growth socioeconomic development agricultural expansion and urbanization liu et al 2019 li et al 2020 however the chinese government has taken policy interventions to provide a more stringent constraint to approach a peak of water withdrawal since 2012 human water withdrawal has stagnated or even decreased in a number of river basins over the npc since the beginning of 21st century wang et al 2017 these indicate that the impacts of water withdrawal on water scarcity trend could be less significant which raises a question whether the dominant drivers have changed as another important driver besides water withdrawal climate change induced water availability has great effects on water scarcity gosling and arnell 2016 ashraf et al 2019 munia et al 2020 climate change led to warming temperature and compounding changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration et thus affected both surface water and groundwater availability further leading to changes in water scarcity zhai et al 2005 zhai and tao 2017 konapala et al 2020 recent studies have proven that precipitation in some basins of the northern china shows an increasing trend in the 21st century li et al 2016 guan et al 2021 it is possible that the impacts of climate change induced water availability on water scarcity trend over the npc become more important than water withdrawal especially in the 21st century thus there is an urgent need to assess the relative contribution of water availability to water scarcity change against water withdrawal and detect the dominant factor of water scarcity across different time periods which not only helps to better understanding the mechanism behind water scarcity evolution but also is of great significance for guiding regional water related policy making to this end this study provided a spatially explicit assessment of water scarcity over the npc the historical assessment was performed at administrative divisions scale by using statistics based water withdrawal and water availability datasets during 1965 2020 which provided more realistic water scarcity estimation than that only based on model simulations we first presented the spatial analysis of water scarcity trends in the npc and applied a piecewise linear regression model to detect the changes in trends then the relative contributions of water withdrawal and water availability to water scarcity trends were examined across different time periods particularly how the impacts of water availability on water scarcity evolved over time from the past to future climate change scenarios was evaluated this study could augment our understanding of water scarcity and help to address the sustainable development goals sdg target 6 4 un 2021 which would be useful for regional water scarcity adaptation 2 study area the npc 73 135 e 31 54 n is located in the northern china which includes fifteen provinces with 159 administrative prefectures fig 1a total area of the npc is 5640 000 km2 accounting for about 58 of total areas of china the npc lies in a temperate continental and monsoon climate zone and its most part belongs to arid or semi arid regions precipitation has large spatial variation within the whole study area with average annual precipitation ranging from 80 mm in the northwest to 1100 mm in the southeast of the npc precipitation showed decreasing trend before the year 2001 in monsoon areas but showed an increasing trend in the western part of the npc while precipitation has increased in the 21st century fig s1 the mean annual temperature during 1965 2020 ranges spatially from 4 15 over the npc and it increases from north to south as a result of the decrease in latitude the mean annual temperature in qinghai also below zero due to high altitudes fig 1c temperature also increased significantly during 1965 2020 with the high latitude areas experiencing the most significant increase fig s1 annual average evapotranspiration ranging from 50 to 800 mm and runoff ranging from 5 to 450 mm showed similar spatial distribution with that of precipitation fig 1d e with water flux decreasing from the southeast to the northwest of the npc the npc is currently facing serious problems of water scarcity due to its arid and semi arid climate conditions and growth in socioeconomic activities jiang 2009 rapid expansion of irrigation agriculture brings large amounts of irrigation water demand while population growth and socioeconomic development lead to increase in domestic and industrial water withdrawal especially during the late 20th century zhou et al 2020 conflicts for water use among sectors have become more serious zhou et al 2019 and environmental water requirement has been deprived leading to severe ecological degradation problems such in the north china plain huang et al 2015 and the heihe river basin li et al 2022 in addition the imbalance between lacking fresh water resources and large human water demand over the npc would become more complex under climate change impacts and ongoing water management measures 3 data and methods 3 1 water scarcity assessment wsi defined as the ratio of water withdrawal to water availability is a proper way to assess regional water scarcity wsi can measure the amount of water used and relates it to the available renewable water resources representing the imbalance between human water withdrawal and natural water availability in a target region over a specific time period and has been applied in a number of studies liu et al 2017 veldkamp et al 2017 greve et al 2018 the larger wsi value the severer water scarcity condition is in this study the annual wsi was calculated at administrative prefectural scale 1 w s i w w w a where ww was the sum of water withdrawal for agricultural industrial and domestic sectors wa was the sum of groundwater and surface water availability after removing the environmental flow requirement efr that was used to maintain the river ecosystem in a desired environmental condition based on the report from the ministry of water resources of china mwrc and literatures efr accounted for about 20 of total natural water availability over the huang huai hai region cai 2008 liu et al 2016 pastor et al 2014 estimated that the proportion of efr to annual flow did not show strong spatially differences over the npc thus we assumed that 20 of natural water availability should be used to maintain ecological integrity which was consistent with previous studies e g sun et al 2022 finally based on annual water availability and water withdrawal estimates at prefectural scale water scarcity in the npc was assessed 3 2 historical water withdrawal and water availability dataset annual water withdrawal during 1965 2013 at prefectural scale in the npc was obtained from a newly developed national long term water withdrawal dataset of china zhou et al 2020 this dataset collected and harmonized the sectoral water withdrawal records and surveys led by mwrc and finally estimated the water withdrawals for agricultural irrigation industrial and domestic sectors at prefectural scale the water withdrawal data during 2014 2020 was estimated by disaggregating the nbsc national bureau of statistics of china water withdrawal data http www stats gov cn english statisticaldata annualdata from provincial scale to prefectural scale based on the prefecture level water withdrawal estimates from zhou et al 2020 thus annual sectoral water withdrawals for 1965 2020 at prefectural scale for the npc were generated for water scarcity assessments the trend of water withdrawal is mainly affected by socioeconomic drivers such as socioeconomic development stage population growth rate and water saving techniques zhou et al 2020 sun et al 2019 which would reflect the impacts of socioeconomic activities on water scarcity annual total runoff has been widely treated as an indicator of renewable water resources in water scarcity assessment yin et al 2017 liu et al 2019 which finally becomes water resources in the rivers lakes and groundwater aquifers and is available for humans in this study natural total runoff consisting of the surface and subsurface runoff which is mainly affected by climate condition was considered as water availability in this study the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model simulations provided gridded estimates of annual water availability both subsurface and surface runoff for the period 1965 2012 at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 which have been well validated with gauge measurements across china zhang et al 2014 however the uncertainties of water availability simulation by hydrological models were usually large hattermann et al 2017 thus we used the annual provincial level natural water availability records for the period 2003 2012 from nbsc to bias correct the vic simulations at grid scale a multiplicative adjustment method was applied to remove bias from the vic model simulations ho et al 2012 2 wa corr t wa vic t wa obs wa vic where wa corr t was the bias corrected surface water groundwater availability at grid scale wa vic t was the surface water groundwater availability simulated by vic at grid scale and wa obs and wa vic were the annual average of nbsc reported and vic simulated water availability during 2003 2012 at provincial scale respectively we further compiled the reported provincial level water availability for the period 2013 2020 from nbsc and downscaled them to prefectural scale based on the grid scale vic simulations during 1965 2012 finally the water availability dataset that merged survey data and model simulations was generated at prefectural scale over the npc during 1965 2020 3 3 historical climate datasets annual precipitation and temperature over the npc were obtained from a 0 25 0 25 meteorological dataset cn05 during 1961 2020 which was constructed on the basis of over 2400 meteorological stations in china the cn05 data has been extensively applied to climate model evaluation and long term climatic analysis wu and gao 2013 global et dataset during 2001 2020 was obtained from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam v3 6a which combined a wide range of multi satellite observations and reanalysis data to estimate actual evaporation through a process based methodology miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 gleam based et showed good agreements with observations from chinese flux observation and research network yang et al 2017 and was more consistent with the gauge observations than the global land data assimilation system gldas version 2 0 dataset over china bai and liu 2018 the precipitation temperature and et datasets were aggregated from grid scale to prefecture and province scales to assess the climate change impacts on water availability in the recent two decades 3 4 project climate change impacts on water availability and water scarcity under different emission scenarios future projections of water availability i e surface and subsurface runoff in hydrological simulation over the npc were obtained from the inter sectoral impact model inter comparison project phase 2b isimip2b frieler et al 2017 isimip 2b was design to quantify the climate change effects based on a strong mitigation pathway and a business as usual pathway to provide tailored impact projections for the ipcc special report on global warming of 1 5 c and the representative concentration pathway rcp rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 were chosen ipcc 2018 rcp2 6 is the lowest emission scenario within coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 and aims to limit the increase of global mean temperature to 2 c above pre industrial levels which needs substantial changes in energy use and emission reduction and would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change van vuuren et al 2011 rcp6 0 is a climate policy intervention scenario i e without explicit policies designed to reduce emissions in which total radiative forcing level reaches a value of 6 w m2 at stabilization after 2100 masui et al 2011 future projection under a no mitigation baseline scenario rcp6 0 and the strong mitigation scenario rcp2 6 would provide the best scientific basis for political discussions about mitigation and adaptation measures following the isimip2b protocol future water availability simulations were performed by four global hydrological models ghms namely h08 hanasaki et al 2008a 2008b lpjml rost et al 2008 pcr globwb van beek et al 2011 and watergap2 müller schmied et al 2014 at half degree spatial resolution for the period 2006 2099 forced by climate projection from four general circulation models gcms namely gfdl esm 2 m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc5 under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 as this study mainly addresses the impacts from water availability under climate change the projections with fixed socioeconomic conditions of the year 2005 from isimip2b were selected furthermore simulation of surface water and groundwater availability by ghms were bias corrected by using the annual provincial level natural water availability records for the period 2006 2020 from nbsc similar to correction during the historical period shown in eq 2 then the bias corrected gridded water availability projections during 2006 2099 were aggregated to prefectural scale to ensure that inter annual variability of water availability does not dominate the signal of water scarcity the 31 year moving averages were computed for water scarcity assessment and the center year of the 31 year moving average was used to denote the 31 year period in order to assess the impacts of future climate projections under rcps on water availability and water scarcity this study assumed that prefectural water withdrawal for the future period 2021 2099 kept constant as the annual average values of 2011 2020 3 5 piecewise linear regression approach for trend analysis because one of the primary objectives in this study was to detect the changes in water scarcity trends among different periods a piecewise linear regression plr approach was applied to assess the turning points of annual wsi series over the npc following wang et al 2011 zhou et al 2020 reported that two turning points were detected for water withdrawal trends in china thus we adopted plr with two turning points to assess wsi series for the npc during 1965 2020 as follows 3 wsi β 0 β 1 t ε t t 1 β 0 β 1 t β 2 t t 1 ε t 1 t t 2 β 0 β 1 t β 2 t t 1 β 3 t t 2 ε t 2 t where t was year wsi was annual series during 1965 2020 for the npc t 1 and t 2 were the turning points of wsi trend and β 0 β 1 β 2 and β 3 were regression coefficients and ε was the residual of the regression the slope of wsi was β 1 before the year t 1 β 1 β 2 during the period from t 1 to t 2 and β 1 β 2 β 3 after the year t 2 a p value less than 0 1 was considered significant for the regression of wsi 3 6 quantify the contributions of water withdrawal and water availability to water scarcity change a decomposition method was developed to quantify the relative contributions of water withdrawal and water availability to the changes in water scarcity here wsi was measured as the ratio of water withdrawal ww to water availability wa denoting eq 1 as g w w w a w w w a we can express the total differential equation as 4 d w s i d t g w w d w w d t g w a d w a d t as and g w a w w w a 2 these substitution into eq 4 leads to 5 d w s i d t 1 w a d w w d t w w w a 2 d w a d t we divide this equation using w s i w w w a and obtain the following equation 6 d w s i d t w s i d w w d t w w d w a d t w a usually the proportional change rate r x of a quantity x t can be defined as 7 r x d x x d t therefore the proportional change rate of wsi r wsi can be expressed as the relative contributions from water withdrawal r ww and water availability r wa 8 r w s i r w w r w a the proportional change rate of variables i e wsi ww and wa for a certain period was calculated using a linear regression normalized by the corresponding long term average values leng et al 2019 thus based on the annual time series of wsi water withdrawal ww and water availability wa we applied the above decomposition method to quantify the contributions of water withdrawal and water availability to the change rate of water scarcity for each prefecture and the npc as a whole when compared the relative contribution from water withdrawal and water availability the dominant factor that affected water scarcity change was detected 4 results 4 1 the spatiotemporal distribution of historical water scarcity in the npc water scarcity over the npc has become a serious issue during 1965 2020 in terms of the spatial distribution fig 2a it was found that severe water scarcity wsi 0 8 was mainly found in areas with large population or intense irrigated cropland e g beijing tianjin hebei ningxia gansu shanxi and xinjiang the largest wsi was found in ningxia with the magnitude of wsi larger than 20 comparing the magnitudes of wsi between the 2010 s and the 1960 s fig 2b it was evident that water scarcity increased significantly in most the areas over the npc large intensification of water scarcity with the relative change larger than 100 mainly occurred in the north china plain and the northeast china e g the henan shanxi hebei heilongjiang and jilin in addition wsi decreased in beijing xinjiang and a part of gansu and qinghai which indicated slight alleviations of water scarcity condition during 1965 2020 4 2 trend and attribution analysis of water scarcity in the npc during 1965 2020 water scarcity in the npc intensified significantly during 1965 2020 with wsi increasing from 0 29 in 1965 0 48 in the 2010 s fig 3a when applying the piecewise linear regression approach to annual wsi series of the npc two turning points i e 1976 and 2001 p 0 01 were detected and three sub periods were divided namely p1 1965 1976 p2 1976 2001 and p3 2001 2020 the increasing trend of wsi was significant before 1976 with the magnitude of 0 0141 year 1 and it decreased to 0 0047 year 1 during 1976 2001 then the trend of wsi turn into negative i e 0 0050 year 1 after 2001 indicating that water scarcity in the npc was alleviated during 2001 2020 to assess the major contributor of changes in water scarcity trends over the whole npc the relative contributions of water withdrawal and water availability to water scarcity change over three sub periods were further quantified fig 3 wsi increased significantly during p1 with the relative change rate of 44 95 where water withdrawal and water availability contributed to 50 78 and 4 80 of changes in wsi respectively fig 3d and table s1 this indicated that growing water withdrawal was the mainly reason for the rapidly aggravated water scarcity before 1976 increased water withdrawal during 1976 2001 also led to moderate increase of wsi and the contribution from water availability was not significant furthermore the deceleration of water scarcity of the npc during p2 were mainly attributed to slowing down of increasing trend in water withdrawal which decreased from 6 23 km3 year 2 in p1 to 1 67 km3 year 2 in p2 fig 3c however water availability showed a significant increasing trend with a rate of 2 86 km3 year 2 during 2001 2020 fig 3b which contributed to a 12 84 of decrease in wsi together with the effects from decreased water withdrawal by about 5 24 water scarcity was alleviated in the npc after 2001 increasing water availability dominated changes in water scarcity than decreasing water withdrawal during 2001 2020 in general when taken the npc as a whole expansion in water withdrawal led to significant intensification of water scarcity before 2001 while water scarcity was mainly alleviated by increased water availability after 2001 fig 4 showed the trends and proportional change rate of wsi at prefectural scale during three sub periods about 84 of prefectures experienced increasing wsi before 1976 as shown in fig 4a significant increase in wsi with the slope 0 03 year 1 occurred in some areas of the northwest china e g ningxia and gansu and the north china plain e g hebei beijing henan and shandong while wsi showed negative trends in the inner mongolia and qinghai provinces during p1 despite that wsi showed an increasing trend in 76 of prefectures during 1976 2001 trends of wsi slowed down during p2 in 57 of total prefectures when compared with that in p1 the slowdown of increasing trend of wsi in p2 was mainly found in shanxi and the north china plain negative trends of wsi during p2 occurred in beijing tianjin xinjiang northern part of henan and shandong fig 4b in terms of the third sub period i e 2001 2020 water scarcity was alleviated in 70 of total prefectures and significant alleviation was found in the northeastern china the north china plain and the northwestern china the relative contributions of water withdrawal and water availability to water scarcity change for the three sub periods over 1965 2020 were separated fig 5 and the dominant driving factor of water scarcity change was further identified fig 6 it is found that increasing water withdrawal has dominated the heightened water scarcity for 75 and 53 of prefectures during p1 and p2 respectively significant growth in water withdrawal contributed up to 60 increase of wsi in the north china plain liaoning and shaanxi during p1 and in the heilongjiang jilin inner mongolia and ningxia during p2 figs s2 and 5 for example large increasing trend of water withdrawal resulted in intensifying water scarcity in spite of increasing water availability in shandong before the year 2001 decreased water withdrawal led to water scarcity alleviation for 24 of prefectures during p3 such as hebei shandong and ningxia in terms of the effects from water availability changes in water scarcity were dominated by water availability in 25 of prefectures during p1 fig 6 increasing water availability from climate change led to decreased wsi in the inner mongolia and qinghai during 1965 1976 figs s3 and 5 water availability played more critical role in water scarcity change over water withdrawal in 40 of prefectures during p2 and among them 23 and 17 of prefectures experienced intensified and alleviated water scarcity condition respectively however changes in wsi over 70 of prefectures were more likely to be affected by water availability during 2001 2020 significant decrease in water availability intensified water scarcity condition over henan and shandong during p3 water scarcity was alleviated by increasing water availability in 48 of prefectures e g the heilongjiang jilin and gansu in summary water withdrawal was the dominant factor for aggravated water scarcity in the npc before 2001 in most of prefectures over the npc while increasing water availability has greatly alleviated water scarcity during 2001 2020 4 3 climate change impacts on water availability during 2001 2020 the results above highlighted the increasing role of water availability on water scarcity change during 1965 2020 and increasing water availability was the dominant contributor to water scarcity alleviation in recent two decades this study used the natural runoff as water availability which was mainly affected by the compound effects from precipitation and et under climate change we further assessed the trends of precipitation and et during the recent two decades fig 7 it shows that precipitation over the npc had an increasing rate of 3 32 mm year during 2001 2020 precipitation showed an increasing trend in 80 of prefectures over the npc and the magnitudes of increasing trend were more than 5 mm year in heilongjiang jilin liaoning shanxi and shaanxi provinces where water availability increased significantly during p3 on the other hand air temperature showed significant increasing trends and the warming air temperature has led to rising et in about 93 of prefectures figs 7 and s1 the most significant increasing trend of et was found in hebei and shanxi provinces however the rising precipitation offset the effect of increasing et to some extent resulted in increasing water availability especially in beijing heilongjiang jilin and shanxi alleviating water scarcity over these areas 4 4 effects of water availability change on future water scarcity this study further assessed the effects of future water availability change on water scarcity over the npc based on water availability projections under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 from multiple ghms the spatial distribution of water scarcity in 2080 under these two climate scenarios would be similar to that in 2010 with severe water scarcity occurring in the hebei henan ningxia and gansu when taken the npc as whole wsi would decrease by 6 24 from 0 47 in 2021 0 43 in 2080 under rcp2 6 but would not show significant changes under rcp6 0 fig 8 this was mainly attributed to that future climate would increase water availability by 6 66 and 2 36 under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 respectively fig s4 spatially significant alleviation of future water scarcity 15 by increasing water availability would be found in hebei shanxi shaanxi ningxia henan and shandong provinces under rcp2 6 however future climate projection under rcp6 0 would lead to decrease of water availability in henan province and further aggravate its water scarcity by about 15 during 2021 2080 water scarcity would be alleviated by increasing water availability in hebei shanxi and inner mongolia under rcp6 0 the results suggested that climate change mitigation actions would promote regional water scarcity alleviation over the npc 5 discussion this study carried out an assessment of water scarcity for the npc at administrative prefectural scale by merging model simulated and survey based water withdrawal and water availability datasets during 1965 2020 unlike previous studies focused on the quantification of long term trends or changes in water scarcity this study visualized the turning points in water scarcity trends and further assessed the relative contributions from water withdrawal and water availability below we further discussed the mechanism behind the trends and attribution of water scarcity in the npc the implication of results for policy makers as well as future potential improvement 5 1 decadal changes in the trends of water scarcity over the npc this study found that water scarcity over the npc intensified considerably during 1965 2020 which agreed with the previous results at global scale wada et al 2011 huang et al 2021b country scale liu et al 2019 and local scale wang et al 2009 zhuo et al 2016 however the alleviation of water scarcity in the npc during recent decades is different from the results by large scale hydrological model simulations which suggested that water scarcity would continue to increase with climate change and socioeconomic development from the past to the future greve et al 2018 liu et al 2019 huang et al 2021b this caught the importance of application of survey based water withdrawal and water availability dataset in the water scarcity assessment sun et al 2017 and also suggested the future directions that large scale hydrological models should integrate the effects of technological change in water use water conservancy projects as well as ongoing policies to reduce the uncertainty in water withdrawal simulation and projection huang et al 2018 5 2 attribution of water scarcity changes the significant increase of water scarcity before 1976 in the npc was mainly attributed to rapid growth in human water withdrawal due to the expansion of irrigated areas and rapid industrial growth human water withdrawal increased by more than 30 and further led to intensified water scarcity in most of prefectures and the npc as a whole as a result of potential of expansion in irrigated agriculture irrigated water withdrawal continued to increase during 1976 2001 over the northeast china and the middle reaches of the yellow river basin zhou et al 2020 together with the growth in industrial water withdrawal water scarcity increased significantly during this period however the application of multiple water conservancy measures including water quota system water pricing reform and water saving and recycling technologies the north china plain has promoted the deceleration and decrease of water withdrawal after 1976 cai 2008 jägermeyr et al 2015 precipitation over the north china plain and the middle reaches of the yellow river has shown downward trend during 1976 2001 huang et al 2016 which further led to less water availability and aggravated water scarcity conditions while in xinjiang increasing water availability resulted in significantly mitigation of water scarcity condition zhai et al 2005 when it came to recent two decades increasing human water withdrawal has reached or even exceeded environmental limit especially in areas with arid hydroclimatic conditions or highly concentrated human activities e g the north china plain and the tarim river basin feng et al 2018 necessary water conservation efforts must be taken to address the water scarcity issue and sustain ecosystem services for instance appropriate agricultural managements including improvement in engineering water saving technologies optimal planting structure and production scale have been widely adopted over the npc zhao and chen 2014 zhang et al 2019 li et al 2021 by implementing these policies and measures the utilization coefficient of irrigation water has increased from 0 35 in the 1980 s to 0 55 in 2019 for the industrial sectors policy interventions like upgrading power generation technologies improvement in air cooling and seawater cooling technologies also reduced the absolute volumes of thermoelectric freshwater withdrawals gu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 technological innovations resulted in decrease of the per capita water withdrawal of urban households during 1992 2012 cai et al 2019 the above measures and strategies from both policy and technology perspective greatly increased water use efficiency during past two decades long and pijanowski 2017 zhou et al 2020 however improving water use efficiency do not necessarily mean mitigation in water scarcity since there is a complex relationship between scarcity and efficiency varghese et al 2013 merli et al 2016 for example unver et al 2017 reported that human might use the water they save due to increased water use efficiency to expand production and freire gonzález 2019 also presented that improving water use efficiency would result in a rebound effect on water scarcity in spain this study found that total water withdrawal increased significantly during 2001 2020 over the northeast china and the relative decrease of water withdrawal in the north china plain was slight when compared with it increasing trend in the 1970 s because of this rebound effect total water withdrawal in the npc would maintain at a threshold and the effects of improving water use efficiency on water scarcity mitigation was not evident however we found that precipitation increased significantly in the npc during past two decades and offset the increase in et leading to enhanced water availability which was consistent with previous studies li et al 2016 li and chen 2021 guan et al 2021 when comparing the relative contribution of water availability to water scarcity against water withdrawal this study elaborated the dominant contributor of climate change induced water availability to water scarcity alleviation during recent two decades 5 3 uncertainty in water scarcity assessment and attribution we acknowledged that there were a few deficiencies that may introduce uncertainties into water scarcity assessment firstly the application of both water withdrawal and water consumption datasets was suggested in water scarcity assessment which could provide more important information to address the sdgs vanham et al 2018 this study only adopted the survey based water withdrawal due to the absence of water consumption dataset which would overestimate water scarcity as return flow would be reused by human furthermore water availability used in this study included sub surface and surface runoff simulated by vic which was biased corrected by survey based records from nbsc however both vic model and nbsc didn t consider additional water resources from inter basin water transfer projects and deep aquifers yin et al 2020 reported that the south to north water diversion project in china would significantly alleviate water scarcity in the npc and groundwater level stayed stable or even recovery in the north china plain after the operation of the south to north water diversion project long et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 groundwater pumping from deep aquifers in the plain and piedmont regions of north china has also proved to be a large component feng et al 2013 thus not taking into account inter basin water transfer and groundwater pumping from deep aquifers would lead to overestimation of water scarcity in the npc which should be considered in future assessment moreover human activities which let out pollutant and waste into rivers would affect water quality and reduce the available water resources in the downstream areas ma et al 2020 van vliet et al 2021 future assessment should take water quality into consideration to avoid an underestimation of downstream water scarcity liu et al 2016 in addition efr was assumed to be 20 of total water availability in this study but more spatial and temporal explicit details of efr should be considered because of various hydrological regimes and ecosystem functions pastor et al 2014 veldkamp et al 2017 liu et al 2021 in terms of the water scarcity change attribution a decomposition method was developed to quantify the relative contributions of water withdrawal and water availability to the proportional change rate of wsi this decomposition method was developed from definition of wsi by total differential equation and widely used in attribution analysis yang et al 2014 leng et al 2019 however we calculated the proportional change rate of the variable i e wsi ww and wa for a certain period by using a linear regression normalized by the corresponding average values despite that the linear regression models show high significance level p 0 01 it is still hard for linear regression model to represent the real change of the variables which would bring uncertainties in the respective contributions of water withdrawal and water availability to water scarcity change table s1 an improved method to accurately estimate the contribution of different factors to water scarcity evolution is suggested in the future furthermore changing trend of water availability only accounts for climate change impacts without the consideration of socioeconomic activities previous study reported that climate change was the dominant factor to long term change of annual water availability as compared with socioeconomic activities ficklin et al 2018 liu et al 2019 but the effects of socioeconomic activities on water availability trend should be considered in the future especially in some regions with significant variations of water withdrawal ashraf et al 2019 5 4 broader implications for coping with regional water scarcity a series of policy interventions have been conducted to address the water scarcity issue over the npc from the withdrawal side the most stringent water resources management system also called the three red lines policy which promulgated in 2012 to established total water use control and water use efficiency control provided a more stringent constraint to approach a peak of water withdrawal by 700 km3 year 1 in 2035 and achieved an increase of irrigation water use efficiency to above 0 6 a series of strategies were adopted to reduce water withdrawal and improve water use efficiency e g water saving irrigation development strategy water price reform and application of air cooling and seawater cooled technologies zhang et al 2018 li et al 2021 in terms of water availability china has constructed lots of projects to divert water resources from water abundant regions to water scarce regions since the 1950 s and the design capacity of the inter basin water transfer projects has reached 48 5 billion m3 yr 1 by 2016 sun et al 2021 direct water supply quota has been established to ensure minimum environmental flow requirements in the water scarce catchments e g the yellow river basin cai and rosegrant 2004 wang et al 2019 we assessed that water scarcity showed a decreasing trend in the recent two decades over the npc which indicated that the above policies have achieved remarkable progresses in addition we noted the main contributor to water scarcity alleviation was climate change induced increase in water availability rather than water saving policies during the recent two decades in terms of future trends we assumed that the total freshwater withdrawal over the npc would keep consistent at current level and projected a slight alleviation of water scarcity by increasing water availability under the strong mitigation scenario rcp2 6 however uncertainties and potential water scarcity risks would still occur since water saving technologies have been widely adopted at current stage the potential for further water conservation would be limited zhou et al 2020 rapid urbanization would promote economic growth and human income leading to the increase in domestic water use hao et al 2019 li et al 2020 furthermore future climate and human interventions would change the amount and distribution of natural water availability schewe et al 2014 veldkamp et al 2017 future extreme events e g flood and drought would become more frequent under climate hirabayashi et al 2013 yuan et al 2019 which also increased the difficulty in safe water supply therefore further adaptation measures should be considered to relieve water scarcity under future changing environment from both withdrawal and availability sides firstly it still requires a stricter implementation of water withdrawal caps or quotas for each sector i e agricultural industrial and domestic at both the administrative scale and catchment levels from both technology and policy sides then unconventional water resources e g sea water and water supply techniques e g renewable groundwater exploitation and utilization inter basin water transfer projects should be developed moreover policymakers should deploy more coordinated climate water strategies achieving carbon neutrality which could not only increase regional water availability but also potentially reduce human water use and thereby alleviate water scarcity liu et al 2022 in addition virtual water trade is a potential solution for water scarcity over the npc the northern water scarce regions should import water intensive products from the southern regions or from the international trade chain instead of producing them by themselves zhao et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 6 conclusions this study presented an assessment of the trends in water scarcity over the npc at administrative prefectural scale from the past to the future based on survey records and hydroclimatic simulations we highlighted the turning points of water scarcity trends and detected their dominant drivers across different periods by separating the relative contribution of water withdrawal and water availability results showed that severe water scarcity was mainly found in prefectures with large population or intense irrigated cropland and water scarcity intensified in most areas over the npc during the period 1965 2020 furthermore wsi over the npc showed a significant increasing trend during 1965 2001 but this increasing trend slowed down after 1976 particularly water scarcity was alleviated during recent two decades due to the negative trend of wsi attribution analysis showed that increased water withdrawal was the dominant factor for the aggravated water scarcity before 2001 but climate change induced increase in water availability became the major contributor to alleviate water scarcity than water withdrawal during 2001 2020 future projections also suggested that future climate changes would further increase water availability and alleviate water scarcity in the npc our research suggests a growing control of climate change on regional water scarcity alleviation aligning with the un sdgs that aimed to mitigate water scarcity the findings of this study highlight the mechanism behind water scarcity evolution over the npc and suggest that climate change impacts should be considered
