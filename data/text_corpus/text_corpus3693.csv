18465,coastal mega cities will face increasing flood risk under the current protection standard because of future climate change previous studies seldom evaluate the comparative effectiveness of alternative options in reducing flood risk under the uncertainty of future extreme rainfall long term planning to manage flood risk is further challenged by uncertainty in socioeconomic factors and contested stakeholder priorities in this study we conducted a knowledge co creation process together with infrastructure experts policy makers and other stakeholders to develop an integrated framework for flexible testing of multiple flood risk mitigation strategies under the condition of deep uncertainties we implemented this framework to the reoccurrence scenarios in the 2050s of a record breaking extreme rainfall event in central shanghai three uncertain factors including precipitation urban rain island effect and the decrease of urban drainage capacity caused by land subsidence and sea level rise are selected to build future extreme inundation scenarios in the case study the risk reduction performance and cost effectiveness of all possible solutions are examined across different scenarios the results show that drainage capacity decrease caused by sea level rise and land subsidence will contribute the most to the rise of future inundation risk in central shanghai the combination of increased green area improved drainage system and the deep tunnel with a runoff absorbing capacity of 30 comes out to be the most favorable and robust solution which can reduce the future inundation risk by 85 8 this research indicates that to conduct a successful synthesized trade off analysis of alternative flood control solutions under future deep uncertainty is bound to be a knowledge co creation process of scientists decision makers field experts and other stakeholders keywords decision making under deep uncertainty urban flood solutions cost effectiveness climate change china 1 introduction climate change presents a significant planning challenge for mega cities with a population greater than 10 million mega cities are typically the most prominent population and economic centers of their home countries united nations 2018 observational evidence over the 20th and early 21st century shows that the globally averaged rate of increase in annual maximum daily rainfall intensity was between 5 9 and 7 7 per c of globally averaged near surface atmospheric temperature westra et al 2013 2014 in addition to this global trend increased urbanization which is associated with anthropogenic heat and artificial land cover may lead to an effect of urban rain island in a localized heavy rainfall event the urban rain island effect means that the center of the city receives much more precipitation than the surrounding suburbs such an effect has been observed in tokyo japan souma et al 2013 shimoju et al 2010 kusaka et al 2014 mumbai india paul et al 2018 and shanghai china gu et al 2015 liang and ding 2017 looking to the next few decades it is expected with high confidence that the intensity and or frequency of extreme daily rainfall will continue to increase especially in urban areas ipcc 2014 kharin et al 2007 westra et al 2014 wu et al 2013 mega cities are therefore positioned to play a leading role in responding to climate change challenges and are in need of knowledge to aid in their planning efforts under deep uncertainty aerts et al 2013 2014 rosenzweig et al 2011 given the fact that rainfall derived floods have been one of the most costly and dangerous natural hazards worldwide hallegatte et al 2013 cred 2014 it is of great socioeconomic significance to improve our understanding of the changing behavior and impacts of extreme rainfall westra et al 2014 and to find robust solutions for the planning and design of flood protection infrastructures löwe et al 2017 there is a large body of literature assessing the inundation risk under future extreme precipitation scenarios e g among others huong and pathirana 2013 jenkins et al 2017 muis et al 2015 poelmans et al 2011 sekovski et al 2015 teng et al 2017 wu et al 2018 however as pointed out by löwe et al 2017 such scenario based evaluations are difficult to apply for planning and design purposes owing to their heavy simulation loads and are therefore typically performed only for a few selected scenarios few studies have provided a planning supporting tool which takes into account the entire cascade of factors from the uncertainties of future urban rainfall behavior to the physical and economic damages resulting from extreme rainfall events and to the cost effectiveness of alternative mitigation options allowing for a synthesized trade off analysis of flood control solutions and pathways this study aims to address this challenge by developing such a synthesized trade off analysis tool for supporting flood control planning in shanghai and other growing megacities such as shenzhen guangzhou ho chi minh city são paulo mumbai bombay dhaka and jakarta our approach follows the tradition of the bottom up decision supporting frameworks which have a strong comparative advantage in handling deep uncertainties of many bottom up or robustness based decision supporting frameworks the following four have achieved increasing popularity dynamic adaptive policy pathway dapp haasnoot et al 2012 information gap info gap ben haim 2004 robust decision making lempert and mckay 2011 lempert et al 2013 and many objective robust decision making mordm kasprzyk et al 2013 the construction of these frameworks can be generalized into the following four sequential steps identifying decision alternatives sampling the state of affairs specifying robustness measurements and performing scenarios discovery to identify the most important uncertainties hadka et al 2015 a successful implementation of these four steps is bound to be a knowledge co creation process which emphasizes the generation of useable science for decision making through sustained and meaningful dialogue between scientists policy makers and other stakeholders clark et al 2016 meadow et al 2015 liu et al 2019 co creation is composed of interlinked processes of co design and co production mauser et al 2013 voorberg et al 2015 the former encompasses scoping of broader research problems and specific project objectives and goals it ensures that scientists properly understand stakeholder needs and leads to higher stakeholder trust in project results knowledge co production entails the generation of new knowledge through processes that integrate stakeholder and disciplinary i e climate science hydrology economics decision science scientific expertise it facilitates the incorporation of stakeholder latent knowledge into the overall scientific synthesis and builds stakeholder capacity to use the project outcomes in decision making usgcrp 2014 clark et al 2016 in this research we had kept sustained and meaningful dialogues with sectoral experts and decision makers in each key stage of the research for the following shared purposes a scoping the research problems and setting project objectives and goals b knowing about the current protection standards better understanding the potential vulnerabilities and selecting the right solutions c finding meaningful approximate methods to grasp such complex issue as the drainage capacity decrease caused by sea level rise and land subsidence and identifying priorities and approximation margins in data model fusion process with the help of these dialogues we added to the upstream and midstream of the above supply chain the entire cascade of factors that drive flood hazards and interact with the mitigation and control measures we opted to use the simple and speedy scs runoff curve number method chung et al 2010 mishra and singh 2003 chen et al 2016 as the core of our inundation model to bridge the gap between detailed risk assessment simulations existing in the literature and the requirements of planning applications for science informed cost effectiveness comparison across all plausible solutions we implemented this framework to the reoccurrence scenarios in the 2050s of a record breaking extreme rainfall event in central shanghai to build future extreme inundation scenarios we focused on three uncertain factors which are precipitation urban rain island effect and the decrease of urban drainage capacity caused by land subsidence to carry out a synthesized trade off analysis of potential solutions under future uncertainty we examined the risk reduction performance and cost effectiveness of all possible levers across different scenarios 2 materials and method 2 1 the case study city and event shanghai with a territory of 6 340 km2 provides residence to 24 1 million population in 2018 shanghai has been the arguably most prominent economic and financial center of china since the early 1900s and is now aiming to be one of the most important economic financial shipping and trading center of the world however as shown in fig 1 shanghai is surrounded by water on three sides to the east by east china sea to the north by yangtze river estuary and to the south by hangzhou bay in addition huangpu river a tributary of yangtze river runs through the center of shanghai the geological profile of shanghai is mostly composed of soft deltaic deposit the annual rainfall is about 1200 mm yr with 60 falling during the flooding season from may to september he and zhao 2009 he 2012 yuan et al 2017 the analyses of he and zhao 2009 he 2012 and yuan et al 2017 based on daily observational records over 1981 2010 indicated that torrential rainfall cumulative precipitation 30 mm day in shanghai are often intensely concentrated within a period of 12 h or less with an occurrence frequency of 18 23 per year in terms of five year moving average the five year moving average value of extraordinary torrential rainfall cumulative precipitation 100mm 12 h ranges one to four annually as a consequence the most devastating hazard in shanghai has been torrential rainfall induced inundation which has led to transportation and other social disruptions annually caused significant economic losses and endangered urban safety it is worth highlighting that the solution district as marked in fig 1 which is the central business district cbd of shanghai has the almost lowest elevation in comparison with other districts in the study area and in also shanghai therefore the performance evaluations of flood control solutions in this study will focus on this cbd area looking forward to the coming decades global warming as a mix of rising temperatures and unstable climate tends to increase the probability of heavy rainfall risks in coastal cities like shanghai chen et al 2017 jiang et al 2015 lee et al 2014 li et al 2016 wu et al 2018 this increasing probability combined with the trends of sea level rise and land subsidence which reduce the capacity of existing urban drainage systems leads to a great concern on the increase of the inundation risk in coastal cities by policy makers scientists and the public while it is recognized that the current flooding control infrastructure in shanghai would not be sufficient in defending the city against future inundation risk there is an urgent need for developing a synthesized trade off evaluation tool to support flood control planning in shanghai this study paid a special attention to a record breaking event of convectional rainstorm which took place during 17 19 h on the 13th of september 2013 and had an intensity record of 130 7 mm in an hour in the study area of shanghai fig 1 being 20 mm higher than the historic record in shanghai the event also had a sharp mark of urban rain island effect the extreme rainfall concentrated in the study area fig 1 this event caused severe inundation in the main roads in pudong cbd region and the temporary out of service of the century avenue metro station which is a hub of four metro lines as a consequence hundreds of thousands of people were stuck during the evening rush hour period this extreme event exposed the vulnerability of the central shanghai in inundation risk management therefore it can serve as an informative baseline case for testing the impact of future reoccurrence of this event on central shanghai under a changing climate 2 2 methods fig 2 depicts our model coupling process across the entire cascade of factors that drive flood hazards and interact with the mitigation and control measures the first major step of the process is to quantify three uncertain factors which features the future reoccurrence of the 13 september 2013 rainstorm event including spatial rain pattern and rain island effect and the decrease of urban drainage capacity the second major step is to simulate the inundation depths and areas for both the baseline event validation of the urban inundation model and each of scenario using the urban inundation model the third major step is to specify various mitigation measures and to evaluate the risk mitigation performance of these measures under each inundation conditions from step 2 the fourth major step includes the calculations of economic costs of various mitigation measures and then the comparative analysis of cost effectiveness of all specified mitigation measures the rest of this section will explain each of the above steps in more details 2 2 1 quantification of the three uncertain factors observational data at 11 representative meteorological stations in shanghai showed that the number of extraordinary torrential rainfall events per year in terms of five year moving average did not present an obvious trend during 1960 2010 however these data did show that the extreme precipitation values daily rainfall 99th percentile exhibited an increased trend at all of the 11 stations with the slope ranging between 1 31 and 4 16 mm day also see wang et al 2015 we had run precis 2 0 regional climate model of uk met office hadley center for the east china region with the spatial resolution of 25 km under both the baseline climate over 1981 2010 and the rcp4 5 scenario over 2041 2060 denoted as the 2050s precis stands for providing regional climates for impacts studies and is designed for researchers with a focus on developing countries to construct high resolution climate change scenarios for their region of interest hadley centre 2018 representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 is a scenario that stabilizes radiative forcing at 4 5 w m 2 approximately 650 ppm co2 equivalent in the year 2100 without ever exceeding that value thomson et al 2011 the results indicate an increase of the extreme precipitation value daily rainfall 99th percentile by above 10 from the baseline climate to the 2050s considering the observed historical trend in wang et al 2015 and the uncertainties of the future climate we assume that the increase rate α of the future precipitation in an extraordinary torrential rainfall event in shanghai by the 2050s will range between 7 and 18 in comparison with a similar event under the baseline climate in section s1 of the supplementary material we provide more details on the estimation of this range based on multiple climate model projections and rcp scenarios in our case study of the reoccurrence of the extreme rainfall event on 13 september 2013 this means that an amount of 7 18 additional precipitation will be added to the gauge s value of the baseline event for generating more inclusive and plausible scenarios in terms of spatial distribution liang and ding 2017 employed the hourly precipitation records of the same 11 representative meteorological stations as employed in our research in shanghai over 1916 2014 to investigate the spatial and temporal variations of extreme heavy precipitation and its link to urbanization effects their analysis showed that the long term trends of the frequency and total precipitation of hourly heavy rainfall across the 11 stations exhibited obvious features of urban rain island effect with heavy rainfall events increasingly focused in urban and suburban areas in more details the total precipitation amounts of heavy rainfall event over central urban pudong and xujiahui and nearby suburban minhang and jiading sites increased by the rates of 21 7 25mm 10yr in sharp contrast the trends at rural stations are not clear and in some cases even show a slight reduction based on these findings and the clear urban rain island feature of the 13 september 2013 rainstorm event we conducted face to face discussions with climate experts at shanghai meteorological services with regard to the future dynamics of such urban island effect the discussions came with an agreement that the urban rain island effect will have a margin of increase β 1 by 10 20 in the case of future reoccurrence over central urban sites xujiahui and pudong by the 2050s but will have a small margin of decrease β 2 by 0 076 to 0 038 at other stations with the help of above assumptions we can establish a large set of scenarios for the future reoccurrence of the extreme rainfall event on 13 september 2013 for example by taking any value within the above assumed intervals of the increase rate of rainfall extremes α and urban rain island effect β 1 and β 2 respectively we can apply these values to the observed baseline precipitation amount at each of the 11 representative rain gauges to generate one scenario at the gauge level then we can interpolate this gauge level scenario into spatial rainfall pattern across the whole shanghai city area shanghai has been experiencing land subsidence for years mostly owing to groundwater extraction and increasing number of high rise buildings anthropogenic urban land subsidence in combination with the global warming induced sea level rise will exacerbate the impact of extreme rainfall and reduce the capacity of drainage system it is estimated that a relative rise of sea level by 50 cm the height of land subsidence plus elevation of sea level rise which is highly likely by the 2050s in shanghai would reduce the capacity of current river embankment and drainage systems by 20 30 liu 2004 wang et al 2018 to take into account the uncertainties in sea level rise land subsidence and other degradation factors of the drainage systems we assume that the decreasing rate of existing drainage system capability γ would range between 0 and 50 dividing the intervals of α β 1 β 2 and γ into 100 equal intervals would generated 108 combinations of plausible values of the uncertain factors too many for a meaningful analysis to select a manageable and representative sample from these 108 combinations we implemented the latin hyper cube lhc sampling method in the r programming environment the lhc is a randomized experimental design that explores the whole input space for the fewest number of representative points in sample lempert et al 2013 in this way we generate 100 random scenarios of the future reoccurrence of the extreme rainfall event on 13 september 2013 2 2 2 the urban inundation model and its validation we developed the urban inundation model uim using shanghai s data to assess urban flooding risk under various extreme precipitation scenarios there is a large number of rainfall runoff methods in the literature most of them require intensive input data demanding calibration and expansive computing efforts chung et al 2010 mishra and singh 2003 in contrast the soil conservation service curve number scs cn which is also termed as the natural resource conservation service curve number nrcs cn method is globally popular for its simplicity stability predictability and ease of application for gauged and ungauged watersheds chung et al 2010 mishra and singh 2003 chen et al 2016 given the fact that our comprehensive evaluations of thousand combinations of inundation scenario and mitigation measures require for running the rainfall runoff module thousands of times the scs cn method becomes the preferred choice for being the core of the uim the uim uses the scs cn urban runoff method to estimate the rainfall loss and surface runoff matched with the local elevation data and spatial urban drainage capacity the scs cn method is based on an empirical proportionality relationship which indicates that the ratio of cumulative surface runoff and infiltration to their corresponding potentials are equal hooshyar and wang 2016 provided the physical basis of the scs cn method and its proportionality hypothesis from the infiltration excess runoff generation perspective chung et al 2010 amended the scs method to allow for the theoretical exploration of the range in which the cn usually falls in section s2 of the supplementary material we provided technical details of the scs cn method adopted in the uim and the localization of key parameters the input data required by the uim includes 1 gridded precipitation data which were generated by spatial interpolation of site observations baseline and the site level reoccurrence scenarios of the extreme rainfall event on 13 september 2013 to 30m resolution grids 2 soil and land use data which are mainly used for determining the cn values of land use type soil infiltration characteristics soil type and pre soil moist condition amc soil data was obtained from the harmonized world soil database hwsd fischer et al 2008 with a spatial resolution of 1 km land use data was from the 2014 satellite data inversion provided by the institute of geographic sciences natural resources research of the chinese academy of sciences with a spatial resolution of 30 m 3 digital elevation model dem elevation data which was obtained from the aster satellite 30m resolution data using the filling process to remove some false depressions according to the land use data considering that the residential and commercial land generally have a certain step height we made a correction on the residential and commercial land terrain by adding 150 mm 4 the map of the municipal underground pipe network is unavailable however considering that the underground pipelines are typically located along the street networks shanghai water authority provided drainage unit map and the approximation of the pipe capacity enclosed by streets boundaries to validate the spatial performance of the uim s baseline simulation we employed the public reported waterlogging point data provided by the shanghai police office on 13 september 2013 this database showed 760 reported flood points during 17 19 h on the 13th of september 2013 and most of them were in the solution district of our study area fig 3 compares the spatial patterns of simulated inundation by the uim and the public reported waterlogging points it shows a very good match in terms of area coverage in the solution district to further check the accuracy of the uim simulation in terms of water depth we ran infoworks v 8 5 developed by innovyze 2018 han 2014 han et al 2014 simulation of the same event for the same solution district using the same input data in the uim hydrological module infoworks icm is an integrated catchment modeling software and has been widely used in urban flooding simulations in the business world the infoworks icm enables to create an integrated model for 1d hydrodynamic simulations and 2d simulations both above and below ground drainage networks in urban area the 1d and 2d integration model gives a holistic view of complete catchment as it happens in reality and many works were generated in a small spatial zone as a number of blocks or a community however its triangle based 2d mesh zone sacrifices the calculation speed at a city district level in our test the ground model dem was meshed in 2d zone with triangle unit area between 1000 m2 to 5000 m2 and the different drainage unit is modelled in different infiltration surface considering their drainage capacity the comparison statistics shows that both the uim and infoworks icm simulations have the similar maximum depths 840 mm versus 800 mm and similar size of inundated area 20 km2 versus 21 km2 2 2 3 characteristics of solutions although shanghai has already built up a comprehensive flood and inundation protection system additional solutions are still needed to address the inundation issue in the future aiming to increase the current protection standards a series of hydraulic engineering projects have been planned or are under construction which includes the upgrading of old drainage pipelines construction of deep tunnels under the riverbed of the lower reach of suzhou creek and other green infrastructure projects in line with the 13th five year plan of shanghai on flooding control shanghai municipal government 2017 and the ongoing hydrological engineering projects we evaluate three sets of solutions the increase in the capacity of drainage systems by the planned rates the increase of green area by various rates and the construction of deep tunnels with varying capacities to make these solutions geographically compatible we assume all the solutions are implemented in the same core region within the study area i e the solution district which is about 70 km2 and mainly consist of the core cbd region in shanghai drainage the study area is divided into 284 drainage units by shanghai water authority these units are categorized by three types of standards in terms of drainage capacity 27 mm h 36 mm h and 50 mm h based on the current designed capacity of local return period of 1 2 and 5 years according to the 13th five year plan for water management and flood control in shanghai shanghai municipal government 2017 the current drainage standard will be raised in central shanghai following this plan and consultations with water and urban planning authorities we assume that the drainage capacity in the whole solution district will be upgraded to the highest standard 50 mm h this means that the extent of standard rising is location specific green area the shanghai municipal government has shown a strong willingness to improve the urban ecological environment through augmented funding for preserving and expanding public green areas statistical data show that both urban green area coverage and forest coverage have been increasing annually in last 25 years statistical yearbook of shanghai 2010 2013 2014 2015 2016 it is anticipated that future investment in green area will continue to rise in addition to their great contribution to air cleaning and urban environmental improvement green areas also play an important role in rain water harvesting and reducing urban surface runoff the municipal government has strongly promote sponge city guideline of increasing the green and permeable area by building green roofs and porous pavement and by tree and grass planting in public spaces in line with this guideline and shanghai master plan 2017 2035 shanghai urban planning and land resource administration bureau 2018 we assume that about 40 of the existing impermeable and moderately permeable with 50 permeability area in the solution district equivalent to about 30 km2 will become permeable with 70 permeability by the 2050s we down scale the district specific requirements of the sponge city guideline and master plan onto the drainage unit level this means that the distribution of the green area is specific to each drainage unit but there is no locational alternatives the conversion from the impermeable area and moderately permeable to permeable is modelled in the uim through changes in the cn in more detail the permeability conversion is implemented by lowering the values of cn in the scs model from 98 impermeable and 86 moderately impermeable to 80 in the corresponding areas deep tunnel the construction of deep tunnels will increase the urban capacity to minimize the surface runoff and thus reduce the inundation impact shanghai initiated the suzhou creek deep tunnel project in 2016 with a designed length of 15 3 km which aims to serve an area of 58 km2 mostly in the study area the target of the deep tunnel is to raise the drainage standard from 1 year to 5 years return period in its serving area and to well manage the rainstorm with a 100 year return period bringing no regional transportation abruption and keeping the water depth on roads no more than 15 cm the first stage of the project is planned to be completed by the end of 2020 followed by the construction of supporting systems 2nd stage and then long term extension stage given the fact that construction of a complete system of deep tunnel water storage sedimentation and purification and discharge by pumping is financially expansive and time consuming we designed to test three levels of the capacity of the deep tunnel project handling 30 50 and 70 tun30 tun50 and tun70 of remaining floodwater after those handled by the existing infrastructure in the baseline run of the uim the rainfall event on 13 september 2013 these three levels of capacity are equivalent to satisfactorily serving an area of 21 km2 35 km2 and 49 km2 with the standard of 5 year return period in the solution district respectively 2 2 4 performance evaluation for each solution or a combination of solutions we evaluate its beneficial performance by the metric of the risk reduction rate rrr the hydrological effectiveness as measured by the rrr per unit of abatement cost is employed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of different solutions flood induced casualties and physical damage to buildings indoor outdoor belongings infrastructure and natural resources constitute the direct loss which in general can be measured definitely by monetizing across all assets damage incurred by a physical asset was calculated as a percentage of its value and the function relating flood depths to this proportion is called a depth damage curve which considers the relationships of flood characteristics such as water depth flow velocity flood duration etc and damage extent either by the absolute damage values or the relative damage rates in the elements at risk the study area is located in the cbd with a high density of residential and commercial properties we opted to focus on direct damage loss resulting from inundation loss caused by the possibility of structural damage from the velocity of incoming water is not estimated in other words we specifically look at the categories of damage to buildings residential commercial loss of belongings indoor and economic disruption so as to examine the direct losses caused by urban inundation we evaluated the inundation risk based on the following equation iso guide 31000 2009 1 r i s k h a z a r d e x p o s u r e v u l n e r a b i l i t y section s3 in supplementary material presents the procedures to quantify each element in eq 1 the risk reduction rate rrr by a specific set of mitigation solutions is calculated as the percentage difference between the risk under the given extreme rainfall scenario without adding any solution r n not treated and the risk under the same extreme rainfall scenario with the specific set of solutions r t treated as specified in eq 2 2 r r r r n r t r n 100 benefit cost ratio is often used in public investment analysis however it is not easy to accurately quantify the public benefits of inundation abatement in contrast the cost effectiveness which measures the hydrological effectiveness per unit of abatement cost can be quantified with confidence and can serve the purpose of comparison across different scenario solution combinations chui et al 2016 liao et al 2013 we use the rrr from eq 2 to measure the hydrological effectiveness for cost estimation a life cycle cost analysis is necessary because the solutions differ in initial cost annual operation and maintenance cost salvage value and particularly lifespan we calculate the present value in 2013 rmb of the life cycle cost of a solution or a combination of solutions in the calculation we assume that the discount rate in shanghai is 5 as justified in ke 2014 section s4 in supplementary material presents more information on cost estimations of the basic solutions 3 result 3 1 inundation simulation the 100 sampled scenarios of the future reoccurrence of the 13 september 2013 rainstorm event as selected in section 2 2 1 were simulated based on the current flood control infrastructure in the whole study area reference runs two indexes were presented herewith to show the uncertain extent of the inundation 1 average inundation depth in the solution district and 2 the average 90th percentile depth which features the average depth of the upper decile of the most inundated drainage units within the solution district fig 4 shows the variation across the 100 scenarios it appears that the second index increases in direct correspondence to the first one the maximum and minimum of both indicates arrive in sc 11 and sc 53 with the maximum and minimum of the first index being 97 68 mm and 17 65 mm and those of the second being 543 2 mm and 176 5 mm respectively the variation of the average inundation across the 100 scenarios are large and its minimum is only 18 of its maximum whereas the minimum of average 90th percentile inundation equals 67 5 of its maximum all scenarios add increments to both the baseline inundation depth and area sc 11 sc 3 and sc 53 show the worst moderate and mild increments fig 5 the hotspot inundation areas are mostly in the cbd region where agglomerations of numerous properties and business are located along the banks of the huangpu river the affected area in sc 11 is significant large than that in both sc 3 and sc 53 in terms of inundation depth many grids in pudong district show high values in all three scenarios in the worst case sc 11 the inundation depth reaches as high as 1420 mm in some grids in pudong which is 750 mm higher than the maximum depth in the baseline simulation and the inundated area is more than doubled in comparison with the baseline even in mild increment scenario like sc 11 there are still some grids in the cbd region where the average 90th percentile water depth can be more than 1000 mm implying a high potential risk in the 2050s fig 5 3 2 the performance of solutions in reducing inundation to evaluate the performance of solutions in reducing inundation we re run the simulations of the 100 sampled scenarios based on the following five flood control solutions and their various combinations in the solution district drainage capacity enhancement drainage green area increase green deep tunnel with 30 runoff absorbed tun30 deep tunnel with 50 runoff absorbed tun50 deep tunnel with 70 runoff absorbed tun70 a performance evaluation based on average depth and average 90th percentile depth shows that 1 most of the solutions perform well in the mild increment cases e g sc 53 in which the solutions can wipe out the inundation water generally 2 in the worst rainfall increment cases e g sc 11 the performance of solutions varied from good to very poor 3 the depth reduction range of all solutions across the 100 rainfall scenarios is from 8 e g drainage in sc 11 to 98 9 e g tun50 drainage green tun30 and tun70 in sc 53 because of the heavy precipitation more than 140 mm in a short duration less than 3 h and in addition the decrease of the drainage capacity γ caused mainly by sea level rise and land subsidence the drainage improvement solution alone is unable to meaningfully reduce the water level in most cases especially in the worst cases a key aspect of the sponge city is to increase green area which can in turn increase the rainwater infiltration and residence time however increased green space alone does not perform well in the worst increment scenario as well the implementation of a deep tunnel solution shows an advantage in reducing the surface runoff especially during a rainfall peak by absorbing 30 50 and 70 of remaining runoff after the absorption in the baseline uim run by combining different solutions together we find that the combination of green area and drainage is able to improve the performance in the worst case scenario and the performance increases significantly once adding the deep tunnel solutions in the risk reduction rate rrr by a specific set of solutions from the risk level under an extreme rainfall scenario without adding any solution is calculated using eq 2 to determine the performance of this set of solutions fig 6 shows the rrrs of seven selected solutions green area increase ga drainage enhancement dr tun30 dr ga d g tun50 dr ga tun30 d g tun30 and tun70 under each of the 100 rainfall scenarios with reference to different level of γ the parameter featuring the uncertainties in the decreasing rate of existing drainage system capability caused by sea level rise land subsidence and other degradation factors fig 6 also shows the average inundation depth across the combinations of solution and rainfall scenarios at the given level of γ in fig 6 we can see that the average inundation depth increases almost linearly with the reduced drainage capacity γ and furthermore there is a strong negative correlation between the average inundation depth and the risk reduction rates of any given set of solutions when moving with γ in fact similar strong negative correlation also exists between the average inundation depth and risk reduction rate of any a given combination of solution and rainfall scenario when moving along the γ axis by contrast the correlation between future precipitation and the inundation depth is much weak this set of results indicates that drainage capacity decrease caused by sea level rise and land subsidence will play a dominant role in worsening future inundation risks in shanghai fig 7 displays the box plots of the rrr results over seven selected sets of solutions it shows that the rrr performances of the first two solutions i e drainage capacity enhancement and green area increase are the lowest in comparison with other solutions and are statistically similar the third and fourth solutions i e deep tunnel with 30 runoff absorbed and drainage enhancement green area expansion are able to reduce the inundation risk by a large margin on average but their performances are very dispersed with poor performances in the worst case scenarios the remaining three solutions i e deep tunnel with 50 runoff absorbed drainage enhancement green area expansion deep tunnel with 30 runoff absorbed and deep tunnel with 70 runoff absorbed are much better performers and the performances of the last two solutions are statistically reliable even in the worst case scenarios 3 3 cost effectiveness comparison table 1 presents the comparative cost structure of the five basic solutions the cost is accounted as the present value in 2013 rmb the annual average cost aac in the table indicates that the low impact solution of green area expansion has the lowest financial demand per year and the highest impact grey solution of tun70 has the highest financial demand per year respectively table 2 compares the cost effectiveness of the above five basic solutions and the two combinations of drainage enhancement green area expansion d g and drainage enhancement green area expansion deep tunnel with 30 runoff absorbed d g tun30 because the effectiveness measure in the comparison focuses on the risk reduction rate the comparison clearly puts higher values on the deep tunnel solutions of which tun50 has the highest effectiveness cost ratio if the criterion of solution choice is that the risk reduction rate should be at least 85 on average tun70 will have the highest effectiveness cost ratio 4 discussion this study has proposed a planning supporting tool which is capable of considering the entire cascade of factors from the uncertainties of future urban rainfall pattern and intensity to the physical and economic damages caused by extreme rainfall events and to the cost effectiveness comparison of plausible solutions the application of this synthesized trade off analysis tool to the case of the reoccurrence in the 2050s of the extreme rainfall event on 13 september 2013 in shanghai reveals a number of findings which are informative to urban planners and other stakeholders first the results show that drainage capacity decrease caused by sea level rise and land subsidence will contribute the most to the worsening of future inundation risk in shanghai in contrast future precipitation and urban rain island effect will have a relatively moderate contribution to the increase of the inundation depth and area this result is also indirectly supported by a real rainstorm event happened in june 2015 which caused severe inundation in central shanghai for days because high water level of rivers in the region prevented rainwater pumping from sewer systems into the river system this finding should have general implications for other coastal cities sitting on river mouth it means that it is important for urban planners in those cities to consider a scenario of a compound event in which an extreme storm surge under a sea level rise background takes place in an astronomical high tide period such an event would cause very severe flooding inside the city and bring disastrous impacts to avoid regret in the near future the mitigation and adaptation solutions should pay great attention to drainage standard increasing and drainage capacity strengthening which should be ahead of the pace of sea level raise plus land subsidence the cost effectiveness comparison in section 3 3 brings up an important decision making issue on the trade offs between the grey infrastructure and the green solutions the latter is usually known by varying names in different cultures e g low impact development lid in the us sustainable urban solutions suds in the uk and sponge city in china the grey infrastructure usually possesses better protection standards in reducing inundation risks associated with the low return period events but has a high level of negative impact on ecology and such negative impact is very difficult to be quantified in sharp contrast green solutions are typically effective in managing relatively high return period events but beneficial to the local environment and ecology and such benefits are very difficult to be measured by monetary value palmer et al 2015 because it is difficult to measure the negative impact of grey infrastructure and the positive benefits of green solutions to the environment planners typically under estimate both of them by a large margin in recognition of this limitation the solution of drainage enhancement green area expansion deep tunnel with 30 runoff absorbed d g tun30 becomes preferable to the solution of deep tunnel with 70 runoff absorbed tun70 given the integrative effect of d g tun30 in reducing urban inundation risk by 85 8 and in improving the local air quality and micro climate synthesized trade off analysis of flood control solutions under future deep uncertainty asks for consolidation of various sets of data from different sources and for decision making by the researchers in terms of solving conflicts across data sets and data sources finding proxies for missing data and identifying priorities and approximation margins in data model fusion process our decisions on these important issues were made jointly with local experts and policy makers in a knowledge co production process clark et al 2016 lempert et al 2013 liu et al 2019 usgcrp 2014 field surveys and focus group discussions were applied in the early stage of this work which provided very useful information for knowing about the current protection standards for illuminating the potential vulnerabilities and for selecting the right adaptation solutions opinions of experts from different infrastructure sectors and scientific fields and discussions with stakeholders and policy makers also gave us inspiration for this shanghai inundation application sun et al 2019 for instance expert opinions provided valuable insight for estimating the relationship between the drainage capacity and river water level and for using this relationship to approximate the drainage capacity decrease caused by sea level rise and land subsidence discussions with policy makers and other stakeholders enabled us to know better their interests and priorities which motivated our choices of solutions and key sources of uncertainties this knowledge co creation process also led to high trust in project results by policy makers the results of the work were delivered to local decision making authorities both the findings and the tool for the synthesized trade off analysis of flood control solutions under future deep uncertainty were well appreciated by the authorities with increased demand for wise and visionary decisions in dealing with the risk and uncertainties posed by future climate change there is an urgency to bridge the gap between the scientific research and practical applications although there is a myriad of research running flood risk simulations and assessments in shanghai and other mega cities in the coastal areas seldom can the detailed quantified solutions be digested by planners this work by integrating the simple but speedy scs cn based hydrological model into the framework of robust decision making under deep uncertainty provides a practical and instructive example for bridging this important gap 5 conclusion precipitation change in the future is subject to deep uncertainties especially in coastal mega cities like shanghai long term planning to manage flood risk caused by extreme rainfall events is challenged by uncertainty in precipitation change and also in socioeconomic changes and contested stakeholder priorities in this paper we have proposed an integrated framework for a synthesized trade off analysis of multiple flood control solutions under the condition of deep uncertainties we have demonstrated its operational ability with an application case study of central shanghai which focused on the reoccurrence in the 2050s of the extreme rainfall event on 13 september 2013 in the case study we considered three uncertain factors which include precipitation urban rain island effect and the decrease of urban drainage capacity caused by land subsidence and sea level rise we built future extreme inundation scenarios based on the plausible ranges of changes in the above three uncertain factors and randomly selected 100 scenarios by using the latin hyper cube lhc sampling method we then estimated the inundation depth and area of these 100 rainfall scenarios under the condition of both existing infrastructure reference runs and enhanced infrastructure by introducing alternative sets of inundation control solutions treated runs the inundation control solutions include the increase of public green area raising the standards of urban drainage system construction of deep tunnel with varying levels of capacity and the various combinations of the above basic solutions the direct physical losses were calculated for the 100 reference runs and also for all treated runs based on the depth damage curves the resultant large set of simulation results enabled us to calculate and then compare the risk reduction performances of all possible solutions in different rainfall scenarios two key results of these simulations and analyses are worth highlighting first drainage capacity decrease caused by sea level rise and land subsidence will play a dominant role in worsening future inundation in central shanghai this finding in combination with others urges future infrastructure planning in coastal cities to pay a great attention to the compound event of an extreme storm surge under a sea level rise background occurring in a period of astronomical high tide a no regret planning should be pro active by strengthening the drainage capacity well ahead of the pace of sea level raise plus land subsidence second although a performance comparison with a flooding risk reduction rate focus puts the solution of deep tunnel with 70 runoff absorbed tun70 ahead of drainage enhancement green area expansion deep tunnel with 30 runoff absorbed d g tun30 a consideration that the negative impact associated with deep tunnel construction on the environment and the environmental benefits of green areas are typically underestimated puts d g tun30 as the top choice which can reduce the future flood risk by 85 8 this example enriches the literature on the performance evaluations between grey e g traditional engineering structure and green solutions in mitigating urban flood risk with reference to financial and ecological benefits and costs the experience of this research suggests that a synthesized trade off analysis of alternative flood control solutions under future deep uncertainty cannot be accomplished by scientists alone and it must be a knowledge co creation process with decision makers and field experts such a knowledge co creation process can ensure useable science for decision making and lead to higher trust in project results by policy makers of course the advantage of our decision supporting tool in running comprehensive evaluations for thousand combinations of scenarios measures within one or a few days and with moderate demand for input data implies its disadvantage in lack of details at the grid cell level the second limitation is that the risk assessment in our work considered only the direct losses caused by inundation and ignored the indirect losses like interruptions to transportation and other urban functions and then the sequential chain effect across urban social and economic sectors declaration of competing interest the authors

18465,coastal mega cities will face increasing flood risk under the current protection standard because of future climate change previous studies seldom evaluate the comparative effectiveness of alternative options in reducing flood risk under the uncertainty of future extreme rainfall long term planning to manage flood risk is further challenged by uncertainty in socioeconomic factors and contested stakeholder priorities in this study we conducted a knowledge co creation process together with infrastructure experts policy makers and other stakeholders to develop an integrated framework for flexible testing of multiple flood risk mitigation strategies under the condition of deep uncertainties we implemented this framework to the reoccurrence scenarios in the 2050s of a record breaking extreme rainfall event in central shanghai three uncertain factors including precipitation urban rain island effect and the decrease of urban drainage capacity caused by land subsidence and sea level rise are selected to build future extreme inundation scenarios in the case study the risk reduction performance and cost effectiveness of all possible solutions are examined across different scenarios the results show that drainage capacity decrease caused by sea level rise and land subsidence will contribute the most to the rise of future inundation risk in central shanghai the combination of increased green area improved drainage system and the deep tunnel with a runoff absorbing capacity of 30 comes out to be the most favorable and robust solution which can reduce the future inundation risk by 85 8 this research indicates that to conduct a successful synthesized trade off analysis of alternative flood control solutions under future deep uncertainty is bound to be a knowledge co creation process of scientists decision makers field experts and other stakeholders keywords decision making under deep uncertainty urban flood solutions cost effectiveness climate change china 1 introduction climate change presents a significant planning challenge for mega cities with a population greater than 10 million mega cities are typically the most prominent population and economic centers of their home countries united nations 2018 observational evidence over the 20th and early 21st century shows that the globally averaged rate of increase in annual maximum daily rainfall intensity was between 5 9 and 7 7 per c of globally averaged near surface atmospheric temperature westra et al 2013 2014 in addition to this global trend increased urbanization which is associated with anthropogenic heat and artificial land cover may lead to an effect of urban rain island in a localized heavy rainfall event the urban rain island effect means that the center of the city receives much more precipitation than the surrounding suburbs such an effect has been observed in tokyo japan souma et al 2013 shimoju et al 2010 kusaka et al 2014 mumbai india paul et al 2018 and shanghai china gu et al 2015 liang and ding 2017 looking to the next few decades it is expected with high confidence that the intensity and or frequency of extreme daily rainfall will continue to increase especially in urban areas ipcc 2014 kharin et al 2007 westra et al 2014 wu et al 2013 mega cities are therefore positioned to play a leading role in responding to climate change challenges and are in need of knowledge to aid in their planning efforts under deep uncertainty aerts et al 2013 2014 rosenzweig et al 2011 given the fact that rainfall derived floods have been one of the most costly and dangerous natural hazards worldwide hallegatte et al 2013 cred 2014 it is of great socioeconomic significance to improve our understanding of the changing behavior and impacts of extreme rainfall westra et al 2014 and to find robust solutions for the planning and design of flood protection infrastructures löwe et al 2017 there is a large body of literature assessing the inundation risk under future extreme precipitation scenarios e g among others huong and pathirana 2013 jenkins et al 2017 muis et al 2015 poelmans et al 2011 sekovski et al 2015 teng et al 2017 wu et al 2018 however as pointed out by löwe et al 2017 such scenario based evaluations are difficult to apply for planning and design purposes owing to their heavy simulation loads and are therefore typically performed only for a few selected scenarios few studies have provided a planning supporting tool which takes into account the entire cascade of factors from the uncertainties of future urban rainfall behavior to the physical and economic damages resulting from extreme rainfall events and to the cost effectiveness of alternative mitigation options allowing for a synthesized trade off analysis of flood control solutions and pathways this study aims to address this challenge by developing such a synthesized trade off analysis tool for supporting flood control planning in shanghai and other growing megacities such as shenzhen guangzhou ho chi minh city são paulo mumbai bombay dhaka and jakarta our approach follows the tradition of the bottom up decision supporting frameworks which have a strong comparative advantage in handling deep uncertainties of many bottom up or robustness based decision supporting frameworks the following four have achieved increasing popularity dynamic adaptive policy pathway dapp haasnoot et al 2012 information gap info gap ben haim 2004 robust decision making lempert and mckay 2011 lempert et al 2013 and many objective robust decision making mordm kasprzyk et al 2013 the construction of these frameworks can be generalized into the following four sequential steps identifying decision alternatives sampling the state of affairs specifying robustness measurements and performing scenarios discovery to identify the most important uncertainties hadka et al 2015 a successful implementation of these four steps is bound to be a knowledge co creation process which emphasizes the generation of useable science for decision making through sustained and meaningful dialogue between scientists policy makers and other stakeholders clark et al 2016 meadow et al 2015 liu et al 2019 co creation is composed of interlinked processes of co design and co production mauser et al 2013 voorberg et al 2015 the former encompasses scoping of broader research problems and specific project objectives and goals it ensures that scientists properly understand stakeholder needs and leads to higher stakeholder trust in project results knowledge co production entails the generation of new knowledge through processes that integrate stakeholder and disciplinary i e climate science hydrology economics decision science scientific expertise it facilitates the incorporation of stakeholder latent knowledge into the overall scientific synthesis and builds stakeholder capacity to use the project outcomes in decision making usgcrp 2014 clark et al 2016 in this research we had kept sustained and meaningful dialogues with sectoral experts and decision makers in each key stage of the research for the following shared purposes a scoping the research problems and setting project objectives and goals b knowing about the current protection standards better understanding the potential vulnerabilities and selecting the right solutions c finding meaningful approximate methods to grasp such complex issue as the drainage capacity decrease caused by sea level rise and land subsidence and identifying priorities and approximation margins in data model fusion process with the help of these dialogues we added to the upstream and midstream of the above supply chain the entire cascade of factors that drive flood hazards and interact with the mitigation and control measures we opted to use the simple and speedy scs runoff curve number method chung et al 2010 mishra and singh 2003 chen et al 2016 as the core of our inundation model to bridge the gap between detailed risk assessment simulations existing in the literature and the requirements of planning applications for science informed cost effectiveness comparison across all plausible solutions we implemented this framework to the reoccurrence scenarios in the 2050s of a record breaking extreme rainfall event in central shanghai to build future extreme inundation scenarios we focused on three uncertain factors which are precipitation urban rain island effect and the decrease of urban drainage capacity caused by land subsidence to carry out a synthesized trade off analysis of potential solutions under future uncertainty we examined the risk reduction performance and cost effectiveness of all possible levers across different scenarios 2 materials and method 2 1 the case study city and event shanghai with a territory of 6 340 km2 provides residence to 24 1 million population in 2018 shanghai has been the arguably most prominent economic and financial center of china since the early 1900s and is now aiming to be one of the most important economic financial shipping and trading center of the world however as shown in fig 1 shanghai is surrounded by water on three sides to the east by east china sea to the north by yangtze river estuary and to the south by hangzhou bay in addition huangpu river a tributary of yangtze river runs through the center of shanghai the geological profile of shanghai is mostly composed of soft deltaic deposit the annual rainfall is about 1200 mm yr with 60 falling during the flooding season from may to september he and zhao 2009 he 2012 yuan et al 2017 the analyses of he and zhao 2009 he 2012 and yuan et al 2017 based on daily observational records over 1981 2010 indicated that torrential rainfall cumulative precipitation 30 mm day in shanghai are often intensely concentrated within a period of 12 h or less with an occurrence frequency of 18 23 per year in terms of five year moving average the five year moving average value of extraordinary torrential rainfall cumulative precipitation 100mm 12 h ranges one to four annually as a consequence the most devastating hazard in shanghai has been torrential rainfall induced inundation which has led to transportation and other social disruptions annually caused significant economic losses and endangered urban safety it is worth highlighting that the solution district as marked in fig 1 which is the central business district cbd of shanghai has the almost lowest elevation in comparison with other districts in the study area and in also shanghai therefore the performance evaluations of flood control solutions in this study will focus on this cbd area looking forward to the coming decades global warming as a mix of rising temperatures and unstable climate tends to increase the probability of heavy rainfall risks in coastal cities like shanghai chen et al 2017 jiang et al 2015 lee et al 2014 li et al 2016 wu et al 2018 this increasing probability combined with the trends of sea level rise and land subsidence which reduce the capacity of existing urban drainage systems leads to a great concern on the increase of the inundation risk in coastal cities by policy makers scientists and the public while it is recognized that the current flooding control infrastructure in shanghai would not be sufficient in defending the city against future inundation risk there is an urgent need for developing a synthesized trade off evaluation tool to support flood control planning in shanghai this study paid a special attention to a record breaking event of convectional rainstorm which took place during 17 19 h on the 13th of september 2013 and had an intensity record of 130 7 mm in an hour in the study area of shanghai fig 1 being 20 mm higher than the historic record in shanghai the event also had a sharp mark of urban rain island effect the extreme rainfall concentrated in the study area fig 1 this event caused severe inundation in the main roads in pudong cbd region and the temporary out of service of the century avenue metro station which is a hub of four metro lines as a consequence hundreds of thousands of people were stuck during the evening rush hour period this extreme event exposed the vulnerability of the central shanghai in inundation risk management therefore it can serve as an informative baseline case for testing the impact of future reoccurrence of this event on central shanghai under a changing climate 2 2 methods fig 2 depicts our model coupling process across the entire cascade of factors that drive flood hazards and interact with the mitigation and control measures the first major step of the process is to quantify three uncertain factors which features the future reoccurrence of the 13 september 2013 rainstorm event including spatial rain pattern and rain island effect and the decrease of urban drainage capacity the second major step is to simulate the inundation depths and areas for both the baseline event validation of the urban inundation model and each of scenario using the urban inundation model the third major step is to specify various mitigation measures and to evaluate the risk mitigation performance of these measures under each inundation conditions from step 2 the fourth major step includes the calculations of economic costs of various mitigation measures and then the comparative analysis of cost effectiveness of all specified mitigation measures the rest of this section will explain each of the above steps in more details 2 2 1 quantification of the three uncertain factors observational data at 11 representative meteorological stations in shanghai showed that the number of extraordinary torrential rainfall events per year in terms of five year moving average did not present an obvious trend during 1960 2010 however these data did show that the extreme precipitation values daily rainfall 99th percentile exhibited an increased trend at all of the 11 stations with the slope ranging between 1 31 and 4 16 mm day also see wang et al 2015 we had run precis 2 0 regional climate model of uk met office hadley center for the east china region with the spatial resolution of 25 km under both the baseline climate over 1981 2010 and the rcp4 5 scenario over 2041 2060 denoted as the 2050s precis stands for providing regional climates for impacts studies and is designed for researchers with a focus on developing countries to construct high resolution climate change scenarios for their region of interest hadley centre 2018 representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 is a scenario that stabilizes radiative forcing at 4 5 w m 2 approximately 650 ppm co2 equivalent in the year 2100 without ever exceeding that value thomson et al 2011 the results indicate an increase of the extreme precipitation value daily rainfall 99th percentile by above 10 from the baseline climate to the 2050s considering the observed historical trend in wang et al 2015 and the uncertainties of the future climate we assume that the increase rate α of the future precipitation in an extraordinary torrential rainfall event in shanghai by the 2050s will range between 7 and 18 in comparison with a similar event under the baseline climate in section s1 of the supplementary material we provide more details on the estimation of this range based on multiple climate model projections and rcp scenarios in our case study of the reoccurrence of the extreme rainfall event on 13 september 2013 this means that an amount of 7 18 additional precipitation will be added to the gauge s value of the baseline event for generating more inclusive and plausible scenarios in terms of spatial distribution liang and ding 2017 employed the hourly precipitation records of the same 11 representative meteorological stations as employed in our research in shanghai over 1916 2014 to investigate the spatial and temporal variations of extreme heavy precipitation and its link to urbanization effects their analysis showed that the long term trends of the frequency and total precipitation of hourly heavy rainfall across the 11 stations exhibited obvious features of urban rain island effect with heavy rainfall events increasingly focused in urban and suburban areas in more details the total precipitation amounts of heavy rainfall event over central urban pudong and xujiahui and nearby suburban minhang and jiading sites increased by the rates of 21 7 25mm 10yr in sharp contrast the trends at rural stations are not clear and in some cases even show a slight reduction based on these findings and the clear urban rain island feature of the 13 september 2013 rainstorm event we conducted face to face discussions with climate experts at shanghai meteorological services with regard to the future dynamics of such urban island effect the discussions came with an agreement that the urban rain island effect will have a margin of increase β 1 by 10 20 in the case of future reoccurrence over central urban sites xujiahui and pudong by the 2050s but will have a small margin of decrease β 2 by 0 076 to 0 038 at other stations with the help of above assumptions we can establish a large set of scenarios for the future reoccurrence of the extreme rainfall event on 13 september 2013 for example by taking any value within the above assumed intervals of the increase rate of rainfall extremes α and urban rain island effect β 1 and β 2 respectively we can apply these values to the observed baseline precipitation amount at each of the 11 representative rain gauges to generate one scenario at the gauge level then we can interpolate this gauge level scenario into spatial rainfall pattern across the whole shanghai city area shanghai has been experiencing land subsidence for years mostly owing to groundwater extraction and increasing number of high rise buildings anthropogenic urban land subsidence in combination with the global warming induced sea level rise will exacerbate the impact of extreme rainfall and reduce the capacity of drainage system it is estimated that a relative rise of sea level by 50 cm the height of land subsidence plus elevation of sea level rise which is highly likely by the 2050s in shanghai would reduce the capacity of current river embankment and drainage systems by 20 30 liu 2004 wang et al 2018 to take into account the uncertainties in sea level rise land subsidence and other degradation factors of the drainage systems we assume that the decreasing rate of existing drainage system capability γ would range between 0 and 50 dividing the intervals of α β 1 β 2 and γ into 100 equal intervals would generated 108 combinations of plausible values of the uncertain factors too many for a meaningful analysis to select a manageable and representative sample from these 108 combinations we implemented the latin hyper cube lhc sampling method in the r programming environment the lhc is a randomized experimental design that explores the whole input space for the fewest number of representative points in sample lempert et al 2013 in this way we generate 100 random scenarios of the future reoccurrence of the extreme rainfall event on 13 september 2013 2 2 2 the urban inundation model and its validation we developed the urban inundation model uim using shanghai s data to assess urban flooding risk under various extreme precipitation scenarios there is a large number of rainfall runoff methods in the literature most of them require intensive input data demanding calibration and expansive computing efforts chung et al 2010 mishra and singh 2003 in contrast the soil conservation service curve number scs cn which is also termed as the natural resource conservation service curve number nrcs cn method is globally popular for its simplicity stability predictability and ease of application for gauged and ungauged watersheds chung et al 2010 mishra and singh 2003 chen et al 2016 given the fact that our comprehensive evaluations of thousand combinations of inundation scenario and mitigation measures require for running the rainfall runoff module thousands of times the scs cn method becomes the preferred choice for being the core of the uim the uim uses the scs cn urban runoff method to estimate the rainfall loss and surface runoff matched with the local elevation data and spatial urban drainage capacity the scs cn method is based on an empirical proportionality relationship which indicates that the ratio of cumulative surface runoff and infiltration to their corresponding potentials are equal hooshyar and wang 2016 provided the physical basis of the scs cn method and its proportionality hypothesis from the infiltration excess runoff generation perspective chung et al 2010 amended the scs method to allow for the theoretical exploration of the range in which the cn usually falls in section s2 of the supplementary material we provided technical details of the scs cn method adopted in the uim and the localization of key parameters the input data required by the uim includes 1 gridded precipitation data which were generated by spatial interpolation of site observations baseline and the site level reoccurrence scenarios of the extreme rainfall event on 13 september 2013 to 30m resolution grids 2 soil and land use data which are mainly used for determining the cn values of land use type soil infiltration characteristics soil type and pre soil moist condition amc soil data was obtained from the harmonized world soil database hwsd fischer et al 2008 with a spatial resolution of 1 km land use data was from the 2014 satellite data inversion provided by the institute of geographic sciences natural resources research of the chinese academy of sciences with a spatial resolution of 30 m 3 digital elevation model dem elevation data which was obtained from the aster satellite 30m resolution data using the filling process to remove some false depressions according to the land use data considering that the residential and commercial land generally have a certain step height we made a correction on the residential and commercial land terrain by adding 150 mm 4 the map of the municipal underground pipe network is unavailable however considering that the underground pipelines are typically located along the street networks shanghai water authority provided drainage unit map and the approximation of the pipe capacity enclosed by streets boundaries to validate the spatial performance of the uim s baseline simulation we employed the public reported waterlogging point data provided by the shanghai police office on 13 september 2013 this database showed 760 reported flood points during 17 19 h on the 13th of september 2013 and most of them were in the solution district of our study area fig 3 compares the spatial patterns of simulated inundation by the uim and the public reported waterlogging points it shows a very good match in terms of area coverage in the solution district to further check the accuracy of the uim simulation in terms of water depth we ran infoworks v 8 5 developed by innovyze 2018 han 2014 han et al 2014 simulation of the same event for the same solution district using the same input data in the uim hydrological module infoworks icm is an integrated catchment modeling software and has been widely used in urban flooding simulations in the business world the infoworks icm enables to create an integrated model for 1d hydrodynamic simulations and 2d simulations both above and below ground drainage networks in urban area the 1d and 2d integration model gives a holistic view of complete catchment as it happens in reality and many works were generated in a small spatial zone as a number of blocks or a community however its triangle based 2d mesh zone sacrifices the calculation speed at a city district level in our test the ground model dem was meshed in 2d zone with triangle unit area between 1000 m2 to 5000 m2 and the different drainage unit is modelled in different infiltration surface considering their drainage capacity the comparison statistics shows that both the uim and infoworks icm simulations have the similar maximum depths 840 mm versus 800 mm and similar size of inundated area 20 km2 versus 21 km2 2 2 3 characteristics of solutions although shanghai has already built up a comprehensive flood and inundation protection system additional solutions are still needed to address the inundation issue in the future aiming to increase the current protection standards a series of hydraulic engineering projects have been planned or are under construction which includes the upgrading of old drainage pipelines construction of deep tunnels under the riverbed of the lower reach of suzhou creek and other green infrastructure projects in line with the 13th five year plan of shanghai on flooding control shanghai municipal government 2017 and the ongoing hydrological engineering projects we evaluate three sets of solutions the increase in the capacity of drainage systems by the planned rates the increase of green area by various rates and the construction of deep tunnels with varying capacities to make these solutions geographically compatible we assume all the solutions are implemented in the same core region within the study area i e the solution district which is about 70 km2 and mainly consist of the core cbd region in shanghai drainage the study area is divided into 284 drainage units by shanghai water authority these units are categorized by three types of standards in terms of drainage capacity 27 mm h 36 mm h and 50 mm h based on the current designed capacity of local return period of 1 2 and 5 years according to the 13th five year plan for water management and flood control in shanghai shanghai municipal government 2017 the current drainage standard will be raised in central shanghai following this plan and consultations with water and urban planning authorities we assume that the drainage capacity in the whole solution district will be upgraded to the highest standard 50 mm h this means that the extent of standard rising is location specific green area the shanghai municipal government has shown a strong willingness to improve the urban ecological environment through augmented funding for preserving and expanding public green areas statistical data show that both urban green area coverage and forest coverage have been increasing annually in last 25 years statistical yearbook of shanghai 2010 2013 2014 2015 2016 it is anticipated that future investment in green area will continue to rise in addition to their great contribution to air cleaning and urban environmental improvement green areas also play an important role in rain water harvesting and reducing urban surface runoff the municipal government has strongly promote sponge city guideline of increasing the green and permeable area by building green roofs and porous pavement and by tree and grass planting in public spaces in line with this guideline and shanghai master plan 2017 2035 shanghai urban planning and land resource administration bureau 2018 we assume that about 40 of the existing impermeable and moderately permeable with 50 permeability area in the solution district equivalent to about 30 km2 will become permeable with 70 permeability by the 2050s we down scale the district specific requirements of the sponge city guideline and master plan onto the drainage unit level this means that the distribution of the green area is specific to each drainage unit but there is no locational alternatives the conversion from the impermeable area and moderately permeable to permeable is modelled in the uim through changes in the cn in more detail the permeability conversion is implemented by lowering the values of cn in the scs model from 98 impermeable and 86 moderately impermeable to 80 in the corresponding areas deep tunnel the construction of deep tunnels will increase the urban capacity to minimize the surface runoff and thus reduce the inundation impact shanghai initiated the suzhou creek deep tunnel project in 2016 with a designed length of 15 3 km which aims to serve an area of 58 km2 mostly in the study area the target of the deep tunnel is to raise the drainage standard from 1 year to 5 years return period in its serving area and to well manage the rainstorm with a 100 year return period bringing no regional transportation abruption and keeping the water depth on roads no more than 15 cm the first stage of the project is planned to be completed by the end of 2020 followed by the construction of supporting systems 2nd stage and then long term extension stage given the fact that construction of a complete system of deep tunnel water storage sedimentation and purification and discharge by pumping is financially expansive and time consuming we designed to test three levels of the capacity of the deep tunnel project handling 30 50 and 70 tun30 tun50 and tun70 of remaining floodwater after those handled by the existing infrastructure in the baseline run of the uim the rainfall event on 13 september 2013 these three levels of capacity are equivalent to satisfactorily serving an area of 21 km2 35 km2 and 49 km2 with the standard of 5 year return period in the solution district respectively 2 2 4 performance evaluation for each solution or a combination of solutions we evaluate its beneficial performance by the metric of the risk reduction rate rrr the hydrological effectiveness as measured by the rrr per unit of abatement cost is employed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of different solutions flood induced casualties and physical damage to buildings indoor outdoor belongings infrastructure and natural resources constitute the direct loss which in general can be measured definitely by monetizing across all assets damage incurred by a physical asset was calculated as a percentage of its value and the function relating flood depths to this proportion is called a depth damage curve which considers the relationships of flood characteristics such as water depth flow velocity flood duration etc and damage extent either by the absolute damage values or the relative damage rates in the elements at risk the study area is located in the cbd with a high density of residential and commercial properties we opted to focus on direct damage loss resulting from inundation loss caused by the possibility of structural damage from the velocity of incoming water is not estimated in other words we specifically look at the categories of damage to buildings residential commercial loss of belongings indoor and economic disruption so as to examine the direct losses caused by urban inundation we evaluated the inundation risk based on the following equation iso guide 31000 2009 1 r i s k h a z a r d e x p o s u r e v u l n e r a b i l i t y section s3 in supplementary material presents the procedures to quantify each element in eq 1 the risk reduction rate rrr by a specific set of mitigation solutions is calculated as the percentage difference between the risk under the given extreme rainfall scenario without adding any solution r n not treated and the risk under the same extreme rainfall scenario with the specific set of solutions r t treated as specified in eq 2 2 r r r r n r t r n 100 benefit cost ratio is often used in public investment analysis however it is not easy to accurately quantify the public benefits of inundation abatement in contrast the cost effectiveness which measures the hydrological effectiveness per unit of abatement cost can be quantified with confidence and can serve the purpose of comparison across different scenario solution combinations chui et al 2016 liao et al 2013 we use the rrr from eq 2 to measure the hydrological effectiveness for cost estimation a life cycle cost analysis is necessary because the solutions differ in initial cost annual operation and maintenance cost salvage value and particularly lifespan we calculate the present value in 2013 rmb of the life cycle cost of a solution or a combination of solutions in the calculation we assume that the discount rate in shanghai is 5 as justified in ke 2014 section s4 in supplementary material presents more information on cost estimations of the basic solutions 3 result 3 1 inundation simulation the 100 sampled scenarios of the future reoccurrence of the 13 september 2013 rainstorm event as selected in section 2 2 1 were simulated based on the current flood control infrastructure in the whole study area reference runs two indexes were presented herewith to show the uncertain extent of the inundation 1 average inundation depth in the solution district and 2 the average 90th percentile depth which features the average depth of the upper decile of the most inundated drainage units within the solution district fig 4 shows the variation across the 100 scenarios it appears that the second index increases in direct correspondence to the first one the maximum and minimum of both indicates arrive in sc 11 and sc 53 with the maximum and minimum of the first index being 97 68 mm and 17 65 mm and those of the second being 543 2 mm and 176 5 mm respectively the variation of the average inundation across the 100 scenarios are large and its minimum is only 18 of its maximum whereas the minimum of average 90th percentile inundation equals 67 5 of its maximum all scenarios add increments to both the baseline inundation depth and area sc 11 sc 3 and sc 53 show the worst moderate and mild increments fig 5 the hotspot inundation areas are mostly in the cbd region where agglomerations of numerous properties and business are located along the banks of the huangpu river the affected area in sc 11 is significant large than that in both sc 3 and sc 53 in terms of inundation depth many grids in pudong district show high values in all three scenarios in the worst case sc 11 the inundation depth reaches as high as 1420 mm in some grids in pudong which is 750 mm higher than the maximum depth in the baseline simulation and the inundated area is more than doubled in comparison with the baseline even in mild increment scenario like sc 11 there are still some grids in the cbd region where the average 90th percentile water depth can be more than 1000 mm implying a high potential risk in the 2050s fig 5 3 2 the performance of solutions in reducing inundation to evaluate the performance of solutions in reducing inundation we re run the simulations of the 100 sampled scenarios based on the following five flood control solutions and their various combinations in the solution district drainage capacity enhancement drainage green area increase green deep tunnel with 30 runoff absorbed tun30 deep tunnel with 50 runoff absorbed tun50 deep tunnel with 70 runoff absorbed tun70 a performance evaluation based on average depth and average 90th percentile depth shows that 1 most of the solutions perform well in the mild increment cases e g sc 53 in which the solutions can wipe out the inundation water generally 2 in the worst rainfall increment cases e g sc 11 the performance of solutions varied from good to very poor 3 the depth reduction range of all solutions across the 100 rainfall scenarios is from 8 e g drainage in sc 11 to 98 9 e g tun50 drainage green tun30 and tun70 in sc 53 because of the heavy precipitation more than 140 mm in a short duration less than 3 h and in addition the decrease of the drainage capacity γ caused mainly by sea level rise and land subsidence the drainage improvement solution alone is unable to meaningfully reduce the water level in most cases especially in the worst cases a key aspect of the sponge city is to increase green area which can in turn increase the rainwater infiltration and residence time however increased green space alone does not perform well in the worst increment scenario as well the implementation of a deep tunnel solution shows an advantage in reducing the surface runoff especially during a rainfall peak by absorbing 30 50 and 70 of remaining runoff after the absorption in the baseline uim run by combining different solutions together we find that the combination of green area and drainage is able to improve the performance in the worst case scenario and the performance increases significantly once adding the deep tunnel solutions in the risk reduction rate rrr by a specific set of solutions from the risk level under an extreme rainfall scenario without adding any solution is calculated using eq 2 to determine the performance of this set of solutions fig 6 shows the rrrs of seven selected solutions green area increase ga drainage enhancement dr tun30 dr ga d g tun50 dr ga tun30 d g tun30 and tun70 under each of the 100 rainfall scenarios with reference to different level of γ the parameter featuring the uncertainties in the decreasing rate of existing drainage system capability caused by sea level rise land subsidence and other degradation factors fig 6 also shows the average inundation depth across the combinations of solution and rainfall scenarios at the given level of γ in fig 6 we can see that the average inundation depth increases almost linearly with the reduced drainage capacity γ and furthermore there is a strong negative correlation between the average inundation depth and the risk reduction rates of any given set of solutions when moving with γ in fact similar strong negative correlation also exists between the average inundation depth and risk reduction rate of any a given combination of solution and rainfall scenario when moving along the γ axis by contrast the correlation between future precipitation and the inundation depth is much weak this set of results indicates that drainage capacity decrease caused by sea level rise and land subsidence will play a dominant role in worsening future inundation risks in shanghai fig 7 displays the box plots of the rrr results over seven selected sets of solutions it shows that the rrr performances of the first two solutions i e drainage capacity enhancement and green area increase are the lowest in comparison with other solutions and are statistically similar the third and fourth solutions i e deep tunnel with 30 runoff absorbed and drainage enhancement green area expansion are able to reduce the inundation risk by a large margin on average but their performances are very dispersed with poor performances in the worst case scenarios the remaining three solutions i e deep tunnel with 50 runoff absorbed drainage enhancement green area expansion deep tunnel with 30 runoff absorbed and deep tunnel with 70 runoff absorbed are much better performers and the performances of the last two solutions are statistically reliable even in the worst case scenarios 3 3 cost effectiveness comparison table 1 presents the comparative cost structure of the five basic solutions the cost is accounted as the present value in 2013 rmb the annual average cost aac in the table indicates that the low impact solution of green area expansion has the lowest financial demand per year and the highest impact grey solution of tun70 has the highest financial demand per year respectively table 2 compares the cost effectiveness of the above five basic solutions and the two combinations of drainage enhancement green area expansion d g and drainage enhancement green area expansion deep tunnel with 30 runoff absorbed d g tun30 because the effectiveness measure in the comparison focuses on the risk reduction rate the comparison clearly puts higher values on the deep tunnel solutions of which tun50 has the highest effectiveness cost ratio if the criterion of solution choice is that the risk reduction rate should be at least 85 on average tun70 will have the highest effectiveness cost ratio 4 discussion this study has proposed a planning supporting tool which is capable of considering the entire cascade of factors from the uncertainties of future urban rainfall pattern and intensity to the physical and economic damages caused by extreme rainfall events and to the cost effectiveness comparison of plausible solutions the application of this synthesized trade off analysis tool to the case of the reoccurrence in the 2050s of the extreme rainfall event on 13 september 2013 in shanghai reveals a number of findings which are informative to urban planners and other stakeholders first the results show that drainage capacity decrease caused by sea level rise and land subsidence will contribute the most to the worsening of future inundation risk in shanghai in contrast future precipitation and urban rain island effect will have a relatively moderate contribution to the increase of the inundation depth and area this result is also indirectly supported by a real rainstorm event happened in june 2015 which caused severe inundation in central shanghai for days because high water level of rivers in the region prevented rainwater pumping from sewer systems into the river system this finding should have general implications for other coastal cities sitting on river mouth it means that it is important for urban planners in those cities to consider a scenario of a compound event in which an extreme storm surge under a sea level rise background takes place in an astronomical high tide period such an event would cause very severe flooding inside the city and bring disastrous impacts to avoid regret in the near future the mitigation and adaptation solutions should pay great attention to drainage standard increasing and drainage capacity strengthening which should be ahead of the pace of sea level raise plus land subsidence the cost effectiveness comparison in section 3 3 brings up an important decision making issue on the trade offs between the grey infrastructure and the green solutions the latter is usually known by varying names in different cultures e g low impact development lid in the us sustainable urban solutions suds in the uk and sponge city in china the grey infrastructure usually possesses better protection standards in reducing inundation risks associated with the low return period events but has a high level of negative impact on ecology and such negative impact is very difficult to be quantified in sharp contrast green solutions are typically effective in managing relatively high return period events but beneficial to the local environment and ecology and such benefits are very difficult to be measured by monetary value palmer et al 2015 because it is difficult to measure the negative impact of grey infrastructure and the positive benefits of green solutions to the environment planners typically under estimate both of them by a large margin in recognition of this limitation the solution of drainage enhancement green area expansion deep tunnel with 30 runoff absorbed d g tun30 becomes preferable to the solution of deep tunnel with 70 runoff absorbed tun70 given the integrative effect of d g tun30 in reducing urban inundation risk by 85 8 and in improving the local air quality and micro climate synthesized trade off analysis of flood control solutions under future deep uncertainty asks for consolidation of various sets of data from different sources and for decision making by the researchers in terms of solving conflicts across data sets and data sources finding proxies for missing data and identifying priorities and approximation margins in data model fusion process our decisions on these important issues were made jointly with local experts and policy makers in a knowledge co production process clark et al 2016 lempert et al 2013 liu et al 2019 usgcrp 2014 field surveys and focus group discussions were applied in the early stage of this work which provided very useful information for knowing about the current protection standards for illuminating the potential vulnerabilities and for selecting the right adaptation solutions opinions of experts from different infrastructure sectors and scientific fields and discussions with stakeholders and policy makers also gave us inspiration for this shanghai inundation application sun et al 2019 for instance expert opinions provided valuable insight for estimating the relationship between the drainage capacity and river water level and for using this relationship to approximate the drainage capacity decrease caused by sea level rise and land subsidence discussions with policy makers and other stakeholders enabled us to know better their interests and priorities which motivated our choices of solutions and key sources of uncertainties this knowledge co creation process also led to high trust in project results by policy makers the results of the work were delivered to local decision making authorities both the findings and the tool for the synthesized trade off analysis of flood control solutions under future deep uncertainty were well appreciated by the authorities with increased demand for wise and visionary decisions in dealing with the risk and uncertainties posed by future climate change there is an urgency to bridge the gap between the scientific research and practical applications although there is a myriad of research running flood risk simulations and assessments in shanghai and other mega cities in the coastal areas seldom can the detailed quantified solutions be digested by planners this work by integrating the simple but speedy scs cn based hydrological model into the framework of robust decision making under deep uncertainty provides a practical and instructive example for bridging this important gap 5 conclusion precipitation change in the future is subject to deep uncertainties especially in coastal mega cities like shanghai long term planning to manage flood risk caused by extreme rainfall events is challenged by uncertainty in precipitation change and also in socioeconomic changes and contested stakeholder priorities in this paper we have proposed an integrated framework for a synthesized trade off analysis of multiple flood control solutions under the condition of deep uncertainties we have demonstrated its operational ability with an application case study of central shanghai which focused on the reoccurrence in the 2050s of the extreme rainfall event on 13 september 2013 in the case study we considered three uncertain factors which include precipitation urban rain island effect and the decrease of urban drainage capacity caused by land subsidence and sea level rise we built future extreme inundation scenarios based on the plausible ranges of changes in the above three uncertain factors and randomly selected 100 scenarios by using the latin hyper cube lhc sampling method we then estimated the inundation depth and area of these 100 rainfall scenarios under the condition of both existing infrastructure reference runs and enhanced infrastructure by introducing alternative sets of inundation control solutions treated runs the inundation control solutions include the increase of public green area raising the standards of urban drainage system construction of deep tunnel with varying levels of capacity and the various combinations of the above basic solutions the direct physical losses were calculated for the 100 reference runs and also for all treated runs based on the depth damage curves the resultant large set of simulation results enabled us to calculate and then compare the risk reduction performances of all possible solutions in different rainfall scenarios two key results of these simulations and analyses are worth highlighting first drainage capacity decrease caused by sea level rise and land subsidence will play a dominant role in worsening future inundation in central shanghai this finding in combination with others urges future infrastructure planning in coastal cities to pay a great attention to the compound event of an extreme storm surge under a sea level rise background occurring in a period of astronomical high tide a no regret planning should be pro active by strengthening the drainage capacity well ahead of the pace of sea level raise plus land subsidence second although a performance comparison with a flooding risk reduction rate focus puts the solution of deep tunnel with 70 runoff absorbed tun70 ahead of drainage enhancement green area expansion deep tunnel with 30 runoff absorbed d g tun30 a consideration that the negative impact associated with deep tunnel construction on the environment and the environmental benefits of green areas are typically underestimated puts d g tun30 as the top choice which can reduce the future flood risk by 85 8 this example enriches the literature on the performance evaluations between grey e g traditional engineering structure and green solutions in mitigating urban flood risk with reference to financial and ecological benefits and costs the experience of this research suggests that a synthesized trade off analysis of alternative flood control solutions under future deep uncertainty cannot be accomplished by scientists alone and it must be a knowledge co creation process with decision makers and field experts such a knowledge co creation process can ensure useable science for decision making and lead to higher trust in project results by policy makers of course the advantage of our decision supporting tool in running comprehensive evaluations for thousand combinations of scenarios measures within one or a few days and with moderate demand for input data implies its disadvantage in lack of details at the grid cell level the second limitation is that the risk assessment in our work considered only the direct losses caused by inundation and ignored the indirect losses like interruptions to transportation and other urban functions and then the sequential chain effect across urban social and economic sectors declaration of competing interest the authors

18466,while the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process has been applied for nitrogen removal from high strength wastewater nitrate accumulation in effluent still represents a major concern here a novel process named the one stage pnam that integrates the partial nitritation pn anammox and methane dependent nitrite nitrate reduction reactions in a single membrane biofilm reactor mbfr is developed with feeding of 1030 mg nh4 n l at a hydraulic retention time of 16 h the proposed one stage pnam process achieved an average total nitrogen removal efficiency of 98 and a nitrogen removal

ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob anammox bacteria nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo bacteria and archaea co developed in the biofilm batch tests showed that aob anammox

2 03h2o offered a new nitrogen removal pathway consisting of partial nitritation pn and anaerobic ammonium oxidation mulder et al 1995 strous et al 1998 compared to the conventional nitrogen removal

stoichiometry with an optimal ammonium to nitrite molar ratio of 1 1 32 in feed the anammox process can maximally remove 89 of the total nitrogen tn with 11 of the n converted to nitrate theoretically strous et al 1998 in practice the effluent of full scale anammox based process usually contains nitrate in a broad range of 20 100 mg n l lackner et al 2014 depending on variations in influent ammonium and residual organic carbon concentrations for example jenni et al 2014 lan et al 2011 and zhang et al 2017 achieved tn removal efficiencies above 90 in anammox based reactors utilizing the high level organic carbon in the feed however other studies found it was difficult to maintain the balance between anammox bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifiers since the latter have much higher

al 2011 van kessel et al 2018 zhu et al 2011 recently the rates of n damo reactions have been increased by utilizing specific reactor configurations for example allegue et al 2018 obtained a high nitrite removal rate of 116 mg n l d in a membrane bioreactor mbr lopez et al 2017 achieved a nitrate removal rate of 400 mg n l d in a biogas based biotrickling filter cai et al 2015 and shi et al 2013 increased the nitrate removal rate to about 700 mg n l d in a membrane biofilm reactor mbfr in which methane was supplied through gas permeable hollow fiber membranes and the membrane surface also supported the growth of n damo organisms in biofilms in a more recent study a microbial consortium containing anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea was enriched in an mbfr to achieve nearly complete nitrogen removal from synthetic wastewater mimicking partially nitrified anaerobic digestion liquor 470 mg nh4 n l 560 mg no2 n l xie et al 2017 a tn removal rate of 1 kg m 3 d

5 mg no2 n l it should be noted that until now all n damo based reactors were operated as the second stage of nitrogen removal under strictly anaerobic condition xie et al 2017 2018 which required a first stage i e the pn process to generate feeding with an appropriate ratio between ammonium and nitrite compared with the two stage system the one stage configuration which couples aerobic and anaerobic processes in one single reactor entails the advantages including vlaeminck et al 2012 1 lower capital investment 2 less n2o emission and 3 mitigated nitrite inhibition risk these could explain why nearly 90 of the 100 full scale sidestream anammox systems surveyed were realized with an one stage configuration lackner et al 2014 despite such advantages the concept of integrating pn anammox and n damo processes into a single reactor i e in one stage has not been investigated experimentally to date while a modelling study demonstrated its feasibility chen et al 2016 the key challenge for this integration is associated with the fact that the n damo microorganisms can be inhibited by oxygen guerrero cruz et al 2018 kampman et al 2018 luesken et al 2012 thus it is of critical importance to control the oxygen flux precisely to maintain the activities of aerobic microbes aob and in the meantime to avoid the inhibition of anaerobic microbes n damo bacteria n damo archaea and anammox bacteria by oxygen the present work aims to experimentally investigate the feasibility to integrate pn anammox and n damo processes in a single mbfr hereafter called the pnam process a laboratory scale methane supplied mbfr fed with synthetic wastewater mimicking anaerobic sludge digestion liquor was set up and operated for over 700 days the reactor was initially operated under strictly anaerobic condition to build up biofilms coupling anammox and n damo reactions oxygen was then supplied at a controlled rate to cultivate the growth of aob in the biofilm thus achieving pn anammox and n damo reactions in a single biofilm eventually 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing were conducted to investigate the microbial community in particular to verify the presence of aob anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea in the biofilm a series of batch tests were performed to confirm their roles in the high level nitrogen removal achieved n2o emission was also monitored to assess the carbon footprint of this new process 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and setup as delineated in fig 1 an mbfr with a total volume of 60 ml was set up for this study the reactor was installed with one bunch of hollow fiber membrane module for methane delivery which took up a volume of 1 4 ml for fiber materials and 0 4 ml for fiber lumen this bundle of membrane comprised 260 non porous polypropylene hollow fibers teijin fibers ltd japan with a length of 30 cm and inner and outer diameters of 90 μm and 200 μm respectively giving rise to an area volume ratio of 816 m2 m3 the dead end membrane module was connected to a methane cylinder 95 ch4 and 5 co2 coregas australia through a gas gauge ross brown australia which was used to monitor and maintain the lumen pressure to be 200 kpa constantly the small reactor size was chosen based on safety considerations because methane is an explosive gas a smaller reactor required lower gas supply and storage the reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater supplied with a peristaltic pump masterflex l s usa from a 1 l feed tank in order to avoid any uncontrolled oxygen contamination a 2 l gas bag tedlar australia filled with nitrogen gas was connected to the feed tank the influent compositions are summarized in table 1 with trace elements in the growth medium table s1 according to ettwig et al 2009 the bulk liquid was recirculated by a peristaltic pump bt300 2j longer china passing through a 100 ml overflow bottle to provide mixing fig 1 the recirculation to influent flow ratio was 300 1 when the hydraulic retention time hrt was 48 h and 100 1 when hrt was 16 h see table 1 for hrt applied in different periods the overflow bottle was equipped with a ph meter oakton australia a do meter hach hq40d usa a liquid sampling point and a gas sampling point the ph was maintained at 7 0 0 5 by dosing 1 m hcl or 2 m naoh manually while acid dosing was required at 0 1 ml d in the two stage phase neither acid nor alkali was needed during the one stage phase see table 1 for different phases the temperature was controlled at 30 1 c with a precision immersion heater circulator th8000 ratek australia in addition an air stone was placed in the overflow bottle which was connected to a vacuum pump via an air flow meter to produce fine bubbles at controlled flowrates from day 466 the settling bottle was used to collect the washed out biomass the water seal bottle was used for gas and liquid releases while preventing air back diffusion into the reactor 2 2 operational strategies and conditions the operational strategies and conditions are summarized in table 1 initially the reactor was inoculated with 60 ml suspended culture volatile suspended solid vss 3 g l from a lab scale parent reactor consisting of anammox and n damo microorganisms on day 0 haroon et al 2013 afterwards the reactor was operated in batch mode for two weeks day 1 14 to avoid biomass wash out only stock solutions of ammonium chloride 46 g nh4 n l 1 and sodium nitrite 32 g no2 n l 1 were manually dosed into the reactor to maintain the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite in the range of 0 240 mg n l and 0 30 mg n l respectively in addition the wash out biomass 5 ml which settled at the bottom of the settling bottle was collected and manually returned to the reactor once every day for re attachment after the bulk liquid became clear implying most of the inoculated biomass attached to the membrane surface the reactor was operated with continuous feeding for about 400 days day 15 410 under strictly anaerobic condition without oxygen supply the synthetic wastewater mimicking the effluent of a sidestream pn reactor containing 500 mg nh4 n l 1 and 530 mg no2 n l 1 was fed into the reactor following the increase of nitrogen removal performance the hrt was stepwise decreased from 48 h to 16 h with tn loading rate increased from 0 5 to 1 5 kg m 3 d 1 based on the calculated nitrogen conversion rates the influent nitrite to ammonium ratio was increased to 1 39 on day 187 to achieve satisfactory effluent quality tn 10 mg n l on day 411 the mbfr was further inoculated with 60 ml suspended culture vss of 5 g l from a pilot scale pn reactor fed with anaerobic digestion liquor in the luggage point wastewater treatment plant wwtp australia following the second inoculation the reactor was operated in batch mode again for about three weeks to enable the suspended biomass to attach on the biofilm surface from day 431 the reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater continuously which contained 780 mg nh4 n l 1 and 250 mg no2 n l 1 nitrite was still supplied in influent to avoid insufficient substrate for anammox and n damo microorganisms on day 466 air was supplied to the reactor through overflow bottle for aob growth following the gradually enhanced ammonia oxidation rate the air flowrate was increased stepwise from 0 1 to 0 7 l d with the do concentration maintained in the range of 0 01 0 06 mg l on day 537 the influent was changed to 1030 mg nh4 n l 1 to mimic raw anaerobic sludge digestion liquor without nitrite the air flowrate was further increased to 1 2 l d on day 574 to provide more oxygen for ammonia oxidation giving rise to a do concentration of 0 02 0 10 mg l effluent samples 2 ml were taken two or three times per week to determine the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate three to five effluent samples 5 ml were also taken at the steady state of each operational condition for dissolved n2o and ch4 measurements biofilm samples were taken on day 0 125 254 and 385 two stage phase and on day 500 565 and 700 one stage phase for microbial community analysis details of the chemical analysis methods and microbial community characterization method i e 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing are described in supplementary information si 2 3 batch tests in order to confirm the active bio reactions in the developed biofilm six batch tests were conducted at the end of the one stage phase table 2 for batch tests a b and c methane supply from the hollow fiber was stopped and the dissolved methane was stripped by flushing the reactor with nitrogen gas for 20 min batch test a was designed to investigate the one stage pn anammox process without influence of methane with the initial ammonium concentration set to be 50 mg n l and the do concentration controlled at 0 2 0 05 mg l during the entire test similarly batch test b was used to investigate the nob activity with the initial nitrite adjusted to 50 mg n l and do controlled at 0 2 0 05 mg l batch test c was used to test the anammox activity under anaerobic condition with the initial ammonium and nitrite concentrations both adjusted to 50 mg n l the methane supply from membrane was also stopped for batch tests d e and f however at the beginning of each test the reactor was flushed with methane gas 95 ch4 5 co2 for 20 min leading to an initial dissolved methane concentration about 18 mg ch4 l batch tests d and e were designed to examine the activities of n damo bacteria and n damo archaea with an initial spiking of nitrite and nitrate at 50 mg n l respectively no aeration was supplied in these two tests in batch test f the reactor was spiked with ammonium at 50 mg n l with do controlled at 0 2 0 05 mg l with simultaneous presences of ammonium dissolved methane and oxygen this test was designed to investigate the one stage pn anammox n damo process in each test liquid samples were taken at 0 5 10 15 20 30 40 and 60 min to determine the concentrations of nitrogen species and dissolved methane 3 results 3 1 two stage nitrogen removal by anammox n damo process the mbfr was established and operated for 711 days including two inoculation phases day 1 14 and day 411 430 the two stage phase day 15 410 and the one stage phase day 431 711 upon the first inoculation both the ammonium and nitrite removal rates increased gradually in the 2 week batch mode reaching about 200 mg n l d and 300 mg n l d respectively data not shown afterwards the mbfr was fed with synthetic wastewater continuously at hrt of 48 h day 14 from day 15 to day 186 the average effluent nitrite and nitrate concentrations were 0 8 mg n l and 3 0 mg n l respectively while the effluent ammonium concentration decreased gradually from about 450 to 80 mg n l fig 2 a indicating the enhanced activities of anammox bacteria following the decrease of hrt from 36 h to 30 h day 27 24 h day 55 and 16 h day 114 the effluent ammonium concentration increased immediately and then decreased gradually to a steady level in one month fig 2a due to the residual ammonium in effluent the influent nitrite to ammonium ratio was elevated from 1 06 to 1 39 on day 187 to improve ammonium removal following this change the effluent ammonium quickly dropped to below 1 0 mg n l on day 193 however the effluent nitrate concentration increased to 22 3 mg n l and then gradually decreased to below 10 mg n l on day 368 giving rise to a tn removal efficiency of above 99 at the final period fig 2b at the end of the two stage phase day 368 410 the ammonium and nitrite removal rates reached 0 6 and 0 9 kg n m 3 d 1 respectively fig 2b the species specific nitrogen conversion rates by each of the three key reactions were calculated based on the methods described in si and presented in fig 2c the anammox reaction was responsible for the most 80 of nitrite removal while n damo bacteria contributed to less than 20 fig 2c specifically the nitrite removal rate of n damo bacteria fluctuated around 200 mg n l d during the entire experiment while the nitrate removal rate of n damo archaea gradually increased from 10 mg n l d to 170 mg n l d in addition the nitrate production rate of anammox bacteria and the nitrate removal rate of n damo archaea followed the same trend fig 2c indicating the nitrate was the limited factor for n damo archaea growth in this period 3 2 one stage nitrogen removal by pn anammox n damo pnam process on day 411 the mbfr was inoculated with enriched aob from a sidestream pn reactor and operated in batch mode for three weeks for biofilm attachment data not shown afterwards the mbfr was fed with synthetic wastewater continuously at an hrt of 16 h for about 300 days with gradually increased aeration fig 3 in order to provide sufficient nitrite for anammox and n damo reactions the feeding comprised of 780 mg nh4 n l and 250 mg no2 n l initially day 431 532 fig 3a during day 431 465 the reactor was operated under anaerobic condition with no air supply in order to avoid any potential inhibition fig 3c therefore the effluent ammonium concentration in this period remained to be 600 mg n l while the nitrite and nitrate concentrations were both below 10 mg n l fig 3a from day 466 the reactor was provided with air with a flowrate of 0 1 l d and the do concentration varied around 0 01 mg l fig 3c the effluent ammonium concentration decreased immediately to 500 mg n l on day 479 with constant nitrite and nitrate concentrations below 5 mg n l correspondingly the ammonium removal rate increased by 50 reaching 420 mg n l d fig 3b further the air flowrate was gradually elevated from 0 1 l d to 0 4 l d day 480 0 5 l d day 500 and 0 7 l d day 516 fig 3c following each increase of air flowrate the effluent ammonium concentration decreased immediately and remained at a steady level until the next aeration increase fig 3a indicating the enhanced activities of aob from day 520 to day 530 the effluent ammonium concentration fluctuated around 70 mg n l while the effluent nitrite and nitrate concentrations kept below 10 mg n l meanwhile the ammonium removal rate increased to 1065 mg n l d on day 515 with an ammonium removal efficiency above 91 achieved fig 3b on day 533 the influent ammonium concentration was increased to 1030 mg nh4 n l to mimic the raw anaerobic sludge digestion liquor while nitrite was no longer supplied in the feed fig 3a following this change the effluent ammonium concentration increased immediately to 235 5 mg n l in one month fig 3a indicating that the aob activity was a limiting factor therefore the air flowrate was elevated to 1 2 l d on day 574 and the average do concentration increased to 0 07 mg l fig 3c afterwards the effluent ammonium concentration decreased to 11 5 mg n l in one week and remained below 50 mg n l stably in the rest of experiment fig 3a notably the effluent nitrite and nitrate concentrations were constantly below 10 mg n l from day 574 to day 711 both ammonium and tn removal rates varied in the range of 1490 1540 mg n l d giving rise to an average removal efficiency of 98 fig 3b additionally the dissolved n2o concentration in effluent during day 574 711 was measured to be 0 29 0 002 mg n2o l fig s3 and the n2o emission was calculated to be 0 34 0 01 due to the low abundance of nob 0 1 in fig s2d as well as the low nob activity measured in the batch tests discussed in the next section the nitrite oxidation by nob was negligible thus the species specific nitrogen conversion rates of aob anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea were calculated as described in si and presented in fig 4 following every air flowrate increase from 0 to 0 7 l d the ammonia oxidization rate by aob increased immediately and maintained stable until the next aeration increase on day 533 an increase of aob activity from 600 mg n l d to 750 mg n l d was observed after changing the influent composition on day 574 the ammonia oxidation rate by aob further increased to 900 mg n l d and remained stable during the rest of experiment because the nitrogen removal rates by anammox and n damo reactions highly depended on the aerobic ammonia oxidation the nitrite removal rate by anammox reaction and n damo bacteria and the nitrate removal rate by n damo archaea followed the same treads to the aob activity fig 4 3 3 batch test results in order to elucidate the active bioreactions a series of batch tests were conducted at the end of the one stage phase fig 5 for batch a fed with ammonium and oxygen the ammonium concentration decreased from 48 9 mg n l to almost 0 mg n l in 1 h with nitrate accumulation of 4 8 mg n l and nitrite fluctuating around 1 mg n l fig 5a the nitrate production represented about 9 5 of the ammonium converted which was in line with the theoretical value 11 from anammox reaction reaction 1 indicating the active aob and anammox reactions this result also indicated negligible nob activities as otherwise nitrate production would be higher than 11 the reactor was fed with nitrite and oxygen for batch b in which the nitrite concentration decreased from 49 9 mg n l to 42 2 mg n l with slightly nitrate accumulation of 4 6 mg n l fig 5b indicating the existence of nob and heterotrophic denitrification driven by cell lysate as no organic carbon was provided for batch c fed with ammonium and nitrite under anaerobic condition the accumulated nitrate 5 9 mg n l represented 8 9 of the nitrogen removed while the consumed nitrite to ammonium ratio was 1 35 which was slightly higher than the theoretical ratio of 1 32 fig 5c these results further confirmed the anammox reaction and also indicated the minor contribution by heterotrophic denitrification to nitrite or nitrate consumption the reactor was fed with methane and nitrite or methane and nitrate for batch d and e respectively in which the simultaneous consumptions of methane and nitrite nitrate were clearly observed fig 5d and e the ratio of nitrite reduction rate to methane oxidation rate in batch d was determined to be 2 89 which was 24 higher than the theoretical value 2 33 based on n damo bacteria reaction reaction 2 similarly the ratio of nitrogen removal rate to methane oxidation rate in batch e was determined to be 1 83 also 31 higher than the theoretical value 1 40 based on n damo bacteria and n damo archaea reactions reaction 2 and 3 these observations indicated the active activities of n damo bacteria and n damo archaea in the biofilm the additional nitrate and nitrite consumption in batch d e could be due to heterotrophic denitrification moreover compared with batch a there was no nitrate accumulation in batch f with methane available fig 5f which again supported that n damo archaea contributed to the nitrate removal in the biofilm the batch tests results were further analyzed using the mass balance method detailed in table s2 of supplementary information with results summarized in table 3 the ammonium oxidation rates in batch a f were very similar at 685 mg n l d and 686 mg n l d respectively indicating strong aob activities despite of a low oxygen concentration of 0 2 0 05 mg l in comparison the nitrite oxidation rate estimated for batch b 110 185 mg n l d was 1 7 2 9 times that in batch a this is likely because nitrite was in excess in batch b while at negligible levels in batch a as a result of nitrite consumption by anammox bacteria these results indicate that nob made minor contribution to the nitrogen conversions under normal operating conditions i e low do and low nitrite the anammox activity was considerably higher in batch c 953 mg no2 n l d than in batch a 604 mg no2 n l d and batch f 631 mg no2 n l d suggesting that the anammox activities were limited by nitrite in the latter two cases the n damo bacterial activity was higher in batch d where nitrite was in excess than in batch e f when nitrite was rate limiting suggesting that the n damo bacteria contribution to nitrogen conversions during the normal operation of the mbfr was limited by the low level nitrite similarly the n damo archaeal activity was higher in batch e than in batch f also suggesting that the n damo archaeal activity in the mbfr would normally be limited by the availability of nitrate the mass balance analysis also allowed the estimation of nitrogen loss by heterotrophic denitrification in batch b e 59 74 mg n l d table 3 these rates are an order of magnitude lower than other reaction rates while the heterotrophic denitrification rates could not be determined for batch a f the nitrogen loss by heterotrophic denitrification in these cases as well as during the normal operation of the mbfr should be much less than the values estimated for batch b e due to the lower nitrite and nitrate levels these results indicate that heterotrophic denitrification should have a limited contribution 5 to the total nitrogen removal in the mbfr 4 discussion 4 1 a one stage pnam process in this study a high level nitrogen removal from synthetic sidestream wastewater was achieved by coupling aob anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea in a single reactor although the use of anammox and n damo microorganisms for removing nitrogen from partially nitrified sidestream wastewater 500 mg nh4 n l 500 mg no2 n l under strictly anaerobic condition was demonstrated previously xie et al 2017 this is the first study successfully coupling aerobic process aob with these anaerobic processes anammox and n damo microorganisms in one single reactor fed with ammonium 1030 mg nh4 n l as the only nitrogen source an average tn removal efficiency of 98 was achieved which is the best effluent quality reported in literature for this ammonium rich wastewater meng et al 2019 szatkowska et al 2007 in addition the nitrogen removal rate obtained in the present study is 1 5 kg n m3 d 1 5 times that achieved in the previous two stage system xie et al 2017 this could be due to the higher area to volume ratio 816 m2 m3 used in this study compared to the previous study 491 m2 m3 xie et al 2017 the activity of the suspended biomass in bulk liquid is determined to be negligible which is supported by the very low vss concentration of 0 005 0 001 g l therefore the areal rate is estimated to be 1 8 g n m2 d it is recognized that the rate was achieved in a small reactor where the reactor wall surface represented 30 of the membrane surface the areal rate reduces to 1 4 g n m2 d when the reactor wall is also considered the one stage pn anammox process has been widely used to treat high strength wastewater lackner et al 2014 however the effluent in most cases cannot meet the discharge standard and requires further polishing the involvement of n damo reactions in the proposed one stage pnam process enables to enhance the effluent quality specifically during the steady state of the one stage phase n damo archaea removed more than 99 of the nitrate produced by anammox bacteria leading to an effluent nitrate concentration below 10 mg n l fig 3a in addition the applied do concentration 0 1 mg l showed no inhibition on anammox or n damo organisms because their rates were similar in one stage with aeration fig 4 and two stage without aeration fig 2c phases it is well known that significant amount of n2o could be generated during biological nitrogen removal kampschreur et al 2009 law et al 2012 which is a potent greenhouse gas and an ozone depleting compound the n2o emission factor calculated for the proposed process was 0 34 0 01 which is in the range 0 1 4 6 reported for one stage pn anammox systems castro barros et al 2015 connan et al 2018 domingo felez et al 2014 hu et al 2013 joss et al 2009 kampschreur et al 2009 sliekers et al 2002 yang et al 2013 given the fact that there is no confirmed n2o production pathway in anammox or n damo reactions ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 kartal et al 2007 it can be assumed that this n2o production was more likely related to the aob metabolism duan et al 2017 hu et al 2013 additionally procedures to safely manage the production and utilization of biogas methane are well established in wwtps these lay the technical foundation for methane management in the proposed process also the mbfr was designed and operated in such a way that a gaseous mixture of methane and oxygen is avoided methane was supplied from hollow fiber membranes to the biofilm matrix while air was delivered to the bulk liquid phase through an aeration system external to the mbfr such separate deliveries of methane and air can sufficiently prevent the explosion risk it is recognized that this study was conducted in a small reactor 60 ml using synthetic feed experiments at larger scales and with real wastewater are clearly needed to investigate the application potential of this novel process hydrodynamic conditions in larger bioreactors are likely different from that in a 60 ml reactor which could affect mass transfer and biofilm development real wastewater likely has contaminants e g residual organic compounds inhibitory compounds and also residual biomass which could all interfere with biofilm development and in biofilm microbial reactions a further limitation of the study was the use of synthetic biogas with a high methane fraction 95 ch4 5 co2 in comparison real biogas contains ch4 and co2 at considerably lower 60 and higher 40 levels respectively and may also contain other gases e g h2s at trace levels ariunbaatar et al 2014 the reduced ch4 level will likely adversely affect its transfer to the biofilm while the elevated level of co2 is expected to cause acidification of the bioreactor both pose significant challenges to the reactor design and operation thus requiring further investigation the presence of other gases will likely support the development of other microorganisms in the biofilm further complicating the microbial community lopez et al 2017 this aspect also requires further experimental studies 4 2 ecological model connecting nitrogen and carbon conversions the microbial analysis clearly showed the co existence of aob anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea in the mbfr biofilm fig s1 their activities are confirmed by both the long term performance fig 3 and the batch tests fig 5 based on the substrate availability and the known microbial functions a conceptual ecological model is established to delineate the microbial interactions in the stratified biofilm fig 6 firstly aerobic microorganisms aob and nob partially convert ammonium to nitrite major and nitrate minor since the oxygen is supplied from the bulk liquid it is speculated that the aerobic reactions more likely occur at the biofilm surface which is in line with the observation in granular one stage pn anammox systems ali et al 2016 liu et al 2017 vlaeminck et al 2010 further the produced nitrite is removed by anammox bacteria with ammonium or by n damo bacteria with methane the nitrate produced by anammox bacteria and nob is reduced to nitrite by n damo archaea due to the availability of methane from the lumen of hollow fiber it is speculated that n damo bacteria and n damo archaea would dominate the inner layer as also predicted by a modelling study chen et al 2016 unfortunately with the current reactor design for a proof of concept study 60 ml in volume it was difficult to take intact biofilm samples to confirm this microbial stratification this aspect should be considered in future reactor designs suppression of nob is the critical step for short cut nitrogen removal which is even more difficult in the one stage system jaroszynski and oleszkiewicz 2011 in the present system both anammox bacteria and n damo bacteria competed for nitrite with nob in addition the low do concentration 0 1 mg l applied also limited the activities of nob although nitrospira nob less than 0 1 was detected in the biofilm fig s2d batch tests showed that the range of nitrite oxidation rate by nob was 110 185 mg n l d table 3 even in the absence of ammonium and methane i e in the absence of competition for nitrite by anammox and n damo bacteria this is far lower than the nitrite consumption rate by anammox bacteria 953 mg n l d and n damo bacteria 296 mg n l d measured in similar batch tests table 3 it is also far lower than the aob activity 685 686 mg n l d measured in the batch tests table 3 in fact in batch a with low level nitrite accumulation 1 mg n l the nitrite oxidation rate by nob was estimated to be 63 mg n l d table 3 this rate is likely more representative of nob activity during the normal mbfr operation it should also be noted the presence of n damo archaea which can convert nitrate back to nitrite also makes nob suppression less critical the strictly controlled oxygen flux and counter diffusion of oxygen from biofilm surface to biofilm base and methane from biofilm base to biofilm surface were likely responsible for the low presence of aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria in the biofilm during the entire experiment the relative abundances of known aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria e g methylocystis methylococcus methylomonas methylophilus and methylobacter were all below 0 002 in contrast anaerobic methanotrophs i e n damo bacteria and n damo archaea were abundant in the biofilm fig s1 likely in the inner part of the biofilm fig 6 it is possible that aerobic methanotrophs failed to compete with anaerobic methanotrophs for methane in the inner layer of biofilms due to the lack or low presence of oxygen and failed to compete with aob for oxygen in the outer layer of the biofilm due to the limited supply of methane in fact the oxygen flux rate at steady state 3200 200 mg o2 l d was well matched with the oxygen required for ammonia oxidation by aob 3100 30 mg o2 l d suggesting limited oxygen was available for aerobic methanotrophs it is worthwhile to note that known organisms belonging to aob nob anammox and n damo organisms only represented about 30 of the microbial communities in the biofilm fig s1 while other members comprised approximately 70 of the community this raises the question about their respective roles in the bioreactor 1 can the above listed functional groups at the measured abundances be solely responsible for the measured nitrogen and methane conversions 2 what are the roles of the 70 other members and what do they live on in the biofilm the data obtained in this study do not provide full answers to these questions supplementary information future research is needed to elucidate roles of the side populations the ecological model of anammox system has been well studied by using meta omics guo et al 2016 lawson et al 2017 speth et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 for example speth et al 2016 used metagenomics to build a genome based ecological model for a full scale pna reactor guo et al 2016 highlighted the important role of sludge aggregate type on the microbial community of anammox reactors based on metagenomics lawson et al 2017 elucidated the functions of heterotrophs and their interactions with anammox by both metagenomics and metatranscriptomics zhao et al 2018 revealed multiple potential cross feeding during start up of an anammox reactor according to metagenomics moreover a more complicated ecological model was established to mimic estuary or brackish sediment conditions which included both anammox and n damo microorganisms arshad et al 2017 compared to these studies the established biofilm in the present study further expands the microbial community with aerobic microorganisms aob which warrants further studies in addition it is also worthwhile to investigate the micro scale substrate profiles inside the biofilm matrix in order to elucidate the correlation between substrate concentrations and microbial activities 5 conclusions in this study a new process named one stage pnam by integrating aob anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea in a single biofilm was developed in a lab scale mbfr to remove nitrogen from synthetic anaerobic sludge digestion liquor the major conclusions and outcomes include it is possible to achieve high level nitrogen removal from anaerobic sludge digestion in a methane and oxygen supplied mbfr by integrating partial nitritation anammox and n damo reactions fed with synthetic anaerobic digestion liquor 1030 mg nh4 n l an average tn removal efficiency of 98 was achieved in this proof of concept study at a rate of 1 5 kg n m3 d however it should be noted that the performance was achieved in a small reactor 60 ml with synthetic wastewater studies at larger scales and with real wastewater are needed to verify the performance under more realistic conditions the one stage pnam process emits n2o with an emission factor 0 34 0 01 observed this study similar to anammox bacteria n damo microorganisms while being sensitive to oxygen can grow in biofilms in the presence of low levels of oxygen 0 1 mg l in this study likely residing in the deep layer of the biofilms declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

18466,while the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process has been applied for nitrogen removal from high strength wastewater nitrate accumulation in effluent still represents a major concern here a novel process named the one stage pnam that integrates the partial nitritation pn anammox and methane dependent nitrite nitrate reduction reactions in a single membrane biofilm reactor mbfr is developed with feeding of 1030 mg nh4 n l at a hydraulic retention time of 16 h the proposed one stage pnam process achieved an average total nitrogen removal efficiency of 98 and a nitrogen removal rate of 1 5 kg n m3 d 1 4 1 8 g n m2 d by using methane as the sole carbon based electron donor the n2o emission was determined to be 0 34 0 01 microbial community characterization revealed that ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob anammox bacteria nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo bacteria and archaea co developed in the biofilm batch tests showed that aob anammox bacteria and n damo microorganisms were indeed jointly responsible for the nitrogen removal this one stage pnam process can potentially be applied to treating high strength wastewater such as anaerobic sludge digestion liquor or landfill leachate graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox anaerobic methane oxidation n damo sidestream one stage membrane biofilm reactor 1 introduction

anammox pna has been widely used to treat wastewater streams containing high levels of nitrogen e g anaerobic sludge digestion liquor 500 1500 mg n l lackner et al 2014 based on the reaction stoichiometry with an optimal ammonium to nitrite molar ratio of 1 1 32 in feed the anammox process can maximally remove 89 of the total nitrogen tn with 11 of the n converted to nitrate theoretically strous et al 1998 in practice the effluent of full scale anammox based process usually contains nitrate in a broad range of 20 100 mg n l lackner et al 2014 depending on variations in influent ammonium and residual organic carbon concentrations for example jenni et al 2014 lan et al 2011 and zhang et al 2017 achieved tn removal efficiencies above 90 in anammox based reactors utilizing the high level organic carbon in the feed however other studies found it was difficult to maintain the balance between anammox bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifiers since the latter have much higher

al 2011 van kessel et al 2018 zhu et al 2011 recently the rates of n damo reactions have been increased by utilizing specific reactor configurations for example allegue et al 2018 obtained a high nitrite removal rate of 116 mg n l d in a membrane bioreactor mbr lopez et al 2017 achieved a nitrate removal rate of 400 mg n l d in a biogas based biotrickling filter cai et al 2015 and shi et al 2013 increased the nitrate removal rate to about 700 mg n l d in a membrane biofilm reactor mbfr in which methane was supplied through gas permeable hollow fiber membranes and the membrane surface also supported the growth of n damo organisms in biofilms in a more recent study a microbial consortium containing anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea was enriched in an mbfr to achieve nearly complete nitrogen removal from synthetic wastewater mimicking partially nitrified anaerobic digestion liquor 470 mg nh4 n l 560 mg no2 n l xie et al 2017 a tn removal rate of 1 kg m 3 d 1 was achieved with an effluent tn concentration below 10 mg n l further xie et al 2018 extended this process to achieve high level nitrogen removal from domestic strength wastewater 22 mg nh4 n l 29 5 mg no2 n l it should be noted that until now all n damo based reactors were operated as the second stage of nitrogen removal under strictly anaerobic condition xie et al 2017 2018 which required a first stage i e the pn process to generate feeding with an appropriate ratio between ammonium and nitrite compared with the two stage system the one stage configuration which couples aerobic and anaerobic processes in one single reactor entails the advantages including vlaeminck et al 2012 1 lower capital investment 2 less n2o emission and 3 mitigated nitrite inhibition risk these could explain why nearly 90 of the 100 full scale sidestream anammox systems surveyed were realized with an one stage configuration lackner et al 2014 despite such advantages the concept of integrating pn anammox and n damo processes into a single reactor i e in one stage has not been investigated experimentally to date while a modelling study demonstrated its feasibility chen et al 2016 the key challenge for this integration is associated with the fact that the n damo microorganisms can be inhibited by oxygen guerrero cruz et al 2018 kampman et al 2018 luesken et al 2012 thus it is of critical importance to control the oxygen flux precisely to maintain the activities of aerobic microbes aob and in the meantime to avoid the inhibition of anaerobic microbes n damo bacteria n damo archaea and anammox bacteria by oxygen the present work aims to experimentally investigate the feasibility to integrate pn anammox and n damo processes in a single mbfr hereafter called the pnam process a laboratory scale methane supplied mbfr fed with synthetic wastewater mimicking anaerobic sludge digestion liquor was set up and operated for over 700 days the reactor was initially operated under strictly anaerobic condition to build up biofilms coupling anammox and n damo reactions oxygen was then supplied at a controlled rate to cultivate the growth of aob in the biofilm thus achieving pn anammox and n damo reactions in a single biofilm eventually 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing were conducted to investigate the microbial community in particular to verify the presence of aob anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea in the biofilm a series of batch tests were performed to confirm their roles in the high level nitrogen removal achieved n2o emission was also monitored to assess the carbon footprint of this new process 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and setup as delineated in fig 1 an mbfr with a total volume of 60 ml was set up for this study the reactor was installed with one bunch of hollow fiber membrane module for methane delivery which took up a volume of 1 4 ml for fiber materials and 0 4 ml for fiber lumen this bundle of membrane comprised 260 non porous polypropylene hollow fibers teijin fibers ltd japan with a length of 30 cm and inner and outer diameters of 90 μm and 200 μm respectively giving rise to an area volume ratio of 816 m2 m3 the dead end membrane module was connected to a methane cylinder 95 ch4 and 5 co2 coregas australia through a gas gauge ross brown australia which was used to monitor and maintain the lumen pressure to be 200 kpa constantly the small reactor size was chosen based on safety considerations because methane is an explosive gas a smaller reactor required lower gas supply and storage the reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater supplied with a peristaltic pump masterflex l s usa from a 1 l feed tank in order to avoid any uncontrolled oxygen contamination a 2 l gas bag tedlar australia filled with nitrogen gas was connected to the feed tank the influent compositions are summarized in table 1 with trace elements in the growth medium table s1 according to ettwig et al 2009 the bulk liquid was recirculated by a peristaltic pump bt300 2j longer china passing through a 100 ml overflow bottle to provide mixing fig 1 the recirculation to influent flow ratio was 300 1 when the hydraulic retention time hrt was 48 h and 100 1 when hrt was 16 h see table 1 for hrt applied in different periods the overflow bottle was equipped with a ph meter oakton australia a do meter hach hq40d usa a liquid sampling point and a gas sampling point the ph was maintained at 7 0 0 5 by dosing 1 m hcl or 2 m naoh manually while acid dosing was required at 0 1 ml d in the two stage phase neither acid nor alkali was needed during the one stage phase see table 1 for different phases the temperature was controlled at 30 1 c with a precision immersion heater circulator th8000 ratek australia in addition an air stone was placed in the overflow bottle which was connected to a vacuum pump via an air flow meter to produce fine bubbles at controlled flowrates from day 466 the settling bottle was used to collect the washed out biomass the water seal bottle was used for gas and liquid releases while preventing air back diffusion into the reactor 2 2 operational strategies and conditions the operational strategies and conditions are summarized in table 1 initially the reactor was inoculated with 60 ml suspended culture volatile suspended solid vss 3 g l from a lab scale parent reactor consisting of anammox and n damo microorganisms on day 0 haroon et al 2013 afterwards the reactor was operated in batch mode for two weeks day 1 14 to avoid biomass wash out only stock solutions of ammonium chloride 46 g nh4 n l 1 and sodium nitrite 32 g no2 n l 1 were manually dosed into the reactor to maintain the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite in the range of 0 240 mg n l and 0 30 mg n l respectively in addition the wash out biomass 5 ml which settled at the bottom of the settling bottle was collected and manually returned to the reactor once every day for re attachment after the bulk liquid became clear implying most of the inoculated biomass attached to the membrane surface the reactor was operated with continuous feeding for about 400 days day 15 410 under strictly anaerobic condition without oxygen supply the synthetic wastewater mimicking the effluent of a sidestream pn reactor containing 500 mg nh4 n l 1 and 530 mg no2 n l 1 was fed into the reactor following the increase of nitrogen removal performance the hrt was stepwise decreased from 48 h to 16 h with tn loading rate increased from 0 5 to 1 5 kg m 3 d 1 based on the calculated nitrogen conversion rates the influent nitrite to ammonium ratio was increased to 1 39 on day 187 to achieve satisfactory effluent quality tn 10 mg n l on day 411 the mbfr was further inoculated with 60 ml suspended culture vss of 5 g l from a pilot scale pn reactor fed with anaerobic digestion liquor in the luggage point wastewater treatment plant wwtp australia following the second inoculation the reactor was operated in batch mode again for about three weeks to enable the suspended biomass to attach on the biofilm surface from day 431 the reactor was fed with synthetic wastewater continuously which contained 780 mg nh4 n l 1 and 250 mg no2 n l 1 nitrite was still supplied in influent to avoid insufficient substrate for anammox and n damo microorganisms on day 466 air was supplied to the reactor through overflow bottle for aob growth following the gradually enhanced ammonia oxidation rate the air flowrate was increased stepwise from 0 1 to 0 7 l d with the do concentration maintained in the range of 0 01 0 06 mg l on day 537 the influent was changed to 1030 mg nh4 n l 1 to mimic raw anaerobic sludge digestion liquor without nitrite the air flowrate was further increased to 1 2 l d on day 574 to provide more oxygen for ammonia oxidation giving rise to a do concentration of 0 02 0 10 mg l effluent samples 2 ml were taken two or three times per week to determine the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate three to five effluent samples 5 ml were also taken at the steady state of each operational condition for dissolved n2o and ch4 measurements biofilm samples were taken on day 0 125 254 and 385 two stage phase and on day 500 565 and 700 one stage phase for microbial community analysis details of the chemical analysis methods and microbial community characterization method i e 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing are described in supplementary information si 2 3 batch tests in order to confirm the active bio reactions in the developed biofilm six batch tests were conducted at the end of the one stage phase table 2 for batch tests a b and c methane supply from the hollow fiber was stopped and the dissolved methane was stripped by flushing the reactor with nitrogen gas for 20 min batch test a was designed to investigate the one stage pn anammox process without influence of methane with the initial ammonium concentration set to be 50 mg n l and the do concentration controlled at 0 2 0 05 mg l during the entire test similarly batch test b was used to investigate the nob activity with the initial nitrite adjusted to 50 mg n l and do controlled at 0 2 0 05 mg l batch test c was used to test the anammox activity under anaerobic condition with the initial ammonium and nitrite concentrations both adjusted to 50 mg n l the methane supply from membrane was also stopped for batch tests d e and f however at the beginning of each test the reactor was flushed with methane gas 95 ch4 5 co2 for 20 min leading to an initial dissolved methane concentration about 18 mg ch4 l batch tests d and e were designed to examine the activities of n damo bacteria and n damo archaea with an initial spiking of nitrite and nitrate at 50 mg n l respectively no aeration was supplied in these two tests in batch test f the reactor was spiked with ammonium at 50 mg n l with do controlled at 0 2 0 05 mg l with simultaneous presences of ammonium dissolved methane and oxygen this test was designed to investigate the one stage pn anammox n damo process in each test liquid samples were taken at 0 5 10 15 20 30 40 and 60 min to determine the concentrations of nitrogen species and dissolved methane 3 results 3 1 two stage nitrogen removal by anammox n damo process the mbfr was established and operated for 711 days including two inoculation phases day 1 14 and day 411 430 the two stage phase day 15 410 and the one stage phase day 431 711 upon the first inoculation both the ammonium and nitrite removal rates increased gradually in the 2 week batch mode reaching about 200 mg n l d and 300 mg n l d respectively data not shown afterwards the mbfr was fed with synthetic wastewater continuously at hrt of 48 h day 14 from day 15 to day 186 the average effluent nitrite and nitrate concentrations were 0 8 mg n l and 3 0 mg n l respectively while the effluent ammonium concentration decreased gradually from about 450 to 80 mg n l fig 2 a indicating the enhanced activities of anammox bacteria following the decrease of hrt from 36 h to 30 h day 27 24 h day 55 and 16 h day 114 the effluent ammonium concentration increased immediately and then decreased gradually to a steady level in one month fig 2a due to the residual ammonium in effluent the influent nitrite to ammonium ratio was elevated from 1 06 to 1 39 on day 187 to improve ammonium removal following this change the effluent ammonium quickly dropped to below 1 0 mg n l on day 193 however the effluent nitrate concentration increased to 22 3 mg n l and then gradually decreased to below 10 mg n l on day 368 giving rise to a tn removal efficiency of above 99 at the final period fig 2b at the end of the two stage phase day 368 410 the ammonium and nitrite removal rates reached 0 6 and 0 9 kg n m 3 d 1 respectively fig 2b the species specific nitrogen conversion rates by each of the three key reactions were calculated based on the methods described in si and presented in fig 2c the anammox reaction was responsible for the most 80 of nitrite removal while n damo bacteria contributed to less than 20 fig 2c specifically the nitrite removal rate of n damo bacteria fluctuated around 200 mg n l d during the entire experiment while the nitrate removal rate of n damo archaea gradually increased from 10 mg n l d to 170 mg n l d in addition the nitrate production rate of anammox bacteria and the nitrate removal rate of n damo archaea followed the same trend fig 2c indicating the nitrate was the limited factor for n damo archaea growth in this period 3 2 one stage nitrogen removal by pn anammox n damo pnam process on day 411 the mbfr was inoculated with enriched aob from a sidestream pn reactor and operated in batch mode for three weeks for biofilm attachment data not shown afterwards the mbfr was fed with synthetic wastewater continuously at an hrt of 16 h for about 300 days with gradually increased aeration fig 3 in order to provide sufficient nitrite for anammox and n damo reactions the feeding comprised of 780 mg nh4 n l and 250 mg no2 n l initially day 431 532 fig 3a during day 431 465 the reactor was operated under anaerobic condition with no air supply in order to avoid any potential inhibition fig 3c therefore the effluent ammonium concentration in this period remained to be 600 mg n l while the nitrite and nitrate concentrations were both below 10 mg n l fig 3a from day 466 the reactor was provided with air with a flowrate of 0 1 l d and the do concentration varied around 0 01 mg l fig 3c the effluent ammonium concentration decreased immediately to 500 mg n l on day 479 with constant nitrite and nitrate concentrations below 5 mg n l correspondingly the ammonium removal rate increased by 50 reaching 420 mg n l d fig 3b further the air flowrate was gradually elevated from 0 1 l d to 0 4 l d day 480 0 5 l d day 500 and 0 7 l d day 516 fig 3c following each increase of air flowrate the effluent ammonium concentration decreased immediately and remained at a steady level until the next aeration increase fig 3a indicating the enhanced activities of aob from day 520 to day 530 the effluent ammonium concentration fluctuated around 70 mg n l while the effluent nitrite and nitrate concentrations kept below 10 mg n l meanwhile the ammonium removal rate increased to 1065 mg n l d on day 515 with an ammonium removal efficiency above 91 achieved fig 3b on day 533 the influent ammonium concentration was increased to 1030 mg nh4 n l to mimic the raw anaerobic sludge digestion liquor while nitrite was no longer supplied in the feed fig 3a following this change the effluent ammonium concentration increased immediately to 235 5 mg n l in one month fig 3a indicating that the aob activity was a limiting factor therefore the air flowrate was elevated to 1 2 l d on day 574 and the average do concentration increased to 0 07 mg l fig 3c afterwards the effluent ammonium concentration decreased to 11 5 mg n l in one week and remained below 50 mg n l stably in the rest of experiment fig 3a notably the effluent nitrite and nitrate concentrations were constantly below 10 mg n l from day 574 to day 711 both ammonium and tn removal rates varied in the range of 1490 1540 mg n l d giving rise to an average removal efficiency of 98 fig 3b additionally the dissolved n2o concentration in effluent during day 574 711 was measured to be 0 29 0 002 mg n2o l fig s3 and the n2o emission was calculated to be 0 34 0 01 due to the low abundance of nob 0 1 in fig s2d as well as the low nob activity measured in the batch tests discussed in the next section the nitrite oxidation by nob was negligible thus the species specific nitrogen conversion rates of aob anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea were calculated as described in si and presented in fig 4 following every air flowrate increase from 0 to 0 7 l d the ammonia oxidization rate by aob increased immediately and maintained stable until the next aeration increase on day 533 an increase of aob activity from 600 mg n l d to 750 mg n l d was observed after changing the influent composition on day 574 the ammonia oxidation rate by aob further increased to 900 mg n l d and remained stable during the rest of experiment because the nitrogen removal rates by anammox and n damo reactions highly depended on the aerobic ammonia oxidation the nitrite removal rate by anammox reaction and n damo bacteria and the nitrate removal rate by n damo archaea followed the same treads to the aob activity fig 4 3 3 batch test results in order to elucidate the active bioreactions a series of batch tests were conducted at the end of the one stage phase fig 5 for batch a fed with ammonium and oxygen the ammonium concentration decreased from 48 9 mg n l to almost 0 mg n l in 1 h with nitrate accumulation of 4 8 mg n l and nitrite fluctuating around 1 mg n l fig 5a the nitrate production represented about 9 5 of the ammonium converted which was in line with the theoretical value 11 from anammox reaction reaction 1 indicating the active aob and anammox reactions this result also indicated negligible nob activities as otherwise nitrate production would be higher than 11 the reactor was fed with nitrite and oxygen for batch b in which the nitrite concentration decreased from 49 9 mg n l to 42 2 mg n l with slightly nitrate accumulation of 4 6 mg n l fig 5b indicating the existence of nob and heterotrophic denitrification driven by cell lysate as no organic carbon was provided for batch c fed with ammonium and nitrite under anaerobic condition the accumulated nitrate 5 9 mg n l represented 8 9 of the nitrogen removed while the consumed nitrite to ammonium ratio was 1 35 which was slightly higher than the theoretical ratio of 1 32 fig 5c these results further confirmed the anammox reaction and also indicated the minor contribution by heterotrophic denitrification to nitrite or nitrate consumption the reactor was fed with methane and nitrite or methane and nitrate for batch d and e respectively in which the simultaneous consumptions of methane and nitrite nitrate were clearly observed fig 5d and e the ratio of nitrite reduction rate to methane oxidation rate in batch d was determined to be 2 89 which was 24 higher than the theoretical value 2 33 based on n damo bacteria reaction reaction 2 similarly the ratio of nitrogen removal rate to methane oxidation rate in batch e was determined to be 1 83 also 31 higher than the theoretical value 1 40 based on n damo bacteria and n damo archaea reactions reaction 2 and 3 these observations indicated the active activities of n damo bacteria and n damo archaea in the biofilm the additional nitrate and nitrite consumption in batch d e could be due to heterotrophic denitrification moreover compared with batch a there was no nitrate accumulation in batch f with methane available fig 5f which again supported that n damo archaea contributed to the nitrate removal in the biofilm the batch tests results were further analyzed using the mass balance method detailed in table s2 of supplementary information with results summarized in table 3 the ammonium oxidation rates in batch a f were very similar at 685 mg n l d and 686 mg n l d respectively indicating strong aob activities despite of a low oxygen concentration of 0 2 0 05 mg l in comparison the nitrite oxidation rate estimated for batch b 110 185 mg n l d was 1 7 2 9 times that in batch a this is likely because nitrite was in excess in batch b while at negligible levels in batch a as a result of nitrite consumption by anammox bacteria these results indicate that nob made minor contribution to the nitrogen conversions under normal operating conditions i e low do and low nitrite the anammox activity was considerably higher in batch c 953 mg no2 n l d than in batch a 604 mg no2 n l d and batch f 631 mg no2 n l d suggesting that the anammox activities were limited by nitrite in the latter two cases the n damo bacterial activity was higher in batch d where nitrite was in excess than in batch e f when nitrite was rate limiting suggesting that the n damo bacteria contribution to nitrogen conversions during the normal operation of the mbfr was limited by the low level nitrite similarly the n damo archaeal activity was higher in batch e than in batch f also suggesting that the n damo archaeal activity in the mbfr would normally be limited by the availability of nitrate the mass balance analysis also allowed the estimation of nitrogen loss by heterotrophic denitrification in batch b e 59 74 mg n l d table 3 these rates are an order of magnitude lower than other reaction rates while the heterotrophic denitrification rates could not be determined for batch a f the nitrogen loss by heterotrophic denitrification in these cases as well as during the normal operation of the mbfr should be much less than the values estimated for batch b e due to the lower nitrite and nitrate levels these results indicate that heterotrophic denitrification should have a limited contribution 5 to the total nitrogen removal in the mbfr 4 discussion 4 1 a one stage pnam process in this study a high level nitrogen removal from synthetic sidestream wastewater was achieved by coupling aob anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea in a single reactor although the use of anammox and n damo microorganisms for removing nitrogen from partially nitrified sidestream wastewater 500 mg nh4 n l 500 mg no2 n l under strictly anaerobic condition was demonstrated previously xie et al 2017 this is the first study successfully coupling aerobic process aob with these anaerobic processes anammox and n damo microorganisms in one single reactor fed with ammonium 1030 mg nh4 n l as the only nitrogen source an average tn removal efficiency of 98 was achieved which is the best effluent quality reported in literature for this ammonium rich wastewater meng et al 2019 szatkowska et al 2007 in addition the nitrogen removal rate obtained in the present study is 1 5 kg n m3 d 1 5 times that achieved in the previous two stage system xie et al 2017 this could be due to the higher area to volume ratio 816 m2 m3 used in this study compared to the previous study 491 m2 m3 xie et al 2017 the activity of the suspended biomass in bulk liquid is determined to be negligible which is supported by the very low vss concentration of 0 005 0 001 g l therefore the areal rate is estimated to be 1 8 g n m2 d it is recognized that the rate was achieved in a small reactor where the reactor wall surface represented 30 of the membrane surface the areal rate reduces to 1 4 g n m2 d when the reactor wall is also considered the one stage pn anammox process has been widely used to treat high strength wastewater lackner et al 2014 however the effluent in most cases cannot meet the discharge standard and requires further polishing the involvement of n damo reactions in the proposed one stage pnam process enables to enhance the effluent quality specifically during the steady state of the one stage phase n damo archaea removed more than 99 of the nitrate produced by anammox bacteria leading to an effluent nitrate concentration below 10 mg n l fig 3a in addition the applied do concentration 0 1 mg l showed no inhibition on anammox or n damo organisms because their rates were similar in one stage with aeration fig 4 and two stage without aeration fig 2c phases it is well known that significant amount of n2o could be generated during biological nitrogen removal kampschreur et al 2009 law et al 2012 which is a potent greenhouse gas and an ozone depleting compound the n2o emission factor calculated for the proposed process was 0 34 0 01 which is in the range 0 1 4 6 reported for one stage pn anammox systems castro barros et al 2015 connan et al 2018 domingo felez et al 2014 hu et al 2013 joss et al 2009 kampschreur et al 2009 sliekers et al 2002 yang et al 2013 given the fact that there is no confirmed n2o production pathway in anammox or n damo reactions ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 kartal et al 2007 it can be assumed that this n2o production was more likely related to the aob metabolism duan et al 2017 hu et al 2013 additionally procedures to safely manage the production and utilization of biogas methane are well established in wwtps these lay the technical foundation for methane management in the proposed process also the mbfr was designed and operated in such a way that a gaseous mixture of methane and oxygen is avoided methane was supplied from hollow fiber membranes to the biofilm matrix while air was delivered to the bulk liquid phase through an aeration system external to the mbfr such separate deliveries of methane and air can sufficiently prevent the explosion risk it is recognized that this study was conducted in a small reactor 60 ml using synthetic feed experiments at larger scales and with real wastewater are clearly needed to investigate the application potential of this novel process hydrodynamic conditions in larger bioreactors are likely different from that in a 60 ml reactor which could affect mass transfer and biofilm development real wastewater likely has contaminants e g residual organic compounds inhibitory compounds and also residual biomass which could all interfere with biofilm development and in biofilm microbial reactions a further limitation of the study was the use of synthetic biogas with a high methane fraction 95 ch4 5 co2 in comparison real biogas contains ch4 and co2 at considerably lower 60 and higher 40 levels respectively and may also contain other gases e g h2s at trace levels ariunbaatar et al 2014 the reduced ch4 level will likely adversely affect its transfer to the biofilm while the elevated level of co2 is expected to cause acidification of the bioreactor both pose significant challenges to the reactor design and operation thus requiring further investigation the presence of other gases will likely support the development of other microorganisms in the biofilm further complicating the microbial community lopez et al 2017 this aspect also requires further experimental studies 4 2 ecological model connecting nitrogen and carbon conversions the microbial analysis clearly showed the co existence of aob anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea in the mbfr biofilm fig s1 their activities are confirmed by both the long term performance fig 3 and the batch tests fig 5 based on the substrate availability and the known microbial functions a conceptual ecological model is established to delineate the microbial interactions in the stratified biofilm fig 6 firstly aerobic microorganisms aob and nob partially convert ammonium to nitrite major and nitrate minor since the oxygen is supplied from the bulk liquid it is speculated that the aerobic reactions more likely occur at the biofilm surface which is in line with the observation in granular one stage pn anammox systems ali et al 2016 liu et al 2017 vlaeminck et al 2010 further the produced nitrite is removed by anammox bacteria with ammonium or by n damo bacteria with methane the nitrate produced by anammox bacteria and nob is reduced to nitrite by n damo archaea due to the availability of methane from the lumen of hollow fiber it is speculated that n damo bacteria and n damo archaea would dominate the inner layer as also predicted by a modelling study chen et al 2016 unfortunately with the current reactor design for a proof of concept study 60 ml in volume it was difficult to take intact biofilm samples to confirm this microbial stratification this aspect should be considered in future reactor designs suppression of nob is the critical step for short cut nitrogen removal which is even more difficult in the one stage system jaroszynski and oleszkiewicz 2011 in the present system both anammox bacteria and n damo bacteria competed for nitrite with nob in addition the low do concentration 0 1 mg l applied also limited the activities of nob although nitrospira nob less than 0 1 was detected in the biofilm fig s2d batch tests showed that the range of nitrite oxidation rate by nob was 110 185 mg n l d table 3 even in the absence of ammonium and methane i e in the absence of competition for nitrite by anammox and n damo bacteria this is far lower than the nitrite consumption rate by anammox bacteria 953 mg n l d and n damo bacteria 296 mg n l d measured in similar batch tests table 3 it is also far lower than the aob activity 685 686 mg n l d measured in the batch tests table 3 in fact in batch a with low level nitrite accumulation 1 mg n l the nitrite oxidation rate by nob was estimated to be 63 mg n l d table 3 this rate is likely more representative of nob activity during the normal mbfr operation it should also be noted the presence of n damo archaea which can convert nitrate back to nitrite also makes nob suppression less critical the strictly controlled oxygen flux and counter diffusion of oxygen from biofilm surface to biofilm base and methane from biofilm base to biofilm surface were likely responsible for the low presence of aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria in the biofilm during the entire experiment the relative abundances of known aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria e g methylocystis methylococcus methylomonas methylophilus and methylobacter were all below 0 002 in contrast anaerobic methanotrophs i e n damo bacteria and n damo archaea were abundant in the biofilm fig s1 likely in the inner part of the biofilm fig 6 it is possible that aerobic methanotrophs failed to compete with anaerobic methanotrophs for methane in the inner layer of biofilms due to the lack or low presence of oxygen and failed to compete with aob for oxygen in the outer layer of the biofilm due to the limited supply of methane in fact the oxygen flux rate at steady state 3200 200 mg o2 l d was well matched with the oxygen required for ammonia oxidation by aob 3100 30 mg o2 l d suggesting limited oxygen was available for aerobic methanotrophs it is worthwhile to note that known organisms belonging to aob nob anammox and n damo organisms only represented about 30 of the microbial communities in the biofilm fig s1 while other members comprised approximately 70 of the community this raises the question about their respective roles in the bioreactor 1 can the above listed functional groups at the measured abundances be solely responsible for the measured nitrogen and methane conversions 2 what are the roles of the 70 other members and what do they live on in the biofilm the data obtained in this study do not provide full answers to these questions supplementary information future research is needed to elucidate roles of the side populations the ecological model of anammox system has been well studied by using meta omics guo et al 2016 lawson et al 2017 speth et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 for example speth et al 2016 used metagenomics to build a genome based ecological model for a full scale pna reactor guo et al 2016 highlighted the important role of sludge aggregate type on the microbial community of anammox reactors based on metagenomics lawson et al 2017 elucidated the functions of heterotrophs and their interactions with anammox by both metagenomics and metatranscriptomics zhao et al 2018 revealed multiple potential cross feeding during start up of an anammox reactor according to metagenomics moreover a more complicated ecological model was established to mimic estuary or brackish sediment conditions which included both anammox and n damo microorganisms arshad et al 2017 compared to these studies the established biofilm in the present study further expands the microbial community with aerobic microorganisms aob which warrants further studies in addition it is also worthwhile to investigate the micro scale substrate profiles inside the biofilm matrix in order to elucidate the correlation between substrate concentrations and microbial activities 5 conclusions in this study a new process named one stage pnam by integrating aob anammox bacteria n damo bacteria and n damo archaea in a single biofilm was developed in a lab scale mbfr to remove nitrogen from synthetic anaerobic sludge digestion liquor the major conclusions and outcomes include it is possible to achieve high level nitrogen removal from anaerobic sludge digestion in a methane and oxygen supplied mbfr by integrating partial nitritation anammox and n damo reactions fed with synthetic anaerobic digestion liquor 1030 mg nh4 n l an average tn removal efficiency of 98 was achieved in this proof of concept study at a rate of 1 5 kg n m3 d however it should be noted that the performance was achieved in a small reactor 60 ml with synthetic wastewater studies at larger scales and with real wastewater are needed to verify the performance under more realistic conditions the one stage pnam process emits n2o with an emission factor 0 34 0 01 observed this study similar to anammox bacteria n damo microorganisms while being sensitive to oxygen can grow in biofilms in the presence of low levels of oxygen 0 1 mg l in this study likely residing in the deep layer of the biofilms declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

degradation a non exhaustive summary of the most successful technologies and aops used in mtbe degradation are summarized in table 1 although most of these aops have been shown to be efficient in degradation of mtbe the heterogeneous aops are often operated in batch conditions and suffer from the intrinsic drawback of requiring the separation of the catalyst particles from the treated solution zhao et al 2017 complicating the process and hampering its upscaling and application indeed the homogeneous aops are more reliable and capable of operating under flow through condition thus are preferred particularly from the application point of view in addition most of the above mentioned processes table 1 needed acidic conditions to achieve their optimum performance moreover the mineralization and toxicity of mtbe degradation intermediates have not been adequately addressed in the previous studies therefore more efficient and reliable aops should be developed and investigated for achieving the greater degradation and mineralization rate of mtbe furthermore the actual conditions of contaminated water namely ionic concentration organic matter etc should also be accounted for the vacuum ultraviolet vuv irradiation is a new method in the achievement of an efficient aop huang et al 2017 ji et al 2017 therefore the vuv based aops offer the advantages of uv light technologies such as the homogeneity of the treatment the modular apparatus and we further propose its enhancement by the fenton reagents which has proven effectiveness towards the mineralization of compounds over the simple photo transformation giannakis et al 2017a to the best of our knowledge the present study is the first work that utilizes a vuv assisted fenton process for the degradation of mtbe in water in order to effectively degrade and mineralize this persistent contaminant solutions involving the fenton process as a parallel process were also considered firstly an optimization of the operational parameters was performed scrutinizing the effect of h2o2 and fe ii concentrations as well as the matrix ph and anions the kinetics of mtbe degradation and mineralization in the vuv photo reactor was compared with the classical fenton and uvc photo fenton processes in batch and continuous flow modes of operation in order to elucidate the pathways to degradation the mechanism of mtbe degradation was evaluated through radical scavenging experiments and the formation reaction by products namely acetone tert buthyl alcohol tba and tert butyl formate tbf finally as a step towards the field scale real world problem applicability was considered by treating an actual mtbe contaminated water sample in the continuous flow vuv fe ii h2o2 process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade purchased from merck and used as received the mtbe aqueous solution was prepared through sufficient dilution of an aliquot of mtbe stock solution prepared in distilled water 2 2 experimental setup and procedure details experiments were conducted using a bench scale photo reactor whose schematics are shown in fig 1 a tubular pyrex column with a working height of 300 mm and inner diameter of 35 mm was used as photo reactor a quartz sleeve made from the synthetic high quality quartz glass with the outer diameter of 21 mm was placed at the center of the column into which the uv lamp was installed the photo reactor had a working volume of 180 ml for the vuv based experiments a low pressure mercury uv lamp 5 7 w uv output heraeus co emitting the radiation at two wavelengths of 185 nm with typical efficiency of approx 9 and 254 nm was used and named hereafter as the vuv lamp in order to indicate the role of uvc and vuv emissions a set of experiment was also conducted under similar optimum conditions in the photo reactor using another 6 w low pressure mercury uvc lamp philips co emitting uv radiation mainly at 254 nm for the safety consideration and preventing the emission of the uv radiation to the lab the photoreactor was covered with the aluminum foil the photo reactor was operated in a circulating mode in an up flow direction using a peristaltic pump heidolph instruments pd 5201 the degradation and mineralization of mtbe was examined when applying the light assisted and fenton related advanced oxidation processes i e fe ii h2o2 vuv vuv fe ii vuv fe ii h2o2 as well as the uvc uvc h2o2 and uvc fe ii h2o2 the effect of solution ph water matrix and radical scavengers were tested on the mtbe degradation and mineralization in what was found to be the most efficient process vuv fe ii h2o2 for each experiment 300 ml of aqueous solution with the known composition was transferred into the feed tank by a heidolph pd 5201 peristaltic pump and the solution was supplied to the photo reactor at a rate of 100 ml min the reactor was operated in both batch and continuous flow conditions during the batch operation the solution was recirculated through the reactor and was sampled at the pre defined target intervals in the continuous flow operation the vuv fe ii h2o2 process was operated as flow through mode and the effect of hydraulic retention time hrt was evaluated on its performance in degradation and mineralization of mtbe in the groundwater spiked with mtbe at each hrt the effluent was sampled after passing two times of hrt from the starting the process the taken samples were analyzed for residual total organic carbon toc and other target parameters e g process intermediates 2 3 analytical methods the performance of the selected aops in the degradation and mineralization of mtbe was determined based on eq 1 and eq 2 respectively for the elimination of mtbe eq 1 we get 1 degradation mtbe 0 mtbe t mtbe 0 100 the toc concentration was determined using a toc analyzer shimadzu co and the degree of mtbe mineralization was calculated from eq 2 as follows 2 mineralization toc 0 toc t toc 0 100 where toc0 and toct represent the toc concentrations mg l in the solution at the beginning and time t of the reaction h2o2 concentration was measured using titration with potassium permanganate 24 iron was determined according to the standard method apha et al 2017 the ph was measured by senseion 37 58 hach ph meter the kinetics of mtbe degradation and mineralization was evaluated considering the eqs 3 6 3 d c dt k ho ho c 4 k ho ho k obs 5 d c dt r obs k obs c the observed rates r obs of mtbe degradation and mineralization were calculated from the pseudo first order pfo reaction rate

its oxidation intermediates in the aqueous solution samples taken from the selected processes under optimum conditions were identified by the method iso 11423 1 using the automated headspace gas chromatography gc agilent 7890 5975 c analyzer with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer ms equipped with a hp5 ms capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm for each sample the solution was transferred by the auto sampler into the headspace vial and heated for 15 min at 70 c and the headspace gas was then automatically injected to the column hwang et al 2010 helium 99 999 was selected as the carrier gas at the flow rate of 1 l min the initial oven temperature of the gc was set at 36 c and increased to a final temperature of 90 c by a ramp of 4 c per min the degradation percentage of mtbe in the process was measured as the disappearance of mtbe from eq 1 acetone tert buthyl alcohol tba and tert butyl formate tbf were screened as the main intermediates of the mtbe degradation burbano et al 2005 mohebali 2013 siedlecka and stepnowski 2006 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of fe or h2o2 addition on vuv mediated mtbe degradation efficacy fig 2 depicts the degradation of 50 mg l mtbe in the vuv reactor at the presence of different h2o2 concentrations in absence of h2o2 the degradation and mtbe mineralization levels were 56 3 and 24 9 respectively mtbe absorbs in the short wavelength region of vuv which might lead to its degradation it has been previously reported that direct oxidation with uv185 photons is another way of the organic compounds oxidation in vuv photo reactors moussavi et al 2018a it worth noting that since the dissolved oxygen was depleted from the water by n2 gas sparging before the solution preparation and that the reactor was not aerated the production of ozone from vuv irradiation was not anticipated however oxidation is expected to be the main pathway to its elimination in the vuv photo reactor ho is generated from the homolysis eq 7 and photo oxidation eq 8 of water molecules by vuv λ 185 n m photons gonzalez et al 2004 imoberdorf and mohseni 2011 7 h 2 o v u v λ 185 n m h o h φ 0 33 8 h 2 o v u v λ 185 n m h o h e a q φ 0 045 furthermore it was found that the mtbe degradation and mineralization degree increased to 69 2 and 45 1 in the presence of 3 0 mm h2o2 nonetheless when h2o2 concentration was increased to 4 5 mm the degree of mtbe degradation and mineralization decreased to 59 5 and 38 1 respectively further increase of the h2o2 concentration caused inhibition of mtbe degradation and mineralization according to fig 2 the optimum h2o2 concentration in the vuv h2o2 process to achieve the highest mtbe degradation and mineralization in the vuv photo reactor was 3 0 mm at this level of addition 45 of the mtbe was converted to co2 and h2o compared to 25 in absence of h2o2 this indicates that although the degradation was merely 13 higher i e the h2o2 addition brought a moderate kinetic improvement removing an extra 20 of the toc of the solution is a desired effect giannakis et al 2017a the improvement in mtbe degradation and mineralization in the vuv photo reactor in the presence of h2o2 up to the optimum level can be attributed to the increase in the generation of ho through interaction between h2o2 and the vuv λ 185 n m photons eq 9 and the aqueous electrons e a q eq 10 produced from photo oxidation eq 2 of water molecules by vuv λ 185 n m photons imoberdorf and mohseni 2011 moussavi et al 2018a velo gala et al 2017 9 h 2 o 2 v u v 185 2 h o 10 h 2 o 2 e a q h o o h k 1 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 nevertheless although this pathway cannot be neglected the 185 nm h2o2 homolysis is not the main driving force of the mtbe degradation considering the low molar absorption coefficient of h2o2 vs h2o at 185 nm and the 10 fold lower photons that fall within the vuv region that said the vuv lamp also emits uvc radiation at the wavelength of 254 nm and is probably the main ho producer from the interaction from the homolysis of h2o2 by uvc photons eq 11 imoberdorf and mohseni 2011 moussavi et al 2018a velo gala et al 2017 11 h 2 o 2 u v c 254 2 h o φ 0 5 therefore the greater amount of ho generated in the reaction medium the higher was the rate of mtbe oxidation in the vuv h2o2 process as compared to that in the vuv alone nonetheless the increase of h2o2 concentration to above the optimum level 3 0 mm was resulted in scavenging ho by h2o2 eqs 12 and 13 and by self scavenging i e recombination of ho species to form h2o2 eq 15 adak et al 2015 imoberdorf and mohseni 2011 moussavi et al 2018a sharma et al 2015 liao et al 2016 li et al 2008 and thus in strongly inhibiting the mtbe degradation and mineralization 12 h 2 o 2 h o h o 2 h 2 o k 2 7 10 7 m 1 s 1 13 h o 2 h o o 2 h 2 o k 6 6 10 9 m 1 s 1 14 h o 2 o 2 h pka 4 88 15 h o h o h 2 o 2 k 4 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 the last reaction eq 15 is generally considered a termination reaction for the uvc h2o2 process and can also be regarded as such for the vuv process since the recombination of ho leads to a less reactive oxygen species however this feature could be exploited with the addition of fe ii in the bulk in this process the fenton reaction is expected to participate and contribute with ho towards mtbe degradation eq 16 16 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 ho oh the inset of fig 2 presents the degradation profile of mtbe in the plain vuv and the combined vuv fe ii process where a difference of 15 is constantly measured thus an enhancement by the fenton process is verified considering that eq 15 is a side reaction and a small amount of h2o2 is generated in absence of the o3 uvc interaction by the vuv lamps this difference is important and hence fe ii inclusion might be a worth enhancement in the vuv h2o2 process 3 2 effect of fe ii addition on the performance of the vuv h2o2 process having seen the effective participation of the fe ii in the vuv assisted mtbe degradation process due to the h2o2 accumulation the addition of fe ii in the vuv h2o2 process was systematically studied the effect of fe ii concentration between 0 and 0 14 mm was investigated assessing the performance of the vuv h2o2 process in the mineralization of 50 mg l mtbe in the reaction time of 30 min the results are shown in fig 3 it is observed that the degradation and mineralization of mtbe first increased and then decreased with the increase of concentration of fe ii based on fig 3 the highest mtbe degradation and mineralization was 97 5 and 69 4 respectively achieved in fe ii concentration of 0 09 mm although in typical uvc h2o2 systems the addition of iron merely brought an enhancement de la cruz et al 2012 2013 in our work a significant improvement was noted similar to other works with very low iron additions ulliman et al 2018 firstly the enhancement of mtbe degradation and mineralization in the vuv h2o2 process in the presence of fe ii can be justified by providing the fenton reaction in the process eq 16 led to the generation of additional ho moussavi et al 2018b and consequently to the improvement of the mtbe oxidation the fe 3 species could be reduced by illumination of the fe organic ligands through the charge transfer from the ligand to metal ulliman et al 2018 and there is the possibility for the reduction of fe 3 species formed in the fenton reaction by the part of uvc emitted from the vuv lamp providing fe2 available for progressing the fenton reaction moussavi et al 2018b yao et al 2017 and thus the mtbe oxidation 17 fe 3 h 2 o λ 254 nm fe 2 ho h hence the presence of fe ii in the reaction medium could initiate and run the fenton reaction resulted in increasing the amount of ho species corresponding to the achievement of the greater mtbe degradation and mineralization percentages it clearly indicates that the integration of fenton reaction with vuv process had a synergistic effect and accelerated the mtbe oxidation rate however further increase of fe ii concentration to 0 11 and then 0 14 mm inhibited the degradation performance the decrease in mtbe oxidation when the fe concentrations was increased above the optimum level 4 mg l might be due to the fact that fe2 acted as ho scavenger moussavi et al 2018b or due to the light absorption of fe ions 18 fe 2 ho fe 3 oh in summary from the results of fig 3 that the vuv stimulated fenton vuv fe ii h2o2 process could achieve a greater level of mtbe oxidation at this level of fe addition i e 0 09 mm alongside with an 18 higher mtbe degradation 69 of the toc was mineralized compared to the 45 in absence of fe so an extra 24 toc removal is attained further abetting the vuv mediated degradation process 3 3 effect of solution ph on mtbe oxidation in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process the ph of the matrix is one of the most important variables controlling the advanced oxidation reactions burbano et al 2005 the degradation and mineralization of mtbe in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process as a function of initial solution ph is shown in fig 4 based on the experimental data at ph 3 the degradation and mineralization of 50 mg l mtbe was 85 2 and 43 1 respectively the degradation and mineralization performance improved with the increase in solution ph to 7 and reached to 97 4 and 69 5 respectively further increase in solution ph had no considerable effect of the mtbe oxidation one of the main limitations of the fenton reaction is that the optimum performance is usually attained under the acidic ph that is far from the ph of natural waters giannakis 2019 indeed the efficacy of the fenton process in neutral ph is low burbano et al 2005 it demands manipulating first decrease and then increase the contaminated natural water ph to achieve an efficient treatment process making the process complex and cost intensive accordingly this increase in ratio of mtbe deprotonated form was more favorable for oxidation was resulted in the improvement of the mtbe oxidation efficiency in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process up to ph 7 however the mtbe degradation and mineralization efficiency in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process decreased as the solution ph was increased to 8 and then 9 fig 4 this shift can be attributed mainly to the precipitation of fe iii dong et al 2017 generated from eq 16 as well as to the decomposition of h2o2 in alkaline phs hu et al 2008 resulted in hindering the ho generated from the fenton reaction and thereby in reducing the mtbe oxidation rate it has been previously reported that the highest mtbe degradation and mineralization is achieved at the acidic solution ph of 3 in the fenton process bergendahl and thies 2004 burbano et al 2005 in our work attaining the highest mtbe oxidation rate at near neutral ph shows that although beneficial the addition of fe ii is complementary and not the governing degradation pathway the efficacy increase observed after its addition can be related to the formation of soluble fe iii containing complex with the ligands formed during the mtbe oxidation such as carboxylic acids in the process clarizia et al 2017 de luca et al 2014 the fe iii ligand product prevented the precipitation of dissolved iron as ferric hydroxide thus the soluble fe ligand complex make fe iii available for the fenton reactions resulted in achieving high oxidation rate in neutral conditions clarizia et al 2017 de luca et al 2014 attaining the greatest degradation and mineralization of mtbe in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process at the neutral ph close to the ph of natural waters overcomes necessitating ph manipulation adjustment and thus mitigates the operational and maintenance complexity and cost for the field application therefore a neutral ph was selected as the optimum level for the next experiments 3 4 comparative kinetics of mtbe oxidation by uvc or vuv photo assisted fenton process the kinetics of mtbe degradation and mineralization was investigated in the uvc fe ii h2o2 and vuv fe ii h2o2 process as well as their constituents for the comparison mtbe degradation and mineralization experiments were conducted under similar reagent conditions under light fenton and light assisted fenton processes for uvc fig 5 and vuv based processes fig 6 as observed in fig 5 the degradation and mineralization of mtbe increased in all the tested uvc based processes as the reaction time was increased however complete degradation of mtbe was not achieved with any of the studied uvc based processes furthermore the mineralization rate remained relatively low 35 at all times for approximately max 75 elimination of mtbe on the other hand the vuv based processes achieved significantly higher rates fig 6 and almost all processes reached total degradation within 60 min the integrated vuv fe ii h2o2 process reached 100 elimination within 30 min reaction time fig 6 even at a lower uv intensity as compared to the uvc lamp it should be noted here that after 20 min when 99 6 of mtbe was degraded the toc elimination rate showed a sharp increase contrary to any other process uvc or vuv based this indicates the efficacy of the process in the elimination of the generated by products in order to better illustrate the efficacy of the vuv on enhancing the performance of fenton process in mtbe oxidation the degradation and mineralization kinetics were evaluated and the information is given in table 2 considering table 2 the degradation and mineralization of mtbe in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process were about 18 and 27 times of those in the fenton process in addition the vuv as a baseline was much more efficient than the uvc for the photo activation of the fenton reaction to improve the degradation and mineralization of mtbe the rate of mtbe degradation and mineralization in the vuv fe ii h2o2 was about 10 and 5 times of those in the uvc fe ii h2o2 most likely the presence of the 185 nm wavelength has a higher h2o2 homolytic cleavage potential while the possibility of direct vuv degradation of mtbe cannot be excluded finally if one takes into account the residual h2o2 concentrations after the end of the experimental runs presented in table 2 it is evident that the vuv lamps with their different geometry thin water film and the presence of both wavelengths makes significantly more effective use of h2o2 specifically the elevated degradation and mineralization coincide with the lower residual h2o2 values measured suggesting that the vuv lamps are in that sense more cost effective as they make better use of the investment in reagent costs in addition the addition of fe is shown to increase consumption and according to our previous data enhancing the degradation and mineralization of mtbe before we try and dissociate the uvc and vuv based results and gain mechanistic insight on the action mode of the integrated processes table 3 compares the performance of the developed vuv fe ii h2o2 method with the previously reported processes for the degradation and mineralization of mtbe it is clearly observed that the vuv fe ii h2o2 process achieved notable mtbe degradation and mineralization percentages although their kinetics could not possibly be directly compared and there are other cost related parameters to consider e g eeo we attained a high degree of degradation and mineralization without the need for special conditions e g dangerous reagents or toxic nanoparticles that impose environmental and health risks using low amount of oxidants these results highlight the potential of the vuv fe ii h2o2 process as an efficient and applicable process for treating mtbe contaminated effluents 3 5 mechanism of mtbe oxidation in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process synergies scavenger experiments and reaction intermediates monitoring we have presented above the various processes that are involved in the vuv based experiments and highlighted the need to further elucidate mtbe degradation by the integrated vuv fe ii h2o2 process although the main oxidant can reasonably be considered to be ho we attempt to dissect the degradation process and attribute the observed kinetics to the light effects the fenton process and the interplay among fe h2o2 and light in fig 7 we present each constituent of the process separately and two ho scavenger experiments by adding tert butanol tba as a strong ho scavenger to the reaction medium tba concentration 1 g l firstly the importance of ho was verified since addition of tba diminished the reaction kinetics the formation of ho in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process was confirmed and the degradation of mtbe in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process decreased from 99 6 in the absence of tba to 20 in 30 min when tba was added to the reaction medium fig 7 tba is a strong ho scavenger with a second order reaction rate constant of 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 hu et al 2019 therefore the considerable retardation in mtbe degradation rate in the presence of tba clearly indicates that ho was the main oxidative species generated in the developed vuv fe ii h2o2 process and that mtbe was degraded predominantly through ho oxidation mechanism hwang et al 2010 however the addition of tba into the sole vuv process has confirmed the proposition that the water photolysis and the subsequent generation of ho will also lead to mtbe degradation the small difference between vuv and vuv h2o2 shows also that there is possibly a considerable amount of ho recombination that eventually leads to the formation of h2o2 or most likely the recombination of secondary ros such as superoxide and hydroperoxyl radicals secondly another notable point is found when the two tba scavenger experiments are compared as it appears there is a fraction of the degradation that remains un accounted for in order to further elucidate the sequence of events and the relative importance of the constituents of the integrated vuv fe ii h2o2 process the initial reaction rates 30 min were calculated dissociated and summarized in table 4 firstly by subtracting the kinetics found in the vuv and scavenged vuv tba process we can obtain the light induced degradation kinetics of mtbe by 185 and 254 nm together which can lead to mtbe degradation a direct light 185 nm effect on mtbe kavanaugh et al 2003 however taking into account that the uvc mediated degradation was 20 fig 5 the direct 185 nm light effect has to be negligible close to the error margin from the next two processes i e the integrated vuv fe ii h2o2 and the corresponding scavenged one theoretically if only oh are generated by the vuv fe ii h2o2 process then we should have found the same values as the previous consideration as such we propose that the unaccounted difference is due to the superoxide radical generated during the h2o2 mediated reduction of fe3 to fe2 and or a possible lmct between fe and mtbe this process would regenerate fe3 to fe2 by using mtbe or a byproduct of the degradation as a sacrificial ligand electron donor also the superoxide can reduce fe3 back to fe2 in order to re participate in the fenton process and produce further oh towards mtbe degradation or directly react with mtbe furthermore the synergy among the different processes was considered as initial proof of concept the addition of the fenton and the vuv process is found to be considerably smaller than the integrated vuv fe ii h2o2 process however this approach is relatively simplistic hence the vuv fe ii and vuv h2o2 processes have to be firstly considered to properly estimate the synergy of the vuv fe ii h2o2 process by dissociating the vuv effect when fe or h2o2 alone are added in the solution we obtain the isolated extra effect they induce when vuv is present processes 10 13 afterwards the addition of the isolated processes vuv fe h2o2 is still confirmed to be lower than the integrated vuv fe ii h2o2 process and the synergy was calculated as the fraction of the integrated process against the sum of the process a similar procedure was followed also for the comparison of the uvc based processes based on the results given in table 4 the synergistic effect between uvc and fenton was relatively low 1 13 times faster whereas between vuv and fenton reaction was x2 5 times more rapid for the degradation of mtbe it is confirmed that the vuv radiation considerably stimulated the fenton reaction for mtbe degradation mainly through the generation of h2o2 and thereby the formation of extra oh the greater synergistic effect of the irradiation of the fenton reaction with the vuv than uvc photons can be attributed to the greater reactions involved in generating radical species in the vuv fe ii h2o2 eqs 7 11 and thus production of greater amount of radical species than in the uvc fe ii h2o2 process the high synergistic effect between the vuv and the fenton reaction is of the great importance from the field scale application of vuv fe ii h2o2 process for efficient and cost effective treatment of the water and wastewater frontistis et al 2012 finally we have to note here that the process is excessively complex to be broken down to plain subtraction of kinetics and this approach should be considered as a primary approach towards the understanding of the composite treatment concerning the reaction intermediates acetone tba and tbf as the main possible intermediates of mtbe degradation were tracked in the mtbe solution after treatment by the fenton vuv uvc fe ii h2o2 and vuv fe ii h2o2 processes acetone and tba were not detected in the analyzed samples most likely below lod but tbf was detected as the primary intermediate of mtbe degradation fig 8 shows the variation of tbf in the fresh un treated solution and the aops treated solutions based on fig 8 the concentration of tbf was the lowest in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process among the tested aops implying the highest mtbe mineralization achieved in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process due to the high reaction rate of tbf with ho garoma et al 2008 detecting lower concentration of tbf in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process is related to the generation of greater amount of oxidative radicals in the combined fenton and vuv processes compared to the individual ones fact that reconfirms the considerable synergistic effect of combining fenton and vuv irradiation from the experimental data and the revision of the relevant literature on mtbe degradation pathways stefan et al 2000 xu et al 2004 acero et al 2001 in fig 9 we present the pathway proposed for the degradation of mtbe by the vuv fe ii h2o2 process the ho can attack both methoxy group route a or methyl groups route b in the structure of mtbe molecules resulted in the generation of carbon centered radicals the carbon centered radicals formed in reactions 19 and 20 resulted in fabrication of peroxyl radicals respectively 19 c h 3 3 c o c h 3 h o c h 3 3 c o c h 2 h 2 o 20 c h 3 o c c h 3 2 c h 3 h o c h 3 o c c h 3 2 c h 2 h 2 o since ho is electrophilic in nature and the c h bonds around the o2 are in charge of stereo electronic effect the methoxy group in mtbe structure is in priority for ho attack which is resulted in mtbe transformation through the h atom abstraction mechanism depending on the position attacked by oh the degradation of mtbe molecules might be occurred through two routes a and b fig 9 mtbe molecules could be transformed to tba 3 tbf 4 and acetone 5 the results of gc ms analysis conducted on the effluent of the vuv fe ii h2o2 process under optimum conditions indicated that tba and acetone were not detected and tbf was detected as the main intermediate formed during the mtbe degradation furthermore since we found that tbf is the main product of mtbe through ho radicals on the methoxy group it is clearly deduced that the mtbe was degraded through route a fig 9 considering the charge distribution and electrophilic character of hydroxyl radicals the formoyl group in the tbf was more prone to be attacked by ho led to the formation of formic and acetic carboxylic acids stefan et al 2000 xu et al 2004 and finally to the mineralization to co2 and h2o the detection of formic and acetic acids in the effluent sample confirms the pathway proposed for the degradation of mtbe and justify the high mineralization achieved in the developed process 3 6 treatment of a mtbe contaminated groundwater in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process in continuous mode of operation in order to assess the applicability of our process into a real world situation a groundwater sample was spiked with 4 8 mg l mtbe and treated in the continuous flow vuv fe ii h2o2 process to indicate the possible field applicability of the developed process the main physicochemical characteristics of the groundwater sample that affect uv and fenton basrd processes was as follows total hardness 186 mg caco3 l total dissolved solids 317 mg l ph 7 3 fe ii 0 35 mg l fig 10 shows the concentration profiles of mtbe and toc as a function of hrt in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process based on fig 10 the complete degradation and 86 4 mineralization of 4 8 mg l mtbe was achieved in the continuous flow vuv fe ii h2o2 process in the hrt of a few min in natural waters the presence of water matrix components such as counter ions and suspended solids usually poses a challenge in light assisted treatment processes giannakis et al 2017b the naturally present organic substances such as humic acid can act either as a light screen or target for the generated ros a process potentially mitigated by the capacity of humic acid to complex iron and possibly maintain a fenton reaction among the physicochemical parameters tested prior to assessing mtbe degradation in groundwater one has to incorporate the natural turbidity of the samples which scatters and blocks light hampering the degradation efficiency furthermore the presence of bi carbonate ions has a documented effect as a hydroxyl radical scavenger wu and linden 2010 following one of the two pathways depending on the ph that defines the carbonate equilibrium eqs 21 and 22 in our waters the bi carbonate form is prevailing 21 h o h c o 3 c o 3 h 2 o 22 h o c o 3 2 c o 3 h o although the carbonate radical is mildly oxidative and has a longer lifetime in water compared to the hydroxyl radical its lower oxidative potential is decreasing the overall efficacy of the process in real world matrices compared to distilled water giannakis et al 2017c it should be noted here that the bi carbonate ions are not the only ones that affect the process in a similar manner chloride and sulfate ions react with hydroxyl radicals and generate chloride and sulfate radicals respectively these radicals are longer living albeit more selective in the degradation of organic contaminants kiwi et al 2000 marjanovic et al 2018 rodríguez chueca et al 2019 hence they generally reduce the overall efficacy of the treatment process in addition photolysis of nitrate nitrite may lead to further hydroxyl radical generation mack and bolton 1999 in overall our study cannot dissociate the effects of the different ions and in a potential field scale application a slight reduction of the mtbe degradation rate should not come as a surprise nevertheless it is worth pointing out the successful application of the vuv fe ii h2o2 process in our study and that the efficacy of the process in a real water matrix in either batch or continuous mode was significant despite the intrinsic scavenging properties of the water 4 conclusions in this work the effectiveness of different uvc and vuv based aops was compared for the degradation and mineralization of mtbe the highest rate of mtbe oxidation was achieved in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process confirming the efficient acceleration of the fenton reaction by vuv irradiation even at neutral ph the vuv light sensitized fenton process was found to be a desirable enhancement the mechanism of mtbe elimination by the vuv technologies was found to be mainly ho driven and the addition of fe ii and or h2o2 further abet its elimination despite the modest kinetic enhancement when one of the fenton reagents was added their simultaneous presence enhanced mtbe degradation with a higher degree of synergy compared to the classical uvc assisted process and with considerably lower by products generation the process could mineralize mtbe mainly to carboxylic acids and then to co2 and h2o with low tbf formation and undetectable levels of acetone and tba the degradation pathway revealed the intermediate steps towards mtbe degradation and the high mineralization rates observed verify the quick shift towards the low molecular weight compounds finally the application of this technology was not found to be limited by the natural water components that normally impede the uv or ho based processes such as uvc h2o2 or the fenton process more specifically in groundwater contaminated with 4 8 mg l mtbe the complete degradation and 86 4 mineralization could be achieved in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process within an hrt as short as 5 min compared with the batch tests for mtbe aqueous solution to the flow through tests for the contaminated groundwater we report a good match that justifies imagining a transfer of this bench scale technology to a field application the proven effectiveness in groundwater in a continuous mode at near neutral conditions with the addition of fe ii and h2o2 is validated by the conditions encountered in the real water matrix assayed groundwater that leaves promise for upscaling and application of the vuv fe ii h2o2 technology declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18467,vacuum uv vuv technologies have recently attracted high interest due to their high efficacy in generating reactive oxygen species ros to date no systematic study of the modes of action of the integrated vuv fe ii h2o2 process against contaminants elimination exists the present study reports the oxidation of mtbe in a new light assisted fenton process by employing either narrowband uvc 254 nm or vuv 185 and 254 nm irradiation in a comparative evaluation the processes under investigation were the uvc or vuv fe ii h2o2 sensitized ones and their constituents i e fe ii h2o2 vuv vuv fe ii vuv h2o2 vuv fe ii h2o2 as well as the uvc uvc h2o2 and uvc fe ii h2o2 we scrutinize the operational parameters of the vuv assisted process its enhancements and synergies comparison with the uvc based ones as well as their inflicted pathways towards mtbe degradation complete degradation and 87 8 mineralization of 50 mg l mtbe was achieved in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process 0 9 mm fe ii and 3 mm h2o2 at near neutral ph reaction times 30 and 60 min respectively irradiation with vuv light was found to act synergistically and in high kinetic rates enhancement compared to the uvc source sensitizing the fenton process for effective oxidation of mtbe in the aqueous solution a scavenger study and degradation by products investigation has been performed leading to a mechanistic pathway proposition elucidating mtbe degradation the vuv fe ii h2o2 process demonstrated potential applicability in the field since it could efficiently treat 100 degradation and 86 4 mineralization groundwater spiked with mtbe operated either under batch or continuous flow mode the findings clearly indicates the vuv assisted fenton as an emerging and viable technology for field application to treat the mtbe contaminated effluents or waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation process vacuum ultraviolet light fenton reaction water contamination degradation pathway 1 introduction methyl tert butyl ether mtbe c5h12o is an oxygenated additive of gasoline with an annual production rate of 20 mt around the world levchuk et al 2014 it is released into the environment mainly through leakage spill accident during the production storage and transportation and use of mtbe and gasoline moussavi et al 2009 since mtbe has relatively high solubility and a low octanol water partition coefficient o neil 2013 it does not adsorb to soil particles thus reaches to the groundwater upon release and is very soluble in water pal et al 2018 russo et al 2015 since mtbe is resistance to chemical and microbial degradation and consequently low natural attenuation it is persistent in groundwater and causes the water contamination facetti et al 2019 accordingly mtbe is known one of the most important contaminants frequently detected in range of microgram to milligrams per liter in groundwater around the world possessing an increasingly concern facetti et al 2019 gonzalez olmosa et al 2009 minetti et al 2017 mtbe has acute and chronic toxicity and imparts adverse health effects on human be exposed to mtbe through the ingestion inhalation and skin paths roberts et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 in addition mtbe imparts a very objectionable taste and odor to water who 2017 epa advised the taste and odor thresholds of 40 and 20 μg l respectively for mtbe in drinking water usepa 2018 several technologies recently developed for mtbe removal from the contaminated water including air stripping adsorption advanced oxidation processes aops and biodegradation dong et al 2017 levchuk et al 2014 safari et al 2013 singh and borthakur 2018 the treatment process is selected based on the efficiency cost applicability and complexity pal et al 2018 air stripping and adsorption are only the phase change techniques leading to generating the air pollution and soil waste secondary contaminated streams that require further treatment disposal mtbe has low biodegradability facetti et al 2019 hong et al 2007 kim et al 2012 levchuk et al 2014 due to the ether link and the tert butyl moiety in its structure kim et al 2012 mohebali 2013 indicating that the biodegradation is mostly inefficient for removal of mtbe from the contaminated water aops are emerging technologies suitable for the degradation of a wide range of contaminants based on the generation of highly oxidative reactive species particularly hydroxyl radical oh which non selectively attack the organic contaminants leading to their degradation mehrjouei et al 2014 since ho has a high reaction rate constant of 1 6 109 m 1 s 1 with mtbe buxton et al 1988 the ho based aops have been established as an attractive technical solution and of great importance for degradation of mtbe in the contaminated water li et al 2008 various

degradation a non exhaustive summary of the most successful technologies and aops used in mtbe degradation are summarized in table 1 although most of these aops have been shown to be efficient in degradation of mtbe the heterogeneous aops are often operated in batch conditions and suffer from the intrinsic drawback of requiring the separation of the catalyst particles from the treated solution zhao et al 2017 complicating the process and hampering its upscaling and application indeed the homogeneous aops are more reliable and capable of operating under flow through condition thus are preferred particularly from the application point of view in addition most of the above mentioned processes table 1 needed acidic conditions to achieve their optimum performance moreover the mineralization and toxicity of mtbe degradation intermediates have not been adequately addressed in the previous studies therefore more efficient and reliable aops should be developed and investigated for achieving the greater degradation and mineralization rate of mtbe furthermore the actual conditions of contaminated water namely ionic concentration organic matter etc should also be accounted for the vacuum ultraviolet vuv irradiation is a new method in the achievement of an efficient aop huang et al 2017 ji et al 2017 therefore the vuv based aops offer the advantages of uv light technologies such as the homogeneity of the treatment the modular apparatus and we further propose its enhancement by the fenton reagents which has proven effectiveness towards the mineralization of compounds over the simple photo transformation giannakis et al 2017a to the best of our knowledge the present study is the first work that utilizes a vuv assisted fenton process for the degradation of mtbe in water in order to effectively degrade and mineralize this persistent contaminant solutions involving the fenton process as a parallel process were also considered firstly an optimization of the operational parameters was performed scrutinizing the effect of h2o2 and fe ii concentrations as well as the matrix ph and anions the kinetics of mtbe degradation and mineralization in the vuv photo reactor was compared with the classical fenton and uvc photo fenton processes in batch and continuous flow modes of operation in order to elucidate the pathways to degradation the mechanism of mtbe degradation was evaluated through radical scavenging experiments and the formation reaction by products namely acetone tert buthyl alcohol tba and tert butyl formate tbf finally as a step towards the field scale real world problem applicability was considered by treating an actual mtbe contaminated water sample in the continuous flow vuv fe ii h2o2 process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade purchased from merck and used as received the mtbe aqueous solution was prepared through sufficient dilution of an aliquot of mtbe stock solution prepared in distilled water 2 2 experimental setup and procedure details experiments were conducted using a bench scale photo reactor whose schematics are shown in fig 1 a tubular pyrex column with a working height of 300 mm and inner diameter of 35 mm was used as photo reactor a quartz sleeve made from the synthetic high quality quartz glass with the outer diameter of 21 mm was placed at the center of the column into which the uv lamp was installed the photo reactor had a working volume of 180 ml for the vuv based experiments a low pressure mercury uv lamp 5 7 w uv output heraeus co emitting the radiation at two wavelengths of 185 nm with typical efficiency of approx 9 and 254 nm was used and named hereafter as the vuv lamp in order to indicate the role of uvc and vuv emissions a set of experiment was also conducted under similar optimum conditions in the photo reactor using another 6 w low pressure mercury uvc lamp philips co emitting uv radiation mainly at 254 nm for the safety consideration and preventing the emission of the uv radiation to the lab the photoreactor was covered with the aluminum foil the photo reactor was operated in a circulating mode in an up flow direction using a peristaltic pump heidolph instruments pd 5201 the degradation and mineralization of mtbe was examined when applying the light assisted and fenton related advanced oxidation processes i e fe ii h2o2 vuv vuv fe ii vuv fe ii h2o2 as well as the uvc uvc h2o2 and uvc fe ii h2o2 the effect of solution ph water matrix and radical scavengers were tested on the mtbe degradation and mineralization in what was found to be the most efficient process vuv fe ii h2o2 for each experiment 300 ml of aqueous solution with the known composition was transferred into the feed tank by a heidolph pd 5201 peristaltic pump and the solution was supplied to the photo reactor at a rate of 100 ml min the reactor was operated in both batch and continuous flow conditions during the batch operation the solution was recirculated through the reactor and was sampled at the pre defined target intervals in the continuous flow operation the vuv fe ii h2o2 process was operated as flow through mode and the effect of hydraulic retention time hrt was evaluated on its performance in degradation and mineralization of mtbe in the groundwater spiked with mtbe at each hrt the effluent was sampled after passing two times of hrt from the starting the process the taken samples were analyzed for residual total organic carbon toc and other target parameters e g process intermediates 2 3 analytical methods the performance of the selected aops in the degradation and mineralization of mtbe was determined based on eq 1 and eq 2 respectively for the elimination of mtbe eq 1 we get 1 degradation mtbe 0 mtbe t mtbe 0 100 the toc concentration was determined using a toc analyzer shimadzu co and the degree of mtbe mineralization was calculated from eq 2 as follows 2 mineralization toc 0 toc t toc 0 100 where toc0 and toct represent the toc concentrations mg l in the solution at the beginning and time t of the reaction h2o2 concentration was measured using titration with potassium permanganate 24 iron was determined according to the standard method apha et al 2017 the ph was measured by senseion 37 58 hach ph meter the kinetics of mtbe degradation and mineralization was evaluated considering the eqs 3 6 3 d c dt k ho ho c 4 k ho ho k obs 5 d c dt r obs k obs c the observed rates r obs of mtbe degradation and mineralization were calculated from the pseudo first order pfo reaction rate model given in eq 5 the pfo rate constant of mtbe degradation and mineralization k obs was obtained from fitting the eq 6 to the experimental results 6 ln c t c 0 k obs t the mtbe concentration and its oxidation intermediates in the aqueous solution samples taken from the selected processes under optimum conditions were identified by the method iso 11423 1 using the automated headspace gas chromatography gc agilent 7890 5975 c analyzer with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer ms equipped with a hp5 ms capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm for each sample the solution was transferred by the auto sampler into the headspace vial and heated for 15 min at 70 c and the headspace gas was then automatically injected to the column hwang et al 2010 helium 99 999 was selected as the carrier gas at the flow rate of 1 l min the initial oven temperature of the gc was set at 36 c and increased to a final temperature of 90 c by a ramp of 4 c per min the degradation percentage of mtbe in the process was measured as the disappearance of mtbe from eq 1 acetone tert buthyl alcohol tba and tert butyl formate tbf were screened as the main intermediates of the mtbe degradation burbano et al 2005 mohebali 2013 siedlecka and stepnowski 2006 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of fe or h2o2 addition on vuv mediated mtbe degradation efficacy fig 2 depicts the degradation of 50 mg l mtbe in the vuv reactor at the presence of different h2o2 concentrations in absence of h2o2 the degradation and mtbe mineralization levels were 56 3 and 24 9 respectively mtbe absorbs in the short wavelength region of vuv which might lead to its degradation it has been previously reported that direct oxidation with uv185 photons is another way of the organic compounds oxidation in vuv photo reactors moussavi et al 2018a it worth noting that since the dissolved oxygen was depleted from the water by n2 gas sparging before the solution preparation and that the reactor was not aerated the production of ozone from vuv irradiation was not anticipated however oxidation is expected to be the main pathway to its elimination in the vuv photo reactor ho is generated from the homolysis eq 7 and photo oxidation eq 8 of water molecules by vuv λ 185 n m photons gonzalez et al 2004 imoberdorf and mohseni 2011 7 h 2 o v u v λ 185 n m h o h φ 0 33 8 h 2 o v u v λ 185 n m h o h e a q φ 0 045 furthermore it was found that the mtbe degradation and mineralization degree increased to 69 2 and 45 1 in the presence of 3 0 mm h2o2 nonetheless when h2o2 concentration was increased to 4 5 mm the degree of mtbe degradation and mineralization decreased to 59 5 and 38 1 respectively further increase of the h2o2 concentration caused inhibition of mtbe degradation and mineralization according to fig 2 the optimum h2o2 concentration in the vuv h2o2 process to achieve the highest mtbe degradation and mineralization in the vuv photo reactor was 3 0 mm at this level of addition 45 of the mtbe was converted to co2 and h2o compared to 25 in absence of h2o2 this indicates that although the degradation was merely 13 higher i e the h2o2 addition brought a moderate kinetic improvement removing an extra 20 of the toc of the solution is a desired effect giannakis et al 2017a the improvement in mtbe degradation and mineralization in the vuv photo reactor in the presence of h2o2 up to the optimum level can be attributed to the increase in the generation of ho through interaction between h2o2 and the vuv λ 185 n m photons eq 9 and the aqueous electrons e a q eq 10 produced from photo oxidation eq 2 of water molecules by vuv λ 185 n m photons imoberdorf and mohseni 2011 moussavi et al 2018a velo gala et al 2017 9 h 2 o 2 v u v 185 2 h o 10 h 2 o 2 e a q h o o h k 1 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 nevertheless although this pathway cannot be neglected the 185 nm h2o2 homolysis is not the main driving force of the mtbe degradation considering the low molar absorption coefficient of h2o2 vs h2o at 185 nm and the 10 fold lower photons that fall within the vuv region that said the vuv lamp also emits uvc radiation at the wavelength of 254 nm and is probably the main ho producer from the interaction from the homolysis of h2o2 by uvc photons eq 11 imoberdorf and mohseni 2011 moussavi et al 2018a velo gala et al 2017 11 h 2 o 2 u v c 254 2 h o φ 0 5 therefore the greater amount of ho generated in the reaction medium the higher was the rate of mtbe oxidation in the vuv h2o2 process as compared to that in the vuv alone nonetheless the increase of h2o2 concentration to above the optimum level 3 0 mm was resulted in scavenging ho by h2o2 eqs 12 and 13 and by self scavenging i e recombination of ho species to form h2o2 eq 15 adak et al 2015 imoberdorf and mohseni 2011 moussavi et al 2018a sharma et al 2015 liao et al 2016 li et al 2008 and thus in strongly inhibiting the mtbe degradation and mineralization 12 h 2 o 2 h o h o 2 h 2 o k 2 7 10 7 m 1 s 1 13 h o 2 h o o 2 h 2 o k 6 6 10 9 m 1 s 1 14 h o 2 o 2 h pka 4 88 15 h o h o h 2 o 2 k 4 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 the last reaction eq 15 is generally considered a termination reaction for the uvc h2o2 process and can also be regarded as such for the vuv process since the recombination of ho leads to a less reactive oxygen species however this feature could be exploited with the addition of fe ii in the bulk in this process the fenton reaction is expected to participate and contribute with ho towards mtbe degradation eq 16 16 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 ho oh the inset of fig 2 presents the degradation profile of mtbe in the plain vuv and the combined vuv fe ii process where a difference of 15 is constantly measured thus an enhancement by the fenton process is verified considering that eq 15 is a side reaction and a small amount of h2o2 is generated in absence of the o3 uvc interaction by the vuv lamps this difference is important and hence fe ii inclusion might be a worth enhancement in the vuv h2o2 process 3 2 effect of fe ii addition on the performance of the vuv h2o2 process having seen the effective participation of the fe ii in the vuv assisted mtbe degradation process due to the h2o2 accumulation the addition of fe ii in the vuv h2o2 process was systematically studied the effect of fe ii concentration between 0 and 0 14 mm was investigated assessing the performance of the vuv h2o2 process in the mineralization of 50 mg l mtbe in the reaction time of 30 min the results are shown in fig 3 it is observed that the degradation and mineralization of mtbe first increased and then decreased with the increase of concentration of fe ii based on fig 3 the highest mtbe degradation and mineralization was 97 5 and 69 4 respectively achieved in fe ii concentration of 0 09 mm although in typical uvc h2o2 systems the addition of iron merely brought an enhancement de la cruz et al 2012 2013 in our work a significant improvement was noted similar to other works with very low iron additions ulliman et al 2018 firstly the enhancement of mtbe degradation and mineralization in the vuv h2o2 process in the presence of fe ii can be justified by providing the fenton reaction in the process eq 16 led to the generation of additional ho moussavi et al 2018b and consequently to the improvement of the mtbe oxidation the fe 3 species could be reduced by illumination of the fe organic ligands through the charge transfer from the ligand to metal ulliman et al 2018 and there is the possibility for the reduction of fe 3 species formed in the fenton reaction by the part of uvc emitted from the vuv lamp providing fe2 available for progressing the fenton reaction moussavi et al 2018b yao et al 2017 and thus the mtbe oxidation 17 fe 3 h 2 o λ 254 nm fe 2 ho h hence the presence of fe ii in the reaction medium could initiate and run the fenton reaction resulted in increasing the amount of ho species corresponding to the achievement of the greater mtbe degradation and mineralization percentages it clearly indicates that the integration of fenton reaction with vuv process had a synergistic effect and accelerated the mtbe oxidation rate however further increase of fe ii concentration to 0 11 and then 0 14 mm inhibited the degradation performance the decrease in mtbe oxidation when the fe concentrations was increased above the optimum level 4 mg l might be due to the fact that fe2 acted as ho scavenger moussavi et al 2018b or due to the light absorption of fe ions 18 fe 2 ho fe 3 oh in summary from the results of fig 3 that the vuv stimulated fenton vuv fe ii h2o2 process could achieve a greater level of mtbe oxidation at this level of fe addition i e 0 09 mm alongside with an 18 higher mtbe degradation 69 of the toc was mineralized compared to the 45 in absence of fe so an extra 24 toc removal is attained further abetting the vuv mediated degradation process 3 3 effect of solution ph on mtbe oxidation in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process the ph of the matrix is one of the most important variables controlling the advanced oxidation reactions burbano et al 2005 the degradation and mineralization of mtbe in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process as a function of initial solution ph is shown in fig 4 based on the experimental data at ph 3 the degradation and mineralization of 50 mg l mtbe was 85 2 and 43 1 respectively the degradation and mineralization performance improved with the increase in solution ph to 7 and reached to 97 4 and 69 5 respectively further increase in solution ph had no considerable effect of the mtbe oxidation one of the main limitations of the fenton reaction is that the optimum performance is usually attained under the acidic ph that is far from the ph of natural waters giannakis 2019 indeed the efficacy of the fenton process in neutral ph is low burbano et al 2005 it demands manipulating first decrease and then increase the contaminated natural water ph to achieve an efficient treatment process making the process complex and cost intensive accordingly this increase in ratio of mtbe deprotonated form was more favorable for oxidation was resulted in the improvement of the mtbe oxidation efficiency in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process up to ph 7 however the mtbe degradation and mineralization efficiency in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process decreased as the solution ph was increased to 8 and then 9 fig 4 this shift can be attributed mainly to the precipitation of fe iii dong et al 2017 generated from eq 16 as well as to the decomposition of h2o2 in alkaline phs hu et al 2008 resulted in hindering the ho generated from the fenton reaction and thereby in reducing the mtbe oxidation rate it has been previously reported that the highest mtbe degradation and mineralization is achieved at the acidic solution ph of 3 in the fenton process bergendahl and thies 2004 burbano et al 2005 in our work attaining the highest mtbe oxidation rate at near neutral ph shows that although beneficial the addition of fe ii is complementary and not the governing degradation pathway the efficacy increase observed after its addition can be related to the formation of soluble fe iii containing complex with the ligands formed during the mtbe oxidation such as carboxylic acids in the process clarizia et al 2017 de luca et al 2014 the fe iii ligand product prevented the precipitation of dissolved iron as ferric hydroxide thus the soluble fe ligand complex make fe iii available for the fenton reactions resulted in achieving high oxidation rate in neutral conditions clarizia et al 2017 de luca et al 2014 attaining the greatest degradation and mineralization of mtbe in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process at the neutral ph close to the ph of natural waters overcomes necessitating ph manipulation adjustment and thus mitigates the operational and maintenance complexity and cost for the field application therefore a neutral ph was selected as the optimum level for the next experiments 3 4 comparative kinetics of mtbe oxidation by uvc or vuv photo assisted fenton process the kinetics of mtbe degradation and mineralization was investigated in the uvc fe ii h2o2 and vuv fe ii h2o2 process as well as their constituents for the comparison mtbe degradation and mineralization experiments were conducted under similar reagent conditions under light fenton and light assisted fenton processes for uvc fig 5 and vuv based processes fig 6 as observed in fig 5 the degradation and mineralization of mtbe increased in all the tested uvc based processes as the reaction time was increased however complete degradation of mtbe was not achieved with any of the studied uvc based processes furthermore the mineralization rate remained relatively low 35 at all times for approximately max 75 elimination of mtbe on the other hand the vuv based processes achieved significantly higher rates fig 6 and almost all processes reached total degradation within 60 min the integrated vuv fe ii h2o2 process reached 100 elimination within 30 min reaction time fig 6 even at a lower uv intensity as compared to the uvc lamp it should be noted here that after 20 min when 99 6 of mtbe was degraded the toc elimination rate showed a sharp increase contrary to any other process uvc or vuv based this indicates the efficacy of the process in the elimination of the generated by products in order to better illustrate the efficacy of the vuv on enhancing the performance of fenton process in mtbe oxidation the degradation and mineralization kinetics were evaluated and the information is given in table 2 considering table 2 the degradation and mineralization of mtbe in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process were about 18 and 27 times of those in the fenton process in addition the vuv as a baseline was much more efficient than the uvc for the photo activation of the fenton reaction to improve the degradation and mineralization of mtbe the rate of mtbe degradation and mineralization in the vuv fe ii h2o2 was about 10 and 5 times of those in the uvc fe ii h2o2 most likely the presence of the 185 nm wavelength has a higher h2o2 homolytic cleavage potential while the possibility of direct vuv degradation of mtbe cannot be excluded finally if one takes into account the residual h2o2 concentrations after the end of the experimental runs presented in table 2 it is evident that the vuv lamps with their different geometry thin water film and the presence of both wavelengths makes significantly more effective use of h2o2 specifically the elevated degradation and mineralization coincide with the lower residual h2o2 values measured suggesting that the vuv lamps are in that sense more cost effective as they make better use of the investment in reagent costs in addition the addition of fe is shown to increase consumption and according to our previous data enhancing the degradation and mineralization of mtbe before we try and dissociate the uvc and vuv based results and gain mechanistic insight on the action mode of the integrated processes table 3 compares the performance of the developed vuv fe ii h2o2 method with the previously reported processes for the degradation and mineralization of mtbe it is clearly observed that the vuv fe ii h2o2 process achieved notable mtbe degradation and mineralization percentages although their kinetics could not possibly be directly compared and there are other cost related parameters to consider e g eeo we attained a high degree of degradation and mineralization without the need for special conditions e g dangerous reagents or toxic nanoparticles that impose environmental and health risks using low amount of oxidants these results highlight the potential of the vuv fe ii h2o2 process as an efficient and applicable process for treating mtbe contaminated effluents 3 5 mechanism of mtbe oxidation in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process synergies scavenger experiments and reaction intermediates monitoring we have presented above the various processes that are involved in the vuv based experiments and highlighted the need to further elucidate mtbe degradation by the integrated vuv fe ii h2o2 process although the main oxidant can reasonably be considered to be ho we attempt to dissect the degradation process and attribute the observed kinetics to the light effects the fenton process and the interplay among fe h2o2 and light in fig 7 we present each constituent of the process separately and two ho scavenger experiments by adding tert butanol tba as a strong ho scavenger to the reaction medium tba concentration 1 g l firstly the importance of ho was verified since addition of tba diminished the reaction kinetics the formation of ho in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process was confirmed and the degradation of mtbe in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process decreased from 99 6 in the absence of tba to 20 in 30 min when tba was added to the reaction medium fig 7 tba is a strong ho scavenger with a second order reaction rate constant of 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 hu et al 2019 therefore the considerable retardation in mtbe degradation rate in the presence of tba clearly indicates that ho was the main oxidative species generated in the developed vuv fe ii h2o2 process and that mtbe was degraded predominantly through ho oxidation mechanism hwang et al 2010 however the addition of tba into the sole vuv process has confirmed the proposition that the water photolysis and the subsequent generation of ho will also lead to mtbe degradation the small difference between vuv and vuv h2o2 shows also that there is possibly a considerable amount of ho recombination that eventually leads to the formation of h2o2 or most likely the recombination of secondary ros such as superoxide and hydroperoxyl radicals secondly another notable point is found when the two tba scavenger experiments are compared as it appears there is a fraction of the degradation that remains un accounted for in order to further elucidate the sequence of events and the relative importance of the constituents of the integrated vuv fe ii h2o2 process the initial reaction rates 30 min were calculated dissociated and summarized in table 4 firstly by subtracting the kinetics found in the vuv and scavenged vuv tba process we can obtain the light induced degradation kinetics of mtbe by 185 and 254 nm together which can lead to mtbe degradation a direct light 185 nm effect on mtbe kavanaugh et al 2003 however taking into account that the uvc mediated degradation was 20 fig 5 the direct 185 nm light effect has to be negligible close to the error margin from the next two processes i e the integrated vuv fe ii h2o2 and the corresponding scavenged one theoretically if only oh are generated by the vuv fe ii h2o2 process then we should have found the same values as the previous consideration as such we propose that the unaccounted difference is due to the superoxide radical generated during the h2o2 mediated reduction of fe3 to fe2 and or a possible lmct between fe and mtbe this process would regenerate fe3 to fe2 by using mtbe or a byproduct of the degradation as a sacrificial ligand electron donor also the superoxide can reduce fe3 back to fe2 in order to re participate in the fenton process and produce further oh towards mtbe degradation or directly react with mtbe furthermore the synergy among the different processes was considered as initial proof of concept the addition of the fenton and the vuv process is found to be considerably smaller than the integrated vuv fe ii h2o2 process however this approach is relatively simplistic hence the vuv fe ii and vuv h2o2 processes have to be firstly considered to properly estimate the synergy of the vuv fe ii h2o2 process by dissociating the vuv effect when fe or h2o2 alone are added in the solution we obtain the isolated extra effect they induce when vuv is present processes 10 13 afterwards the addition of the isolated processes vuv fe h2o2 is still confirmed to be lower than the integrated vuv fe ii h2o2 process and the synergy was calculated as the fraction of the integrated process against the sum of the process a similar procedure was followed also for the comparison of the uvc based processes based on the results given in table 4 the synergistic effect between uvc and fenton was relatively low 1 13 times faster whereas between vuv and fenton reaction was x2 5 times more rapid for the degradation of mtbe it is confirmed that the vuv radiation considerably stimulated the fenton reaction for mtbe degradation mainly through the generation of h2o2 and thereby the formation of extra oh the greater synergistic effect of the irradiation of the fenton reaction with the vuv than uvc photons can be attributed to the greater reactions involved in generating radical species in the vuv fe ii h2o2 eqs 7 11 and thus production of greater amount of radical species than in the uvc fe ii h2o2 process the high synergistic effect between the vuv and the fenton reaction is of the great importance from the field scale application of vuv fe ii h2o2 process for efficient and cost effective treatment of the water and wastewater frontistis et al 2012 finally we have to note here that the process is excessively complex to be broken down to plain subtraction of kinetics and this approach should be considered as a primary approach towards the understanding of the composite treatment concerning the reaction intermediates acetone tba and tbf as the main possible intermediates of mtbe degradation were tracked in the mtbe solution after treatment by the fenton vuv uvc fe ii h2o2 and vuv fe ii h2o2 processes acetone and tba were not detected in the analyzed samples most likely below lod but tbf was detected as the primary intermediate of mtbe degradation fig 8 shows the variation of tbf in the fresh un treated solution and the aops treated solutions based on fig 8 the concentration of tbf was the lowest in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process among the tested aops implying the highest mtbe mineralization achieved in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process due to the high reaction rate of tbf with ho garoma et al 2008 detecting lower concentration of tbf in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process is related to the generation of greater amount of oxidative radicals in the combined fenton and vuv processes compared to the individual ones fact that reconfirms the considerable synergistic effect of combining fenton and vuv irradiation from the experimental data and the revision of the relevant literature on mtbe degradation pathways stefan et al 2000 xu et al 2004 acero et al 2001 in fig 9 we present the pathway proposed for the degradation of mtbe by the vuv fe ii h2o2 process the ho can attack both methoxy group route a or methyl groups route b in the structure of mtbe molecules resulted in the generation of carbon centered radicals the carbon centered radicals formed in reactions 19 and 20 resulted in fabrication of peroxyl radicals respectively 19 c h 3 3 c o c h 3 h o c h 3 3 c o c h 2 h 2 o 20 c h 3 o c c h 3 2 c h 3 h o c h 3 o c c h 3 2 c h 2 h 2 o since ho is electrophilic in nature and the c h bonds around the o2 are in charge of stereo electronic effect the methoxy group in mtbe structure is in priority for ho attack which is resulted in mtbe transformation through the h atom abstraction mechanism depending on the position attacked by oh the degradation of mtbe molecules might be occurred through two routes a and b fig 9 mtbe molecules could be transformed to tba 3 tbf 4 and acetone 5 the results of gc ms analysis conducted on the effluent of the vuv fe ii h2o2 process under optimum conditions indicated that tba and acetone were not detected and tbf was detected as the main intermediate formed during the mtbe degradation furthermore since we found that tbf is the main product of mtbe through ho radicals on the methoxy group it is clearly deduced that the mtbe was degraded through route a fig 9 considering the charge distribution and electrophilic character of hydroxyl radicals the formoyl group in the tbf was more prone to be attacked by ho led to the formation of formic and acetic carboxylic acids stefan et al 2000 xu et al 2004 and finally to the mineralization to co2 and h2o the detection of formic and acetic acids in the effluent sample confirms the pathway proposed for the degradation of mtbe and justify the high mineralization achieved in the developed process 3 6 treatment of a mtbe contaminated groundwater in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process in continuous mode of operation in order to assess the applicability of our process into a real world situation a groundwater sample was spiked with 4 8 mg l mtbe and treated in the continuous flow vuv fe ii h2o2 process to indicate the possible field applicability of the developed process the main physicochemical characteristics of the groundwater sample that affect uv and fenton basrd processes was as follows total hardness 186 mg caco3 l total dissolved solids 317 mg l ph 7 3 fe ii 0 35 mg l fig 10 shows the concentration profiles of mtbe and toc as a function of hrt in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process based on fig 10 the complete degradation and 86 4 mineralization of 4 8 mg l mtbe was achieved in the continuous flow vuv fe ii h2o2 process in the hrt of a few min in natural waters the presence of water matrix components such as counter ions and suspended solids usually poses a challenge in light assisted treatment processes giannakis et al 2017b the naturally present organic substances such as humic acid can act either as a light screen or target for the generated ros a process potentially mitigated by the capacity of humic acid to complex iron and possibly maintain a fenton reaction among the physicochemical parameters tested prior to assessing mtbe degradation in groundwater one has to incorporate the natural turbidity of the samples which scatters and blocks light hampering the degradation efficiency furthermore the presence of bi carbonate ions has a documented effect as a hydroxyl radical scavenger wu and linden 2010 following one of the two pathways depending on the ph that defines the carbonate equilibrium eqs 21 and 22 in our waters the bi carbonate form is prevailing 21 h o h c o 3 c o 3 h 2 o 22 h o c o 3 2 c o 3 h o although the carbonate radical is mildly oxidative and has a longer lifetime in water compared to the hydroxyl radical its lower oxidative potential is decreasing the overall efficacy of the process in real world matrices compared to distilled water giannakis et al 2017c it should be noted here that the bi carbonate ions are not the only ones that affect the process in a similar manner chloride and sulfate ions react with hydroxyl radicals and generate chloride and sulfate radicals respectively these radicals are longer living albeit more selective in the degradation of organic contaminants kiwi et al 2000 marjanovic et al 2018 rodríguez chueca et al 2019 hence they generally reduce the overall efficacy of the treatment process in addition photolysis of nitrate nitrite may lead to further hydroxyl radical generation mack and bolton 1999 in overall our study cannot dissociate the effects of the different ions and in a potential field scale application a slight reduction of the mtbe degradation rate should not come as a surprise nevertheless it is worth pointing out the successful application of the vuv fe ii h2o2 process in our study and that the efficacy of the process in a real water matrix in either batch or continuous mode was significant despite the intrinsic scavenging properties of the water 4 conclusions in this work the effectiveness of different uvc and vuv based aops was compared for the degradation and mineralization of mtbe the highest rate of mtbe oxidation was achieved in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process confirming the efficient acceleration of the fenton reaction by vuv irradiation even at neutral ph the vuv light sensitized fenton process was found to be a desirable enhancement the mechanism of mtbe elimination by the vuv technologies was found to be mainly ho driven and the addition of fe ii and or h2o2 further abet its elimination despite the modest kinetic enhancement when one of the fenton reagents was added their simultaneous presence enhanced mtbe degradation with a higher degree of synergy compared to the classical uvc assisted process and with considerably lower by products generation the process could mineralize mtbe mainly to carboxylic acids and then to co2 and h2o with low tbf formation and undetectable levels of acetone and tba the degradation pathway revealed the intermediate steps towards mtbe degradation and the high mineralization rates observed verify the quick shift towards the low molecular weight compounds finally the application of this technology was not found to be limited by the natural water components that normally impede the uv or ho based processes such as uvc h2o2 or the fenton process more specifically in groundwater contaminated with 4 8 mg l mtbe the complete degradation and 86 4 mineralization could be achieved in the vuv fe ii h2o2 process within an hrt as short as 5 min compared with the batch tests for mtbe aqueous solution to the flow through tests for the contaminated groundwater we report a good match that justifies imagining a transfer of this bench scale technology to a field application the proven effectiveness in groundwater in a continuous mode at near neutral conditions with the addition of fe ii and h2o2 is validated by the conditions encountered in the real water matrix assayed groundwater that leaves promise for upscaling and application of the vuv fe ii h2o2 technology declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18468,the metabolisms of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria related to ammonia oxidation with nitrite reduction and autotrophic carbon fixation have been extensively observed however little is known about the specific metabolic pathways associated with oxygen detoxification and organic carbon utilization to this end we obtained high abundance of anammox species 50 in a lab scale continuous stirred tank reactor cstr at room temperature without strict anaerobic condition the draft genome of the dominant anammox bacteria affiliated to ca brocadia sp was recovered its metabolic pathways and genes expression were reconstructed and examined through metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses interestingly the results suggested that this anammox lineage likely performs oxygen detoxification with genes encoding superoxide dismutase sod and cytochrome c peroxidase ccp moreover the ccp activated hydrogen peroxide intermediate of oxygen detoxification reduction might be energetically beneficial for the observed acetate conversion related to cell synthesis of ca brocadia sp this study offers a comprehensive understanding on the diverse metabolic activities in anammox species affiliated to ca brocadia sp and expanded the applicability of anammox process graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox oxygen detoxification mixotrophic brocadia sp 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox based process has been widely applied to wastewater treatment due to the advantages of both energy and co substrate saving compared to conventional nitrogen removal processes kartal et al 2011 especially the research on mainstream anammox process has gained lots of interests expanding the applicability of anammox process laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2015 till now a variety of full scale deammonification demon and anammox based plants have been developed around the world and most of them are one stage partial nitrification anammox lackner et al 2014 wett et al 2013 in practice anammox enrichment requires suitable environmental conditions such as temperature ph dissolved oxygen substrates etc thuan et al 2004 various types of reactors are available for such enrichment either through the combined process with nitritation or by separate operation single stage or two stage chamchoi and nitisoravut 2007 lopez et al 2008 some reactor configurations intend to form granules or biofilms protecting anammox bacteria from the poisoning caused by oxygen diffusion abma et al 2010 rosenwinkel and cornelius 2005 however these processes are difficult to maintain a strict anaerobic environment specifically for the single stage partial nitrification anammox process low dissolved oxygen do concentration was maintained in the reactor for partial nitrification lackner et al 2014 anammox has been known to grow under limited do condition but the relevant mechanism is not well known moreover anammox bacteria could even survive under oxygen exposure liu et al 2008 previous study revealed that suspended anammox cell identified as ca brocadia sp 40 survived in partial nitrification anammox pn a system under do concentration of 0 1 0 16 mg l yeshi et al 2016 anammox species are currently regarded as anaerobic bacteria chamchoi and nitisoravut 2007 and anaerobic bacteria would be poisoned by superoxide o2 or hydrogen peroxide h2o2 due to the lack none of catalase or superoxide dismutase sod mccord et al 1971 in the presence of dissolved oxygen molecular oxygen transported from the environment is converted into superoxide o2 in the cell termed reactive oxygen species ros which are toxic to anaerobic bacteria bryukhanov et al 2015 and we explored and annotated the genes in previously sequenced anammox genomes and found the presence of gene encoding sod fe mn family sod2 associated with the conversion of o2 to h2o2 in ca brocadia sp 40 samn05817826 ali et al 2016 ca brocadia sinica jpn1 samd00036619 oshiki et al 2015 and ca brocadia fulgida samn03103735 ferousi et al 2013 this indicates the potential capacity of oxygen detoxification by anammox bacteria hence it is vital to comprehensively understand the oxygen detoxification mechanism in anammox bacteria extra electron is generally required by relevant enzymes in the process of oxygen detoxification to reduce superoxide mccord et al 1971 apart from ammonia as the electron donor by anammox bacteria organic carbon sources might also serve as the one though anammox bacteria are initially considered as autotrophs and utilize inorganic carbon through wood ljungdahl pathway for cell synthesis kartal et al 2008 2012 genome based information combined with reactor performance revealed that they were susceptible to be affected by the addition of organic carbon leal et al 2016 li et al 2015 shu et al 2016 for example metabolomic study revealed that acetate addition triggered the conversion of adenosine triphosphate atp to adenosine monophosphate amp in candidatus brocadia feng et al 2018 likewise the phenomenon of organics utilization was observed in other anammox cultures gori et al 2011 kartal et al 2007 park et al 2017 furthermore nitrate reduction using organic carbon as electron donor in anammox bacteria termed dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra was also reported winkler et al 2012 in addition to external organic utilization extracellular polymeric substances eps secretion by anammox bacteria for adaptation to an unfavorable environment was also revealed tang et al 2011 hence it is also important to explore the pathway of organic carbon utilization in anammox bacteria here we set up a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr to obtain high abundance of anammox bacteria without strict anaerobic condition through inoculating the dried power sludge from a full scale simultaneous partial nitrification anammox and denitrification snad particular interest was to elucidate the capabilities of oxygen detoxification and mixotrophic metabolism nitrogen transformation and carbon metabolism in anammox bacteria to this end metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses were performed to reconstruct the metabolic pathways and examine the gene expression profiles from the recovered anammox genome these findings reveal the potential metabolic mechanism in anammox bacteria and widen the application of anammox based processes 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor set up inoculum and operation strategy a lab scale anammox continuously stirred tank reactor cstr with an effective volume of 1 0 l was set

raw reads were processed using mothur software to remove chimeric and low quality sequences the obtained high quality sequences with an average length of 440 bp were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with 97 similarity cutoff and assigned to the silva reference database 2 4 whole genome metagenomics sequencing whole genome metagenome sequencing was performed to recover genomes

metatranscriptomics library construction and analysis metatranscriptomics analysis was performed to access the expressed functional genes in recovered anammox genome sludge sample for metatranscriptomics analysis was collected at the same time as metagenomic sampling about 5 ml mixed liquor was collected from the reactor and added 10 ml buffer qiagen rnaprotect bacteria reagent to protect the rna sample the mixed sludge sample was sent to bgi company shenzhen china for rna extraction and library construction and was sequenced using the illumina hiseq4000 platform

number srp150295 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance the cstr was operated continuously at room temperature for 300 days to cultivate anammox bacteria during the whole operational period the reactor ph and do concentration were around 7 5 8 0 and 0 0 4 mg l respectively the overall nitrogen removal performance was shown in fig 1 the operational period was divided into three stages based on the hydraulic retention time hrt at stage i days 1 75 the reactor was fed with an average concentration of 25 55 mg l of nh4 n and 31 88 mg l no2 n fig 1a corresponding to a nitrogen loading rate nlr of 0 119 kg n m3 d fig 1b the total nitrogen removal efficiency tnre increased gradually and reached around 60 on day 55 at stage ii days 76 147 hrt was reduced from 12 to 9 6 h resulting in an increase of nlr from 0 192 to 0 337 kg n m3 d it should be noted that the nitrogen removal performance deteriorated suddenly with an increase of nlr from 0 189 to 0 288 kg n m3 d on day 117 representing a decrease of tnre from 66 24 to 32 04 the tnre reverted to 54 11 slowly even nlr further increased to 0 338 kg n m3 d at stage iii days 148 294 nlr increased from 0 408 to 1 277 kg n m3 d gradually due to the shorten of hrt from 9 6 to 7 6 h and the increase of substrates nh4 n and no2 n concentration the nitrogen removal performance increased constantly with a tnre of 80 at the end of this study simultaneously the reactor reached a nrr of 1 032 kg n m3 d similar with previous anammox studies bagchi et al 2010 cao et al 2016 guo et al 2016 3 2 the overall shifts of microbial community the microbial community at different operating time in cstr was conducted using 16s rrna amplicon sequencing more than 76550 reads for each sample was generated the community diversity showed an apparent reduction during the enrichment period indicating the population dominance supplementary table 2 taxonomic results showed that the dominant bacteria mainly affiliated with the phyla of planctomycetes proteobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria similar to the dominant phylum in other reported anammox reactors cao et al 2016 guo et al 2016 as except planctomycetes became the most dominant phyla reaching a relative abundance of 50 93 at the end of this study supplementary fig 2a candidatus brocadia was the most dominant genus with a relative abundance of 50 81 in cstr representing for approximate 99 of planctomycetes supplementary figs 2a and 2b the genera sideroxydans was also enriched synchronously with anammox bacteria and responsible for a relative abundance of 12 41 furthermore over 99 sequences of candidatus brocadia belong to one otus cluster indicating almost only one anammox bacterium was enriched in this study 3 3 whole genome metagenomic analysis as high abundance 50 81 of ca brocadia was enriched whole genome metagenomic analyses were performed to recover the draft genome of dominant anammox species and reconstruct its potential metabolic pathways this resulted in the recovery of one high quality draft anammox genome cstr001 maxbin results revealed that cstr001 contained 1 rrna 37 trna and 185 contigs with an n50 of 35660 bp the completeness of recovered cstr001 was 99 94 with a contamination of 1 65 supplementary fig 3 and table 3 the average gc content of cstr001 was 42 3 similar to other recovered anammox genomes around 40 oshiki et al 2015 2016a the genome size was about 3 1 mb with a protein number of 2829 closed to ca brocadia sp 40 supplementary table 3 oshiki et al 2016a 3 4 phylogenetic relationship of recovered anammox genome the 16s rrna sequence in cstr001 genome was extracted using checkm with command of ssu and employed to access the phylogenetic relationship between recovered cstr001 genome and other published anammox species fig 2 a the neighbor joining phylogenetic tree showed a similarity of 99 between cstr001 and ca brocadia sp moreover taxonomic analysis and phylogenetic tree by 16s rrna sequence revealed that cstr001 was classified into the genus of ca brocadia therefore whole genome phylogenetic tree was constructed between cstr001 genome and reference anammox genomes belonging to ca brocadia genus fig 2b this analysis verified the results conducted above and further confirmed that cstr001 was one strain of ca brocadia sp furthermore average nucleotide identity anib and nucleotides alignment af were used to compare the relatedness between cstr001 and above six published ca brocadia genomes fig 2c the results revealed that cstr001 was most similar to ca brocadia r4w10303 among these reference anammox genomes correspondingly the observed values of anib and af were higher than 96 and 84 respectively fig 2c bring the results from taxonomic classification phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna sequence whole genome and anib value together it indicated that the recovered cstr001 genome belonged to the strain of ca brocadia sp 3 5 metabolism pathways in anammox genome 3 5 1 nitrogen metabolic pathway the nitrogen metabolic pathway was recovered and annotated in cstr001 fig 3 a to date genes relevant to ammonium nitrite and nitrate transporters have been reported in reference anammox genomes the observed cstr001 contains two copies of nitrate nitrite transporter nrt one copy of ammonium transporter amt and formate nitrite transporter foca supplementary table 4a the presence of nrt in cstr001 indicated its potential capability on nitrate utilization ammonium and nitrite nh4 n and no2 n are the two main substrates for anammox bacteria nitrite was reduced to nitric oxide no by nitric oxidenitrite oxidoreductase nirs or copper based nirk type nitrite reductase kartal et al 2007 however anammox species of ca brocadia sinica and ca brocadia fulgida may employ an unidentified gene for nitrite reduction when nirk s genes are absent gori et al 2011 oshiki et al 2016a notably ca brocadia sinica may reduce nitrite to hydroxylamine rather than nitric oxide as intermediate oshiki et al 2016a in this study neither nirs nor nirk genes were recovered in cstr001 genome suggesting cstr001 might utilize unidentified genes to generate hydroxylamine or no from nitrite reduction hydrazine synthase subunit hzs that converts ammonium and nitric oxide into hydrazine has been recognized as the specific gene for anammox bacteria known as three types hzsa hzsb and hzsc harhangi et al 2012 oshiki et al 2016a and 2016b strous et al 2006 therefore hzs encoding genes were used to identify the anammox organisms in this study two copies of the hzs genes hzsa and hzsc from the cstr001 aligned with high nucleotide identities 95 and 92 to ca brocadia fulgida samn03103735 using local blastp supplementary table 4a gori et al 2011 metatranscriptomic results showed that gene hzs especially hzsa cluster was one of most highly expressed genes revealing its activity in nitrogen transformation fig 3b six copies of hydroxylamine oxidoreductase like hao like genes converting hydrazine and ammonium into nitrogen gas were observed in cstr001 supplementary table 4a all of these hao like genes were highly expressed in cstr001 fig 3b suggesting the metabolic flexibility of nitrogen gas generation additionally the genes encoded nitrate reductase narg nitrite reductase nadh large submit nirb and cytochrome c 552 nrfa cytochrome c nitrite reductase small submit nrfh were highly expressed in this study indicating this anammox strain could perform dnra pathway to reduce nitrate into nitrite and further to ammonium 3 5 2 oxygen detoxification and potential energy conservation in this study non strict anaerobic condition was likely to create micro oxygen regions in the cstr here a proposed fundamental mechanism for oxygen detoxification in anammox bacteria was found in the study fig 4 a genes encoding superoxide dismutase fe mn family sod2 and superoxide reductase dfx were observed in the cstr001 which converted o2 to hydrogen peroxide h2o2 interestingly the sod2 rather than the dfx gene was highly expressed in cstr001 suggesting the anammox species cstr001 abundant in the cstr developed an intrinsic mechanism for oxygen detoxification fig 4b the evolutionary pressure induces organisms develop intrinsic mechanism with sod for superoxide detoxification for instance the sod2 gene observed in this study has been found even in methanogens miller 2012 to date three distinct families of superoxide dismutase have been reported i e copper zinc superoxide dismutase cu znsod iron manganese superoxide dismutase fe mnsod and nickel superoxide dismutase nisod miller 2012 the fesod is the most primitive version however some organisms evolved another version of sod that requires mn for activity the driving force for sod evolution may be resulted from the changes on the employment of inorganic chemical composition though fesod and mnsod appear from a common ancestor they evolved into different clusters wolfesimon et al 2005 in anaerobic bacteria both fesod and mnsod are found whereas fesod has not yet been found in aerobic bacteria dos santos et al 2000 some organisms possess fe mnsods that trend to emphasize fe or mn for superoxide metabolism based on the specific conditions specifically mn is more emphasized in the activated sod under aerobic condition whereas fe under anaerobic condition amo et al 2003 hence the activation of sod in anammox bacteria may be complicated since they survive under anoxic condition although o2 was detoxified by sod2 the product h2o2 still had strong oxidizing properties that could cause the damage of dna and protein the downstream process for h2o2 detoxification was likely to be performed by genes encoding cytochrome c peroxidase ccp menaquinol cytochrome c reductase iron sulfur subunit mqcra and nadh quinone oxidoreductase nuo kaya et al 2017 which reduced h2o2 into h2o in this study these genes were all highly expressed in cstr001 fig 4b and supplementary table 4b besides the major genes encoding catalase cat ascorbate peroxidase apx and glutathione peroxidase gpx also play key roles in h2o2 detoxification kapoor et al 2015a miller 2012 however they are absent in cstr001 here the ccp can use h2o2 as the electron acceptor for electron capture which probably from the periplasmic quinone pool under anoxic conditions kaya et al 2017 different from cat converting h2o2 to o2 the product by ccp is h2o as is for apx and gpx nonetheless the mechanism for apx is different from ccp which utilizes ascorbic acid as a substrate for the reduction of h2o2 in the ascorbate glutathione cycle ascorbate is oxidized to mono dehydroascorbate with the conversion of h2o2 to h2o and the produced mono dehydroascorbate is reversely dissociated to ascorbate and dehydroascorbate gapper and dolan 2006 similar to apx gpx also uses reduced glutathione regeneration system as an electron donor for h2o2 detoxification indeed the previous study also confirmed that ccp could degrade micromolar h2o2 in e coli at substantial rates under anoxic conditions khademian and imlay 2017 recently gene ccp involved in peroxide metabolism was observed in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes e g saccharomyces cerevisiae budding yeast kaya et al 2017 in this study gene ccp was recovered with a high gene expression value of rpkm of 9 60 in cstr001 moreover it is also reported that ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase cytochrome b subunit cytb is involved in the peroxide metabolism under aerobic conditions where ubiquinone q acts as a role to reduce the oxidation of apx in h2o2 metabolism pathway we recovered one gene encoding cytb with a high gene expression value of rpkm 8 84 in cstr001 however previous studies found that the oxidation of ccp was reduced by menaquinone mq rather than ubiquinone q kaya et al 2017 khademian and imlay 2017 in this study highly expressed mqcra gene rpkm 9 54 was also identified in cstr001 as a result it indicated that oxygen detoxification pathway in cstr001was likely to be performed by the conjoint actions of sod2 ccp and mqcra based on the results conducted by kaya et al 2017 the main function of ccp is to facilitate electron transport from a primary electron donor non fermentable carbon sources to h2o2 for energy production in bacteria leaving h2o2 detoxification as a second function additionally ccp were only activated when o2 and subsequent h2o2 were present in the low concentrations this raises the hypothesis that highly expressed ccp of oxygen detoxification observed in the anammox bacteria maybe associated with the respiratory growth based on the nonfermentable carbon utilization actually it represents a significantly beneficial use of h2o2 in the metabolism of anammox bacteria the presence of dissolved oxygen in the influent possibly resulted the production of exogenous and endogenous h2o2 which in turn activate the expression of anammox bacterial ccp the expressed ccp allows anammox not only to utilize primary organic matter for bioenergetic conservation but also to protect their perrplasm from h2o2 toxicity meanwhile the activated ccp in ca brocadia sp might regulate its energy conservation for biomass synthesis which is discussed in the next section 3 5 3 carbon assimilation in mixotrophic mode anammox species has widely been assumed to live autotrophically by fixation atmospheric co2 via the reductive acetyl coa pathway kartal et al 2008 park et al 2017 strous et al 2006 in this study the genome cstr001 contained a complete set of expressed genes encoding in the wood ljungdahl pathway supplementary table s4 c including two key enzymes co dehydrogenase and acetyl coa synthase acs fig 5 it suggested that this anammox lineage could reduce co2 to co and subsequently combine the resulting co with a methyl group to form acetyl coa which is an essential intermediate for the synthesis of cellular components to couple with this carbon assimilation energy derived from anammox reaction was considered to drive the fixation of co2 into biomass constituting an autotrophic lifestyle in this anammox bacteria in addition to autotrophic cell synthesis the ability of anammox bacteria to utilize organic matters as electron acceptor has drawn extensive attention recently russ et al 2012 found an amp forming acetyl coa synthetase gene acs of kuenenia stuttgartiensis could be functionally expressed to convert acetate to acetyl coa in escherichia coli in this study acs gene with an expression value of rpkm 10 29 was also retrieved in genome cstr001 indicating that this anammox lineage could directly incorporate acetate for cell biomass via reductive acetyl coa pathway under mixotrophic conditions even if no acetate was added in the influent anammox bacteria might use organic matters produced by the endogenous degradation or soluble microbial products smp from other microbial species in the system thus this anammox lineage was more likely to grow mixotrophically rather than autotrophically in the reactor here low influent nitrogen concentrations might be the reason for the dominance of such mixotrophic anammox where insufficient nitrogen might only support a slow growth via co2 fixation whereas acetate derived carbon might supply the additional cellular components to trigger faster growth based upon this hypothesis the coupled energy to drive such acetate conversion into biomass maybe resulted from the oxidation of organic compounds rather than traditional anammox reaction in such mixotrophic anammox bacteria therefore above mentioned ccp controlled electron transport from non fermentable carbon source to h2o2 could be proposed as a candidate for energy production to facilitate acetate incorporation into biomass however because the activation of ccp is sensitive to the available amount of o2 it is still unclear the affordable do range for oxygen detoxification in anammox bacteria in addition genome cstr001 also contained the genes involved in central carbon metabolic pathways including the embden meyerhof parnas emp pathway the citrate cycle tac cycle and the ribulose monophosphate rump pathway key genes encoding these three pathways were highly expressed rpkm 7 29 except gene rpib that converting ribulose 5p to ribose 5p in rump pathway additionally genes encoding citrate synthase glta associated with the synthesis of citrate and fructose bisphosphate aldolase class i stewart et al 2012 functioned on fructose 1 6p2 formation were missing from the cstr001 genome perhaps it may be a result of assembled gaps in cstr001 genome the central carbon metabolic pathway has a central role in both carbon anabolism and catabolism in all three domains of life recently lawson et al 2017 have proposed the synthesis pathways of amino acids via central carbon metabolism in one anammox genome affiliated with ca brocadia therefore the recovered central carbon metabolic pathways in this study might be also important in anammox carbon assimilation 3 6 engineering implications considering the potential of mainstream anammox applications it is important to quickly enrich anammox bacteria and maintain its stable performance in contrast to the lab scale reactors mainstream applications are constrained by various conditions for example the do level in a full scale reactor especially in the single stage pn a systems could not be homogenous but fluctuated considered as one key inhibition factor on anammox bacteria however with its various metabolisms gradually revealed in anammox bacteria it urges a re evaluation of the view of anammox bacteria under mainstream conditions as was demonstrated in this study for a wide range of environments for instance do and c n ratio perhaps to varying extents anammox bacteria could even benefit from these conditions with faster enrichment and higher activity at engineered controllable conditions if this is the case the application of mainstream anammox could be positively impacted with the standard characteristics of sewage and no enriched anammox seed needed 4 conclusions this study demonstrates diverse metabolisms associated with the oxygen detoxification mixotrophic growth ability or even coupling both in cstr001 affiliated to the strain of ca brocadia sp these findings are beneficial for mainstream anammox applications with a first stage carbon removal through either energy efficient aeration or anaerobic treatment a low c n ratio treated sewage is suitable for the following up nitritation anammox process in the second stage importantly the identified oxygen detoxification mechanism suggests that the short foot print nitritation anammox process in one reactor is feasible the oxygen detoxification pathway released also indicates the possibility of energy generation or cell synthesis via organic carbon metabolism regulation by anammox bacteria the remaining biochemical oxygen demand bod e g smp short chain volatile fatty acids vfas can serve as organic sources for anammox bacteria as the sewage influent and operational conditions are generally unstable for the traditional anammox metabolism its versatility in both inorganic and organic carbon for energy harvesting or cell synthesis in cstr001 has promise for the system adaptability and stability further investigation in what do range should be acceptable for anammox bacteria is essential this study raises a new horizon for our understanding of anammox metabolism and its mainstream application declaration of competing interest the authors

18468,the metabolisms of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria related to ammonia oxidation with nitrite reduction and autotrophic carbon fixation have been extensively observed however little is known about the specific metabolic pathways associated with oxygen detoxification and organic carbon utilization to this end we obtained high abundance of anammox species 50 in a lab scale continuous stirred tank reactor cstr at room temperature without strict anaerobic condition the draft genome of the dominant anammox bacteria affiliated to ca brocadia sp was recovered its metabolic pathways and genes expression were reconstructed and examined through metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses interestingly the results suggested that this anammox lineage likely performs oxygen detoxification with genes encoding superoxide dismutase sod and cytochrome c peroxidase ccp moreover the ccp activated hydrogen peroxide intermediate of oxygen detoxification reduction might be energetically beneficial for the observed acetate conversion related to cell synthesis of ca brocadia sp this study offers a comprehensive understanding on the diverse metabolic activities in anammox species affiliated to ca brocadia sp and expanded the applicability of anammox process graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox oxygen detoxification mixotrophic brocadia sp 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox based process has been widely applied to wastewater treatment due to the advantages of both energy and co substrate saving compared to conventional nitrogen removal processes kartal et al 2011 especially the research on mainstream anammox process has gained lots of interests expanding the applicability of anammox process laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2015 till now a variety of full scale deammonification demon and anammox based plants have been developed around the world and most of them are one stage partial nitrification anammox lackner et al 2014 wett et al 2013 in practice anammox enrichment requires suitable environmental conditions such as temperature ph dissolved oxygen substrates etc thuan et al 2004 various types of reactors are available for such enrichment either through the combined process with nitritation or by separate operation single stage or two stage chamchoi and nitisoravut 2007 lopez et al 2008 some reactor configurations intend to form granules or biofilms protecting anammox bacteria from the poisoning caused by oxygen diffusion abma et al 2010 rosenwinkel and cornelius 2005 however these processes are difficult to maintain a strict anaerobic environment specifically for the single stage partial nitrification anammox process low dissolved oxygen do concentration was maintained in the reactor for partial nitrification lackner et al 2014 anammox has been known to grow under limited do condition but the relevant mechanism is not well known moreover anammox bacteria could even survive under oxygen exposure liu et al 2008 previous study revealed that suspended anammox cell identified as ca brocadia sp 40 survived in partial nitrification anammox pn a system under do concentration of 0 1 0 16 mg l yeshi et al 2016 anammox species are currently regarded as anaerobic bacteria chamchoi and nitisoravut 2007 and anaerobic bacteria would be poisoned by superoxide o2 or hydrogen peroxide h2o2 due to the lack none of catalase or superoxide dismutase sod mccord et al 1971 in the presence of dissolved oxygen molecular oxygen transported from the environment is converted into superoxide o2 in the cell termed reactive oxygen species ros which are toxic to anaerobic bacteria bryukhanov et al 2015 and we explored and annotated the genes in previously sequenced anammox genomes and found the presence of gene encoding sod fe mn family sod2 associated with the conversion of o2 to h2o2 in ca brocadia sp 40 samn05817826 ali et al 2016 ca brocadia sinica jpn1 samd00036619 oshiki et al 2015 and ca brocadia fulgida samn03103735 ferousi et al 2013 this indicates the potential capacity of oxygen detoxification by anammox bacteria hence it is vital to comprehensively understand the oxygen detoxification mechanism in anammox bacteria extra electron is generally required by relevant enzymes in the process of oxygen detoxification to reduce superoxide mccord et al 1971 apart from ammonia as the electron donor by anammox bacteria organic carbon sources might also serve as the one though anammox bacteria are initially considered as autotrophs and utilize inorganic carbon through wood ljungdahl pathway for cell synthesis kartal et al 2008 2012 genome based information combined with reactor performance revealed that they were susceptible to be affected by the addition of organic carbon leal et al 2016 li et al 2015 shu et al 2016 for example metabolomic study revealed that acetate addition triggered the conversion of adenosine triphosphate atp to adenosine monophosphate amp in candidatus brocadia feng et al 2018 likewise the phenomenon of organics utilization was observed in other anammox cultures gori et al 2011 kartal et al 2007 park et al 2017 furthermore nitrate reduction using organic carbon as electron donor in anammox bacteria termed dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra was also reported winkler et al 2012 in addition to external organic utilization extracellular polymeric substances eps secretion by anammox bacteria for adaptation to an unfavorable environment was also revealed tang et al 2011 hence it is also important to explore the pathway of organic carbon utilization in anammox bacteria here we set up a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr to obtain high abundance of anammox bacteria without strict anaerobic condition through inoculating the dried power sludge from a full scale simultaneous partial nitrification anammox and denitrification snad particular interest was to elucidate the capabilities of oxygen detoxification and mixotrophic metabolism nitrogen transformation and carbon metabolism in anammox bacteria to this end metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses were performed to reconstruct the metabolic pathways and examine the gene expression profiles from the recovered anammox genome these findings reveal the potential metabolic mechanism in anammox bacteria and widen the application of anammox based processes 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor set up inoculum and operation strategy a lab scale anammox continuously stirred tank reactor cstr with an effective volume of 1 0 l was set up and operated with continuous mode supplementary fig 1 at room temperature magnetic stirring with 50 rpm was used for mixing in the reactor biomass was intercepted through the inclined plate

raw reads were processed using mothur software to remove chimeric and low quality sequences the obtained high quality sequences with an average length of 440 bp were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with 97 similarity cutoff and assigned to the silva reference database 2 4 whole genome metagenomics sequencing whole genome metagenome sequencing was performed to recover genomes

metatranscriptomics library construction and analysis metatranscriptomics analysis was performed to access the expressed functional genes in recovered anammox genome sludge sample for metatranscriptomics analysis was collected at the same time as metagenomic sampling about 5 ml mixed liquor was collected from the reactor and added 10 ml buffer qiagen rnaprotect bacteria reagent to protect the rna sample the mixed sludge sample was sent to bgi company shenzhen china for rna extraction and library construction and was sequenced using the illumina hiseq4000 platform

number srp150295 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance the cstr was operated continuously at room temperature for 300 days to cultivate anammox bacteria during the whole operational period the reactor ph and do concentration were around 7 5 8 0 and 0 0 4 mg l respectively the overall nitrogen removal performance was shown in fig 1 the operational period was divided into three stages based on the hydraulic retention time hrt at stage i days 1 75 the reactor was fed with an average concentration of 25 55 mg l of nh4 n and 31 88 mg l no2 n fig 1a corresponding to a nitrogen loading rate nlr of 0 119 kg n m3 d fig 1b the total nitrogen removal efficiency tnre increased gradually and reached around 60 on day 55 at stage ii days 76 147 hrt was reduced from 12 to 9 6 h resulting in an increase of nlr from 0 192 to 0 337 kg n m3 d it should be noted that the nitrogen removal performance deteriorated suddenly with an increase of nlr from 0 189 to 0 288 kg n m3 d on day 117 representing a decrease of tnre from 66 24 to 32 04 the tnre reverted to 54 11 slowly even nlr further increased to 0 338 kg n m3 d at stage iii days 148 294 nlr increased from 0 408 to 1 277 kg n m3 d gradually due to the shorten of hrt from 9 6 to 7 6 h and the increase of substrates nh4 n and no2 n concentration the nitrogen removal performance increased constantly with a tnre of 80 at the end of this study simultaneously the reactor reached a nrr of 1 032 kg n m3 d similar with previous anammox studies bagchi et al 2010 cao et al 2016 guo et al 2016 3 2 the overall shifts of microbial community the microbial community at different operating time in cstr was conducted using 16s rrna amplicon sequencing more than 76550 reads for each sample was generated the community diversity showed an apparent reduction during the enrichment period indicating the population dominance supplementary table 2 taxonomic results showed that the dominant bacteria mainly affiliated with the phyla of planctomycetes proteobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria similar to the dominant phylum in other reported anammox reactors cao et al 2016 guo et al 2016 as except planctomycetes became the most dominant phyla reaching a relative abundance of 50 93 at the end of this study supplementary fig 2a candidatus brocadia was the most dominant genus with a relative abundance of 50 81 in cstr representing for approximate 99 of planctomycetes supplementary figs 2a and 2b the genera sideroxydans was also enriched synchronously with anammox bacteria and responsible for a relative abundance of 12 41 furthermore over 99 sequences of candidatus brocadia belong to one otus cluster indicating almost only one anammox bacterium was enriched in this study 3 3 whole genome metagenomic analysis as high abundance 50 81 of ca brocadia was enriched whole genome metagenomic analyses were performed to recover the draft genome of dominant anammox species and reconstruct its potential metabolic pathways this resulted in the recovery of one high quality draft anammox genome cstr001 maxbin results revealed that cstr001 contained 1 rrna 37 trna and 185 contigs with an n50 of 35660 bp the completeness of recovered cstr001 was 99 94 with a contamination of 1 65 supplementary fig 3 and table 3 the average gc content of cstr001 was 42 3 similar to other recovered anammox genomes around 40 oshiki et al 2015 2016a the genome size was about 3 1 mb with a protein number of 2829 closed to ca brocadia sp 40 supplementary table 3 oshiki et al 2016a 3 4 phylogenetic relationship of recovered anammox genome the 16s rrna sequence in cstr001 genome was extracted using checkm with command of ssu and employed to access the phylogenetic relationship between recovered cstr001 genome and other published anammox species fig 2 a the neighbor joining phylogenetic tree showed a similarity of 99 between cstr001 and ca brocadia sp moreover taxonomic analysis and phylogenetic tree by 16s rrna sequence revealed that cstr001 was classified into the genus of ca brocadia therefore whole genome phylogenetic tree was constructed between cstr001 genome and reference anammox genomes belonging to ca brocadia genus fig 2b this analysis verified the results conducted above and further confirmed that cstr001 was one strain of ca brocadia sp furthermore average nucleotide identity anib and nucleotides alignment af were used to compare the relatedness between cstr001 and above six published ca brocadia genomes fig 2c the results revealed that cstr001 was most similar to ca brocadia r4w10303 among these reference anammox genomes correspondingly the observed values of anib and af were higher than 96 and 84 respectively fig 2c bring the results from taxonomic classification phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna sequence whole genome and anib value together it indicated that the recovered cstr001 genome belonged to the strain of ca brocadia sp 3 5 metabolism pathways in anammox genome 3 5 1 nitrogen metabolic pathway the nitrogen metabolic pathway was recovered and annotated in cstr001 fig 3 a to date genes relevant to ammonium nitrite and nitrate transporters have been reported in reference anammox genomes the observed cstr001 contains two copies of nitrate nitrite transporter nrt one copy of ammonium transporter amt and formate nitrite transporter foca supplementary table 4a the presence of nrt in cstr001 indicated its potential capability on nitrate utilization ammonium and nitrite nh4 n and no2 n are the two main substrates for anammox bacteria nitrite was reduced to nitric oxide no by nitric oxidenitrite oxidoreductase nirs or copper based nirk type nitrite reductase kartal et al 2007 however anammox species of ca brocadia sinica and ca brocadia fulgida may employ an unidentified gene for nitrite reduction when nirk s genes are absent gori et al 2011 oshiki et al 2016a notably ca brocadia sinica may reduce nitrite to hydroxylamine rather than nitric oxide as intermediate oshiki et al 2016a in this study neither nirs nor nirk genes were recovered in cstr001 genome suggesting cstr001 might utilize unidentified genes to generate hydroxylamine or no from nitrite reduction hydrazine synthase subunit hzs that converts ammonium and nitric oxide into hydrazine has been recognized as the specific gene for anammox bacteria known as three types hzsa hzsb and hzsc harhangi et al 2012 oshiki et al 2016a and 2016b strous et al 2006 therefore hzs encoding genes were used to identify the anammox organisms in this study two copies of the hzs genes hzsa and hzsc from the cstr001 aligned with high nucleotide identities 95 and 92 to ca brocadia fulgida samn03103735 using local blastp supplementary table 4a gori et al 2011 metatranscriptomic results showed that gene hzs especially hzsa cluster was one of most highly expressed genes revealing its activity in nitrogen transformation fig 3b six copies of hydroxylamine oxidoreductase like hao like genes converting hydrazine and ammonium into nitrogen gas were observed in cstr001 supplementary table 4a all of these hao like genes were highly expressed in cstr001 fig 3b suggesting the metabolic flexibility of nitrogen gas generation additionally the genes encoded nitrate reductase narg nitrite reductase nadh large submit nirb and cytochrome c 552 nrfa cytochrome c nitrite reductase small submit nrfh were highly expressed in this study indicating this anammox strain could perform dnra pathway to reduce nitrate into nitrite and further to ammonium 3 5 2 oxygen detoxification and potential energy conservation in this study non strict anaerobic condition was likely to create micro oxygen regions in the cstr here a proposed fundamental mechanism for oxygen detoxification in anammox bacteria was found in the study fig 4 a genes encoding superoxide dismutase fe mn family sod2 and superoxide reductase dfx were observed in the cstr001 which converted o2 to hydrogen peroxide h2o2 interestingly the sod2 rather than the dfx gene was highly expressed in cstr001 suggesting the anammox species cstr001 abundant in the cstr developed an intrinsic mechanism for oxygen detoxification fig 4b the evolutionary pressure induces organisms develop intrinsic mechanism with sod for superoxide detoxification for instance the sod2 gene observed in this study has been found even in methanogens miller 2012 to date three distinct families of superoxide dismutase have been reported i e copper zinc superoxide dismutase cu znsod iron manganese superoxide dismutase fe mnsod and nickel superoxide dismutase nisod miller 2012 the fesod is the most primitive version however some organisms evolved another version of sod that requires mn for activity the driving force for sod evolution may be resulted from the changes on the employment of inorganic chemical composition though fesod and mnsod appear from a common ancestor they evolved into different clusters wolfesimon et al 2005 in anaerobic bacteria both fesod and mnsod are found whereas fesod has not yet been found in aerobic bacteria dos santos et al 2000 some organisms possess fe mnsods that trend to emphasize fe or mn for superoxide metabolism based on the specific conditions specifically mn is more emphasized in the activated sod under aerobic condition whereas fe under anaerobic condition amo et al 2003 hence the activation of sod in anammox bacteria may be complicated since they survive under anoxic condition although o2 was detoxified by sod2 the product h2o2 still had strong oxidizing properties that could cause the damage of dna and protein the downstream process for h2o2 detoxification was likely to be performed by genes encoding cytochrome c peroxidase ccp menaquinol cytochrome c reductase iron sulfur subunit mqcra and nadh quinone oxidoreductase nuo kaya et al 2017 which reduced h2o2 into h2o in this study these genes were all highly expressed in cstr001 fig 4b and supplementary table 4b besides the major genes encoding catalase cat ascorbate peroxidase apx and glutathione peroxidase gpx also play key roles in h2o2 detoxification kapoor et al 2015a miller 2012 however they are absent in cstr001 here the ccp can use h2o2 as the electron acceptor for electron capture which probably from the periplasmic quinone pool under anoxic conditions kaya et al 2017 different from cat converting h2o2 to o2 the product by ccp is h2o as is for apx and gpx nonetheless the mechanism for apx is different from ccp which utilizes ascorbic acid as a substrate for the reduction of h2o2 in the ascorbate glutathione cycle ascorbate is oxidized to mono dehydroascorbate with the conversion of h2o2 to h2o and the produced mono dehydroascorbate is reversely dissociated to ascorbate and dehydroascorbate gapper and dolan 2006 similar to apx gpx also uses reduced glutathione regeneration system as an electron donor for h2o2 detoxification indeed the previous study also confirmed that ccp could degrade micromolar h2o2 in e coli at substantial rates under anoxic conditions khademian and imlay 2017 recently gene ccp involved in peroxide metabolism was observed in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes e g saccharomyces cerevisiae budding yeast kaya et al 2017 in this study gene ccp was recovered with a high gene expression value of rpkm of 9 60 in cstr001 moreover it is also reported that ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase cytochrome b subunit cytb is involved in the peroxide metabolism under aerobic conditions where ubiquinone q acts as a role to reduce the oxidation of apx in h2o2 metabolism pathway we recovered one gene encoding cytb with a high gene expression value of rpkm 8 84 in cstr001 however previous studies found that the oxidation of ccp was reduced by menaquinone mq rather than ubiquinone q kaya et al 2017 khademian and imlay 2017 in this study highly expressed mqcra gene rpkm 9 54 was also identified in cstr001 as a result it indicated that oxygen detoxification pathway in cstr001was likely to be performed by the conjoint actions of sod2 ccp and mqcra based on the results conducted by kaya et al 2017 the main function of ccp is to facilitate electron transport from a primary electron donor non fermentable carbon sources to h2o2 for energy production in bacteria leaving h2o2 detoxification as a second function additionally ccp were only activated when o2 and subsequent h2o2 were present in the low concentrations this raises the hypothesis that highly expressed ccp of oxygen detoxification observed in the anammox bacteria maybe associated with the respiratory growth based on the nonfermentable carbon utilization actually it represents a significantly beneficial use of h2o2 in the metabolism of anammox bacteria the presence of dissolved oxygen in the influent possibly resulted the production of exogenous and endogenous h2o2 which in turn activate the expression of anammox bacterial ccp the expressed ccp allows anammox not only to utilize primary organic matter for bioenergetic conservation but also to protect their perrplasm from h2o2 toxicity meanwhile the activated ccp in ca brocadia sp might regulate its energy conservation for biomass synthesis which is discussed in the next section 3 5 3 carbon assimilation in mixotrophic mode anammox species has widely been assumed to live autotrophically by fixation atmospheric co2 via the reductive acetyl coa pathway kartal et al 2008 park et al 2017 strous et al 2006 in this study the genome cstr001 contained a complete set of expressed genes encoding in the wood ljungdahl pathway supplementary table s4 c including two key enzymes co dehydrogenase and acetyl coa synthase acs fig 5 it suggested that this anammox lineage could reduce co2 to co and subsequently combine the resulting co with a methyl group to form acetyl coa which is an essential intermediate for the synthesis of cellular components to couple with this carbon assimilation energy derived from anammox reaction was considered to drive the fixation of co2 into biomass constituting an autotrophic lifestyle in this anammox bacteria in addition to autotrophic cell synthesis the ability of anammox bacteria to utilize organic matters as electron acceptor has drawn extensive attention recently russ et al 2012 found an amp forming acetyl coa synthetase gene acs of kuenenia stuttgartiensis could be functionally expressed to convert acetate to acetyl coa in escherichia coli in this study acs gene with an expression value of rpkm 10 29 was also retrieved in genome cstr001 indicating that this anammox lineage could directly incorporate acetate for cell biomass via reductive acetyl coa pathway under mixotrophic conditions even if no acetate was added in the influent anammox bacteria might use organic matters produced by the endogenous degradation or soluble microbial products smp from other microbial species in the system thus this anammox lineage was more likely to grow mixotrophically rather than autotrophically in the reactor here low influent nitrogen concentrations might be the reason for the dominance of such mixotrophic anammox where insufficient nitrogen might only support a slow growth via co2 fixation whereas acetate derived carbon might supply the additional cellular components to trigger faster growth based upon this hypothesis the coupled energy to drive such acetate conversion into biomass maybe resulted from the oxidation of organic compounds rather than traditional anammox reaction in such mixotrophic anammox bacteria therefore above mentioned ccp controlled electron transport from non fermentable carbon source to h2o2 could be proposed as a candidate for energy production to facilitate acetate incorporation into biomass however because the activation of ccp is sensitive to the available amount of o2 it is still unclear the affordable do range for oxygen detoxification in anammox bacteria in addition genome cstr001 also contained the genes involved in central carbon metabolic pathways including the embden meyerhof parnas emp pathway the citrate cycle tac cycle and the ribulose monophosphate rump pathway key genes encoding these three pathways were highly expressed rpkm 7 29 except gene rpib that converting ribulose 5p to ribose 5p in rump pathway additionally genes encoding citrate synthase glta associated with the synthesis of citrate and fructose bisphosphate aldolase class i stewart et al 2012 functioned on fructose 1 6p2 formation were missing from the cstr001 genome perhaps it may be a result of assembled gaps in cstr001 genome the central carbon metabolic pathway has a central role in both carbon anabolism and catabolism in all three domains of life recently lawson et al 2017 have proposed the synthesis pathways of amino acids via central carbon metabolism in one anammox genome affiliated with ca brocadia therefore the recovered central carbon metabolic pathways in this study might be also important in anammox carbon assimilation 3 6 engineering implications considering the potential of mainstream anammox applications it is important to quickly enrich anammox bacteria and maintain its stable performance in contrast to the lab scale reactors mainstream applications are constrained by various conditions for example the do level in a full scale reactor especially in the single stage pn a systems could not be homogenous but fluctuated considered as one key inhibition factor on anammox bacteria however with its various metabolisms gradually revealed in anammox bacteria it urges a re evaluation of the view of anammox bacteria under mainstream conditions as was demonstrated in this study for a wide range of environments for instance do and c n ratio perhaps to varying extents anammox bacteria could even benefit from these conditions with faster enrichment and higher activity at engineered controllable conditions if this is the case the application of mainstream anammox could be positively impacted with the standard characteristics of sewage and no enriched anammox seed needed 4 conclusions this study demonstrates diverse metabolisms associated with the oxygen detoxification mixotrophic growth ability or even coupling both in cstr001 affiliated to the strain of ca brocadia sp these findings are beneficial for mainstream anammox applications with a first stage carbon removal through either energy efficient aeration or anaerobic treatment a low c n ratio treated sewage is suitable for the following up nitritation anammox process in the second stage importantly the identified oxygen detoxification mechanism suggests that the short foot print nitritation anammox process in one reactor is feasible the oxygen detoxification pathway released also indicates the possibility of energy generation or cell synthesis via organic carbon metabolism regulation by anammox bacteria the remaining biochemical oxygen demand bod e g smp short chain volatile fatty acids vfas can serve as organic sources for anammox bacteria as the sewage influent and operational conditions are generally unstable for the traditional anammox metabolism its versatility in both inorganic and organic carbon for energy harvesting or cell synthesis in cstr001 has promise for the system adaptability and stability further investigation in what do range should be acceptable for anammox bacteria is essential this study raises a new horizon for our understanding of anammox metabolism and its mainstream application declaration of competing interest the authors

18469,the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes arg in treated effluents of urban wastewater treatment plants wwtp may represent a threat to the environment and public health therefore cost effective technologies contributing to minimize loads of these contaminants in the final effluents of wwtp are required this study aimed at assessing the capacity of coagulation to reduce the arb arg load in secondary treated urban wastewater stww as well as the impact of the process on the structure and diversity of the bacterial community coagulation performance using aluminium sulphate a synthetic substance and tannins a biowaste was compared samples were analysed immediately before stww and after the coagulation treatment alu tan as well as after 3 days storage in the dark at room temperature rstww ralu rtan to assess possible reactivation events both coagulants decreased the turbidity and colour and reduced the bacterial load 16s rrna gene copy number total heterotrophs het and arb faecal coliforms resistant to amoxicillin fc amx or ciprofloxacin fc cip up to 1 2 log immediately after the treatment both coagulants reduced the load of intl1 but in average aluminium sulphate was able to decrease the content of the analysed args bla tem and qnrs to lower levels than tannin reactivation after storage was observed mainly in rtan in these samples the load of the culturable populations and qnrs gene prevalence increased sometimes to values higher than those found in the initial wastewater reactivation was also characterized by an increment in gammaproteobacteria relative abundance in the bacterial community although with distinct patterns for rtan and ralu curvibacter undibacterium and aquaspirillum were among the most abundant genera in ralu and aeromonas pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas in rtan these bacterial community shifts were in agreement with the variations in the culturable bacterial counts of het for rtan and fc cip for ralu in summary the overall performance of aluminium sulphate was better than that of tannins in the treatment of treated urban wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords coagulation arb arg bacterial communities bacterial regrowth 1 introduction the excessive and indiscriminate use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine as well as in animal prophylaxis metaphylaxis and growth promotion has been pointed out to be directly related to the increase in bacterial antibiotic resistance who 2015 who 2017 the antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality and is considered a global public health issue frieri et al 2017 wastewater treatment plants wwtp may have a major role in the dissemination of bacterial resistance and consequently impact on human and environmental health as their effluents may act as sources of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes arg manaia et al 2018 this fact may be related to the selective pressure created by the presence of pollutants in the wastewater such as antibiotics disinfectants and metals which even at low concentrations may favour the acquisition and horizontal gene transference of args karkman et al 2017 kumar et al 2018 wwtp use physical and biological processes to reduce the amount of coarse materials suspended solids organic matter and inorganic nutrients such as phosphorus ammonia and nitrate mustapha et al 2017 although being able to reduce the total load of microorganisms of the sewage the effluents of wwtp operating with a secondary treatment based on conventional activated sludge cas still contain a high number of bacterial cells including arb manaia et al 2009 novo and manaia 2010 indeed the final treated effluents of cas processes may contain up to 107 cfu and 1010 gene copies per 100 ml of arb and args respectively manaia et al 2016 in order to reduce the microbial loads of the treated effluents some wwtps rely on processes such as chlorination ultraviolet radiation ozonation and membrane filtering lamba and ahammad 2017 however the high energy and reagent costs involved are a significant limiting factor in their use rahman et al 2016 moreover despite being effective on the removal of the microbial load some of these disinfection processes did not prevent regrowth of arb arg with the establishment of disturbed bacterial communities in stored treated wastewater becerra castro et al 2016 jia et al 2015 moreira et al 2018 these findings point out the importance of investigating treatment technologies that along with the improvement of physical chemical and biological parameters will assist in reducing the quantity of arb arg in the final treated wastewater and promote a lower imbalance in the bacterial community the use of coagulation is a routine practice in both drinking and wastewater treatment plants sillanpää et al 2018 coagulation is a physicochemical process that reduces the repulsive potential of the colloidal double electrical layer through the use of a coagulating reagent which promotes the aggregation of suspended solids and results in the formation of flocs that can be separated by sedimentation this aggregation phenomenon includes various mechanisms such as charge neutralization capture adsorption and complexation with the coagulant s metallic ions into insoluble aggregates that easily settle henderson et al 2006 coagulation and flocculation are sensitive to factors such as type and nature of turbidity producing substances turbidity levels type and concentration of coagulant ph and the hydrodynamic factors that promote the contact among those colloids bratby 2016 carissimi and rubio 2015 carissimi et al 2018 tebbutt 1998 the commonly used chemical coagulants are aluminium sulphate al2 so4 3 ferric chloride fecl3 ferric sulphate fe2 so4 3 and polyaluminium chloride pac rana and suresh 2017 although ferric based coagulants are highly efficient for colloidal aggregation in wide ranges of ph and temperature its corrosive properties are quite impeditive for industrial applications in water and wastewater treatment plants shi et al 2004 aluminium sulphate is largely employed for coagulation due its low price and simplicity of use however it is frequently associated as a potential risk factor in alzheimer s and other diseases bondy 2016 flaten 2001 freitas et al 2016 green polymeric coagulants are alternative reagents which act in a similar manner causing the aggregation of the particles and enabling the solid liquid separation of the suspended particles many natural organic substances are being studied and validated as potential coagulants flocculants for the treatment of water namely chitosan extracted from crustacean exoskeletons moringa extracted from moringa oleifera seeds and tannins extracted from bark and wood of trees like acacia castanea or schinopsis among others ferreira et al 2011 oladoja 2015 yin 2010 among the many possibilities brazil has available for commercial scale water treatment the tanfloc sg a tannin extracted from the bark of the acacia mearnsii tree recommended by the manufacturer to be used alone or combined with other flocculant agents in the treatment of wastewater of different types of industries or in drinking water production tanac 2013 this is an organic cationic polymer of low molecular weight of essentially vegetable origin which promotes the aggregation of the particles and is used for water and wastewater treatment graham et al 2008 hameed et al 2018 justina et al 2018 besides its good performance on turbidity removal tannin is also reported as environmentally friendly nontoxic and biodegradable what facilitates and makes cheaper the sludge disposal wei et al 2018 the main goal of this work was to assess the potential of coagulation to remove arb arg from the final effluents of a cas process without disturbance of the bacterial community of the final treated stored water due to the commercial availability of tannin from the bark of the acacia mearnsii tree tanfloc sg the effectiveness of this green coagulant was compared to that of aluminium sulphate a commonly used coagulant 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling and experimental design wastewater samples were collected from an urban wwtp located in northern portugal after the secondary sedimentation of the cas process to assess the effect of coagulation on the chemical and biological composition of the treated wastewater the collected samples were divided into four aliquots out of which two were subjected to coagulation treatments with aluminium sulphate and tannin respectively herein named as alu and tan respectively the third aliquot was used as a control of the coagulation process herein named as control which was subjected to the physical processes of agitation and decanting but without the addition of any coagulant the fourth aliquot corresponding to the freshly collected sample herein named as stww was immediately analysed because treatment may cause dramatic bacterial community rearrangements in the final effluents of urban wwtp the changes in the chemical and biological composition of the wastewater induced by storage of the treated wastewater were also assessed for that the collected samples were divided into five aliquots an aliquot of the collected wastewater was immediately stored for three days under darkness at room temperature conditions herein named as rstww to evaluate the effect of storage per se the two other aliquots of the collected sample were subjected to the coagulation treatments and further stored for 3 days herein named as ralu and rtan respectively the fourth and fifth aliquots corresponded to the stww and control as previously described three experimental replicates were assayed with independent water samples collected over the first semester of 2017 the samples were collected on the 10th 24th january and 14th february and were used to assess the capacity of the coagulation treatments on the removal of the microbial load including arb arg as well as on the composition and structure of the bacterial community immediately after the treatment herein noted by 1 3 those collected on the 14th march 21st and 28th april were used to assess the effect of storage of the treated water on the same parameters herein noted by 4 6 2 2 coagulation assays coagulation assays were carried out in a jar test jlt76 velp scientifica italy apparatus with six stirred beakers of 1 l capacity with controlled mixing speed the beakers were filled with 0 5 l of wastewater the coagulation procedure was based on previous reports beltrán heredia and sánchez martín 2009 briefly the assays were carried out at room temperature the samples were immediately stirred at 100 rpm for 2 min to homogenise the coagulant and then at 40 rpm for 30 min before settling for 1 h alu tan ralu rtan simultaneously the control of the coagulation step was performed which was subjected to the same jar test conditions but without the addition of any coagulant control all tests were carried out in triplicate and submitted to physicochemical analyses three aliquots of the same sample were transferred to a sterilized recipient forming a composite sample of 1 5 l for the microbiological analyses the amount of coagulant used per sample replica varied according to the colloids present in each freshly collected wastewater sample with a turbidity range from 12 6 to 24 ntu thus the amount of aluminium sulphate al2 so4 3 14 18 h2o p a a c s synth or tannin tanfloc sg tanac brazil used ranged between 220 and 350 mg l or 50 80 mg l respectively a preliminary jar test assay was carried out to assess the best conditions for the flocs formation to further determine the concentration of each coagulant flocs were not formed with dosages below 220 or 50 mg l or above 350 or 80 mg l for the aluminium sulphate and tannin respectively similar concentrations were found by beltrán heredia and sánchez martín 2009 all the wastewater samples were characterized for turbidity colour ph conductivity and total

recently been updated with relevant taxonomic re classifications being introduced according to the taxonomy reorganization proposed by parks et al 2018 known as gtdb taxonomy available at the genome taxonomy database http gtdb ecogenomic org in these re classifications the class betaproteobacteria integrated a new order in the class gammaproteobacteria betaproteobacteriales parks et al 2018 and the class epsilonproteobacteria became a new phylum named epsilonbacteraeota parks et al 2018 waite et al 2017 after applying the trained classifier to the representative sequences to assign taxonomy chloroplast mitochondria as well as unclassified at the kingdom level not bacteria or archaea derived sequences were removed from the dataset in total 1 137 594 illumina sequence reads were obtained

activation of genes xtreated corresponded to the values obtained after 3 days storage at room temperature physicochemical parameters microbial counts and qpcr data were compared using both two sample statistical test t test for pairwise analysis and one way anova to compare simultaneously treatments and stww samples all these analyses were performed using the bioestat software version 5 0 the permutation multivariate analysis of variance permanova based on weighted unifrac similarities was performed within qiime2 to evaluate if the bacterial communities were grouped by sample and if there were statistically different groups within the analysed bacterial communities moreover the differences on the relative abundance of a given bacterial group from each sample alu tan rstww ralu and rtan in comparison to the untreated control stww was achieved using a pairwise t test with the storey fdr correction for multiple comparisons as implemented in the stamp software v 2 1 3 parks et al 2014 to assess possible correlations between the observed rearrangements in the bacterial communities and the physicochemical and biological parameters measured canonical correspondence analyses cca were

decrease the turbidity and colour of the initial samples stww table 1 the aluminium sulphate was able to remove over 94 of the turbidity registered for the stww samples even after storage of the treated water alu and ralu aluminium sulphate allowed also an average colour reduction of 88 1 immediately after coagulation alu and 75 3 after storage of the treated water ralu the values of turbidity and colour of the samples treated with tannin were slightly higher and less homogeneous than those treated with aluminium sulphate indeed tannin removed about 89 0 of the turbidity and 73 6 of the colour registered for the stww immediately after coagulation tan and 78 7 of the turbidity and 56 2 of the colour after storage rtan considering that the coagulation process contributes to the reduction of natural organic matter henderson et al 2006 this study also assessed the capacity of the tested coagulants to reduce the toc content of the analysed samples aluminium sulphate and tannin were respectively able to remove up to 50 0 and 35 0 of the toc registered in the initial samples stww immediately after coagulation alu and tan and after treated water storage ralu and rtan noteworthy toc reduction up to 29 0 was registered for the stored untreated control wastewater samples rstww in contrast none of the coagulants led to observable alterations in the conductivity in the treated wastewater which varied between 710 and 812 μs cm ph varied between 6 60 and 7 43 differing statistically only in the alu and ralu samples as compared to stww this was an expected result because aluminium sulphate is a strong conjugate acid and reduces the ph of the medium when considering the turbidity colour and total organic carbon of the final treated water samples we can conclude that aluminium sulphate was on average more efficient than tannin however higher doses of aluminium sulphate about 4 times higher on average were used than tannin 3 2 culturable bacterial removal and reactivation to assess if the coagulation process by aluminium sulphate and tannin could promote the aggregation of microbial cells and their further removal through sedimentation of the resulting sludge the culturable bacterial load from the stww was assessed through the enumeration of the total heterotrophic bacteria as well as the faecal coliforms and their amoxicillin or ciprofloxacin resistant counterparts fig 1 a the performance of both coagulants on the bacterial removal was similar being able to remove in average between 1 9 and 2 6 log units corresponding to percentages of removal of 98 3 99 4 of each of the analysed bacterial groups from the initial stww fig 1a and b table s2 similar removal values 1 to 2 log units were observed in other studies carried out with surface water using organic coagulants from moringa oleifera mangifera indica and prunus armeniaca ali et al 2008 aluminium sulphate ho et al 2012 and tanfloc tannin sánchez martín et al 2009 interestingly the prevalence of each targeted culturable group assessed by the ratio between the culturable counts and the 16s rrna copy number used as a proxy for the total number of prokaryotes in the sample decreased after the coagulation process for both coagulants fig 1c such results suggest that other non targeted organisms have less tendency to flocculate than the targeted ones altogether these results suggest that the mechanism of removal of the microbial cells do not differ between aluminium sulphate and tannin being probably both able to neutralize the cells surface charge and promote their aggregation bratby 2016 indeed the behaviour of this commercial tannin has been considered similar to that of conventional aluminium and iron salt coagulants graham et al 2008 despite the capacity of both coagulants to reduce loads of the analysed culturable groups immediately after the treatment further assays were carried out to assess the regrowth capacity after the application of the coagulation process indeed bacterial reactivation during storage of treated water has been widely reported regardless of the type of water and the treatment process fiorentino et al 2015 giannakis et al 2016 2018 malvestiti and dantas 2018 moreira et al 2016 2018 moreira et al 2018 sousa et al 2016 being influenced by parameters such as temperature and availability of carbon and energy sources giannakis et al 2014 ubomba jaswa et al 2009 zhao et al 2014 storage of the initial stww for 3 days at room temperature rstww did not change the load of the analysed culturable bacterial groups fig 1d and e in contrast during storage of samples treated with aluminium sulphate ralu a decrease on the microbial load particularly on ciprofloxacin resistant faecal coliforms was observed fig 1d and e with average log reductions up to 4 6 table s2 inversely during storage of samples treated with tannin rtan the regrowth of all the analysed culturable bacterial groups particularly of the total heterotrophic bacteria was observed fig 1d and e which concentration was significantly higher p 0 01 in rtan than in stww although not statistically significantly different due to the high variation among the samples also the prevalence of the analysed culturable bacterial groups differed in ralu and rtan fig 1f whereas for ralu the prevalence of the targeted groups did not differ total heterotrophs or was lower faecal coliforms and resistant counterparts than that in stww in rtan was in average higher than in stww for all the analysed culturable bacterial groups the ability of bacteria to utilise the organic compounds of this natural coagulant part of which may have dissolved during the coagulation process may explain the regrowth of the culturable populations during storage of the tannin treated samples rtan in contrast the aluminium sulphate may release ions which hamper the development of faecal coliforms bojić et al 2002 3 3 effect of coagulation on args and bacterial community composition given the limitation of the culture based methods to recover the wide diversity of bacteria inhabiting the stww as well as the difficulties on the recovery of stressed cells after the treatments the analyses of total dna based on quantitative pcr was used to assess the efficacy of the tested coagulants on the removal of the bacterial population from the stww as observed for the culturable populations both coagulants were able to reduce the load of the prokaryotic organisms immediately after the treatment as assessed by the number of copies of the 16s rrna gene per millilitre of sample fig 2 a and b which in average was approximately 1 log unit lower in the treated water alu and tan than in the initial stww table s2 similar results were observed for the gene intl1 a proxy for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 indeed intl1 has been linked to multidrug resistance and horizontal gene transference in a wide diversity of bacteria gillings et al 2015 however when analysing the arg bla tem and qnrs respectively encoding for beta lactams and plasmid mediated quinolone resistance coagulation with aluminium sulphate promoted higher removal of these args approximately 1 log reduction in average table s2 from the initial stww than tannin fig 2a however due to the high variance among the samples no clear distinction was observed between the c c0 values of alu and tan for these analysed args alu fig 2b in contrast the prevalence of each of the analysed genes in alu and tan was similar to that found in stww fig 2c despite the high variation during storage of samples treated with aluminium sulphate a decrease on the load of all analysed genes ranging from 0 4 to 1 4 log reduction in average table s2 was observed fig 2d and e in contrast during storage of samples treated with tannin reactivation of bla tem and mainly qnrs which in average reached levels 0 7 log higher than those found in stww was observed fig 2d and e table s2 interestingly whereas the prevalence of intl1 in the all the stored samples was lower than in stww p 0 05 no significant differences were found for bla tem fig 2f in contrast the prevalence of qnrs was higher in rtan than in all the other analysed samples fig 2f in contrast to our findings a coagulation process carried out with fe based coagulants led to 0 5 log to 3 1 log reductions of different classes of args li et al 2017 suggesting a better performance of this type of coagulants than those herein studied nevertheless the effect of storage on the fe based coagulants treated water was not assessed li et al 2017 water treatment processes such as those based on advanced oxidation processes have been described as promoting disturbance of the bacterial communities which in part are due to differential regrowth capacity of distinct bacterial groups becerra castro et al 2016 moreira et al 2018 in this context the effect of the analysed coagulants on the bacterial communities of the treated water was also assessed in this study as expected the bacterial community of the initial stww was diverse comprising members of 32 phyla being proteobacteria 33 47 and bacteroidetes 26 31 the most abundant in accordance with previous reports becerra castro et al 2016 also bacteria affiliated to epsilonbacteraeota 17 14 and firmicutes 3 4 were among the most abundant phyla found in stww figs 3a and 4 a the distribution of the samples in the pcoa biplot fig 5 in particular along axis 1 which depicts 41 4 of the variance found among samples suggests that there were rearrangements in the bacterial communities of ralu and mainly rtan cluster iii fig 5 the permanova analysis indicated significant differences among the analysed groups of samples pseudo f 3 86 p 0 001 in addition the cca biplot indicates that these rearrangements were correlated with the abundance of culturable heterotrophs het and ciprofloxacin resistant faecal coliforms fc cip as well as with turbidity and conductivity fig 6 the abundance of culturable heterotrophs correlated positively with the variance plotted along axis 1 explaining 13 of the total variance pseudo f 2 8 p 0 05 which allowed to separate the bacterial communities of rtan in contrast the abundance of ciprofloxacin resistant faecal coliforms fc cip the turbidity and conductivity were good predictors of the variance plotted along axis 2 explaining respectively 12 2 12 1 and 6 7 of the total variance pseudo f 2 4 2 9 and 1 7 respectively p 0 05 these variables and mainly fc cip contributed to separate the bacterial communities of the initial stww from those of the ralu samples in all the treated stored wastewater samples the abundance of members affiliated to epsilonbacteraeota decreased p 0 05 in comparison to the initial stww fig 4a yet distinct rearrangements were observed regarding the abundance of other groups particularly bacteroidetes and proteobacteria in ralu and rstww the abundance of bacteroidetes respectively decreased and increased p 0 05 in comparison to stww although not significant due to high variation between replicas in ralu and particularly in rtan samples not only alpha but mainly gammaproteobacteria including those of the order betaproteobacteriales increased in comparison to stww fig s1 whereas in rstww only the members affiliated to class alphaproteobacteria increased p 0 05 in comparison to stww the absence of a common trend in the rearrangements occurring in the bacterial community following the storage of the analysed samples was also observed in their alpha diversity values table 2 where the only clear difference was observed in the phylogenetic diversity pd values table 2 being the lowest value observed for rtan samples in fact this loss of phylogenetic diversity agrees with the increase in the abundance of members affiliated to proteobacteria which members represented more than 70 in rtan samples fig 4 moreover in these samples more than 53 of the total relative abundance of bacteria was given by the abundance of organisms affiliated to ten different genera of gammaproteobacteria fig 4b bacterial community members affiliated to the genera aeromonas pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas were among those with higher relative abundance p 0 05 in rtan than in stww 15 6 vs 1 5 5 8 vs 0 3 and 2 4 vs 0 1 respectively although bacterial community analyses do not offer any evidence about antibiotic resistance dissemination it is worthy of note that all these three genera include species with the potential to acquire resistance genes vaz moreira et al 2014 moreover the increase in the abundance of aeromonas spp in the rtan samples might be related with the increase of the qnrs load and prevalence registered following storage fig 2d e f as this gene has been detected in both surface and wastewater aeromonads isolates varela et al 2016 indeed 8 out of 15 asvs affiliated to the genus aeromonas which represented 13 of total abundance of the rtan samples were positively correlated to the abundance of the qnrs gene p 0 005 fig s2 in addition these aeromonads might have contributed to the increase in all culturable groups observed in rtan samples as aeromonads isolates have been recovered from different culture media in particular in those used in this study pca and mfc agar figueira et al 2011 in fact 5 out of 15 asvs affiliated to the genus aeromonas which represented 12 of total abundance of the rtan samples were positively correlated with the abundance of culturable heterotrophs p 0 05 fig 6 in contrast in ralu samples curvibacter undibacterium and aquaspirillum all belonging to the order betaproteobacteriales were among the most abundant genera in comparison with the stww p 0 05 10 6 vs 0 01 6 3 vs 0 01 3 5 vs 0 02 respectively these organisms are ubiquitous in water environments jia et al 2015 kampfer et al 2007 vaz moreira et al 2014 interestingly the genus curvibacter includes members thriving in a nuclear fuel storage pond which are resistant to co2 dekker et al 2014 also undibacterium members tolerant to arsenic as have been isolated from contaminated ground water samples ghosh and sar 2013 thus the ability of these organisms to resist and live in metal enriched contaminated water might explain their increment in the stored wastewater previously treated with aluminium sulphate ralu the dominance of gammaproteobacteria in the treated stored wastewater ralu and rtan may possible explain their separation in a unique cluster iii in the pcoa biplot fig 5 the results herein obtained demonstrate that storage of wastewater following a coagulation treatment with aluminium sulphate or tannin favour the overgrowth of particular gammaproteobacteria members including betaproteobacteriales increments in proteobacterial members have also been reported in wastewater under treatments coupling biological and photocatalysis or ozonation treatments chen et al 2013 esplugas et al 2013 moreover increment in beta or gammaproteobacteria relative abundance in particular pseudomonads as well as args have also been reported for wastewater stored following photolysis ozonation photocatalytic ozonation becerra castro et al 2016 moreira et al 2018 or different solar driven advanced oxidation processes moreira et al 2018 as well as for drinking water following chlorination treatment jia et al 2015 these observations suggest that particular members affiliated to gammaproteobacteria including some betaproteobacteriales have a higher capacity to regrow or are less effectively inactivated or removed during the treatments than the other bacterial community members nevertheless the present study indicated that the most abundant gammaproteobacterial genera were dependent on the coagulant used most important some of those favoured following treatment with tannin were previously described as potentially critical regarding antibiotic resistance dissemination 4 conclusions coagulation with both aluminium sulphate and tannin decreased the turbidity and colour of the secondary treated urban wastewater although aluminium sulphate showed an overall better removal efficiency both coagulants significantly reduced the load of prokaryotic organisms including the analysed arb immediately after the treatment up to 2 log units however following storage of the treated wastewater with tannin this reduction was attenuated with regrowth of these organisms to values significantly higher than or similar to those found in the initial stww both coagulants significantly reduced the load of intl1 even upon storage of the treated wastewater in contrast only aluminium sulphate significantly reduced the load genes bla tem and qnrs immediately after treatment despite the high variation among samples storage of the wastewater treated with tannin led to the increase of the load of bla tem and mainly qnrs to levels higher than those in the initial stww also the prevalence of this last arg was significantly higher in wastewater treated with tannin than in the initial stww the storage of coagulation treated wastewater created the opportunity for rearrangements in the bacterial communities irrespectively of the coagulant stored treated wastewater contained a higher relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria including betaproteobacteriales than the initial stww the abundance of the total heterotrophs correlated with the bacterial communities of the wastewater treated with tannin whereas fc cip better explained those of wastewater treated with aluminium sulphate within gammaproteobacteria curvibacter undibacterium and aquaspirillum betaproteobacteriales prevailed in the aluminium treated stored wastewater whereas aeromonas aeromonadales pseudomonas pseudomonadales and stenotrophomonas xanthomonadales were the most abundant genera in the tannin treated stored wastewater when compared to the initial stww declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

18469,the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes arg in treated effluents of urban wastewater treatment plants wwtp may represent a threat to the environment and public health therefore cost effective technologies contributing to minimize loads of these contaminants in the final effluents of wwtp are required this study aimed at assessing the capacity of coagulation to reduce the arb arg load in secondary treated urban wastewater stww as well as the impact of the process on the structure and diversity of the bacterial community coagulation performance using aluminium sulphate a synthetic substance and tannins a biowaste was compared samples were analysed immediately before stww and after the coagulation treatment alu tan as well as after 3 days storage in the dark at room temperature rstww ralu rtan to assess possible reactivation events both coagulants decreased the turbidity and colour and reduced the bacterial load 16s rrna gene copy number total heterotrophs het and arb faecal coliforms resistant to amoxicillin fc amx or ciprofloxacin fc cip up to 1 2 log immediately after the treatment both coagulants reduced the load of intl1 but in average aluminium sulphate was able to decrease the content of the analysed args bla tem and qnrs to lower levels than tannin reactivation after storage was observed mainly in rtan in these samples the load of the culturable populations and qnrs gene prevalence increased sometimes to values higher than those found in the initial wastewater reactivation was also characterized by an increment in gammaproteobacteria relative abundance in the bacterial community although with distinct patterns for rtan and ralu curvibacter undibacterium and aquaspirillum were among the most abundant genera in ralu and aeromonas pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas in rtan these bacterial community shifts were in agreement with the variations in the culturable bacterial counts of het for rtan and fc cip for ralu in summary the overall performance of aluminium sulphate was better than that of tannins in the treatment of treated urban wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords coagulation arb arg bacterial communities bacterial regrowth 1 introduction the excessive and indiscriminate use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine as well as in animal prophylaxis

associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality and is considered a global public health issue frieri et al 2017 wastewater treatment plants wwtp may have a major role in the dissemination of bacterial resistance and consequently impact on human and environmental health as their effluents may act as sources of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes arg manaia et al 2018 this fact may be related to the selective pressure created by the presence of pollutants in the wastewater such as antibiotics disinfectants and metals which even at low concentrations may favour the acquisition and horizontal gene transference of args karkman et al 2017 kumar et al 2018 wwtp use physical and biological processes to reduce the amount of coarse materials suspended solids organic matter and inorganic nutrients such as phosphorus ammonia and nitrate mustapha et al 2017 although being able to reduce the total load of microorganisms of the sewage the effluents of wwtp operating with a secondary treatment based on conventional activated sludge cas still contain a high number of bacterial cells including arb manaia et al 2009 novo and manaia 2010 indeed the final treated effluents of cas processes may contain up to 107 cfu and 1010 gene copies per 100 ml of arb and args respectively manaia et al 2016 in order to reduce the microbial loads of the treated effluents some wwtps rely on processes such as chlorination ultraviolet radiation ozonation and membrane filtering lamba and ahammad 2017 however the high energy and reagent costs involved are a significant limiting factor in their use rahman et al 2016 moreover despite being effective on the removal of the microbial load some of these disinfection processes did not prevent regrowth of arb arg with the establishment of disturbed bacterial communities in stored treated wastewater becerra castro et al 2016 jia et al 2015 moreira et al 2018 these findings point out the importance of investigating treatment technologies that along with the improvement of physical chemical and biological parameters will assist in reducing the quantity of arb arg in the final treated wastewater and promote a lower imbalance in the bacterial community the use of coagulation is a routine practice in both drinking and wastewater treatment plants sillanpää et al 2018 coagulation is a physicochemical process that reduces the repulsive potential of the colloidal double electrical layer through the use of a coagulating reagent which promotes the aggregation of suspended solids and results in the formation of flocs that can be separated by sedimentation this aggregation phenomenon includes various mechanisms such as charge neutralization capture adsorption and complexation with the coagulant s metallic ions into insoluble aggregates that easily settle henderson et al 2006 coagulation and flocculation are sensitive to factors such as type and nature of turbidity producing substances turbidity levels type and concentration of coagulant ph and the hydrodynamic factors that promote the contact among those colloids bratby 2016 carissimi and rubio 2015 carissimi et al 2018 tebbutt 1998 the commonly used chemical coagulants are aluminium sulphate al2 so4 3 ferric chloride fecl3 ferric sulphate fe2 so4 3 and polyaluminium chloride pac rana and suresh 2017 although ferric based coagulants are highly efficient for colloidal aggregation in wide ranges of ph and temperature its corrosive properties are quite impeditive for industrial applications in water and wastewater treatment plants shi et al 2004 aluminium sulphate is largely employed for coagulation due its low price and simplicity of use however it is frequently associated as a potential risk factor in alzheimer s and other diseases bondy 2016 flaten 2001 freitas et al 2016 green polymeric coagulants are alternative reagents which act in a similar manner causing the aggregation of the particles and enabling the solid liquid separation of the suspended particles many natural organic substances are being studied and validated as potential coagulants flocculants for the treatment of water namely chitosan extracted from crustacean exoskeletons moringa extracted from moringa oleifera seeds and tannins extracted from bark and wood of trees like acacia castanea or schinopsis among others ferreira et al 2011 oladoja 2015 yin 2010 among the many possibilities brazil has available for commercial scale water treatment the tanfloc sg a tannin extracted from the bark of the acacia mearnsii tree recommended by the manufacturer to be used alone or combined with other flocculant agents in the treatment of wastewater of different types of industries or in drinking water production tanac 2013 this is an organic cationic polymer of low molecular weight of essentially vegetable origin which promotes the aggregation of the particles and is used for water and wastewater treatment graham et al 2008 hameed et al 2018 justina et al 2018 besides its good performance on turbidity removal tannin is also reported as environmentally friendly nontoxic and biodegradable what facilitates and makes cheaper the sludge disposal wei et al 2018 the main goal of this work was to assess the potential of coagulation to remove arb arg from the final effluents of a cas process without disturbance of the bacterial community of the final treated stored water due to the commercial availability of tannin from the bark of the acacia mearnsii tree tanfloc sg the effectiveness of this green coagulant was compared to that of aluminium sulphate a commonly used coagulant 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling and experimental design wastewater samples were collected from an urban wwtp located in northern portugal after the secondary sedimentation of the cas process to assess the effect of coagulation on the chemical and biological composition of the treated wastewater the collected samples were divided into four aliquots out of which two were subjected to coagulation treatments with aluminium sulphate and tannin respectively herein named as alu and tan respectively the third aliquot was used as a control of the coagulation process herein named as control which was subjected to the physical processes of agitation and decanting but without the addition of any coagulant the fourth aliquot corresponding to the freshly collected sample herein named as stww was immediately analysed because treatment may cause dramatic bacterial community rearrangements in the final effluents of urban wwtp the changes in the chemical and biological composition of the wastewater induced by storage of the treated wastewater were also assessed for that the collected samples were divided into five aliquots an aliquot of the collected wastewater was immediately stored for three days under darkness at room temperature conditions herein named as rstww to evaluate the effect of storage per se the two other aliquots of the collected sample were subjected to the coagulation treatments and further stored for 3 days herein named as ralu and rtan respectively the fourth and fifth aliquots corresponded to the stww and control as previously described three experimental replicates were assayed with independent water samples collected over the first semester of 2017 the samples were collected on the 10th 24th january and 14th february and were used to assess the capacity of the coagulation treatments on the removal of the microbial load including arb arg as well as on the composition and structure of the bacterial community immediately after the treatment herein noted by 1 3 those collected on the 14th march 21st and 28th april were used to assess the effect of storage of the treated water on the same parameters herein noted by 4 6 2 2 coagulation assays coagulation assays were carried out in a jar test jlt76 velp scientifica italy apparatus with six stirred beakers of 1 l capacity with controlled mixing speed the beakers were filled with 0 5 l of wastewater the coagulation procedure was based on previous reports beltrán heredia and sánchez martín 2009 briefly the assays were carried out at room temperature the samples were immediately stirred at 100 rpm for 2 min to homogenise the coagulant and then at 40 rpm for 30 min before settling for 1 h alu tan ralu rtan simultaneously the control of the coagulation step was performed which was subjected to the same jar test conditions but without the addition of any coagulant control all tests were carried out in triplicate and submitted to physicochemical analyses three aliquots of the same sample were transferred to a sterilized recipient forming a composite sample of 1 5 l for the microbiological analyses the amount of coagulant used per sample replica varied according to the colloids present in each freshly collected wastewater sample with a turbidity range from 12 6 to 24 ntu thus the amount of aluminium sulphate

conditions for the flocs formation to further determine the concentration of each coagulant flocs were not formed with dosages below 220 or 50 mg l or above 350 or 80 mg l for the aluminium sulphate and tannin respectively similar concentrations were found by beltrán heredia and sánchez martín 2009 all the wastewater samples were characterized for turbidity colour ph conductivity and total

chloroplast mitochondria as well as unclassified at the kingdom level not bacteria or archaea derived sequences were removed from the dataset in total 1 137 594 illumina sequence reads were obtained

decrease the turbidity and colour of the initial samples stww table 1 the aluminium sulphate was able to remove over 94 of the turbidity registered for the stww samples even after storage of the treated water alu and ralu aluminium sulphate allowed also an average colour reduction of 88 1 immediately after coagulation alu and 75 3 after storage of the treated water ralu the values of turbidity and colour of the samples treated with tannin were slightly higher and less homogeneous than those treated with aluminium sulphate indeed tannin removed about 89 0 of the turbidity and 73 6 of the colour registered for the stww immediately after coagulation tan and 78 7 of the turbidity and 56 2 of the colour after storage rtan considering that the coagulation process contributes to the reduction of natural organic matter henderson et al 2006 this study also assessed the capacity of the tested coagulants to reduce the toc content of the analysed samples aluminium sulphate and tannin were respectively able to remove up to 50 0 and 35 0 of the toc registered in the initial samples stww immediately after coagulation alu and tan and after treated water storage ralu and rtan noteworthy toc reduction up to 29 0 was registered for the stored untreated control wastewater samples rstww in contrast none of the coagulants led to observable alterations in the conductivity in the treated wastewater which varied between 710 and 812 μs cm ph varied between 6 60 and 7 43 differing statistically only in the alu and ralu samples as compared to stww this was an expected result because aluminium sulphate is a strong conjugate acid and reduces the ph of the medium when considering the turbidity colour and total organic carbon of the final treated water samples we can conclude that aluminium sulphate was on average more efficient than tannin however higher doses of aluminium sulphate about 4 times higher on average were used than tannin 3 2 culturable bacterial removal and reactivation to assess if the coagulation process by aluminium sulphate and tannin could promote the aggregation of microbial cells and their further removal through sedimentation of the resulting sludge the culturable bacterial load from the stww was assessed through the enumeration of the total heterotrophic bacteria as well as the faecal coliforms and their amoxicillin or ciprofloxacin resistant counterparts fig 1 a the performance of both coagulants on the bacterial removal was similar being able to remove in average between 1 9 and 2 6 log units corresponding to percentages of removal of 98 3 99 4 of each of the analysed bacterial groups from the initial stww fig 1a and b table s2 similar removal values 1 to 2 log units were observed in other studies carried out with surface water using organic coagulants from moringa oleifera mangifera indica and prunus armeniaca ali et al 2008 aluminium sulphate ho et al 2012 and tanfloc tannin sánchez martín et al 2009 interestingly the prevalence of each targeted culturable group assessed by the ratio between the culturable counts and the 16s rrna copy number used as a proxy for the total number of prokaryotes in the sample decreased after the coagulation process for both coagulants fig 1c such results suggest that other non targeted organisms have less tendency to flocculate than the targeted ones altogether these results suggest that the mechanism of removal of the microbial cells do not differ between aluminium sulphate and tannin being probably both able to neutralize the cells surface charge and promote their aggregation bratby 2016 indeed the behaviour of this commercial tannin has been considered similar to that of conventional aluminium and iron salt coagulants graham et al 2008 despite the capacity of both coagulants to reduce loads of the analysed culturable groups immediately after the treatment further assays were carried out to assess the regrowth capacity after the application of the coagulation process indeed bacterial reactivation during storage of treated water has been widely reported regardless of the type of water and the treatment process fiorentino et al 2015 giannakis et al 2016 2018 malvestiti and dantas 2018 moreira et al 2016 2018 moreira et al 2018 sousa et al 2016 being influenced by parameters such as temperature and availability of carbon and energy sources giannakis et al 2014 ubomba jaswa et al 2009 zhao et al 2014 storage of the initial stww for 3 days at room temperature rstww did not change the load of the analysed culturable bacterial groups fig 1d and e in contrast during storage of samples treated with aluminium sulphate ralu a decrease on the microbial load particularly on ciprofloxacin resistant faecal coliforms was observed fig 1d and e with average log reductions up to 4 6 table s2 inversely during storage of samples treated with tannin rtan the regrowth of all the analysed culturable bacterial groups particularly of the total heterotrophic bacteria was observed fig 1d and e which concentration was significantly higher p 0 01 in rtan than in stww although not statistically significantly different due to the high variation among the samples also the prevalence of the analysed culturable bacterial groups differed in ralu and rtan fig 1f whereas for ralu the prevalence of the targeted groups did not differ total heterotrophs or was lower faecal coliforms and resistant counterparts than that in stww in rtan was in average higher than in stww for all the analysed culturable bacterial groups the ability of bacteria to utilise the organic compounds of this natural coagulant part of which may have dissolved during the coagulation process may explain the regrowth of the culturable populations during storage of the tannin treated samples rtan in contrast the aluminium sulphate may release ions which hamper the development of faecal coliforms bojić et al 2002 3 3 effect of coagulation on args and bacterial community composition given the limitation of the culture based methods to recover the wide diversity of bacteria inhabiting the stww as well as the difficulties on the recovery of stressed cells after the treatments the analyses of total dna based on quantitative pcr was used to assess the efficacy of the tested coagulants on the removal of the bacterial population from the stww as observed for the culturable populations both coagulants were able to reduce the load of the prokaryotic organisms immediately after the treatment as assessed by the number of copies of the 16s rrna gene per millilitre of sample fig 2 a and b which in average was approximately 1 log unit lower in the treated water alu and tan than in the initial stww table s2 similar results were observed for the gene intl1 a proxy for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 indeed intl1 has been linked to multidrug resistance and horizontal gene transference in a wide diversity of bacteria gillings et al 2015 however when analysing the arg bla tem and qnrs respectively encoding for beta lactams and plasmid mediated quinolone resistance coagulation with aluminium sulphate promoted higher removal of these args approximately 1 log reduction in average table s2 from the initial stww than tannin fig 2a however due to the high variance among the samples no clear distinction was observed between the c c0 values of alu and tan for these analysed args alu fig 2b in contrast the prevalence of each of the analysed genes in alu and tan was similar to that found in stww fig 2c despite the high variation during storage of samples treated with aluminium sulphate a decrease on the load of all analysed genes ranging from 0 4 to 1 4 log reduction in average table s2 was observed fig 2d and e in contrast during storage of samples treated with tannin reactivation of bla tem and mainly qnrs which in average reached levels 0 7 log higher than those found in stww was observed fig 2d and e table s2 interestingly whereas the prevalence of intl1 in the all the stored samples was lower than in stww p 0 05 no significant differences were found for bla tem fig 2f in contrast the prevalence of qnrs was higher in rtan than in all the other analysed samples fig 2f in contrast to our findings a coagulation process carried out with fe based coagulants led to 0 5 log to 3 1 log reductions of different classes of args li et al 2017 suggesting a better performance of this type of coagulants than those herein studied nevertheless the effect of storage on the fe based coagulants treated water was not assessed li et al 2017 water treatment processes such as those based on advanced oxidation processes have been described as promoting disturbance of the bacterial communities which in part are due to differential regrowth capacity of distinct bacterial groups becerra castro et al 2016 moreira et al 2018 in this context the effect of the analysed coagulants on the bacterial communities of the treated water was also assessed in this study as expected the bacterial community of the initial stww was diverse comprising members of 32 phyla being proteobacteria 33 47 and bacteroidetes 26 31 the most abundant in accordance with previous reports becerra castro et al 2016 also bacteria affiliated to epsilonbacteraeota 17 14 and firmicutes 3 4 were among the most abundant phyla found in stww figs 3a and 4 a the distribution of the samples in the pcoa biplot fig 5 in particular along axis 1 which depicts 41 4 of the variance found among samples suggests that there were rearrangements in the bacterial communities of ralu and mainly rtan cluster iii fig 5 the permanova analysis indicated significant differences among the analysed groups of samples pseudo f 3 86 p 0 001 in addition the cca biplot indicates that these rearrangements were correlated with the abundance of culturable heterotrophs het and ciprofloxacin resistant faecal coliforms fc cip as well as with turbidity and conductivity fig 6 the abundance of culturable heterotrophs correlated positively with the variance plotted along axis 1 explaining 13 of the total variance pseudo f 2 8 p 0 05 which allowed to separate the bacterial communities of rtan in contrast the abundance of ciprofloxacin resistant faecal coliforms fc cip the turbidity and conductivity were good predictors of the variance plotted along axis 2 explaining respectively 12 2 12 1 and 6 7 of the total variance pseudo f 2 4 2 9 and 1 7 respectively p 0 05 these variables and mainly fc cip contributed to separate the bacterial communities of the initial stww from those of the ralu samples in all the treated stored wastewater samples the abundance of members affiliated to epsilonbacteraeota decreased p 0 05 in comparison to the initial stww fig 4a yet distinct rearrangements were observed regarding the abundance of other groups particularly bacteroidetes and proteobacteria in ralu and rstww the abundance of bacteroidetes respectively decreased and increased p 0 05 in comparison to stww although not significant due to high variation between replicas in ralu and particularly in rtan samples not only alpha but mainly gammaproteobacteria including those of the order betaproteobacteriales increased in comparison to stww fig s1 whereas in rstww only the members affiliated to class alphaproteobacteria increased p 0 05 in comparison to stww the absence of a common trend in the rearrangements occurring in the bacterial community following the storage of the analysed samples was also observed in their alpha diversity values table 2 where the only clear difference was observed in the phylogenetic diversity pd values table 2 being the lowest value observed for rtan samples in fact this loss of phylogenetic diversity agrees with the increase in the abundance of members affiliated to proteobacteria which members represented more than 70 in rtan samples fig 4 moreover in these samples more than 53 of the total relative abundance of bacteria was given by the abundance of organisms affiliated to ten different genera of gammaproteobacteria fig 4b bacterial community members affiliated to the genera aeromonas pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas were among those with higher relative abundance p 0 05 in rtan than in stww 15 6 vs 1 5 5 8 vs 0 3 and 2 4 vs 0 1 respectively although bacterial community analyses do not offer any evidence about antibiotic resistance dissemination it is worthy of note that all these three genera include species with the potential to acquire resistance genes vaz moreira et al 2014 moreover the increase in the abundance of aeromonas spp in the rtan samples might be related with the increase of the qnrs load and prevalence registered following storage fig 2d e f as this gene has been detected in both surface and wastewater aeromonads isolates varela et al 2016 indeed 8 out of 15 asvs affiliated to the genus aeromonas which represented 13 of total abundance of the rtan samples were positively correlated to the abundance of the qnrs gene p 0 005 fig s2 in addition these aeromonads might have contributed to the increase in all culturable groups observed in rtan samples as aeromonads isolates have been recovered from different culture media in particular in those used in this study pca and mfc agar figueira et al 2011 in fact 5 out of 15 asvs affiliated to the genus aeromonas which represented 12 of total abundance of the rtan samples were positively correlated with the abundance of culturable heterotrophs p 0 05 fig 6 in contrast in ralu samples curvibacter undibacterium and aquaspirillum all belonging to the order betaproteobacteriales were among the most abundant genera in comparison with the stww p 0 05 10 6 vs 0 01 6 3 vs 0 01 3 5 vs 0 02 respectively these organisms are ubiquitous in water environments jia et al 2015 kampfer et al 2007 vaz moreira et al 2014 interestingly the genus curvibacter includes members thriving in a nuclear fuel storage pond which are resistant to co2 dekker et al 2014 also undibacterium members tolerant to arsenic as have been isolated from contaminated ground water samples ghosh and sar 2013 thus the ability of these organisms to resist and live in metal enriched contaminated water might explain their increment in the stored wastewater previously treated with aluminium sulphate ralu the dominance of gammaproteobacteria in the treated stored wastewater ralu and rtan may possible explain their separation in a unique cluster iii in the pcoa biplot fig 5 the results herein obtained demonstrate that storage of wastewater following a coagulation treatment with aluminium sulphate or tannin favour the overgrowth of particular gammaproteobacteria members including betaproteobacteriales increments in proteobacterial members have also been reported in wastewater under treatments coupling biological and photocatalysis or ozonation treatments chen et al 2013 esplugas et al 2013 moreover increment in beta or gammaproteobacteria relative abundance in particular pseudomonads as well as args have also been reported for wastewater stored following photolysis ozonation photocatalytic ozonation becerra castro et al 2016 moreira et al 2018 or different solar driven advanced oxidation processes moreira et al 2018 as well as for drinking water following chlorination treatment jia et al 2015 these observations suggest that particular members affiliated to gammaproteobacteria including some betaproteobacteriales have a higher capacity to regrow or are less effectively inactivated or removed during the treatments than the other bacterial community members nevertheless the present study indicated that the most abundant gammaproteobacterial genera were dependent on the coagulant used most important some of those favoured following treatment with tannin were previously described as potentially critical regarding antibiotic resistance dissemination 4 conclusions coagulation with both aluminium sulphate and tannin decreased the turbidity and colour of the secondary treated urban wastewater although aluminium sulphate showed an overall better removal efficiency both coagulants significantly reduced the load of prokaryotic organisms including the analysed arb immediately after the treatment up to 2 log units however following storage of the treated wastewater with tannin this reduction was attenuated with regrowth of these organisms to values significantly higher than or similar to those found in the initial stww both coagulants significantly reduced the load of intl1 even upon storage of the treated wastewater in contrast only aluminium sulphate significantly reduced the load genes bla tem and qnrs immediately after treatment despite the high variation among samples storage of the wastewater treated with tannin led to the increase of the load of bla tem and mainly qnrs to levels higher than those in the initial stww also the prevalence of this last arg was significantly higher in wastewater treated with tannin than in the initial stww the storage of coagulation treated wastewater created the opportunity for rearrangements in the bacterial communities irrespectively of the coagulant stored treated wastewater contained a higher relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria including betaproteobacteriales than the initial stww the abundance of the total heterotrophs correlated with the bacterial communities of the wastewater treated with tannin whereas fc cip better explained those of wastewater treated with aluminium sulphate within gammaproteobacteria curvibacter undibacterium and aquaspirillum betaproteobacteriales prevailed in the aluminium treated stored wastewater whereas aeromonas aeromonadales pseudomonas pseudomonadales and stenotrophomonas xanthomonadales were the most abundant genera in the tannin treated stored wastewater when compared to the initial stww declaration of competing interest the authors declare that
