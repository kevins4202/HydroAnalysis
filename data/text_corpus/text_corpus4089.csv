20445,environmental contours are used to simplify the process of design response analysis a wide variety of contour methods exist however there have been a very limited number of comparisons of these methods to date this paper is the output of an open benchmarking exercise in which contributors developed contours based on their preferred methods and submitted them for a blind comparison study the exercise had two components one focusing on the robustness of contour methods across different offshore sites and the other focusing on characterizing sampling uncertainty nine teams of researchers contributed to the benchmark the analysis of the submitted contours highlighted significant differences between contours derived via different methods for example the highest wave height value along a contour varied by as much as a factor of two between some submissions while the number of metocean data points or observations that fell outside a contour deviated by an order of magnitude between the contributions even for contours with a return period shorter than the duration of the record these differences arose from both different joint distribution models and different contour construction methods however variability from joint distribution models appeared to be higher than variability from contour construction methods graphical abstract keywords environmental contour metocean extremes

order reliability method isorm inverse second order reliability method mle maximum likelihood estimation 1 introduction the environmental contour method is often used to aid in the design and analysis of marine structures it is a simplified approach that derives extreme environmental conditions which can be used to estimate the n year structural response with n corresponding to a target reliability for an ultimate limit state for example n 50 years a more accurate approximation of the true n yr structural response can be computed by integrating the product of the short term response distribution conditional on the environmental state and the long term joint distribution of the environment this approach is usually referred to as full long term analysis see for example guedes soares 1993 muliawan et al 2013 because a full long term analysis can be computationally expensive the environmental contour method is commonly used to get a first estimate of the response or as an entire replacement for performing a full long term analysis it is important to understand that the typical two dimensional contour method ignores response variability conditional on the sea state or more generally the environmental state conditions and response computations are later made only for points on the contour that represent a subset of environmental conditions of interest for design for each design condition on the environmental contour a number of stochastic time domain simulations are run and the peak response in each simulation is recorded the peak response in the environmental state is then defined as the median or to indirectly account for short term variability a higher percentile baarholm et al 2010 muliawan et al 2013 of the peak values over each simulation alternatively short term variability can also be accounted for by inflating the contour by using a higher return period or by applying an additional safety factor that is multiplied with the environmental load norsok 2007 finally the design value is taken as the largest response over all design conditions along the contour there are two limitations with this approach to design first many environmental states are not checked and second the short term variability of the response is not fully assessed any full long term response based analysis see for example vanem et al 2020 makes neither of these approximations but can be prohibitively expensive note that the environmental contour method is a special case of more general inverse reliability approaches that can expand the dimension space by one variable to include the response conditional on the environment as an additional variable an advantage is that more environmental states can be checked than were included in the contour method but a disadvantage is that points on the hypersphere for the target reliability require quantiles of response conditional on the environment that are far from median levels and require considerable amount of simulations albeit less than with a full long term analysis and of course a greater number of environmental states must be evaluated than with the environmental contour method this has been demonstrated in the seminal work winterstein et al 1993 and explicit inclusion of response variability has been employed in the design of fixed and floating offshore wind turbines rendon and manuel 2014 liu et al 2019 it is important to emphasize that contour methods and other inverse reliability methods are acknowledged as approximate methods they were founded on principles of structural reliability with a view toward limiting computation that can be prohibitive with a full long term analysis deriving an environmental contour from a metocean dataset generally involves two steps estimating the joint distribution of the environmental variables of interest for example wave height and period and constructing the environmental contour based on that joint distribution fig 1 for both steps various approaches have been proposed the joint distribution can be estimated using different model structures such as global hierarchical models for example mathisen and bitner gregersen 1990 bitner gregersen 2015 horn et al 2018 cheng et al 2019 copula models for example vanem 2016 fazeres ferradosa et al 2018 manuel et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 heredia zavoni and montes iturrizaga 2019 lin et al 2020 kernel density estimates for example ferreira and guedes soares 2002 eckert gallup and martin 2016 haselsteiner et al 2017b or conditional extremes models jonathan et al 2010 2014 another consideration relates to how the model parameters are estimated even if the same model structure is used parameter values estimated using for example maximum likelihood estimation or the method of moments can strongly deviate from each other guedes soares and henriques 1996 vanem 2015 for the second step namely construction of the contour various methods have been proposed that differ in their definition of which regions in the variable space are considered exceedances fig 2 they include haver s constant exceedance method haver 1985 1987 the inverse first order reliability method iform winterstein et al 1993 the inverse second order reliability method isorm chai and leira 2018 inverse directional simulation dimitrov 2020 the direct sampling contour method huseby et al 2013 direct iform derbanne and de hauteclocque 2019 joint exceedance contour methods jonathan et al 2014 and the highest density contour method haselsteiner et al 2017a due to contrasting definitions even for the same underlying joint distribution for any target exceedance probability α different constructed contours will result from each of the methods broadly the contour construction methods can be classified by two criteria i whether the contour is constructed in the original physical variable space as with the direct sampling direct iform and highest density method or in a standard normal space as with iform isorm and inverse directional simulation and ii whether the contour definition is based on one or more regions in the variable space associated with the target α exceedance probability in iform direct iform and the direct sampling contour method the failure surface is approximated as a hyperplane which is equivalent to defining the contour exceedance probability as a marginal exceedance probability under a rotation of the axis during contour construction all axis rotations are considered such that there are many regions in the variable space that contain probability α however only one of these regions is assumed to match the failure surface of the structure of interest in isorm inverse directional simulation and the highest density contour method a single region that covers the complete variable space outside the contour contains a probability of α these two classes of contours can therefore be summarized as contours based on marginal exceedance probability and contours based on total exceedance probability a study on the properties of these two classes of contours was presented by mackay and haselsteiner 2021 the different definitions for the exceedance region are related to an important approximation of the environmental contour method for a deterministic response the method assumes that if a structure is designed using environmental conditions that have a joint exceedance probability of α 1 t r n y r where t r is the return period in years and n y r is the number of environmental states per year the resulting structure will have a probability of failure p f that is less than but close to α consequently it is desired that the contour s exceedance region is a conservative approximation of the structure s failure region note however that the goal of conservatism in the approximation of the failure surface is not absolute a slightly unconservative approximation can be compensated by choosing an appropriate safety factor which is later multiplied with the design load studies on different constructed contours for the same joint distribution have been published by leira 2008 vanem and bitner gregersen 2015 vanem 2017 huseby et al 2017 haselsteiner et al 2017a chai and leira 2018 wang et al 2018 and vanem et al 2020 a broad recent review on the environmental contour method was provided by ross et al 2019 and a recent effort presenting a comparison framework for environmental contours was published by eckert et al 2021 to provide a common basis to compare proposed environmental contour methods a benchmarking exercise was proposed at the international conference on ocean offshore arctic engineering omae 2019 haselsteiner et al 2019 this benchmark exercise involved two components one focused on analyzing the robustness of contour methods across different sites exercise 1 and the other focused on characterizing sampling uncertainty exercise 2 six datasets were provided each involving two environmental variables three datasets comprised time series of significant wave height and zero up crossing period while three other datasets included wind speed and significant wave height data participants were asked to compute environmental contours with return periods of 1 20 and 50 years these two dimensional contours of wave and wind variables were chosen for comparison because they represent common cases required in practice for design the use of sea state contours is recommended in guidelines and standards such as dnv gl s recommended practice on environmental conditions and environmental loads rp c205 dnv gl 2017 and norsok s standard on actions and action effects n 003 norsok 2007 the use of wind wave contours is required when following iec s standard on the design of offshore wind turbines international electrotechnical commission 2019 studies on sea state environmental contours include the works of haver 1985 winterstein et al 1993 eckert gallup et al 2014 velarde et al 2019 and studies on wind speed wave height contours have been published for example by saranyasoontorn and manuel 2006 and karmakar et al 2016 some researchers combined these three variables to construct wave height wave period and wind speed contours for example li et al 2015 2016 2019 vanem 2019 nine teams of researchers participated in the exercise and this paper presents the results the benchmarking study was designed as an open systematic comparison allowing for both different models for the joint distribution and different methods for contour construction the study s design did not aim to rank the appropriateness or accuracy quality of any participant s submitted contours or methods used to derive them but rather to provide a comparison of the wide range of contour methods that have been proposed in recent years the benchmark s results highlight and quantify some significant differences between contours derived via the different methods for example the highest wave height value along the contour varied by as much as a factor of two between some submissions while the number of metocean data points or observations that fell outside a contour deviated by an order of magnitude between the contributions even for contours with a return period shorter than the duration of the record while not covered by the originally scoped benchmark exercise proposal haselsteiner et al 2019 the paper by de hautecloque mackay and vanem provides further comparisons of the nine submitted contributions de hauteclocque et al 2021 the next section section 2 describes the contour methods that were employed in the nine submitted contributions it first provides a high level overview and then a single sub section for each contribution that offers additional details then section 3 describes the used metocean datasets and section 4 describes the results using the methods and metrics that were stipulated in the paper that announced the exercise haselsteiner et al 2019 finally section 5 contains a discussion and section 6 provides some conclusions 2 exercises and contributions nine teams submitted contributions for exercise 1 and four of those teams submitted for exercise 2 a high level overview of the details of each contribution is presented in table 2 in addition table 2 references code and stand alone papers for each method where available the two exercises were described in detail in the paper that announced the benchmark haselsteiner et al 2019 they were based on six provided datasets fig 3 three datasets dataset a b and c contained hourly buoy measurements from three sites off the us coast they contained hourly time series of significant wave height h s and zero up crossing period t z the other three datasets dataset d e and f were obtained from the hindcast coastdat 2 groll and weisse 2016 2017 and covered three locations in the north sea they contained hourly time series of a 10 minute mean wind speed u 10 at 10m above sea level and a 1 hour significant wave height h s the organizers provided 10 years of data of sea state measurements datasets a b and c and 25 years of wind wave data datasets d e and f to the participants for evaluation of the submitted contours another 10 years of sea state data and 25 years of wind wave data were retained by the organizers until after all the participants results were received to distinguish between the different parts of the datasets we refer to the parts that were made available to the participants as provided to the parts that were not made available as retained and to the entire set as full in exercise 1 participants were required to compute 1 yr and a 20 yr sea state contours and 1 yr and 50 yr wind wave contours the exercise focused on the robustness of a contour method across different offshore sites this robustness is mainly affected by the type of model used to represent the joint distributions three types of comparisons were outlined for exercise 1 in the omae 2019 paper plotting all submitted contours in an overlay for visual comparison reporting the maximum values along the contour in each dimension and counting the number of points measured environmental conditions outside each contour to provide perspective to the number of points outside the contours here we also calculate the expected number of points outside a contour assuming that measurement data represent independent observations the impact of serial correlation in the data on this metric is discussed in section 5 this number varies with the contour s return period and the method that was used to construct the contour table 2 it is important not to overly weight the importance and reliability of this metric since environmental contours are generally used in engineering analyses in predicting extreme responses only points that fall outside the contour that elicit large responses are generally of practical concern for this reason in addition to reporting the number of points outside each contour alongside the analytically expected result we also present the number of points outside each contour above a certain threshold exercise 2 focused on characterizing sampling uncertainty participants were asked to sample 1 5 and 25 yr subsets from the provided dataset d and to compute environmental contours based on these subsets for each of the three time periods 1000 such subsets were required such that 1000 environmental contours per time period were calculated to compare the contributions it was described that an uncertainty overlay of these 1000 contours should be plotted and that confidence intervals should be calculated the following subsections describe the individual contributions to keep overall paper length in balance the subsections are relatively brief however for some contour methods further details are provided in individual papers 2 1 contour method 1 by wei chai and bernt leira the environmental contours were constructed by application of the inverse second order reliability method isorm for calculation of the failure probability the form approximation will underestimate the result for cases with a concave failure surface in the standard normal space i e the u space see fig 4 b for a two dimensional example correspondingly the iform contour will yield non conservative results for design purposes in order to address such a shortcoming of the traditional iform contour chai and leira 2018 proposed a specific second order approximation to the failure surface in the u space generally the sorm approximation may provide better approximations to the failure probability than the form approach the failure surface of the specific sorm approximation is assumed to be a circle in u space for the two dimensional case therefore the estimated failure probability and the corresponding contour are generally conservative similar to the development of an n dimensional contour for a given return period by the iform method in the process of establishing the corresponding isorm contours an n dimensional sphere with the radius β s is first created with the value of β s being determined by the following equation 1 1 p f i 1 n u i 2 β s 2 ϕ u u d u where u represents an n dimensional vector in the normalized u space and ϕ u u denotes the standard multivariate normal probability density function it is seen from eq 1 that in the normalized u space the probability content outside the sphere with radius β s is p f moreover the sum of n independent standard normal variables follows a chi squared distribution with n degrees of freedom therefore the radius β s can be determined from the following equation 2 χ n 2 β s 2 1 p f subsequently the n dimensional sphere with radius β s in the normalized u space is transformed into the isorm contour in the original parameter space by application of the rosenblatt transformation if the joint distribution of environmental parameters is described by the conditional modeling approach the nataf transformation is applied if the marginal distributions of the environmental parameters in combination with corresponding correlation coefficients are applied in order to describe the joint distribution of environmental parameters in present exercise we used the baseline joint distribution models that were provided in the paper that proposed this benchmark haselsteiner et al 2019 they were established by following the conditional modeling approach 2 2 contour method 2 by guilherme clarindo and c guedes soares participant 2 used the models for the joint distributions that were provided as baseline results by the benchmark organizers however while the baseline results then constructed iform contours here direct sampling contours were constructed the joint distribution of metocean variables was obtained by applying the conditional modeling approach see guedes soares et al 1988 bitner gregersen and haver 1991 the model structure consists of a marginal distribution for h s and a conditional distribution for co variables t z and u 10 the marginal distribution of h s is assumed to follow a three parameter weibull distribution in all dataset while a conditional log normal distribution is assumed for t z in a b and c as for example in lucas and guedes soares 2015 for the remaining dataset d e and f the u 10 distribution is now conditioned by two parameters of a weibull distribution and the statistical dependence is based on scale and shape parameters whereas the log normal distribution was conditioned by the mean and variance respectively see table 3 the applied approach for contour construction is based on direct methods presented by huseby et al 2013 2015 as an approach to establish environmental contours directly in the original space of the environmental variables based on monte carlo simulations of the fitted joint metocean observations thus not requiring any transformation the initial inaccuracies due to insufficient number of monte carlo samples can be improved by a reject sampling scheme explained by huseby et al 2014 the understanding of this approach was extended to three dimensions by vanem 2019 contours were constructed using 10 as the angular intervals thus generating 35 points of intersection which can be defined as coordinates the number of samples generated by monte carlo simulation were five hundred thousand for each dataset 2 3 contour method 3 by ásta hannesdóttir and nikolay dimitrov in this contribution the inverse directional simulation ids was used to construct the environmental contours dimitrov 2020 as shown in section 2 1 and in fig 4 the classical iform approach is formulated to compute the probability of failure behind a linear limit state surface this formulation is suitable for classical reliability analysis where one assumes that the failure region is convex and the goal is to find a single design point the most likely point of failure then it is sufficient to evaluate the probability behind the limit state surface in the close vicinity of the design point however for other types of problems multiple points with equal return periods forming an entire contour or a segment a part of contour could be considered equally critical in such situation it is required that the exceedance probability accounts for all events outside any part of the contour or segment using iform for such problems would lead to underestimation of the failure probability and a non conservative result the ids method provides an exact solution for computing the total probability outside the return period contour or outside a contour segment of arbitrary size this is achieved by replacing the linear iform failure boundary by a hyper sphere in standard normal space as with the iform the reliability index β defines the radius of the sphere or circle in 2d which equals the l 2 norm of the variable vector u 3 β i u i i 1 n here u i are the environmental variables in standard normal space and n is the number of dimensions in the variable space because the variables in u space are independent and normally distributed their sum follows by definition a chi squared distribution in a n dimensional variable space the radius reliability index may be defined by 4 β χ n 1 1 p f where χ n 1 is the inverse cumulative distribution function of the chi square distribution with n degrees of freedom and p f is the probability of failure with the above formulation it is straightforward to determine the radius of a contour segment where only exceedances within a certain range of variable combinations are relevant for example for a contour of wind speed vs wave heights we may be interested only in the segment where high wind speeds are combined with large wave heights this procedure is described in dimitrov 2020 for the case when the full contour length is considered the ids method is equivalent to the isorm method chai and leira 2018 apart from how the reliability index is defined the implementation of the ids in the present study followed the general steps of the iform procedure as performed in for example hannesdóttir et al 2019 for 10 minute mean and standard deviation of wind speed measurements the reliability index was estimated with eq 4 for exceedance probability corresponding to the entire space outside the contour for datasets a b and c we modeled the joint distribution assuming that the marginal distributions of both the significant wave height and the conditional distribution of zero up crossing periods follow a log normal distribution for datasets d e and f we modeled the joint distribution where we assume the marginal distribution of significant wave height to follow a 3 parameter weibull distribution and the conditional distribution of wind speed to follow a 2 parameter weibull distribution the marginal distributions were fitted with the maximum likelihood method and the parameters of the conditional distribution were estimated with a least squares fit 2 4 contour method 4 by andreas haselsteiner aljoscha sander jan hendrik ohlendorf and klaus dieter thoben we fitted novel types of global hierarchical models to the datasets and constructed highest density contours our model for the joint distribution of sea states assumes that the marginal distribution of significant wave height follows an exponentiated weibull distribution and that zero up crossing period follows a conditional log normal distribution the model for the wind wave joint distribution assumes that wind speed follows an exponentiated weibull distribution and that significant wave height follows a conditional exponentiated weibull distribution recently we analyzed how well the exponentiated weibull distribution fits significant wave height data and we proposed a method that prioritizes high wave heights over low waves when the distribution s parameters are estimated haselsteiner and thoben 2020 this weighted least squares estimation method was used here as well the dependence structure between the variables was designed to yield simple relationships between u 10 h s and t z that can be interpreted physically the models assume that the median significant wave height follows the relationship 5 h s c 1 c 2 u 10 c 3 and that the median zero up crossing period follows the relationship 6 t z c 4 c 5 h s g where c i are parameters that are estimated and g is the acceleration due to gravity benefits of these dependence functions are that the parameter c 3 enables simple interpretation of how wave heights increase with wind speeds and that the dependence of t z on h s is expressed in physically consistent units unfortunately the exponent c 3 which is estimated as a float does not allow for physically consistent units in the relationship between h s and u 10 additionally the relationship between t z and h s requires only two estimated parameters the complete bivariate models for h s t z and u 10 h s required the estimation of 8 and 10 parameters respectively these fitted joint distributions were used to construct highest density environmental contours a highest density contour contains 1 α probability content within the environmental contour and has constant probability density along its path fig 2 thus for a given joint distribution it leads to more conservative design conditions than iform or direct sampling contours see mackay and haselsteiner 2021 for an analysis of the differences and application examples further details on this contribution are given in a conference paper haselsteiner et al 2020 2 5 contour method 5 by guillaume de hauteclocque the environmental contours were calculated using the method presented in derbanne and de hauteclocque 2019 compared to all other approaches used in the benchmark this method does not rely on the inference of a joint distribution extending the direct sampling method the two original variables h s and t z for instance are projected on a search direction α eq 7 and univariate fit is performed on each x α 7 x α v 1 cos α v 2 sin α for each direction α distribution parameters θ α for x α were estimated by mle or other means those parameters were used to interpolate extrapolate x e x t α at desired probability the contour was then constructed from the tangents or hyper plane for n 3 defined by α and x e x t α as with the tangent method described in huseby et al 2013 and illustrated on fig 5b in practice the construction of a contour from tangents works better if data are convex thus a variable change is often necessary additionally the data were also scaled so that the two variables have comparable dimension v 1 and v 2 in eq 7 thus correspond to the transformed and scaled variables in the current benchmark h s t z is for instance transformed to h s h s t z one benefit of this direct iform approach is its ability to straightforwardly plug any state of the art method with respect to the univariate fit here this possibility is used to get rid of the independent and identically distributed events assumption by using standard peak over threshold approach together with declustering on each search direction α data were declustered using threshold up and down crossing as cluster boundaries with an additional minimum interval of 48 h between clusters threshold exceedances were then fitted with generalized pareto distributions see coles 2001 for further details fig 5a illustrates the declustering effect on h s i e α 0 for dataset a the effect is dramatic for t r 1 yr while at t r 20 yrs conclusion are not obvious due to large sampling uncertainties contour construction from tangents is presented on fig 5b 2 6 contour method 6 by ed mackay and philip jonathan the joint distribution of environmental parameters was estimated using the storm resampling method presented in mackay and jonathan 2020 and contours were derived from the joint distribution using the standard iform method in the block resampling method it is assumed that the time series of environmental variables can be divided into blocks where the peak values in adjacent blocks can be considered independent the peak values of each variable within the block are not required to coincide in time but the blocks are assumed to be sufficiently short so that the peak values of each variable are related in some way a model for the joint distribution of the peak values is then estimated the distribution of all data is recovered by simulating block peak values from the joint model and resampling and rescaling the measured blocks so that the peak values from the resampled blocks match the simulated peak values as the data that the model is fitted to are approximately independent this gives a better justification for the use of asymptotic extreme value models the approach also has the advantage that much of the complex short term dependence structure in the data is resampled rather than modeled explicitly the block resampling approach only preserves the distribution of the peak values in the block for contours of h s and t z we are interested in both the maximum and minimum values of t z for a given h s to get around this problem we work with the significant steepness s 2 π h s g t z 2 and a distance variable defined as d h s 2 t z 2 2 1 2 lines of constant d are orthogonal to the lines of constant s in the h s t z plane see fig 6 moreover the peak values of s and d correspond to the frontiers of interest for h s t z contours the marginal distributions of the block peak values of s and d were modeled using a composite approach with a kernel density model for the body and a generalized pareto model for the tail the joint distribution was also modeled using a composite approach with a kernel density model for the body and the heffernan and tawn 2004 model for the tail a similar approach was used for estimating the marginal distributions of block peak h s and wind speed u 10 however for the joint distribution a piecewise linear generalized pareto model was used for the distribution of h s p e a k conditional on u 10 p e a k for intermediate values of u 10 p e a k and the heffernan and tawn model was used for estimating the joint distribution for higher values of u 10 p e a k further details are provided in mackay and jonathan 2020 2 7 contour method 7 by chi qiao and andrew myers a new framework is proposed for using global hierarchical models to construct long term environmental contours qiao et al 2021 in the implementation of the framework presented here h s and v are selected as the independent variables for datasets a c and datasets d f respectively and t z and h s are selected as the corresponding dependent variables the marginal distribution f x of the independent variable and discrete bins of the conditional distribution f y x are determined with a hybrid model that uses separate methods to form the distribution for frequently occurring values and for extreme values the distribution of the extreme values is modeled by first fitting a generalized extreme value distribution to block maxima of the data and then adjusting this distribution to include temporal correlation within the time series qiao and myers the extreme values of each tail are modeled with six parameters three for the generalized extreme value distribution plus three for the adjustment for temporal correlation resulting in a total of 12 distribution parameters for the extreme values of both tails the frequently occurring values are modeled empirically and so in effect the number of distribution parameters is equal to the number of frequently occurring values in the dataset the set of distribution parameters for f y x is represented by θ and the next step in the global hierarchical model is to find a mathematical form to fit the parameters of θ as a function of the independent variable x the form used here is θ a x b c however the large dimension of θ for the hybrid model makes this step difficult so the dimension of θ is lowered to two or three by fitting a conventional two or three parameter distribution that approximates the cumulative conditional probabilities of the hybrid model specifically for the range of quantiles that contribute to the upper and lower parts of the contour in this paper 14 types of parametric distributions are considered including normal log normal logistic etc for this approximation and a two parameter distribution is selected for each dataset as indicated in table a 1 this results in a joint distribution model that is defined by 24 parameters 12 parameters for f y x two distribution parameters each fit as a function of the independent variable x using three parameters for two parts of the contours upper and lower plus 12 parameters for the marginal distribution three parameters for the generalized extreme value distribution plus three parameters for the adjustment of temporal correlation for two tails note that these 24 parameters do not define the frequently occurring values of f x and this information is also necessary to fully define the joint distribution model and the corresponding long term environmental contour in this framework the frequently occurring values of f x are modeled empirically 2 8 contour method 8 by anna rode arndt hildebrandt and boso schmidt the parameters of all statistical models were estimated with maximum likelihood estimation mle and subsequently the contours were derived with the classical iform approach winterstein et al 1993 for the three datasets a c the zero up crossing period t z was opted as the marginal distribution whereas the significant wave height h s was modeled as the conditional environmental variable table 4 both the marginal and the conditional distribution were fitted by a 2 parameter weibull distribution the stochastic parameters of the marginals were estimated as above mentioned with mle the dependence functions of the conditional distributions for h s were estimated by using a linear regression of the previously classified weibull parameters datasets d f provide data of the significant wave height h s and the wind speed u 10 the environmental variable h s was assumed to be the marginal distributed variable for these three hindcast datasets in these cases the wind speed was the conditional environmental variable the environmental variable h s and u 10 were both assumed to follow a 2 parameter weibull distribution for constructing the environmental contours the classical inverse first order method iform as presented in winterstein et al 1993 was used 2 9 contour method 9 by erik vanem and arne bang huseby a set of environmental contours were calculated in this contribution as outlined in vanem and huseby 2020 all contours were based on fitting a conditional model to the data as a product of a marginal model for the primary variable and a conditional model where the model parameters are modeled as parametric functions of the primary variable bitner gregersen 2015 horn et al 2018 for all datasets the marginal model for h s were the 3 parameter weibull distribution for the sea state data a conditional log normal distribution was assumed for t z and for the wind wave data a conditional 2 parameter weibull distribution was assumed for u 10 based on the fitted joint models environmental contours were calculated by two different approaches i e the iform approach haver and winterstein 2009 and the direct sampling approach huseby et al 2013 2015 the main differences between these contour methods are that the iform approach includes a transformation to standard normal space and assumes a convex failure region in the transformed space or rather performs a linearization of the failure boundary in this space whereas the direct sampling approach makes the same assumption in the original parameter space see for example vanem and bitner gregersen 2015 vanem 2017 the direct sampling contours were calculated based on a set of monte carlo simulations from the joint distributions and there may be numerical uncertainties due to the monte carlo variance this can be reduced by increasing the number of samples and in this work an efficient tail sampling approach has been utilized in order to obtain a large effective number of samples with reasonable computational efforts see for example huseby et al 2014 vanem and huseby 2018 3 metocean datasets 3 1 bivariate patterns and storm events scatter diagrams of the six used datasets are shown in fig 7 individual datasets exhibit different patterns among the sea state datasets a b c the behavior at high wave periods differs in datasets a and b the highest observed wave periods occur at low significant wave heights while in dataset c they occur at high wave heights in the wind wave datasets d e f the observed maximum wave height at a given wind speed interval varies greatly between the datasets for wind speeds 10m s the observed highest significant wave height varies between 5 4m dataset d and 10 6m dataset f the scatter diagrams also reveal that the strongest observed storms events the highest wave heights and wind speeds observations vary between the datasets for example the highest observed significant wave height at dataset d was 10 8m but 16 6m at dataset f additionally the strongest storms sometimes occurred in the provided part of the dataset and sometimes in the retained part among the used datasets the difference between the provided and retained part of the dataset was especially stark for dataset a the maximum observed h s in the provided portion was 7 1m whereas in the retained portion there were four storms where the peak h s exceeded 8m with the largest storm peak h s being 11 8m the difference between the provided and the retained datasets can also be visualized by overlaying the empirical exceedance probability of observed storm peak h s in both parts of the datasets fig 8 for this analysis storm peaks are defined as a local maxima within a moving window of size five days for datasets b and c the empirical distributions are similar for the provided and retained portions indicating that a model that is a good fit to the provided data will also be a good fit for the retained data however for dataset a the empirical distribution of the retained data has a significantly longer tail in this case a close fit to the tail of the provided data will underestimate the slope of the tail in the retained data 3 2 serial correlation this benchmark provided datasets comprising of hourly observations of metocean variables consecutive data points in such time series are not independent and identically distributed but are strongly autocorrelated there are multiple scales of variability and correlation in metocean conditions that correspond to different physical effects these can be categorized as short term serial correlation of the order of hours to days related to passing weather systems seasonal variability inter annual variability related to longer term climatic modes for example nao enso etc and longer term decadal scale climatic changes resulting from both anthropogenic influences and from naturally occurring climatic variations the full time series of significant wave height are shown in fig 9 the seasonal variability is clearly observable because at these sites the highest h s values typically occur in the winter months additionally the time series show some rare storm events with much higher h s than the highest storms in typical years these rare storm events provide a challenge for estimating the tail of the probability distribution because a metocean dataset might hold only one two or zero such events the highest serial correlation is in the short term in the order of hours to days related to passing weather systems fig 10 the autocorrelation measured by the correlation coefficient of all three considered variables significant wave height h s zero up crossing period t z and mean wind speed u 10 is above 0 2 for delays of less than 1 day however autocorrelation was stronger for significant wave height compared to wave period and wind speed the cross correlation between wave height and wave period peaked between 3 and 10 h delay wave period is delayed relative to wave height and the cross correlation between wind speed and wave height peaked between 2 and 3 h delay wave height is delayed relative to wind speed the effect of short term serial correlation on extreme events is usually quantified in terms of the extremal index θ 0 1 see for example ferro and segers 2003 it can be shown that asymptotically extremes of a stationary sequence occur in clusters with mean size 1 θ hsing 1987 hsing et al 1988 the extremal index characterizes the effect of serial correlation at asymptotically high levels at extreme levels relevant to structural design the effect of serial correlation can be quantified using a sub asymptotic extremal index θ x θ it can be shown that θ x t x t x where t x is the true return period of level x and t x is the return period of the equivalent independent sequence mackay et al 2021b the equivalent independent sequence is the sequence that would be obtained by randomizing the order of observations in the dependent sequence alternatively t x can be interpreted as the return period obtained when serial correlation is neglected since θ x 1 we have t x t x so neglecting serial correlation can introduce a positive bias into estimates of return values at a given return period beirlant et al 2004 p 381 some authors have proposed incorporating estimates of θ x explicitly into inferences of extremes from serially correlated data to account for clustering in extremes for example eastoe and tawn 2012 however estimates of θ or θ x from data are subject to significant uncertainties ancona navarrete and tawn 2000 and for univariate oceanographic data it is more usual to work with either annual maxima or storm peak events that are approximately independent thus ensuring that θ x 1 4 results this section presents the benchmark s results using the previously described analysis methods first the results of the sea state contours are reported datasets a b c section 4 1 then the wind wave contours are presented datasets d e f section 4 2 finally the results for exercise 2 the uncertainty characterization that was applied to dataset d are reported section 4 3 appendix a lists the various joint models that were fitted by the participants 4 1 sea state contours a set of overlays of the sea state contours are shown in fig 11 in each of the six plots shown in fig 11 the eleven contour contributions are overlaid with the full dataset there are contributions from nine teams but contribution 9 contains three different contours that were calculated using the same joint distributions the maximum h s value as well as the maximum and minimum t z value along each 1 yr and 20 yr contour is plotted in fig 12 1 yr and in fig 13 20 yr for reference the empirical marginal 1 yr return value as well as the maximum and minimum of the full measured datasets are also plotted the maximum h s values along the 1 yr and 20 yr contours strongly deviate between the contributions for the 1 yr contours as expected among the contributions the highest h s value is from a contour that is based on total exceedance contribution 4 in dataset a and contribution 3 in datasets b and c for the 20 yr contours the highest h s value is from a total exceedance contour in dataset a contribution 4 and from a marginal exceedance contour in datasets b and c contribution 7 in all datasets the highest maximum h s value along the 20 yr contour is more than double the lowest maximum h s value for example in dataset a the lowest value is about 5m contribution 2 and the highest value is about 13m contribution 4 in dataset b and c the highest buoy measured h s value is within the range of the 20 yr contours maximum values but in dataset a the highest measured value is higher than all contour maxima this effect is likely due to the much higher h s maximum in the retained part of dataset a compared to the provided part ca 12m and ca 7m respectively in general differences due to the different joint models appear to be greater than differences due to different contour construction methods as there is no consistent order between the maxima of marginal exceedance contours and total exceedance contours if the joint models were similar total exceedance contours would be bigger than marginal exceedance contours the counted data points outside the contours are presented in table 5 as described in section 2 the expected number of data points outside the contours is different among the contributions as different contour construction methods were used see table 2 however for contributions that constructed isorm inverse directional simulation and highest density contours total exceedance contours the expected number of points outside the contour e n o u t s i d e is the same for contributions that constructed iform direct sampling and direct iform contours marginal exceedance contours e n o u t s i d e is similar note that if a statistical model was fitted to declustered data such that serial correlation is reduced the environmental contour will have smaller dimensions and the number of expected data points outside the contour will be higher for such a contour contribution 5 constructed direct iform contours after applying declustering for the first group the total exceedance contours the theoretical e n o u t s i d e is 1 for a 20 yr contour but between 13 7 and 114 0 points exceeded the constructed contours average over datasets a b c for the second group the marginal exceedance contours e n o u t s i d e is exactly iform or approximately direct sampling direct iform 11 5 but between 16 7 and 21966 3 points exceeded the constructed contours contribution 5 and 9 which have the highest points outside the 20 yr contour contain many exceeding points at low h s values which are irrelevant for structural design if these points are excluded by only counting sea states with a significant wave height greater than 1m between 7 7 and 280 points exceed the constructed marginal exceedance contours in summary in both contour classes the number of exceeding points varied by an order of magnitude among the submitted contributions 4 2 wind wave contours overlays of all contours are plotted in fig 14 the maximum values along the contours are plotted in figs 15 and 16 similar to the sea state contours there is a wide variability among the contributions the spread from the highest to the lowest maximum value is higher for the wave height values than for the wind speed values ca 40 50 versus ca 20 of the empirical maximum for the 50 yr contours for example in dataset d the contributions have maximum wave height values between ca 9m and 15m and maximum wind speed values between ca 25m s and 32m s the highest wave height maximum along the 50 yr contour is on a total exceedance contour in all datasets contribution 4 but the highest wind speed maximum is on marginal exceedance contours contributions 6 and 9 the use of the two classes of contours total exceedance and marginal exceedance contours did not manifest itself in two distinct groups of contour maxima figs 15 and 16 consequently similar to the sea state contours differences due to selected model types for the joint distribution seem to be bigger than differences due to the selected contour construction methods the number of data points outside the wind wave contours is presented in table 6 for reference the expected number of points outside the contour if events were independent is also reported for total exceedance contours the expected number of points outside the contour is e n o u t s i d e 1 for a 50 yr contour and 50 years of data but between 3 7 contribution 4 and 103 7 contribution 1 points exceeded the constructed contours average over datasets d e f for marginal exceedance contours e n o u t s i d e is exactly iform or approximately 12 direct sampling direct iform but between 8 3 contribution 6 and 15301 contribution 9 ds points exceeded the constructed contours similar as with the sea state contours the thousands of exceeding points in contribution 9 are at low wave heights and are therefore not relevant for structural design if these points are excluded by only counting sea states with a significant wave height greater than 1m and wind speeds greater than 1m s only 103 45 points exceed the contour mean standard deviation n 3 in summary similar to the sea state contours the number of exceeding points vary by an order of magnitude among the submitted contributions for both groups marginal exceedance and total exceedance contours 4 3 uncertainty of the wind wave contours to better understand the level of sampling uncertainty in different contours an exercise was proposed using a bootstrap sampling approach the procedure was based on a study first published by gramstad et al 2018 and extended by vanem et al 2019 and was defined as follows haselsteiner et al 2019 1 set the index i 1 2 resample y 1 5 or 25 years of data from dataset d resulting in sample o i 3 fit the model structure that you used in exercise 1 to the sample o i resulting in the statistical model x i 4 compute a 50 yr contour with the same method that you used in exercise 1 based on the statistical model x i resulting in environmental contour c i 5 if i 1000 increase the index i and repeat steps 2 4 this procedure leads to 1000 different environmental contours these contours were then used to compute a 95 confidence interval and a median contour the methods for finding the confidence interval and median contour can be found in haselsteiner et al 2019 note that the confidence intervals from this procedure are not a true reflection of the uncertainty due to a dataset s typical length because they neglect the serial correlation in the data thus the results from this exercise should only be interpreted as comparative between contour methods rather than quantitative estimates of the sampling uncertainty the effect of serial correlation will be further discussed in section 5 further contours that are based on total exceedance contributions 3 and 4 are expected to have greater uncertainty than contours that are based on marginal exceedance contributions 2 and 9 since for a given return period total exceedance contours are extrapolating further in the tail of the distribution overlay plots of all 1000 contours are presented in fig 17 each row in the figure relates to a specific contribution from top to bottom these are contributions 2 3 4 and 9 some contributors chose not to participate in exercise 2 the columns relate to the amount of data used in producing the contours in the left most column for example the 50 yr contours are produced using just 1 year of data moving to the right within the figure more data is used in estimation of the contours the overlay plots show that uncertainty decreases with increasing sample size in all contributions in contribution 3 when 1 and 5 years of data are used two different modes seem to be apparent a major mode where the contours upper parts have only strong curvature at the region of ca u 10 26m s h s 11m and a minor mode where the contours additionally have strong curvature at ca u 10 26m s h s 6m possibly these different modes could also be present in the estimated parameter values in the study by vanem et al 2019 on sampling uncertainty the estimated parameter values clustered around two distinct values in a case where they resampled from a hindcast dataset and used maximum likelihood estimation confidence intervals for all contributions are plotted in fig 18 similar to the overlay plots they show how uncertainty decreases with increasing sample size the confidence intervals for contributions 2 and 9 1 1 in contribution 9 the confidence intervals were computed with a different procedure than the one outlined in the paper that announced the benchmark haselsteiner et al 2019 such that the results are not fully comparable this procedure is described in the work by vanem and huseby 2020 and is considered to be only negligibly different from the procedure outlined in haselsteiner et al 2019 were narrower than for contributions 3 and 4 contributions 2 and 9 constructed contours that belong to the group of marginal exceedance contours while contributions 3 and 4 constructed total exceedance contours such that the latter group s contour required further extrapolation this additional extrapolation should lead to greater variability among the 1000 contours there are however many other differences between these four contribution such that it is not clear whether the different contour construction methods are the main reason for the different degrees of variability 5 discussion the results suggested that the different joint models were responsible for much of the observed deviations between contours thus section 5 1 will discuss the different types of joint distribution models used in this study then section 5 2 and section 5 3 will discuss the results of exercise 1 and exercise 2 finally we will suggest areas of future research in section 5 4 5 1 joint distribution models in this benchmark participants submitted contributions based on three different kind of joint models global hierarchical models a projected peak over threshold model and a model based on storm resampling these types of models make different assumptions on aspects like which kind of events the joint distribution represents all environmental states or only storm peaks whether and how the model accounts for serial correlation and how dependence is modeled both in the body and in the tail of the distribution in the comparison of contours and the maximum values along the contours we did not find a consistent ordering between contours that were constructed based on marginal exceedance probability and based on total exceedance this suggests that differences in the underlying joint models are likely responsible for the majority of the deviations between contours the exercise s methodology focused on comparing environmental contours instead of models for the joint distribution of metocean variables however comparing the joint models and analyzing their goodness of fit could provide further insights into the various environmental contour methods the paper by de hauteclocque et al 2021 provides such additional assessment for the joint models that were fitted to datasets a b and c many quantitative and qualitative visual methods to assess the goodness of fit of a joint distribution exist the marginal distributions of a joint distribution can be analyzed for example using plots where empirical and model quantiles are plotted either over the same exceedance probability or where the empirical quantile is plotted over the model s quantile as a qq plot such analysis however does not inform about the appropriateness of a joint model s dependence structure to assess the dependence structure lines of varying constant density of a joint model can be plotted either on top of a scatter plot of the dataset or on top of constant density lines of the empirical joint distribution another possibility are centile curves where constant percentiles of the conditional distribution are plotted over the range of the conditioning variable examples of plots to analyze the marginal distributions and to analyze the dependence structure are presented in the appendix in figs a 1 and a 2 finally the tail dependence of the joint model can be analyzed for variables x and y this extremal dependence can be quantified in terms of the upper tail dependence see coles et al 1999 who use the notation χ instead of λ for upper tail dependence 8 λ lim u 1 pr y f y 1 u x f x 1 u λ quantifies how quickly y becomes extreme when x becomes extreme often the value of λ for a particular model can be determined a priori for example a bivariate gaussian distribution has λ 0 regardless of the correlation between parameters provided that the gaussian correlation is 1 for some bivariate copula models λ can be related to distributional summary statistics such as kendall s tau and to other model parameters the conditional extremes model of heffernan and tawn 2004 which was used in contribution 6 seeks explicitly to estimate whether the data exhibit asymptotic dependence λ 0 or asymptotic independence λ 0 a plot of estimates λ ˆ for λ for dataset d and one of the joint models is presented in the appendix in fig a 2 some methods that are commonly used to analyze the goodness of fit of joint extremes however cannot directly be related to environmental contours in the broader literature on statistics of extremes joint extreme events are often defined as events where multiple variables exceed high thresholds see for example cai et al 2020 and such a definition for multivariate extremes has been considered for structural reliability problems too see for example jonathan et al 2014 mazas 2019 if only those events are important where all variables exceed a high threshold a goodness of fit analysis could focus on such events and for example compare their probability of joint occurrence in many structural reliability problems however extreme loads can also occur when only one of the variables is extreme or even when none of them are extreme an ocean system often experiences highest loads when the sea state s spectral peak period matches the system s eigenfrequency even if at this sea state h s is lower compared to extreme h s values occurring at other peak periods similarly due to their controllers wind turbines often experience highest loads at intermediate wind speeds often around rated instead of near extreme wind speed levels see for example bachynski and collu 2019 agarwal and manuel 2009 where in the latter reference the important role of resonance and intermediate wind speeds is highlighted with special attention to environmental contours the definitions for multivariate exceedance that have been used in the environmental contour methods in this paper reflect this they are based on considerations about where in the variable space environmental events might lead to extreme loads in this study participants were free to use their contour construction method of choice which means they were free to choose a definition for multivariate exceedance thus we did not have a clear exceedance region for which we could compare the probability of occurrence predicted by the various joint models instead as the environmental contours themselves describe joint extremes based on the used definition for multivariate exceedance we compared the number of events that fell into the complete region outside the contours as a measure of the goodness of fit for the used joint models in summary the goodness of fit of joint model can be evaluated in various ways that have not been considered in the benchmarking exercise presented here analysis can focus on the marginal distributions or on the dependence structure as the goodness of fit of the various joint models appeared to have a bigger influence than the contour construction methods future studies could focus on evaluating joint models instead of environmental contours 5 2 discussion exercise 1 the degree of variability amongst the presented contours is noticeable for all of the comparison cases the maximum h s values along the 20 yr sea state contours deviate circa by a factor of two highest h s m a x 2 lowest h s m a x if for example we consider the contour for dataset a see lower left hand corner of fig 11 the maximum significant wave height ranges from ca 5m to 12m this range in maxima can also be seen in fig 13 which shows maxima of each contour consider that these different 20 yr contours are used to estimate the 20 yr extreme response of a marine structure if the maximum h s values deviate by a factor of two responses that are linear functions of h s will also deviate by factor of two for example if the motions of a vessel are analyzed in a sea keeping analysis where often a linear relationship between the h s and the vessel s movement is assumed then design conditions from some contours would result in for example roll or pitch motions that are twice as high as the motions calculated using another contour some responses increases even more than linearly with h s see for example vanem 2017 such that responses could deviate even more than by a factor of two clearly such differences can make a design either unreliable or strongly over conservative the number of points outside of each contour presented in tables 5 and 6 for sea state cases datasets a b and c and the wind wave cases datasets d e and f respectively provide a useful point of reference while the number of points expected to fall outside of a contour can be estimated analytically when independent events are assumed such a measure has multiple issues i hourly observations of metocean variables are not independent and identically distributed but are strongly autocorrelated fig 10 and ii for the environmental contour method it is only important whether a joint distribution model describes the true distribution at severe environmental conditions such that points outside the contour at severe conditions are of practical importance while points at non severe conditions are not the first issue serial correlation affects the metric in the sense that a single storm event might lead to one two or n hourly observations that are outside a computed contour consequently the observed number of points outside the contour is not the number of independent storm events but represents a metric that could be interpreted as the number of independent storm events weighted by their duration the second issue points outside the contour at non severe regions is well illustrated by looking for example at the results for contribution 9 in table 5 we can see that for the 20 yr contour there are 11 5 points expected outside of the contour but the three contours from contribution 9 have between 6 1 0 3 and 2 2 1 0 4 points outside of the 20 yr contour further inspection of the contours in fig 11 reveals that the vast majority of the points falling outside of the contour are at low significant wave heights in fact as shown in the right most column in table 5 if we restrict the counting of points outside the contour to those above a threshold of h s 1 m the results for all of the contributions are of more similar orders of magnitude as these environmental contours are most often used in the analysis of extreme condition design load cases it is reasonable to consider points falling outside of a contour with low significant waves heights to be immaterial thus it can be a sensible model choice to accept low goodness of fit at low h s values and consequently many points outside the contour at this area to increase the goodness of fit at the distribution s upper tail 5 3 discussion exercise 2 the uncertainty study presented in exercise 2 see figs 17 and 18 showed how uncertainty decreases with the available sample size as expected we see relatively wide uncertainty bounds for the contours when the ratio of the return period to period of record is large however the sampling variance even if only 1 year of data was used to construct the 50 yr contours was smaller than the variance among different contour methods compare figs 17 and 20 note that the kind of sampling uncertainty that was calculated for exercise 2 ignores the autocorrelation of the environmental variable s time series because the points are sampled randomly from the provided dataset each sub sample of for example 1 year represents the full sample better than any consecutive 1 yr time period consequently exercise 2 s sampling uncertainty is lower than if samples of consecutive time series would have been used fig 19 shows 25 contours that were computed by sampling 1 year of data randomly from the full dataset top left panel and 25 contours that were computed from 25 1 yr consecutive time series top right panel the 25 contours based on consecutive time series vary to a much greater degree some of them deviate up to 8m s wind speed and 8m wave height from the contour that was calculated using all 25 year of data the variability apparent when consecutive time series are used is more representative to the practical use of environmental contours however such an analysis can only be performed for very small sub sample sizes because the overall sample size of buoy or hindcast data is usually limited to a duration in the order of 10 100 years in fig 19 the bottom right panel shows five contours that are constructed using consecutive 5 yr time series the variability among these five contours is already much lower than the contour variability associated with 1 yr time series likely the variability would further decrease if longer consecutive time series were used however at some point the variability due to a changing climate could dwarf the inter annual and inter n year variability associated with a theoretical stationary climate exercise 2 only analyzed one kind of uncertainty in general the uncertainty of an environmental contour can be attributed to multiple components uncertainty associated with the quality of the metocean dataset for example due to systematic biases in measurements or hindcast models dataset quality uncertainty uncertainty due to limited sample size and sampling variability sampling uncertainty uncertainty associated with choosing a model for the joint distribution all statistical models that describe wave and wind can be considered to have some degree of model misspecification the associated uncertainty contributes to overall joint model uncertainty uncertainty associated with choosing a type of parameter estimation technique for example maximum likelihood estimation versus the method of moments or least squares estimation contributes to joint model uncertainty uncertainty associated with setting hyper parameters in the parameter estimation technique for example the number of intervals that are used when data are binned contributes to joint model uncertainty uncertainty associated with how the climate will change climate uncertainty uncertainty associated with the numerical methods of a contour construction method for example due to the used numeric integration method or due to the applied monte carlo method numeric uncertainty and uncertainty associated with which type of contour iform isorm shall be constructed to approximate the failure surface to ensure that the contour s exceedance probability and the structure s probability of failure will match contour type uncertainty this study only directly analyzed the uncertainty due to limited sample size indirectly it also provides insights into joint model uncertainty and contour type uncertainty fig 20 because many different models for the joint distribution have been fitted to the same datasets and different contour construction methods were applied note however that among the contributions joint model structures parameter estimation techniques and contour construction methods were varied at the same time such that the variability among the contours cannot be pinned directly to one of these factors other studies that analyzed uncertainties of environmental contours include the works of silva gonzález et al 2015 montes iturrizaga and heredia zavoni 2017 and vanem 2018 which focused on joint model uncertainty the work of vanem 2015 on climate uncertainty and the works of gramstad et al 2018 and vanem et al 2019 on sampling uncertainty in summary exercise 2 examined the uncertainty due to the limited length of an available dataset it allowed comparisons among different contour methods however because exercise 2 s methodology did not account for serial correlation the degree of the true practical sampling variability was not directly assessed an additional analysis based on consecutive time series suggested that the practical sampling uncertainty is higher the variability among contours derived from 1 yr to 5 yr consecutive time series was in the same order of magnitude as the variability among the nine submitted contributions compare figs 19 and 20 5 4 areas for future research as with any area of research the improved understanding of environmental contours helps to highlight a number of areas in need of further consideration serial correlation of sea states is a fundamental issue for environmental contours in that most contour methods rely on an assumption of independence between samples it is typical for sea state and weather data to be recorded hourly or with intervals in the same order of magnitude such as 10 minute mean wind speeds or 6 hour sea states nonetheless it is well understood that weather patterns and sea states can persist for many hours and even days from a system dynamics perspective the ocean and atmosphere are dynamic systems with inertia and cannot shift instantly without some memory of their previous state while some means of controlling for the serial correlation between samples have been proposed see for example contributions 5 and 6 more can be done to understand the implications of serial correlation of samples on environmental contours and to develop means of controlling for this effect serial correlation can be categorized by the time scale starting from short term serial correlation caused by passing weather systems to seasonal changes and climatic modes on the order of years or decades future research could explore the effect these different categories of serial correlation have on environmental contour methods short term serial correlation could be assessed by using a block bootstrap technique with block lengths of the order of one week similarly the influence of inter annual variability could be assessed by using block bootstraps with lengths of one year as briefly explored in fig 19 assessing the influence of longer term climatic variability is more challenging as there is usually insufficient data available to be able to accurately quantify these effects as discussed throughout this paper we have not presented any definitive correct solution and performed a test of contours based on this solution in the formulation of this benchmarking exercise we considered a number of ways in which such a test might be constructed one initial idea was to present data from known parametric distributions and construct contours from this synthetic data while this approach does certainly have value it can also be said that the distribution of environmental data varies we observe dramatically different distributions for waves in the us gulf coast versus the north atlantic another practical means of providing something closer to a definitive correct solution for environmental contours would be to utilize a very long climatic simulation dataset such as the 1200 yr dataset analyzed by jones et al 2018 or the recently published 700 yr dataset song et al 2020 that represents a stationary preindustrial climate bao et al 2020 in this way it would be possible to more directly assess the agreement between a constructed contour and the data of course climatic simulations and especially long simulations with durations such that they cannot be compared with historical measurements also possess model uncertainty and model error for the purpose of comparing contour methods however the errors in the model data could be assumed to be negligible and the effect of model error could be investigated separately based on these considerations a new benchmarking exercise was proposed that makes use of song et al s 700 year stationary dataset mackay et al 2021a environmental contours are generally used within a larger engineering design workflow in which the ultimate results are an estimate of a design response thus it is logical that the most important test of an environmental contour is not the contour itself but its ability to provide an accurate design response estimate however many design responses exist and they are typically specific to the structure for example one could consider maximum pitch angle in a container vessel deck slamming in an offshore platform tower bending moment in an offshore wind turbine or mooring load in a wave energy converter thus to avoid potentially favoring one engineering system over another in this exercise a deliberate decision was made to consider only the environmental contours themselves however based on the discussions from amongst this paper s authors a comparison has been made of design responses using these contours de hauteclocque et al 2021 in this benchmarking exercise contours of significant wave height and mean wind speed have been constructed these two variables represent aggregate statistics of the changing water surface elevation and of wind fluctuations over a certain reference period here significant wave height had a reference period of 1hour h s 1 h and mean wind speed had a reference period of 10minutes u 10 using a combination of 1 hr sea states and 10 min wind speed is typical for offshore wind turbine design see for example the recommendations in iec 61400 3 1 international electrotechnical commission 2019 in general however combining variables with different reference periods in a joint distribution model raises the question what kind of joint environmental state the distribution represents it is commonly assumed that the long term evolution of environmental conditions can be considered as a sequence of stationary processes naess and moan 2013 that is the random process associated with a certain environmental condition is assumed to be stationary for fixed time intervals of equal length to be consistent with this assumption one would assume that wind and wave represent a joint stationary process with a fixed length such that either wind speed should be converted to represent a 1 hr mean value u 1 h or significant wave height should be converted to represent the intensity of a 10 min sea state h s 10 m i n while there exist recommendations on how to convert wind speeds with different reference periods using factors international electrotechnical commission 2019 future research could explore how conversion factors change with wind conditions and how such conversions change the dependence structure of the wind wave joint distribution additionally if different reference periods are used they need be handled properly when time domain simulations are conducted the current standard on the design of offshore wind turbines iec 61400 3 1 50 pp 64 65 allows designers to either perform one continuous 1 hr simulation or six 10 min simulations and assumes that the maximum response values in these two options are similar 6 concluding remarks benchmark exercises were defined that sought to allow comparisons of alternative approaches for constructing environmental contours for different metocean datasets three datasets comprised 10 years of national data buoy center ndbc buoy wave measurements gathered from three locations along the eastern coast of the united states off the coast of maine a off the coast of florida b and in the gulf of mexico c these data consisted of hourly significant wave height and zero up crossing period data participants were asked to derive 1 and 20 yr environmental contours of these two variables an additional set of three coastdat 2 hindcast datasets comprised 25 years of near surface 10 minute wind speed and significant wave height values for offshore sites close to germany d the united kingdom e and norway f respectively participants were asked to derive 1 and 50 yr environmental contours of these two variables the development of contours as defined for these six different datasets was the focus of exercise 1 of this benchmark study a second exercise referred to as exercise 2 focused on characterizing uncertainty in the constructed contours a total of nine teams offered contributions for exercise 1 and four of these teams also contributed to exercise 2 with respect to exercise 1 differences in the contours provided by the contributing teams resulted mostly due to different joint distribution models employed for the metocean variables and not as much due to the different methods for contour construction additionally given that the amount of probability content outside some types of environmental contours is known a discussion on the expected and observed number of points outside the contours was presented while this quantity is not a universally agreed upon metric of performance of any contour construction and indeed points lying outside a contour are problematic in some regions of the two dimensional metocean space and not so much in others this issue was merely remarked upon and it was generally found that points outside derived contours varied by an order of magnitude among the participants with regard to exercise 2 as expected it was found that constructed contour uncertainty decreased with increase in sample size or amount of data made available the uncertainty in contours arises from multiple sources including selecting a type of model for the joint distribution selecting a parameter estimation technique selecting a contour construction method as well as the metocean dataset s finite sample size and climate patterns that are likely changing over time several areas for further exploration have been outlined in a section of this article the assumption of independent and identically distributed metocean data samples requires some reflection and perhaps some consideration in future contour construction efforts another issue worthy of exploration is that related to the use of contours namely in design accuracy of a contour construction approach may well be different depending on the application and

20445,environmental contours are used to simplify the process of design response analysis a wide variety of contour methods exist however there have been a very limited number of comparisons of these methods to date this paper is the output of an open benchmarking exercise in which contributors developed contours based on their preferred methods and submitted them for a blind comparison study the exercise had two components one focusing on the robustness of contour methods across different offshore sites and the other focusing on characterizing sampling uncertainty nine teams of researchers contributed to the benchmark the analysis of the submitted contours highlighted significant differences between contours derived via different methods for example the highest wave height value along a contour varied by as much as a factor of two between some submissions while the number of metocean data points or observations that fell outside a contour deviated by an order of magnitude between the contributions even for contours with a return period shorter than the duration of the record these differences arose from both different joint distribution models and different contour construction methods however variability from joint distribution models appeared to be higher than variability from contour construction methods graphical abstract keywords environmental contour metocean extremes

order reliability method isorm inverse second order reliability method mle maximum likelihood estimation 1 introduction the environmental contour method is often used to aid in the design and analysis of marine structures it is a simplified approach that derives extreme environmental conditions which can be used to estimate the n year structural response with n corresponding to a target reliability for an ultimate limit state for example n 50 years a more accurate approximation of the true n yr structural response can be computed by integrating the product of the short term response distribution conditional on the environmental state and the long term joint distribution of the environment this approach is usually referred to as full long term analysis see for example guedes soares 1993 muliawan et al 2013 because a full long term analysis can be computationally expensive the environmental contour method is commonly used to get a first estimate of the response or as an entire replacement for performing a full long term analysis it is important to understand that the typical two dimensional contour method ignores response variability conditional on the sea state or more generally the environmental state conditions and response computations are later made only for points on the contour that represent a subset of environmental conditions of interest for design for each design condition on the environmental contour a number of stochastic time domain simulations are run and the peak response in each simulation is recorded the peak response in the environmental state is then defined as the median or to indirectly account for short term variability a higher percentile baarholm et al 2010 muliawan et al 2013 of the peak values over each simulation alternatively short term variability can also be accounted for by inflating the contour by using a higher return period or by applying an additional safety factor that is multiplied with the environmental load norsok 2007 finally the design value is taken as the largest response over all design conditions along the contour there are two limitations with this approach to design first many environmental states are not checked and second the short term variability of the response is not fully assessed any full long term response based analysis see for example vanem et al 2020 makes neither of these approximations but can be prohibitively expensive note that the environmental contour method is a special case of more general inverse reliability approaches that can expand the dimension space by one variable to include the response conditional on the environment as an additional variable an advantage is that more environmental states can be checked than were included in the contour method but a disadvantage is that points on the hypersphere for the target reliability require quantiles of response conditional on the environment that are far from median levels and require considerable amount of simulations albeit less than with a full long term analysis and of course a greater number of environmental states must be evaluated than with the environmental contour method this has been demonstrated in the seminal work winterstein et al 1993 and explicit inclusion of response variability has been employed in the design of fixed and floating offshore wind turbines rendon and manuel 2014 liu et al 2019 it is important to emphasize that contour methods and other inverse reliability methods are acknowledged as approximate methods they were founded on principles of structural reliability with a view toward limiting computation that can be prohibitive with a full long term analysis deriving an environmental contour from a metocean dataset generally involves two steps estimating the joint distribution of the environmental variables of interest for example wave height and period and constructing the environmental contour based on that joint distribution fig 1 for both steps various approaches have been proposed the joint distribution can be estimated using different model structures such as global hierarchical models for example mathisen and bitner gregersen 1990 bitner gregersen 2015 horn et al 2018 cheng et al 2019 copula models for example vanem 2016 fazeres ferradosa et al 2018 manuel et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 heredia zavoni and montes iturrizaga 2019 lin et al 2020 kernel density estimates for example ferreira and guedes soares 2002 eckert gallup and martin 2016 haselsteiner et al 2017b or conditional extremes models jonathan et al 2010 2014 another consideration relates to how the model parameters are estimated even if the same model structure is used parameter values estimated using for example maximum likelihood estimation or the method of moments can strongly deviate from each other guedes soares and henriques 1996 vanem 2015 for the second step namely construction of the contour various methods have been proposed that differ in their definition of which regions in the variable space are considered exceedances fig 2 they include haver s constant exceedance method haver 1985 1987 the inverse first order reliability method iform winterstein et al 1993 the inverse second order reliability method isorm chai and leira 2018 inverse directional simulation dimitrov 2020 the direct sampling contour method huseby et al 2013 direct iform derbanne and de hauteclocque 2019 joint exceedance contour methods jonathan et al 2014 and the highest density contour method haselsteiner et al 2017a due to contrasting definitions even for the same underlying joint distribution for any target exceedance probability α different constructed contours will result from each of the methods broadly the contour construction methods can be classified by two criteria i whether the contour is constructed in the original physical variable space as with the direct sampling direct iform and highest density method or in a standard normal space as with iform isorm and inverse directional simulation and ii whether the contour definition is based on one or more regions in the variable space associated with the target α exceedance probability in iform direct iform and the direct sampling contour method the failure surface is approximated as a hyperplane which is equivalent to defining the contour exceedance probability as a marginal exceedance probability under a rotation of the axis during contour construction all axis rotations are considered such that there are many regions in the variable space that contain probability α however only one of these regions is assumed to match the failure surface of the structure of interest in isorm inverse directional simulation and the highest density contour method a single region that covers the complete variable space outside the contour contains a probability of α these two classes of contours can therefore be summarized as contours based on marginal exceedance probability and contours based on total exceedance probability a study on the properties of these two classes of contours was presented by mackay and haselsteiner 2021 the different definitions for the exceedance region are related to an important approximation of the environmental contour method for a deterministic response the method assumes that if a structure is designed using environmental conditions that have a joint exceedance probability of α 1 t r n y r where t r is the return period in years and n y r is the number of environmental states per year the resulting structure will have a probability of failure p f that is less than but close to α consequently it is desired that the contour s exceedance region is a conservative approximation of the structure s failure region note however that the goal of conservatism in the approximation of the failure surface is not absolute a slightly unconservative approximation can be compensated by choosing an appropriate safety factor which is later multiplied with the design load studies on different constructed contours for the same joint distribution have been published by leira 2008 vanem and bitner gregersen 2015 vanem 2017 huseby et al 2017 haselsteiner et al 2017a chai and leira 2018 wang et al 2018 and vanem et al 2020 a broad recent review on the environmental contour method was provided by ross et al 2019 and a recent effort presenting a comparison framework for environmental contours was published by eckert et al 2021 to provide a common basis to compare proposed environmental contour methods a benchmarking exercise was proposed at the international conference on ocean offshore arctic engineering omae 2019 haselsteiner et al 2019 this benchmark exercise involved two components one focused on analyzing the robustness of contour methods across different sites exercise 1 and the other focused on characterizing sampling uncertainty exercise 2 six datasets were provided each involving two environmental variables three datasets comprised time series of significant wave height and zero up crossing period while three other datasets included wind speed and significant wave height data participants were asked to compute environmental contours with return periods of 1 20 and 50 years these two dimensional contours of wave and wind variables were chosen for comparison because they represent common cases required in practice for design the use of sea state contours is recommended in guidelines and standards such as dnv gl s recommended practice on environmental conditions and environmental loads rp c205 dnv gl 2017 and norsok s standard on actions and action effects n 003 norsok 2007 the use of wind wave contours is required when following iec s standard on the design of offshore wind turbines international electrotechnical commission 2019 studies on sea state environmental contours include the works of haver 1985 winterstein et al 1993 eckert gallup et al 2014 velarde et al 2019 and studies on wind speed wave height contours have been published for example by saranyasoontorn and manuel 2006 and karmakar et al 2016 some researchers combined these three variables to construct wave height wave period and wind speed contours for example li et al 2015 2016 2019 vanem 2019 nine teams of researchers participated in the exercise and this paper presents the results the benchmarking study was designed as an open systematic comparison allowing for both different models for the joint distribution and different methods for contour construction the study s design did not aim to rank the appropriateness or accuracy quality of any participant s submitted contours or methods used to derive them but rather to provide a comparison of the wide range of contour methods that have been proposed in recent years the benchmark s results highlight and quantify some significant differences between contours derived via the different methods for example the highest wave height value along the contour varied by as much as a factor of two between some submissions while the number of metocean data points or observations that fell outside a contour deviated by an order of magnitude between the contributions even for contours with a return period shorter than the duration of the record while not covered by the originally scoped benchmark exercise proposal haselsteiner et al 2019 the paper by de hautecloque mackay and vanem provides further comparisons of the nine submitted contributions de hauteclocque et al 2021 the next section section 2 describes the contour methods that were employed in the nine submitted contributions it first provides a high level overview and then a single sub section for each contribution that offers additional details then section 3 describes the used metocean datasets and section 4 describes the results using the methods and metrics that were stipulated in the paper that announced the exercise haselsteiner et al 2019 finally section 5 contains a discussion and section 6 provides some conclusions 2 exercises and contributions nine teams submitted contributions for exercise 1 and four of those teams submitted for exercise 2 a high level overview of the details of each contribution is presented in table 2 in addition table 2 references code and stand alone papers for each method where available the two exercises were described in detail in the paper that announced the benchmark haselsteiner et al 2019 they were based on six provided datasets fig 3 three datasets dataset a b and c contained hourly buoy measurements from three sites off the us coast they contained hourly time series of significant wave height h s and zero up crossing period t z the other three datasets dataset d e and f were obtained from the hindcast coastdat 2 groll and weisse 2016 2017 and covered three locations in the north sea they contained hourly time series of a 10 minute mean wind speed u 10 at 10m above sea level and a 1 hour significant wave height h s the organizers provided 10 years of data of sea state measurements datasets a b and c and 25 years of wind wave data datasets d e and f to the participants for evaluation of the submitted contours another 10 years of sea state data and 25 years of wind wave data were retained by the organizers until after all the participants results were received to distinguish between the different parts of the datasets we refer to the parts that were made available to the participants as provided to the parts that were not made available as retained and to the entire set as full in exercise 1 participants were required to compute 1 yr and a 20 yr sea state contours and 1 yr and 50 yr wind wave contours the exercise focused on the robustness of a contour method across different offshore sites this robustness is mainly affected by the type of model used to represent the joint distributions three types of comparisons were outlined for exercise 1 in the omae 2019 paper plotting all submitted contours in an overlay for visual comparison reporting the maximum values along the contour in each dimension and counting the number of points measured environmental conditions outside each contour to provide perspective to the number of points outside the contours here we also calculate the expected number of points outside a contour assuming that measurement data represent independent observations the impact of serial correlation in the data on this metric is discussed in section 5 this number varies with the contour s return period and the method that was used to construct the contour table 2 it is important not to overly weight the importance and reliability of this metric since environmental contours are generally used in engineering analyses in predicting extreme responses only points that fall outside the contour that elicit large responses are generally of practical concern for this reason in addition to reporting the number of points outside each contour alongside the analytically expected result we also present the number of points outside each contour above a certain threshold exercise 2 focused on characterizing sampling uncertainty participants were asked to sample 1 5 and 25 yr subsets from the provided dataset d and to compute environmental contours based on these subsets for each of the three time periods 1000 such subsets were required such that 1000 environmental contours per time period were calculated to compare the contributions it was described that an uncertainty overlay of these 1000 contours should be plotted and that confidence intervals should be calculated the following subsections describe the individual contributions to keep overall paper length in balance the subsections are relatively brief however for some contour methods further details are provided in individual papers 2 1 contour method 1 by wei chai and bernt leira the environmental contours were constructed by application of the inverse second order reliability method isorm for calculation of the failure probability the form approximation will underestimate the result for cases with a concave failure surface in the standard normal space i e the u space see fig 4 b for a two dimensional example correspondingly the iform contour will yield non conservative results for design purposes in order to address such a shortcoming of the traditional iform contour chai and leira 2018 proposed a specific second order approximation to the failure surface in the u space generally the sorm approximation may provide better approximations to the failure probability than the form approach the failure surface of the specific sorm approximation is assumed to be a circle in u space for the two dimensional case therefore the estimated failure probability and the corresponding contour are generally conservative similar to the development of an n dimensional contour for a given return period by the iform method in the process of establishing the corresponding isorm contours an n dimensional sphere with the radius β s is first created with the value of β s being determined by the following equation 1 1 p f i 1 n u i 2 β s 2 ϕ u u d u where u represents an n dimensional vector in the normalized u space and ϕ u u denotes the standard multivariate normal probability density function it is seen from eq 1 that in the normalized u space the probability content outside the sphere with radius β s is p f moreover the sum of n independent standard normal variables follows a chi squared distribution with n degrees of freedom therefore the radius β s can be determined from the following equation 2 χ n 2 β s 2 1 p f subsequently the n dimensional sphere with radius β s in the normalized u space is transformed into the isorm contour in the original parameter space by application of the rosenblatt transformation if the joint distribution of environmental parameters is described by the conditional modeling approach the nataf transformation is applied if the marginal distributions of the environmental parameters in combination with corresponding correlation coefficients are applied in order to describe the joint distribution of environmental parameters in present exercise we used the baseline joint distribution models that were provided in the paper that proposed this benchmark haselsteiner et al 2019 they were established by following the conditional modeling approach 2 2 contour method 2 by guilherme clarindo and c guedes soares participant 2 used the models for the joint distributions that were provided as baseline results by the benchmark organizers however while the baseline results then constructed iform contours here direct sampling contours were constructed the joint distribution of metocean variables was obtained by applying the conditional modeling approach see guedes soares et al 1988 bitner gregersen and haver 1991 the model structure consists of a marginal distribution for h s and a conditional distribution for co variables t z and u 10 the marginal distribution of h s is assumed to follow a three parameter weibull distribution in all dataset while a conditional log normal distribution is assumed for t z in a b and c as for example in lucas and guedes soares 2015 for the remaining dataset d e and f the u 10 distribution is now conditioned by two parameters of a weibull distribution and the statistical dependence is based on scale and shape parameters whereas the log normal distribution was conditioned by the mean and variance respectively see table 3 the applied approach for contour construction is based on direct methods presented by huseby et al 2013 2015 as an approach to establish environmental contours directly in the original space of the environmental variables based on monte carlo simulations of the fitted joint metocean observations thus not requiring any transformation the initial inaccuracies due to insufficient number of monte carlo samples can be improved by a reject sampling scheme explained by huseby et al 2014 the understanding of this approach was extended to three dimensions by vanem 2019 contours were constructed using 10 as the angular intervals thus generating 35 points of intersection which can be defined as coordinates the number of samples generated by monte carlo simulation were five hundred thousand for each dataset 2 3 contour method 3 by ásta hannesdóttir and nikolay dimitrov in this contribution the inverse directional simulation ids was used to construct the environmental contours dimitrov 2020 as shown in section 2 1 and in fig 4 the classical iform approach is formulated to compute the probability of failure behind a linear limit state surface this formulation is suitable for classical reliability analysis where one assumes that the failure region is convex and the goal is to find a single design point the most likely point of failure then it is sufficient to evaluate the probability behind the limit state surface in the close vicinity of the design point however for other types of problems multiple points with equal return periods forming an entire contour or a segment a part of contour could be considered equally critical in such situation it is required that the exceedance probability accounts for all events outside any part of the contour or segment using iform for such problems would lead to underestimation of the failure probability and a non conservative result the ids method provides an exact solution for computing the total probability outside the return period contour or outside a contour segment of arbitrary size this is achieved by replacing the linear iform failure boundary by a hyper sphere in standard normal space as with the iform the reliability index β defines the radius of the sphere or circle in 2d which equals the l 2 norm of the variable vector u 3 β i u i i 1 n here u i are the environmental variables in standard normal space and n is the number of dimensions in the variable space because the variables in u space are independent and normally distributed their sum follows by definition a chi squared distribution in a n dimensional variable space the radius reliability index may be defined by 4 β χ n 1 1 p f where χ n 1 is the inverse cumulative distribution function of the chi square distribution with n degrees of freedom and p f is the probability of failure with the above formulation it is straightforward to determine the radius of a contour segment where only exceedances within a certain range of variable combinations are relevant for example for a contour of wind speed vs wave heights we may be interested only in the segment where high wind speeds are combined with large wave heights this procedure is described in dimitrov 2020 for the case when the full contour length is considered the ids method is equivalent to the isorm method chai and leira 2018 apart from how the reliability index is defined the implementation of the ids in the present study followed the general steps of the iform procedure as performed in for example hannesdóttir et al 2019 for 10 minute mean and standard deviation of wind speed measurements the reliability index was estimated with eq 4 for exceedance probability corresponding to the entire space outside the contour for datasets a b and c we modeled the joint distribution assuming that the marginal distributions of both the significant wave height and the conditional distribution of zero up crossing periods follow a log normal distribution for datasets d e and f we modeled the joint distribution where we assume the marginal distribution of significant wave height to follow a 3 parameter weibull distribution and the conditional distribution of wind speed to follow a 2 parameter weibull distribution the marginal distributions were fitted with the maximum likelihood method and the parameters of the conditional distribution were estimated with a least squares fit 2 4 contour method 4 by andreas haselsteiner aljoscha sander jan hendrik ohlendorf and klaus dieter thoben we fitted novel types of global hierarchical models to the datasets and constructed highest density contours our model for the joint distribution of sea states assumes that the marginal distribution of significant wave height follows an exponentiated weibull distribution and that zero up crossing period follows a conditional log normal distribution the model for the wind wave joint distribution assumes that wind speed follows an exponentiated weibull distribution and that significant wave height follows a conditional exponentiated weibull distribution recently we analyzed how well the exponentiated weibull distribution fits significant wave height data and we proposed a method that prioritizes high wave heights over low waves when the distribution s parameters are estimated haselsteiner and thoben 2020 this weighted least squares estimation method was used here as well the dependence structure between the variables was designed to yield simple relationships between u 10 h s and t z that can be interpreted physically the models assume that the median significant wave height follows the relationship 5 h s c 1 c 2 u 10 c 3 and that the median zero up crossing period follows the relationship 6 t z c 4 c 5 h s g where c i are parameters that are estimated and g is the acceleration due to gravity benefits of these dependence functions are that the parameter c 3 enables simple interpretation of how wave heights increase with wind speeds and that the dependence of t z on h s is expressed in physically consistent units unfortunately the exponent c 3 which is estimated as a float does not allow for physically consistent units in the relationship between h s and u 10 additionally the relationship between t z and h s requires only two estimated parameters the complete bivariate models for h s t z and u 10 h s required the estimation of 8 and 10 parameters respectively these fitted joint distributions were used to construct highest density environmental contours a highest density contour contains 1 α probability content within the environmental contour and has constant probability density along its path fig 2 thus for a given joint distribution it leads to more conservative design conditions than iform or direct sampling contours see mackay and haselsteiner 2021 for an analysis of the differences and application examples further details on this contribution are given in a conference paper haselsteiner et al 2020 2 5 contour method 5 by guillaume de hauteclocque the environmental contours were calculated using the method presented in derbanne and de hauteclocque 2019 compared to all other approaches used in the benchmark this method does not rely on the inference of a joint distribution extending the direct sampling method the two original variables h s and t z for instance are projected on a search direction α eq 7 and univariate fit is performed on each x α 7 x α v 1 cos α v 2 sin α for each direction α distribution parameters θ α for x α were estimated by mle or other means those parameters were used to interpolate extrapolate x e x t α at desired probability the contour was then constructed from the tangents or hyper plane for n 3 defined by α and x e x t α as with the tangent method described in huseby et al 2013 and illustrated on fig 5b in practice the construction of a contour from tangents works better if data are convex thus a variable change is often necessary additionally the data were also scaled so that the two variables have comparable dimension v 1 and v 2 in eq 7 thus correspond to the transformed and scaled variables in the current benchmark h s t z is for instance transformed to h s h s t z one benefit of this direct iform approach is its ability to straightforwardly plug any state of the art method with respect to the univariate fit here this possibility is used to get rid of the independent and identically distributed events assumption by using standard peak over threshold approach together with declustering on each search direction α data were declustered using threshold up and down crossing as cluster boundaries with an additional minimum interval of 48 h between clusters threshold exceedances were then fitted with generalized pareto distributions see coles 2001 for further details fig 5a illustrates the declustering effect on h s i e α 0 for dataset a the effect is dramatic for t r 1 yr while at t r 20 yrs conclusion are not obvious due to large sampling uncertainties contour construction from tangents is presented on fig 5b 2 6 contour method 6 by ed mackay and philip jonathan the joint distribution of environmental parameters was estimated using the storm resampling method presented in mackay and jonathan 2020 and contours were derived from the joint distribution using the standard iform method in the block resampling method it is assumed that the time series of environmental variables can be divided into blocks where the peak values in adjacent blocks can be considered independent the peak values of each variable within the block are not required to coincide in time but the blocks are assumed to be sufficiently short so that the peak values of each variable are related in some way a model for the joint distribution of the peak values is then estimated the distribution of all data is recovered by simulating block peak values from the joint model and resampling and rescaling the measured blocks so that the peak values from the resampled blocks match the simulated peak values as the data that the model is fitted to are approximately independent this gives a better justification for the use of asymptotic extreme value models the approach also has the advantage that much of the complex short term dependence structure in the data is resampled rather than modeled explicitly the block resampling approach only preserves the distribution of the peak values in the block for contours of h s and t z we are interested in both the maximum and minimum values of t z for a given h s to get around this problem we work with the significant steepness s 2 π h s g t z 2 and a distance variable defined as d h s 2 t z 2 2 1 2 lines of constant d are orthogonal to the lines of constant s in the h s t z plane see fig 6 moreover the peak values of s and d correspond to the frontiers of interest for h s t z contours the marginal distributions of the block peak values of s and d were modeled using a composite approach with a kernel density model for the body and a generalized pareto model for the tail the joint distribution was also modeled using a composite approach with a kernel density model for the body and the heffernan and tawn 2004 model for the tail a similar approach was used for estimating the marginal distributions of block peak h s and wind speed u 10 however for the joint distribution a piecewise linear generalized pareto model was used for the distribution of h s p e a k conditional on u 10 p e a k for intermediate values of u 10 p e a k and the heffernan and tawn model was used for estimating the joint distribution for higher values of u 10 p e a k further details are provided in mackay and jonathan 2020 2 7 contour method 7 by chi qiao and andrew myers a new framework is proposed for using global hierarchical models to construct long term environmental contours qiao et al 2021 in the implementation of the framework presented here h s and v are selected as the independent variables for datasets a c and datasets d f respectively and t z and h s are selected as the corresponding dependent variables the marginal distribution f x of the independent variable and discrete bins of the conditional distribution f y x are determined with a hybrid model that uses separate methods to form the distribution for frequently occurring values and for extreme values the distribution of the extreme values is modeled by first fitting a generalized extreme value distribution to block maxima of the data and then adjusting this distribution to include temporal correlation within the time series qiao and myers the extreme values of each tail are modeled with six parameters three for the generalized extreme value distribution plus three for the adjustment for temporal correlation resulting in a total of 12 distribution parameters for the extreme values of both tails the frequently occurring values are modeled empirically and so in effect the number of distribution parameters is equal to the number of frequently occurring values in the dataset the set of distribution parameters for f y x is represented by θ and the next step in the global hierarchical model is to find a mathematical form to fit the parameters of θ as a function of the independent variable x the form used here is θ a x b c however the large dimension of θ for the hybrid model makes this step difficult so the dimension of θ is lowered to two or three by fitting a conventional two or three parameter distribution that approximates the cumulative conditional probabilities of the hybrid model specifically for the range of quantiles that contribute to the upper and lower parts of the contour in this paper 14 types of parametric distributions are considered including normal log normal logistic etc for this approximation and a two parameter distribution is selected for each dataset as indicated in table a 1 this results in a joint distribution model that is defined by 24 parameters 12 parameters for f y x two distribution parameters each fit as a function of the independent variable x using three parameters for two parts of the contours upper and lower plus 12 parameters for the marginal distribution three parameters for the generalized extreme value distribution plus three parameters for the adjustment of temporal correlation for two tails note that these 24 parameters do not define the frequently occurring values of f x and this information is also necessary to fully define the joint distribution model and the corresponding long term environmental contour in this framework the frequently occurring values of f x are modeled empirically 2 8 contour method 8 by anna rode arndt hildebrandt and boso schmidt the parameters of all statistical models were estimated with maximum likelihood estimation mle and subsequently the contours were derived with the classical iform approach winterstein et al 1993 for the three datasets a c the zero up crossing period t z was opted as the marginal distribution whereas the significant wave height h s was modeled as the conditional environmental variable table 4 both the marginal and the conditional distribution were fitted by a 2 parameter weibull distribution the stochastic parameters of the marginals were estimated as above mentioned with mle the dependence functions of the conditional distributions for h s were estimated by using a linear regression of the previously classified weibull parameters datasets d f provide data of the significant wave height h s and the wind speed u 10 the environmental variable h s was assumed to be the marginal distributed variable for these three hindcast datasets in these cases the wind speed was the conditional environmental variable the environmental variable h s and u 10 were both assumed to follow a 2 parameter weibull distribution for constructing the environmental contours the classical inverse first order method iform as presented in winterstein et al 1993 was used 2 9 contour method 9 by erik vanem and arne bang huseby a set of environmental contours were calculated in this contribution as outlined in vanem and huseby 2020 all contours were based on fitting a conditional model to the data as a product of a marginal model for the primary variable and a conditional model where the model parameters are modeled as parametric functions of the primary variable bitner gregersen 2015 horn et al 2018 for all datasets the marginal model for h s were the 3 parameter weibull distribution for the sea state data a conditional log normal distribution was assumed for t z and for the wind wave data a conditional 2 parameter weibull distribution was assumed for u 10 based on the fitted joint models environmental contours were calculated by two different approaches i e the iform approach haver and winterstein 2009 and the direct sampling approach huseby et al 2013 2015 the main differences between these contour methods are that the iform approach includes a transformation to standard normal space and assumes a convex failure region in the transformed space or rather performs a linearization of the failure boundary in this space whereas the direct sampling approach makes the same assumption in the original parameter space see for example vanem and bitner gregersen 2015 vanem 2017 the direct sampling contours were calculated based on a set of monte carlo simulations from the joint distributions and there may be numerical uncertainties due to the monte carlo variance this can be reduced by increasing the number of samples and in this work an efficient tail sampling approach has been utilized in order to obtain a large effective number of samples with reasonable computational efforts see for example huseby et al 2014 vanem and huseby 2018 3 metocean datasets 3 1 bivariate patterns and storm events scatter diagrams of the six used datasets are shown in fig 7 individual datasets exhibit different patterns among the sea state datasets a b c the behavior at high wave periods differs in datasets a and b the highest observed wave periods occur at low significant wave heights while in dataset c they occur at high wave heights in the wind wave datasets d e f the observed maximum wave height at a given wind speed interval varies greatly between the datasets for wind speeds 10m s the observed highest significant wave height varies between 5 4m dataset d and 10 6m dataset f the scatter diagrams also reveal that the strongest observed storms events the highest wave heights and wind speeds observations vary between the datasets for example the highest observed significant wave height at dataset d was 10 8m but 16 6m at dataset f additionally the strongest storms sometimes occurred in the provided part of the dataset and sometimes in the retained part among the used datasets the difference between the provided and retained part of the dataset was especially stark for dataset a the maximum observed h s in the provided portion was 7 1m whereas in the retained portion there were four storms where the peak h s exceeded 8m with the largest storm peak h s being 11 8m the difference between the provided and the retained datasets can also be visualized by overlaying the empirical exceedance probability of observed storm peak h s in both parts of the datasets fig 8 for this analysis storm peaks are defined as a local maxima within a moving window of size five days for datasets b and c the empirical distributions are similar for the provided and retained portions indicating that a model that is a good fit to the provided data will also be a good fit for the retained data however for dataset a the empirical distribution of the retained data has a significantly longer tail in this case a close fit to the tail of the provided data will underestimate the slope of the tail in the retained data 3 2 serial correlation this benchmark provided datasets comprising of hourly observations of metocean variables consecutive data points in such time series are not independent and identically distributed but are strongly autocorrelated there are multiple scales of variability and correlation in metocean conditions that correspond to different physical effects these can be categorized as short term serial correlation of the order of hours to days related to passing weather systems seasonal variability inter annual variability related to longer term climatic modes for example nao enso etc and longer term decadal scale climatic changes resulting from both anthropogenic influences and from naturally occurring climatic variations the full time series of significant wave height are shown in fig 9 the seasonal variability is clearly observable because at these sites the highest h s values typically occur in the winter months additionally the time series show some rare storm events with much higher h s than the highest storms in typical years these rare storm events provide a challenge for estimating the tail of the probability distribution because a metocean dataset might hold only one two or zero such events the highest serial correlation is in the short term in the order of hours to days related to passing weather systems fig 10 the autocorrelation measured by the correlation coefficient of all three considered variables significant wave height h s zero up crossing period t z and mean wind speed u 10 is above 0 2 for delays of less than 1 day however autocorrelation was stronger for significant wave height compared to wave period and wind speed the cross correlation between wave height and wave period peaked between 3 and 10 h delay wave period is delayed relative to wave height and the cross correlation between wind speed and wave height peaked between 2 and 3 h delay wave height is delayed relative to wind speed the effect of short term serial correlation on extreme events is usually quantified in terms of the extremal index θ 0 1 see for example ferro and segers 2003 it can be shown that asymptotically extremes of a stationary sequence occur in clusters with mean size 1 θ hsing 1987 hsing et al 1988 the extremal index characterizes the effect of serial correlation at asymptotically high levels at extreme levels relevant to structural design the effect of serial correlation can be quantified using a sub asymptotic extremal index θ x θ it can be shown that θ x t x t x where t x is the true return period of level x and t x is the return period of the equivalent independent sequence mackay et al 2021b the equivalent independent sequence is the sequence that would be obtained by randomizing the order of observations in the dependent sequence alternatively t x can be interpreted as the return period obtained when serial correlation is neglected since θ x 1 we have t x t x so neglecting serial correlation can introduce a positive bias into estimates of return values at a given return period beirlant et al 2004 p 381 some authors have proposed incorporating estimates of θ x explicitly into inferences of extremes from serially correlated data to account for clustering in extremes for example eastoe and tawn 2012 however estimates of θ or θ x from data are subject to significant uncertainties ancona navarrete and tawn 2000 and for univariate oceanographic data it is more usual to work with either annual maxima or storm peak events that are approximately independent thus ensuring that θ x 1 4 results this section presents the benchmark s results using the previously described analysis methods first the results of the sea state contours are reported datasets a b c section 4 1 then the wind wave contours are presented datasets d e f section 4 2 finally the results for exercise 2 the uncertainty characterization that was applied to dataset d are reported section 4 3 appendix a lists the various joint models that were fitted by the participants 4 1 sea state contours a set of overlays of the sea state contours are shown in fig 11 in each of the six plots shown in fig 11 the eleven contour contributions are overlaid with the full dataset there are contributions from nine teams but contribution 9 contains three different contours that were calculated using the same joint distributions the maximum h s value as well as the maximum and minimum t z value along each 1 yr and 20 yr contour is plotted in fig 12 1 yr and in fig 13 20 yr for reference the empirical marginal 1 yr return value as well as the maximum and minimum of the full measured datasets are also plotted the maximum h s values along the 1 yr and 20 yr contours strongly deviate between the contributions for the 1 yr contours as expected among the contributions the highest h s value is from a contour that is based on total exceedance contribution 4 in dataset a and contribution 3 in datasets b and c for the 20 yr contours the highest h s value is from a total exceedance contour in dataset a contribution 4 and from a marginal exceedance contour in datasets b and c contribution 7 in all datasets the highest maximum h s value along the 20 yr contour is more than double the lowest maximum h s value for example in dataset a the lowest value is about 5m contribution 2 and the highest value is about 13m contribution 4 in dataset b and c the highest buoy measured h s value is within the range of the 20 yr contours maximum values but in dataset a the highest measured value is higher than all contour maxima this effect is likely due to the much higher h s maximum in the retained part of dataset a compared to the provided part ca 12m and ca 7m respectively in general differences due to the different joint models appear to be greater than differences due to different contour construction methods as there is no consistent order between the maxima of marginal exceedance contours and total exceedance contours if the joint models were similar total exceedance contours would be bigger than marginal exceedance contours the counted data points outside the contours are presented in table 5 as described in section 2 the expected number of data points outside the contours is different among the contributions as different contour construction methods were used see table 2 however for contributions that constructed isorm inverse directional simulation and highest density contours total exceedance contours the expected number of points outside the contour e n o u t s i d e is the same for contributions that constructed iform direct sampling and direct iform contours marginal exceedance contours e n o u t s i d e is similar note that if a statistical model was fitted to declustered data such that serial correlation is reduced the environmental contour will have smaller dimensions and the number of expected data points outside the contour will be higher for such a contour contribution 5 constructed direct iform contours after applying declustering for the first group the total exceedance contours the theoretical e n o u t s i d e is 1 for a 20 yr contour but between 13 7 and 114 0 points exceeded the constructed contours average over datasets a b c for the second group the marginal exceedance contours e n o u t s i d e is exactly iform or approximately direct sampling direct iform 11 5 but between 16 7 and 21966 3 points exceeded the constructed contours contribution 5 and 9 which have the highest points outside the 20 yr contour contain many exceeding points at low h s values which are irrelevant for structural design if these points are excluded by only counting sea states with a significant wave height greater than 1m between 7 7 and 280 points exceed the constructed marginal exceedance contours in summary in both contour classes the number of exceeding points varied by an order of magnitude among the submitted contributions 4 2 wind wave contours overlays of all contours are plotted in fig 14 the maximum values along the contours are plotted in figs 15 and 16 similar to the sea state contours there is a wide variability among the contributions the spread from the highest to the lowest maximum value is higher for the wave height values than for the wind speed values ca 40 50 versus ca 20 of the empirical maximum for the 50 yr contours for example in dataset d the contributions have maximum wave height values between ca 9m and 15m and maximum wind speed values between ca 25m s and 32m s the highest wave height maximum along the 50 yr contour is on a total exceedance contour in all datasets contribution 4 but the highest wind speed maximum is on marginal exceedance contours contributions 6 and 9 the use of the two classes of contours total exceedance and marginal exceedance contours did not manifest itself in two distinct groups of contour maxima figs 15 and 16 consequently similar to the sea state contours differences due to selected model types for the joint distribution seem to be bigger than differences due to the selected contour construction methods the number of data points outside the wind wave contours is presented in table 6 for reference the expected number of points outside the contour if events were independent is also reported for total exceedance contours the expected number of points outside the contour is e n o u t s i d e 1 for a 50 yr contour and 50 years of data but between 3 7 contribution 4 and 103 7 contribution 1 points exceeded the constructed contours average over datasets d e f for marginal exceedance contours e n o u t s i d e is exactly iform or approximately 12 direct sampling direct iform but between 8 3 contribution 6 and 15301 contribution 9 ds points exceeded the constructed contours similar as with the sea state contours the thousands of exceeding points in contribution 9 are at low wave heights and are therefore not relevant for structural design if these points are excluded by only counting sea states with a significant wave height greater than 1m and wind speeds greater than 1m s only 103 45 points exceed the contour mean standard deviation n 3 in summary similar to the sea state contours the number of exceeding points vary by an order of magnitude among the submitted contributions for both groups marginal exceedance and total exceedance contours 4 3 uncertainty of the wind wave contours to better understand the level of sampling uncertainty in different contours an exercise was proposed using a bootstrap sampling approach the procedure was based on a study first published by gramstad et al 2018 and extended by vanem et al 2019 and was defined as follows haselsteiner et al 2019 1 set the index i 1 2 resample y 1 5 or 25 years of data from dataset d resulting in sample o i 3 fit the model structure that you used in exercise 1 to the sample o i resulting in the statistical model x i 4 compute a 50 yr contour with the same method that you used in exercise 1 based on the statistical model x i resulting in environmental contour c i 5 if i 1000 increase the index i and repeat steps 2 4 this procedure leads to 1000 different environmental contours these contours were then used to compute a 95 confidence interval and a median contour the methods for finding the confidence interval and median contour can be found in haselsteiner et al 2019 note that the confidence intervals from this procedure are not a true reflection of the uncertainty due to a dataset s typical length because they neglect the serial correlation in the data thus the results from this exercise should only be interpreted as comparative between contour methods rather than quantitative estimates of the sampling uncertainty the effect of serial correlation will be further discussed in section 5 further contours that are based on total exceedance contributions 3 and 4 are expected to have greater uncertainty than contours that are based on marginal exceedance contributions 2 and 9 since for a given return period total exceedance contours are extrapolating further in the tail of the distribution overlay plots of all 1000 contours are presented in fig 17 each row in the figure relates to a specific contribution from top to bottom these are contributions 2 3 4 and 9 some contributors chose not to participate in exercise 2 the columns relate to the amount of data used in producing the contours in the left most column for example the 50 yr contours are produced using just 1 year of data moving to the right within the figure more data is used in estimation of the contours the overlay plots show that uncertainty decreases with increasing sample size in all contributions in contribution 3 when 1 and 5 years of data are used two different modes seem to be apparent a major mode where the contours upper parts have only strong curvature at the region of ca u 10 26m s h s 11m and a minor mode where the contours additionally have strong curvature at ca u 10 26m s h s 6m possibly these different modes could also be present in the estimated parameter values in the study by vanem et al 2019 on sampling uncertainty the estimated parameter values clustered around two distinct values in a case where they resampled from a hindcast dataset and used maximum likelihood estimation confidence intervals for all contributions are plotted in fig 18 similar to the overlay plots they show how uncertainty decreases with increasing sample size the confidence intervals for contributions 2 and 9 1 1 in contribution 9 the confidence intervals were computed with a different procedure than the one outlined in the paper that announced the benchmark haselsteiner et al 2019 such that the results are not fully comparable this procedure is described in the work by vanem and huseby 2020 and is considered to be only negligibly different from the procedure outlined in haselsteiner et al 2019 were narrower than for contributions 3 and 4 contributions 2 and 9 constructed contours that belong to the group of marginal exceedance contours while contributions 3 and 4 constructed total exceedance contours such that the latter group s contour required further extrapolation this additional extrapolation should lead to greater variability among the 1000 contours there are however many other differences between these four contribution such that it is not clear whether the different contour construction methods are the main reason for the different degrees of variability 5 discussion the results suggested that the different joint models were responsible for much of the observed deviations between contours thus section 5 1 will discuss the different types of joint distribution models used in this study then section 5 2 and section 5 3 will discuss the results of exercise 1 and exercise 2 finally we will suggest areas of future research in section 5 4 5 1 joint distribution models in this benchmark participants submitted contributions based on three different kind of joint models global hierarchical models a projected peak over threshold model and a model based on storm resampling these types of models make different assumptions on aspects like which kind of events the joint distribution represents all environmental states or only storm peaks whether and how the model accounts for serial correlation and how dependence is modeled both in the body and in the tail of the distribution in the comparison of contours and the maximum values along the contours we did not find a consistent ordering between contours that were constructed based on marginal exceedance probability and based on total exceedance this suggests that differences in the underlying joint models are likely responsible for the majority of the deviations between contours the exercise s methodology focused on comparing environmental contours instead of models for the joint distribution of metocean variables however comparing the joint models and analyzing their goodness of fit could provide further insights into the various environmental contour methods the paper by de hauteclocque et al 2021 provides such additional assessment for the joint models that were fitted to datasets a b and c many quantitative and qualitative visual methods to assess the goodness of fit of a joint distribution exist the marginal distributions of a joint distribution can be analyzed for example using plots where empirical and model quantiles are plotted either over the same exceedance probability or where the empirical quantile is plotted over the model s quantile as a qq plot such analysis however does not inform about the appropriateness of a joint model s dependence structure to assess the dependence structure lines of varying constant density of a joint model can be plotted either on top of a scatter plot of the dataset or on top of constant density lines of the empirical joint distribution another possibility are centile curves where constant percentiles of the conditional distribution are plotted over the range of the conditioning variable examples of plots to analyze the marginal distributions and to analyze the dependence structure are presented in the appendix in figs a 1 and a 2 finally the tail dependence of the joint model can be analyzed for variables x and y this extremal dependence can be quantified in terms of the upper tail dependence see coles et al 1999 who use the notation χ instead of λ for upper tail dependence 8 λ lim u 1 pr y f y 1 u x f x 1 u λ quantifies how quickly y becomes extreme when x becomes extreme often the value of λ for a particular model can be determined a priori for example a bivariate gaussian distribution has λ 0 regardless of the correlation between parameters provided that the gaussian correlation is 1 for some bivariate copula models λ can be related to distributional summary statistics such as kendall s tau and to other model parameters the conditional extremes model of heffernan and tawn 2004 which was used in contribution 6 seeks explicitly to estimate whether the data exhibit asymptotic dependence λ 0 or asymptotic independence λ 0 a plot of estimates λ ˆ for λ for dataset d and one of the joint models is presented in the appendix in fig a 2 some methods that are commonly used to analyze the goodness of fit of joint extremes however cannot directly be related to environmental contours in the broader literature on statistics of extremes joint extreme events are often defined as events where multiple variables exceed high thresholds see for example cai et al 2020 and such a definition for multivariate extremes has been considered for structural reliability problems too see for example jonathan et al 2014 mazas 2019 if only those events are important where all variables exceed a high threshold a goodness of fit analysis could focus on such events and for example compare their probability of joint occurrence in many structural reliability problems however extreme loads can also occur when only one of the variables is extreme or even when none of them are extreme an ocean system often experiences highest loads when the sea state s spectral peak period matches the system s eigenfrequency even if at this sea state h s is lower compared to extreme h s values occurring at other peak periods similarly due to their controllers wind turbines often experience highest loads at intermediate wind speeds often around rated instead of near extreme wind speed levels see for example bachynski and collu 2019 agarwal and manuel 2009 where in the latter reference the important role of resonance and intermediate wind speeds is highlighted with special attention to environmental contours the definitions for multivariate exceedance that have been used in the environmental contour methods in this paper reflect this they are based on considerations about where in the variable space environmental events might lead to extreme loads in this study participants were free to use their contour construction method of choice which means they were free to choose a definition for multivariate exceedance thus we did not have a clear exceedance region for which we could compare the probability of occurrence predicted by the various joint models instead as the environmental contours themselves describe joint extremes based on the used definition for multivariate exceedance we compared the number of events that fell into the complete region outside the contours as a measure of the goodness of fit for the used joint models in summary the goodness of fit of joint model can be evaluated in various ways that have not been considered in the benchmarking exercise presented here analysis can focus on the marginal distributions or on the dependence structure as the goodness of fit of the various joint models appeared to have a bigger influence than the contour construction methods future studies could focus on evaluating joint models instead of environmental contours 5 2 discussion exercise 1 the degree of variability amongst the presented contours is noticeable for all of the comparison cases the maximum h s values along the 20 yr sea state contours deviate circa by a factor of two highest h s m a x 2 lowest h s m a x if for example we consider the contour for dataset a see lower left hand corner of fig 11 the maximum significant wave height ranges from ca 5m to 12m this range in maxima can also be seen in fig 13 which shows maxima of each contour consider that these different 20 yr contours are used to estimate the 20 yr extreme response of a marine structure if the maximum h s values deviate by a factor of two responses that are linear functions of h s will also deviate by factor of two for example if the motions of a vessel are analyzed in a sea keeping analysis where often a linear relationship between the h s and the vessel s movement is assumed then design conditions from some contours would result in for example roll or pitch motions that are twice as high as the motions calculated using another contour some responses increases even more than linearly with h s see for example vanem 2017 such that responses could deviate even more than by a factor of two clearly such differences can make a design either unreliable or strongly over conservative the number of points outside of each contour presented in tables 5 and 6 for sea state cases datasets a b and c and the wind wave cases datasets d e and f respectively provide a useful point of reference while the number of points expected to fall outside of a contour can be estimated analytically when independent events are assumed such a measure has multiple issues i hourly observations of metocean variables are not independent and identically distributed but are strongly autocorrelated fig 10 and ii for the environmental contour method it is only important whether a joint distribution model describes the true distribution at severe environmental conditions such that points outside the contour at severe conditions are of practical importance while points at non severe conditions are not the first issue serial correlation affects the metric in the sense that a single storm event might lead to one two or n hourly observations that are outside a computed contour consequently the observed number of points outside the contour is not the number of independent storm events but represents a metric that could be interpreted as the number of independent storm events weighted by their duration the second issue points outside the contour at non severe regions is well illustrated by looking for example at the results for contribution 9 in table 5 we can see that for the 20 yr contour there are 11 5 points expected outside of the contour but the three contours from contribution 9 have between 6 1 0 3 and 2 2 1 0 4 points outside of the 20 yr contour further inspection of the contours in fig 11 reveals that the vast majority of the points falling outside of the contour are at low significant wave heights in fact as shown in the right most column in table 5 if we restrict the counting of points outside the contour to those above a threshold of h s 1 m the results for all of the contributions are of more similar orders of magnitude as these environmental contours are most often used in the analysis of extreme condition design load cases it is reasonable to consider points falling outside of a contour with low significant waves heights to be immaterial thus it can be a sensible model choice to accept low goodness of fit at low h s values and consequently many points outside the contour at this area to increase the goodness of fit at the distribution s upper tail 5 3 discussion exercise 2 the uncertainty study presented in exercise 2 see figs 17 and 18 showed how uncertainty decreases with the available sample size as expected we see relatively wide uncertainty bounds for the contours when the ratio of the return period to period of record is large however the sampling variance even if only 1 year of data was used to construct the 50 yr contours was smaller than the variance among different contour methods compare figs 17 and 20 note that the kind of sampling uncertainty that was calculated for exercise 2 ignores the autocorrelation of the environmental variable s time series because the points are sampled randomly from the provided dataset each sub sample of for example 1 year represents the full sample better than any consecutive 1 yr time period consequently exercise 2 s sampling uncertainty is lower than if samples of consecutive time series would have been used fig 19 shows 25 contours that were computed by sampling 1 year of data randomly from the full dataset top left panel and 25 contours that were computed from 25 1 yr consecutive time series top right panel the 25 contours based on consecutive time series vary to a much greater degree some of them deviate up to 8m s wind speed and 8m wave height from the contour that was calculated using all 25 year of data the variability apparent when consecutive time series are used is more representative to the practical use of environmental contours however such an analysis can only be performed for very small sub sample sizes because the overall sample size of buoy or hindcast data is usually limited to a duration in the order of 10 100 years in fig 19 the bottom right panel shows five contours that are constructed using consecutive 5 yr time series the variability among these five contours is already much lower than the contour variability associated with 1 yr time series likely the variability would further decrease if longer consecutive time series were used however at some point the variability due to a changing climate could dwarf the inter annual and inter n year variability associated with a theoretical stationary climate exercise 2 only analyzed one kind of uncertainty in general the uncertainty of an environmental contour can be attributed to multiple components uncertainty associated with the quality of the metocean dataset for example due to systematic biases in measurements or hindcast models dataset quality uncertainty uncertainty due to limited sample size and sampling variability sampling uncertainty uncertainty associated with choosing a model for the joint distribution all statistical models that describe wave and wind can be considered to have some degree of model misspecification the associated uncertainty contributes to overall joint model uncertainty uncertainty associated with choosing a type of parameter estimation technique for example maximum likelihood estimation versus the method of moments or least squares estimation contributes to joint model uncertainty uncertainty associated with setting hyper parameters in the parameter estimation technique for example the number of intervals that are used when data are binned contributes to joint model uncertainty uncertainty associated with how the climate will change climate uncertainty uncertainty associated with the numerical methods of a contour construction method for example due to the used numeric integration method or due to the applied monte carlo method numeric uncertainty and uncertainty associated with which type of contour iform isorm shall be constructed to approximate the failure surface to ensure that the contour s exceedance probability and the structure s probability of failure will match contour type uncertainty this study only directly analyzed the uncertainty due to limited sample size indirectly it also provides insights into joint model uncertainty and contour type uncertainty fig 20 because many different models for the joint distribution have been fitted to the same datasets and different contour construction methods were applied note however that among the contributions joint model structures parameter estimation techniques and contour construction methods were varied at the same time such that the variability among the contours cannot be pinned directly to one of these factors other studies that analyzed uncertainties of environmental contours include the works of silva gonzález et al 2015 montes iturrizaga and heredia zavoni 2017 and vanem 2018 which focused on joint model uncertainty the work of vanem 2015 on climate uncertainty and the works of gramstad et al 2018 and vanem et al 2019 on sampling uncertainty in summary exercise 2 examined the uncertainty due to the limited length of an available dataset it allowed comparisons among different contour methods however because exercise 2 s methodology did not account for serial correlation the degree of the true practical sampling variability was not directly assessed an additional analysis based on consecutive time series suggested that the practical sampling uncertainty is higher the variability among contours derived from 1 yr to 5 yr consecutive time series was in the same order of magnitude as the variability among the nine submitted contributions compare figs 19 and 20 5 4 areas for future research as with any area of research the improved understanding of environmental contours helps to highlight a number of areas in need of further consideration serial correlation of sea states is a fundamental issue for environmental contours in that most contour methods rely on an assumption of independence between samples it is typical for sea state and weather data to be recorded hourly or with intervals in the same order of magnitude such as 10 minute mean wind speeds or 6 hour sea states nonetheless it is well understood that weather patterns and sea states can persist for many hours and even days from a system dynamics perspective the ocean and atmosphere are dynamic systems with inertia and cannot shift instantly without some memory of their previous state while some means of controlling for the serial correlation between samples have been proposed see for example contributions 5 and 6 more can be done to understand the implications of serial correlation of samples on environmental contours and to develop means of controlling for this effect serial correlation can be categorized by the time scale starting from short term serial correlation caused by passing weather systems to seasonal changes and climatic modes on the order of years or decades future research could explore the effect these different categories of serial correlation have on environmental contour methods short term serial correlation could be assessed by using a block bootstrap technique with block lengths of the order of one week similarly the influence of inter annual variability could be assessed by using block bootstraps with lengths of one year as briefly explored in fig 19 assessing the influence of longer term climatic variability is more challenging as there is usually insufficient data available to be able to accurately quantify these effects as discussed throughout this paper we have not presented any definitive correct solution and performed a test of contours based on this solution in the formulation of this benchmarking exercise we considered a number of ways in which such a test might be constructed one initial idea was to present data from known parametric distributions and construct contours from this synthetic data while this approach does certainly have value it can also be said that the distribution of environmental data varies we observe dramatically different distributions for waves in the us gulf coast versus the north atlantic another practical means of providing something closer to a definitive correct solution for environmental contours would be to utilize a very long climatic simulation dataset such as the 1200 yr dataset analyzed by jones et al 2018 or the recently published 700 yr dataset song et al 2020 that represents a stationary preindustrial climate bao et al 2020 in this way it would be possible to more directly assess the agreement between a constructed contour and the data of course climatic simulations and especially long simulations with durations such that they cannot be compared with historical measurements also possess model uncertainty and model error for the purpose of comparing contour methods however the errors in the model data could be assumed to be negligible and the effect of model error could be investigated separately based on these considerations a new benchmarking exercise was proposed that makes use of song et al s 700 year stationary dataset mackay et al 2021a environmental contours are generally used within a larger engineering design workflow in which the ultimate results are an estimate of a design response thus it is logical that the most important test of an environmental contour is not the contour itself but its ability to provide an accurate design response estimate however many design responses exist and they are typically specific to the structure for example one could consider maximum pitch angle in a container vessel deck slamming in an offshore platform tower bending moment in an offshore wind turbine or mooring load in a wave energy converter thus to avoid potentially favoring one engineering system over another in this exercise a deliberate decision was made to consider only the environmental contours themselves however based on the discussions from amongst this paper s authors a comparison has been made of design responses using these contours de hauteclocque et al 2021 in this benchmarking exercise contours of significant wave height and mean wind speed have been constructed these two variables represent aggregate statistics of the changing water surface elevation and of wind fluctuations over a certain reference period here significant wave height had a reference period of 1hour h s 1 h and mean wind speed had a reference period of 10minutes u 10 using a combination of 1 hr sea states and 10 min wind speed is typical for offshore wind turbine design see for example the recommendations in iec 61400 3 1 international electrotechnical commission 2019 in general however combining variables with different reference periods in a joint distribution model raises the question what kind of joint environmental state the distribution represents it is commonly assumed that the long term evolution of environmental conditions can be considered as a sequence of stationary processes naess and moan 2013 that is the random process associated with a certain environmental condition is assumed to be stationary for fixed time intervals of equal length to be consistent with this assumption one would assume that wind and wave represent a joint stationary process with a fixed length such that either wind speed should be converted to represent a 1 hr mean value u 1 h or significant wave height should be converted to represent the intensity of a 10 min sea state h s 10 m i n while there exist recommendations on how to convert wind speeds with different reference periods using factors international electrotechnical commission 2019 future research could explore how conversion factors change with wind conditions and how such conversions change the dependence structure of the wind wave joint distribution additionally if different reference periods are used they need be handled properly when time domain simulations are conducted the current standard on the design of offshore wind turbines iec 61400 3 1 50 pp 64 65 allows designers to either perform one continuous 1 hr simulation or six 10 min simulations and assumes that the maximum response values in these two options are similar 6 concluding remarks benchmark exercises were defined that sought to allow comparisons of alternative approaches for constructing environmental contours for different metocean datasets three datasets comprised 10 years of national data buoy center ndbc buoy wave measurements gathered from three locations along the eastern coast of the united states off the coast of maine a off the coast of florida b and in the gulf of mexico c these data consisted of hourly significant wave height and zero up crossing period data participants were asked to derive 1 and 20 yr environmental contours of these two variables an additional set of three coastdat 2 hindcast datasets comprised 25 years of near surface 10 minute wind speed and significant wave height values for offshore sites close to germany d the united kingdom e and norway f respectively participants were asked to derive 1 and 50 yr environmental contours of these two variables the development of contours as defined for these six different datasets was the focus of exercise 1 of this benchmark study a second exercise referred to as exercise 2 focused on characterizing uncertainty in the constructed contours a total of nine teams offered contributions for exercise 1 and four of these teams also contributed to exercise 2 with respect to exercise 1 differences in the contours provided by the contributing teams resulted mostly due to different joint distribution models employed for the metocean variables and not as much due to the different methods for contour construction additionally given that the amount of probability content outside some types of environmental contours is known a discussion on the expected and observed number of points outside the contours was presented while this quantity is not a universally agreed upon metric of performance of any contour construction and indeed points lying outside a contour are problematic in some regions of the two dimensional metocean space and not so much in others this issue was merely remarked upon and it was generally found that points outside derived contours varied by an order of magnitude among the participants with regard to exercise 2 as expected it was found that constructed contour uncertainty decreased with increase in sample size or amount of data made available the uncertainty in contours arises from multiple sources including selecting a type of model for the joint distribution selecting a parameter estimation technique selecting a contour construction method as well as the metocean dataset s finite sample size and climate patterns that are likely changing over time several areas for further exploration have been outlined in a section of this article the assumption of independent and identically distributed metocean data samples requires some reflection and perhaps some consideration in future contour construction efforts

technology wuhan 430063 china maritime autonomous surface ships mass receive enormous attention in recent years compared to an individual mass greater efficiency and operational capability can be realized by cooperative mass an increasing number of researches propose different methods for cooperative multiple ships such as cooperative collision avoidance formation control etc however in existing research hydrodynamic effects such as the ship ship and confined water effects are ignored when designing motion controllers for ships in fact in the cooperative scenarios mass are close to each other where hydrodynamic effects significantly impact ship motions neglecting hydrodynamic interactions may lead to control failures thus this paper aims at connecting the research on cooperative control of multi mass and hydrodynamic effects systematic reviews on existing literature on cooperative mass are carried out in this work subsequently mentioned cooperative scenarios are analyzed and the parameters involving hydrodynamic interactions are collected then existing research on hydrodynamic effects related to the cooperative scenarios is reviewed to summarize the impacts of hydrodynamics on cooperative motion control of mass keywords cooperative mass hydrodynamic effects motion control formation control ship ship interaction bibliometrics 1 introduction a maritime autonomous surface ship mass is a ship which to a varying degree can make decisions and determine actions by itself and has great potential in improving the safety and efficiency of waterborne transport thus recent years have witnessed a rapid increase in research on mass moreover for potential efficiency gains additional operational capability and fault tolerance cooperative control of multiple ships has gained increasing attention however in existing research hydrodynamic effects such as ship ship and ship bank effects are ignored when designing motion controllers for ships in fact in the cooperative scenarios such as formation and cooperative task performing mass are close to each other where hydrodynamic effects significantly impact ship motions neglecting hydrodynamic interactions may lead to control failures which in extreme cases can result in a collision li et al 2017 in terms of energy saving observations from animal motions such as goose in flocks prove that the follower or the whole system could save energy by specific convoy shapes this biological phenomenon indicates that reasonable formation of the mass could minimize the drag and save energy both for the individuals and the entire convoy tian et al 2017 thus a well understanding of the hydrodynamic interactions between multi mass can help avoid rapid changes in the motions of mass which may lead to a collision or even a failure of the mission and bring potential advantages in energy saving at present the research for cooperative motion control of mass and hydrodynamic effects on ships are separated existing literature for the control of ships was usually from the perspective of an individual ship such as motion control liu et al 2016 l wang et al 2019 collision avoidance techniques campbell et al 2012 huang et al 2019a b tam et al 2009 collision risk chen et al 2019a b c d chen et al 2020a provided a systematic review on cooperative control of multiple ships but hydrodynamic effects are not mentioned for the hydrodynamic interactions most of the research objects were large ships or very large ships lee and hong 2017 considering the confined water effects and ship ship interaction effects lee 2003 yit sian et al 2016 between two ships for small ships only some autonomous underwater vehicles auv consider the hydrodynamic interaction impacts on the control system thus this article aims at connecting the research on cooperative control of multi mass and hydrodynamic effects systematic reviews on existing literature on cooperative mass are carried out in this work then mentioned cooperative scenarios are analyzed and the parameters involving hydrodynamic interactions such as distance velocity and dimension are collected subsequently existing research on hydrodynamic effects related to the cooperative scenarios is reviewed to summarize the impacts of hydrodynamics on cooperative motion control of mass the main contributions of this article are as follows 1 bibliometrics of existing research on cooperative motion control of multi mass and hydrodynamic effects 2 a review of parameters related to hydrodynamic effects analysis in cooperative scenarios 3 hydrodynamic effects that should be considered in cooperative motion control of multi mass and the methods to predict the effects the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides the methodology in which the basic framework of the survey and the classification of the research for cooperative multiple mass and hydrodynamic effects are introduced in section 3 the bibliometric analysis of existing literature on cooperative multi mass and hydrodynamic effects is presented section 4 discusses the research of cooperative motion control of mass and it also analyzes the parameters related to hydrodynamic effects section 5 reviews the existing research on hydrodynamic effects and provides the methods for predicting the hydrodynamic effects in the cooperative scenarios in section 6 we discuss the main findings and the connection between the two types of research the conclusions of this article are provided in section 7 2 methodology 2 1 framework of the survey according to the objectives cooperative control of ships can be divided into three types chen et al 2020a cooperative collision avoidance aims at finding collision free trajectories for ships through communication or predefined protocols formation control aims at steering a convoy of ships to form a specific geometric configuration cooperative manipulation aims at coordinating a convoy of ships to perform specific tasks the ship maneuvering motion is greatly affected by hydrodynamic forces and moments acting between two ships passing too close to each other in confined waters such as in a harbor or narrow channel two types of effects are the focuses in existing research for hydrodynamic effects ship ship interaction means the lateral force and yaw moment are induced due to the ships are navigating in close quarter confined water effects mean the ship maneuvering is affected by the lateral and vertical limits of the navigation area vantorre et al 2003 which contain two aspects bank effects and shallow water effects hydrodynamic effects arise with the change of distance velocity dimensions of the involved ships or bank shape therefore the framework of this survey is presented in fig 1 firstly bibliometrics about existing research on cooperative motion control of multiple mass are provided to show the research trend including cooperative collision avoidance formation control and cooperative manipulation the research for hydrodynamic effects is also reviewed secondly the research for cooperative motion control is connected to hydrodynamic research by parameters related to hydrodynamic interactions in the cooperative scenarios such as distance between the ships and objects velocities and dimensions of the involving ships thirdly the hydrodynamic interactions that should be considered in each cooperative scenario are identified then existing methods to predict related hydrodynamic interactions are provided in this way the research on cooperative motion control of multi mass and hydrodynamic effects are connected 2 2 literature search in the existing literature studies on cooperative motion control and hydrodynamic effects are separated therefore in this research two parts of the literature are collected the literature search method and process are as follows 1 the first step is to collect extensive literature in web of science published during 2010 2020 limiting the language to english and research domain to engineering a research on cooperative motion control of mass studies with the following keywords in title keywords and abstract mass or asv or unmanned surface vessel or unmanned surface vehicle or autonomous surface vessel or autonomous vehicle and format or cooperate or coordinate or communicate or flock or platoon or manipulate or target tracking or group or multi research with keywords that indicate that it is out of our scope is excluded such as underwater rov uuv auv aircraft drone car and truck b research on hydrodynamic effects studies with the following keywords in title keywords and abstract hydrodynamic interact or ship ship interact or ship to ship interact or interact effect between ships or ship ship hydrodynamic interact or hydrodynamic interference or bank effect or riverside effect or restrict waterway or restrict water or restrict channel or confined water or wall effect or ship bank distance or ship bank interaction or vessel bank distance 2 the second step is to check the literature and remove the research that is out of this survey s scope 3 the third step is to add the papers which are the source of certain research or are cited in the selected papers but not included in the database through literature collection and filtering a total of 121 articles 61 for cooperative motion control and 60 for hydrodynamic effects are closely consistent with the research scope the following review is based on this literature database 3 bibliometric analysis in this chapter bibliometric analysis is used to show the timeline and source distribution of 121 articles collected in the previous section 3 1 global analysis fig 2 provides the world cloud of the literature that we collected there are 4 clusters and most of them are strongly connected the red and blue clusters are mainly related to cooperative control while the green and yellow clusters are interrelated to hydrodynamic effects then the correlation analysis is carried out for the keywords of two aspects 3 2 correlation analysis of research on cooperative multiple mass when the keyword mass is taken as the center there are few links between mass and hydrodynamic effects as shown in fig 3 a most of the existing research on mass focuses on the robust controller design to resist uncertain dynamics and external disturbance moreover the main objects are to improve the safety of navigation to adapt to the real marine environment and to avoid collision with static or dynamic obstacles thus the design of a closed loop system not only needs to improve the accuracy and stability of the algorithm but also needs to consider the rules and regulations such as colregs the international regulations for preventing collisions at seas while the keyword formation is taken as the center fig 3b the keywords related to the control of the mass show in fig 3a are also there such as collision avoidance external disturbance and uncertainty however rules and seamanship are not mentioned there are more links between the center and keywords related to hydrodynamic effects in fig 3b than in fig 3a with the help of cfd computational fluid dynamics zhang et al 2017 2019 a b and experimental methods panda et al 2021 the changes of resistance to the velocity are studied and whether the interaction effects will cause the collision or grounding is analyzed in fig 3c ship resistance is closely linked to energy management however few researchers have studied the relations between formation and interaction effects for energy management liang et al 2017 rattanasiri et al 2015 hydrodynamic effects have been considered in the literature for auv formation control thus in fig 3d auv is taken as the center robustness external disturbance and the mathematical maneuvering model are also essential when designing the controllers for auvs when planning the path the factors such as collision avoidance total resistance and trajectory smoothness are considered besides when an auv operating in confined water or when the formation members are close to each other the interaction effects with flow field of the auvs would affect the forces motion with various distances sizes and velocities these interaction forces can be calculated quantitatively by experimental techniques or cfd simulations 3 2 1 correlation analysis of hydrodynamic effects as shown in fig 4 a in the studies for the ship ship interaction bank effects and shallow water effects are also considered the main reason is that the confined water effects amplify the interaction effects and vice versa fig 4b velocity encounter situation relative distance and ship size are the key factors therefore the potential flow double body which ignores the free surface effect and the fixed model tests can be used to accurately predict the changes of ship resistance and motion under different conditions in fig 4b the influencing factors and research methods of confined water effects are consistent with the ship ship interaction these two kinds of hydrodynamic effects may cause uncontrollable forces and moment acting on the ship and make the ship s trajectory deviate from the original course increasing the difficulty of maneuvering and the risk of collision and grounding when ships are sailing in channels canals or harbor areas the bank shapes are arbitrarily lataire et al 2017 within the existing publications bank shapes include vertical slope mound submerged wedge shaped and semi circle but the most common bank shapes are vertical and slope see fig 4c different degrees of freedom dof of ships are considered in the research see fig 4d the ship ship interaction and bank effects acting on the ship hull result in horizontal motions of the ships i e surge sway and yaw the shallow water effects force the ships to squat combination sinkage and trim thus the vertical motion of the ship hull such as heave and pitch are considered in some comprehensive scenarios the rolling of the hull has also been taken into consideration 3 3 timeline distribution of publications fig 5 is the timeline distribution of keywords reflecting the popularity importance and development trend of scientific research formation control of ships started at the very beginning researchers have realized the non linear and underactuated characteristics of ships they aimed to design controllers for collision avoidance path planning trajectory tracking and other multi mass cooperation issues in different encounter situations with the deepening of the research the colregs good seamanship external disturbance and uncertainties become hotspots li et al 2021 moreover energy management started to receive attention regarding hydrodynamic effects the research methods of predicting the hydrodynamic effects in confined water have undergone a series of development beginning based on slender body theory then potential flow is proposed in some cases the classical potential flow method cannot meet the engineering requirements thus researchers improve and develop the potential flow i e high order panel method and boundary value problem bvp or adopt the viscous flow method the research object has been expanded and developed from the same ships in the open sea to different scaled ships in different conditions such as moored and the passing ship tugboat and the assisted ship auvs and the host ship in confined channels in a word the research scenes become more complex and closer to reality 3 4 source distribution of publications a minimum threshold of 2 articles per journal is set fourteen journals meet the requirement see fig 6 journals in the red block are those where the research for hydrodynamic effects published where the blue block includes the journals where studies for cooperative control published the overlap is ocean engineering since it has a wide range of topics including hydrodynamics experimental approaches automatic control of marine systems etc overall the journal s impact factor of cooperative multiple mass is higher than that of hydrodynamic effects explaining why most papers on ship control systems designing were published in control related journals rather than marine or navigation related journals 3 5 discussion of global analysis to conclude through the global analysis of 121 articles collected in the previous section it can be found that cooperative multiple mass and hydrodynamic effects have some connection to a certain extent taking hydrodynamic effects into account ensures the maneuverability of the ship and has a connection with energy management however few existing studies combine cooperative control of mass and hydrodynamic effects at the same time 4 cooperative motion control of multiple mass this section reviews the existing research for the three types of cooperative control cooperative collision avoidance formation control and cooperative manipulation parameters related to hydrodynamic interactions in the cooperative scenarios are collected to find out the hydrodynamic effects that should be considered such as distance between the ships and objects velocities and dimensions of the ships 4 1 cooperative collision avoidance two main types of methods for cooperative collision avoidance are found in existing research 1 assumption based e g potential field daily and bevly 2008 2 rule based he et al 2017 the assumption based method predicts other ships actions either by assuming that others sail with constant speed and heading lazarowska 2017 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 or according to holonomic or kinematic models candeloro et al 2017 the rule based uses pre defined rules as the protocol to realize cooperation among controllers ships could coordinate their behavior through rule compliant decision making colregs are the most frequently used protocol other predefined protocols that define the actions that ships should take under certain encountering situations could also be used such as the half half rule in reciprocal velocity obstacle method huang et al 2018 2019 in accordance with colregs encountering situations can be divided into head on overtaking and crossing tam and bucknall 2013 table 1 shows that most studies focus on the crossing situation the reason is that crossing is the most common situation in shipping and sailing and it is widely defined in colregs however in the head on and overtaking situations given the high relative speed between ships and little time for ships to take appropriate actions the collision risk is high besides ships sail in parallel in such situations if the ship to ship distance is small the hydrodynamic interaction forces arise and they have strong influences on the maneuverability of the ships 4 3 formation control due to the improved degree of autonomy and personnel risk minimization by reducing human operator interaction unmanned ships are being used in several specialist fields liu and bucknall 2018 ranging from military operations such as search and rescue to civil fields such as resource exploration hydrography the formation control of multiple mass has become a hotspot and enormous related studies have been carried out in recent decades in formation control control strategies are designed to achieve the goal that each independent mass accurately meets the desired requirements in course speed and relative attitude mu et al 2020 the formation shapes of a convoy can be divided into two types amorphous and morphous the former implies that the ships are without specified desired formations i e each member is independent rather than treating the entire ships as one fixed structure qin et al 2017 the swarm is a representative phenomenon on the contrary morphous signifies the ships formation type is predefined and the involved ships need to cooperate to maintain the desired formation shapes an overview of publications for formation control of ships is presented in table 2 formations usually contain 3 7 ships among which a 3 ship formation is the most common the formation shape can be a queue a line a triangle a square or a trapezium the most common formation shape is a triangle with one leading ship and two following ships or 3 5 ships in a train formation these two formation shapes are inspired by a wild goose or duck swarm and such bionic experiences the formation tracking starts with a straight path develops into a curve or a circular path which suits the complex reality rather than focusing on the formation control algorithms our paper pays attention to the hydrodynamic interaction problems which are closely related to the dimension and the distance in the sway and surge direction with other ships static or dynamic obstacles thus the ratio of ship length to minimum distance is the most important factor in peng et al 2016 and wang and peng 2014 the minimum distance between ships is less than the ship s length the ship to ship interaction effects at this small distance arises but the influences of hydrodynamic forces on the ships are ignored in those papers what s more in qin et al 2017 tiang and mahyuddin 2016 wang et al 2017 the mass was treated as a particle and the ship length was neglected these simplifications are inappropriate for further studies in the perspective of the robustness of the control systems besides when the mass execute maritime searches and rescue missions the space between the mass and channel are usually close and the water depth could be shallow owing to the asymmetric flow around the ship hull forces and moments acting on the hull especially lateral forces and yaw moments and ship trimming to stern phenomenon are much more complicated than that in open and deep waters besides with smaller separation distances and higher speeds near the waterway the ship s trajectory deviates from the original course and the bow is exclusive with a large yaw angle the influence would significantly increase the difficulty of maneuvering to conclude two main hydrodynamic characteristics of ships in convoy need to be considered ship to ship interaction and the confined water effects on the independent hull or the convoy firstly in a convoy the distance between the ships could be very close the involved ships may sail in each other s wake areas which turns out to cause a change of flow characteristics and the hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull thus the mass can utilize the sailing wake from the group members to reduce total resistance and achieve energy consumption hence the distance between the vehicles and the arrangement of formation have apparent influences on the multi mass s total resistance secondly in confined waterways such as shallow water the mass convoy may have difficulties following its intended course and the possibility of grounding and collision increases therefore in light of robust maneuvering and navigation safety it is evident and essential to take ship ship ship bank and shallow water effects into account when modeling the mathematical models of the ships in the controlling algorithms moreover optimizing the convoy configurations in formation control which would in turn improve the propulsion efficiency and provide energy benefits for the sailing system to some extent chen et al 2019a b c d 2020b 4 3 cooperative manipulation according to the application scenarios cooperative manipulation can be divided into cooperative object transport caging and self assembly an overview of related publications is given in table 3 cooperative object transport regards a swarm of mass as tugboats to cooperatively move a large floating object e g disable ships baris et al 2016 esposito et al 2008 and large offshore structures feemster et al 2004 on the water according to the size of different objects the number of mass can be flexibly changed as shown in table 3 the mass are homogeneous while the object is much larger than the mass from the point of mechanics the tugboats are attached to the barge based on newton s third law the force acting on the tugboats and the object is the same due to the large scale difference tugboats are more sensitive to force changes it is necessary to consider the scale ratio between the tugboats and floating objects to ensure the accomplishment of a mission caging indicates the application that two ships are connected by a rope arrichiello et al 2012 bhattacharya et al 2011 or a boom giron sierra et al 2014 to trap and transport something caging systems are usually used to collect liquid on the water such as spilling oil in bhattacharya et al 2011 giron sierra et al 2014 pereda et al 2011 a caging system consisted of two ships is proposed for oil skimming and cleanings in arrichiello et al 2012 two ships are connected with a flexible floating rope they coordinate to capture a floating target from a given location and transport it to a designated position self assembly means a large team of autonomous robotic boats into floating platforms for humanitarian aid to hurricane stricken islands ad hoc landing strips encircling oil spills or refueling depots in the middle of the ocean o hara et al 2014 in these situations many small self propelled mass units join together to create floating bridges or islands for example in paulos et al 2015 an island formed of six modules and a bridge of 33 modules that span one corner of the pool is constructed simulations and model tests are the main methods to study the cooperative manipulation of mass in most research mass cooperates toward a predefined goal while anti collision with other ships or obstacles is not considered in some cases the space between the units is small even less than half of the ship length and the wake interaction is neglected these assumptions are inappropriate for practical usage to conclude for cooperative manipulation there are usually physical connections between the participants such as towlines ropes or booms problems related to cooperative object transport caging and self assembly have been investigated however avoiding collision with other ships or static and dynamic obstacles is rarely considered meanwhile unlike with cooperative collision avoidance and formation control involving homogeneous ships the ship s dimensions in the cooperative object transports i e tugboats and barge are pretty different also the distances between the ships are small might be less than half of the ship s length or zero under these circumstances the hydrodynamic interaction effects produce stronger negative influences on the smaller ones motion than the larger ones however little research focuses on this phenomenon for the cooperative manipulation of the mass 4 4 summary of potential hydrodynamic effects in cooperative mass scenarios the hydrodynamic effects between two ships approach zero when the longitudinal distance between the ships larger than twice the ship length vantorre et al 2002 therefore we collect the relative position and distances in the cooperative scenarios within this range see fig 7 the main findings are as follows 1 in cooperative collision avoidance cases encountering situations include head on overtaking and crossing in the head on and overtaking scenes especially in overtaking the distance between ships would be less than twice the ship length and most studies set the involved objects to the same scale 2 in formation scenarios formation shapes include triangle in line queue rectangle and trapezoid the most common formation shape is a triangle with one leading ship and two following ships in this case the relative transverse and longitudinal distances between ships are usually less than twice the ship length when the formation shape is in line the lateral distance between ships is even less than the ship length in formation scenarios the members are mostly homogeneous the scale ratio of participating ships is 1 3 in cooperative manipulation cases the ships are usually linked by towlines ropes or booms and stay very close to each other in some scenarios the ships are attached to each other at different positions and angles where the ship ship interaction effects are strong and cannot be ignored moreover the hydrodynamic force has greater influences on the motion of the smaller ones than that of the larger ones in summary in the cooperative scenarios the distances between ships are close thus the ship ship interaction effects cannot be ignored however little research focuses on this phenomenon for the cooperative manipulation of the mass besides most existing research focuses on open water where the closest distance between the ships are large however when the ships are sailing in the inland rivers or ports where the traffic is dense the distances between ships are within the range that the ship ship interaction effects are strong moreover in locks or ports where the ship bank distances and ukc under keel clearance are small shallow water effects cannot be ignored besides the space between ships the velocity the dimension ratio of ships and the shapes of the bank are also essential factors that need to be taken into account 5 hydrodynamic effects maneuvering characteristics of the mass are affected by hydrodynamic interaction thus it is necessary to study the hydrodynamic effects on motion control of cooperative multiple mass in this section research objects and methods of hydrodynamic effects that may relate to the cooperative scenarios are introduced 5 1 research objects 5 1 1 ship ship interactions when the ship is navigating near another they are close at transverse sp and longitudinal directions i e distances between o1 o2 along the x axis where o i is located at the midship of the ship x i pointing to the bow y i pointing to starboard the decrease of the local cross section of the flow results in the increase of flow velocity and the reduction of pressure liu et al 2020 producing the lateral force and the turning moment see fig 8 this is the so called ship ship hydrodynamic interaction at present the ship ship hydrodynamic interaction effects are mainly for an individual conventional manned ship and the auv convoy x wang et al 2019 for mass especially for the cooperative multi mass meeting special tasks as a convoy the research on ship ship interaction effects has a non negligible influence on its maneuverability in this case the wake making of the frontal ship has an impact on other ships the wake making of ships is a form of energy which may have favorable or unfavorable interference to the ships around under different position layouts the minimum and maximum value on the resistance and motion curve may appear in an individual or the whole mass convoy with the favorable wake making interference the resistance can be reduced and the navigation efficiency can be improved haseltalab and negenborn 2019 hydrodynamic interaction under different situations have been analyzed including ships in the process of head on encountering and overtaking the interference of passing ships on mooring ships chen et al 2019a b c d koop 2020 lee 2015 setiawan and muin 2018 yuan et al 2019 and two ships moving parallel during replenishment or lightering operations gierusz and waszkiel 2012 lataire et al 2012a b rattanasiri et al 2015 setiawan and muin 2018 zhang et al 2019 a b in the head on and overtaking situation the evolution of lateral force is characterized as repulsion attraction repulsion meanwhile the yaw moment is diverse in different encounter situations in the head on situation the evolution of the yaw moment is bow repulsion bow attraction bow repulsion bow attraction xu et al 2017 in the overtaking situation there are only two phases i e bow repulsion bow attraction xu et al 2019 when the ships are abeam of one another the bow of one ship turns away from the bow of the other causing their respective sterns to swing toward each other thus overtaking is regarded as the most dangerous situation yuan et al 2015 and more than half of the collected papers focused on this situation see fig 9 with the decrease of water depth or lateral distances between ships or the increase of speed the magnitudes of the lateral force and yaw moment will increase when a ship passes by a moored ship hydrodynamic interactions will result in unexpected movements of the moored ship a good understanding of this phenomenon benefits the design of the mooring system moreover when the ships are sailing side by side during replenishment or lightering operations the two ships in close proximity at the same direction and speed and the hydrodynamic interfere continuously which would produce a persistent effect on the automatic navigation control mode thus it is essential to consider ship ship hydrodynamic interaction effects in different situations in accordance with newton s law the ships experience even forces and moments however ships always differ in their scales thus the smaller ones are much more difficult to stay in their original motion state that is to say the effect on the smaller ship is more distinct than that on the larger one maritime and coastguard agency 2002 therefore when studying the ship ship interaction effects on the multi mass it is necessary to consider the longitudinal and transverse distance between ships and the influence of the scale ratio drafts d depth draft ratio h d where h is the water depth and other variables a large number of results show that the ship ship hydrodynamic interaction effects occur in the range of the longitudinal distance being twice the length of the ship and the transverse distance being 0 5 times the maximum length of the ships but most of the ship ship interaction effects are for the ships with similar scales li et al 2017 5 1 2 confined water effects confined water effects as shown in fig 10 mean that ships are restricted by the bottom and the bank wall in navigation waterways which include shallow water effects bank effects and coupled shallow water bank effects when a ship approaches the bank or near some fixed obstacles such as piers locks and docks or in a narrow channel the asymmetric flow around the ship induced by the vicinity of banks and bottom causing pressure differences between starboard to port sides bow to stern section lataire and delefortrie 2007 panda et al 2021 then the ships would be attracted by the suction effect and this lateral force tends to increase slightly with decreasing h d while when the ukc drops to a very small value the attraction force vanishes to zero and turns into a repulsion force it is confirmed in lataire and vantorre 2008 vantorre et al 2003 that this transition phenomenon is fr and ukc dependent where fr v gl 1 2 v is ship speed g is the acceleration of gravity l is the ship length unlike the lateral force acting on the hull the bow is pushed away by the bank cushion producing the yaw moment which increases dramatically with the decrease of h d when the ship bank distance is smaller and the speed is higher the bank effects more prominent which leads to the ship attracted closer to the bank and the yaw angle getting larger this phenomenon is known as bank effects in the shallow water areas the ukc is smaller than the design value which leads to an additional sinkage and trim besides with the changes of sinkage the wetted surface is altered resulting in a different frictional resistance simultaneously the pressure field of the ship will change causing variations in viscous pressure resistance and wave making resistance zeng et al 2019a b confined water has a noticeable influence on the ship s maneuverability and hydrodynamic forces baric et al 2019 when the ship is sailing nearshore especially during the berthing and unberthing procedures when the ship sails at an extremely low speed the rudder efficiency decreases or even fails under these circumstances external disturbances such as wind wave and current have a more pronounced influence on the ship s motion which request higher robustness of the maneuvering and control systems moreover when a ship s motion changes are large the hydrodynamic force acting on the ship is non linear due to the flow separation and viscous effects this phenomenon aggravates the squat of the ships the so called confined water effects are affected by multiple factors like h d ship bank distance d to breadth b depth froude number fr h ship sailing speed v and type of bank as shown in fig 11 fig 11a shows that most research studies on the confined water effects focus on shallow water h d 1 5 and very shallow water h d 1 2 du et al 2020 in shallow water the dimensionless froude number based on the water depth fr h v gh 1 2 is introduced to indicate the wave making resistance and the generated waves pattern related to both water depth and forward speed in the collected literature when fr h 1 fig 11b the speed is in the subcritical region havelock 1908 when fr h 0 5 the generated waves can be described by the secondary wave pattern which is known as the kelvin wave pattern with an angle of 19 2 8 the wave angle does not change with advancing speed when 0 5 fr h 1 the wave making area becomes larger meanwhile the wave angle rises with the increase of fr h resulting in a lift of resistance when the fr h approaches the critical speed fr h 1 it is evident that the wave making resistance increases significantly zeng et al 2020 and the ship trims to the stern in fig 11c when the bank boundary is limited the restricted horizontal channel reflects the ship waves making the wave pattern more complicated than in open water specifically when 0 25 d b 1 the bank effects are most significant duan et al 2020 interaction effects increase sharply as the lateral distance decreases when d b 3 ship bank interaction usually can be ignored liu et al 2017 a b thus ittc defines the dimensions of the towing tank as follows ittc recommended procedures and guidelines 2011 1 v v 0 67 m l b 3 4 1 1 f r h 2 0 67 m l b 3 4 1 1 v g h 2 where δv is the calculated return flow velocity v is the ship velocity m a x a a x is the maximum transverse section of the model m2 a is the sectional area of the tank m2 for all the fr h 1 fig 11 b δv v 0 which means the bank effects cause the increase of velocity consistent with the bernoulli phenomenon equation 1 shows that as the water depth becomes shallower the ship breadth and speed increase the channel gets narrower the bank effects are more obvious hence the impacts of confined water effects must be well understood to avoid marine accidents like collision and grounding du et al 2018 besides the shapes of the bank result in different effects as shown in fig 11e the vertical and slope banks are the commonest but some scholars study the special types of the bank including mound lee 2013 wedge shaped lee 2012 semi circle lee et al 2015 and submerged kim and ng 2017 maimun et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 due to the distinctiveness of the research circumstances the speed of the ship is mainly moderate 0 1 fr 0 2 and slow fr 0 1 see fig 11d 5 1 3 advancing speed effect ship speed is an essential factor in studying hydrodynamic interaction between ships and in confined waters which would aggravate ship ship hydrodynamic interaction effects ship bank effects and shallow water effects according to the bernoulli equation the pressure p at any point on the hull can be calculated as follows 2 p ρ φ t v φ 1 2 φ φ where ρ is the fluid density φ t x y z is the perturbation potential v is the velocity vector of the ship and v i is the horizontal velocity of the ith ship the hydrodynamic forces and moment acting on the ship are as following 3 x i s i p n 1 i τ n 1 i d s 4 y i s i p n 2 i d s 5 n i s i p x n 2 i y n 1 i d s where x i y i n i are the forces and moment along the three axes i is the ship number i 1 2 n i n 1 i n 2 i n 3 i is the outer normal vector of the ship τ is the tangential force s is the wetted surface of the ship to analyze the ship forces and motions in confined water areas a mathematical model is established through a series of experiments which can quantitatively analyze changes of the longitudinal force the sway force and the yaw moment under all realistic bank geometries and water depths the formulations are as follow 6 x 1 2 ρ v 2 l d ξ x 1 ξ x 2 f r 2 m e q 2 1 ξ x 3 t p 7 y 1 2 ρ v e f f y 2 l d 1 d 2 b ξ y 1 f r v t ξ y 2 d h e f f d ξ y 3 f r v t ξ y 4 8 n 1 2 ρ v e f f n 2 l 2 d 1 d 2 b d h e f f d ξ n 1 ξ n 2 f r e f f n ξ n 3 f r e f f n 2 where v is the longitudinal speed along the x axis ξ n is the coefficient of the mathematical model m eq is equivalent blockage parameter t p is the thrust of the propeller d2b is the dimensionless distance to the bank fr vt is the froude number calculated according to the speed in propeller wake h eff is the effective water depth taking squat into account v effy is the y axial speed in the flow field induced by the propeller v effn is the z axial speed in the flow field induced by the propeller fr effn is the froude number calculated according to the z axial speed in the flow field induced by the propeller among these parameters m eq and d2b are related to fr h details about parameter setting can be found in lataire and vantorre 2008 thus fr h can be used as a criterion when the distance between the ship and the closest bank y infl is larger than b 5fr h 5 the bank effects can be ignored because the forces and moment are proportional to the square of the ship velocity the influence of velocity on the forces and moment is more significant than other factors thus the advancing speed effect is of great importance for the cooperative control of mass and should be well understood besides the advancing speed of a ship is a significant factor when choosing cfd methods from the view of the resistance component total resistance includes frictional resistance viscous pressure resistance and wave making resistance the proportion of these resistance components vary with a change of speed at low speed fr 0 2 the frictional resistance makes up 70 80 of total resistance the viscous pressure resistance accounts for 10 and the wave making resistance is small enough to be ignored birk 2019 zeng et al 2019a b at this condition the free surface can be regarded as a rigid wall and a double body method can be used in simulating the hydrodynamic effects of ships many pieces of literature show that the double body method can still obtain relatively accurate results at a low speed duan et al 2020 zou and larsson 2013 for high speed ships the frictional resistance accounts for about 50 and the viscous pressure resistance only 5 and the proportion of wave making resistance increases to 40 50 of total resistance in this situation the free surface effects must be considered for improving computational efficiency and obtaining satisfactory predictions the potential flow method is usually adopted 5 2 research methods three main methodologies are utilized to explore the hydrodynamic effects shown in fig 12 theoretical method experimental method and numerical simulation method results of theoretical studies within the framework of the slender body assumption are universal raven 2019a setiawan and muin 2018 sulistyawati et al 2019 various factors affecting the hydrodynamic effects of the ship are also clearly visible however research objects are simplified for the primary purpose which means this method is not available for solving actual problems experimental methods are divided into full scale tests paulauskas et al 2020 and ship model tests lataire et al 2012a b lataire and vantorre 2017 lee 2013 liu et al 2017 a b mucha et al 2018 zeng et al 2018a b the cost of the former method is high while the latter is influenced by the scale effect the numerical simulation is cost effective and shortens the research periods it has been widely used to replace some time consuming and difficult to operate experiments huang et al 2020 the numerical methods for predicting the hydrodynamic interaction between ships and confined water include potential flow bari and matveev 2016 kadri and weihs 2015 ren et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 and viscous flow the potential flow method assumes that the fluid is nonviscous and irrotational yuan 2019 the process of solving hydrodynamic forces is transformed into satisfying the laplace equation in the fluid domain and the initial boundary value problem is usually solved by the green function in the 1960s and 1970s the panel method and rankine panel method zhou et al 2015 were proposed then the high order panel method xu et al 2017 2019 was proposed to improve the defects of the constant panel method cpm compared to the potential flow method the viscous flow method simulates the flow on the water surface the flow is generally set as turbulent flow and the viscous incompressible navier stokes n s equation is applied to solve such flow phenomena besides the direct numerical simulation dns is proposed to replace the original flow with the mean flow field at present two averaging methods are used to study the viscous flow problem one is the large eddy simulation les with spatial average and the other is the reynolds average navier stokes rans for the system average the dns directly solves the n s equation and calculates the evolution of all variables in three dimensional space theoretically the dns can obtain all the information of turbulent flow without any turbulence model thus it is an accurate method to simulate turbulence however from the perspective of the spatial domain it is necessary to take a very small scale mesh to capture the vortices to ensure accuracy while for the sake of stability of the simulation process it is necessary to set up a very small time step to distinguish the detailed spatial structure and time characteristics of the turbulence in the time domain considering the current computers computational efficiency and memory capacity the dns is only adopted to solve turbulent problems with medium or lower reynolds number or cases with simple geometric structures however to analyze the hydrodynamic interactions among cooperative mass the amount of grid would be enormous it may not be appropriate to utilize the dns method to study the ship ship and ship bank interaction effects the les is a turbulence simulation method between rans and dns the principle of which is all variables of the flow could be filtered into large scale and small scale large scale quantities that are greatly affected by boundary conditions are directly calculated by solving differential equations in contrast the small scale quantities are obtained by establishing the subgrid scale turbulent model compared with dns the les method reduces the computation workload and is suitable to solve cases with higher reynolds number and more complex geometry structure when the turbulent model is appropriate les is more precise than rans though this method is developing some unexpected obstacles exist for example les asks for a better computing capacity and lacks accuracy on the boundary layer of small scale flows therefore the les method is not yet widely used as a practical tool for engineering conditions the rans equation is based on the statistical theory and regards the turbulence as the superposition of time averaged flow and instantaneous impulse flow thus compared with dns and les there are some deviations in the calculation results of rans therefore some researchers advised using detached eddy simulation des to simulate the turbulence whose basic idea is combining les with s a turbulence model les is used to simulate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the ship in the region where large eddy transport is the main feature rans is used in the region where dissipation is the main feature in conclusion theoretically dns and les are more accurate than rans however they are limited by the computing performance and the model complexity furthermore little research is carried with des because the accuracy of that cannot be verified hence it is evident that solving the rans equation is the first choice to study the ship ship and confined water hydrodynamic interaction effects on motion control of cooperative multiple mass at present the rans equation can be solved by open usage and commercial cfd code as shown in table 5 compared with commercial software open usage has higher requirements for programming while the commercial software is easy to operate and the accuracy is guaranteed therefore much research utilizes the existing commercial software to study the hydrodynamic performance of the ship when adopting the rans equation to work on turbulence flow the reynolds stress term is added leading the reynolds equations not closed thus the turbulence model is introduced and the relationship between the additional stress caused by turbulence impulse and the time average strain rate is established in this way the reynolds equations can be closed and solved with the finite volume method fvm the main turbulence models are eddy viscosity models and reynolds stress models most research on the ship s hydrodynamic effects used two equation based turbulence model including sst k ω realizable k ω and rng k ω panda et al 2021 see table 6 6 discussion hydrodynamic performances of ships are seriously affected by ship ship distance ship bank distance and water depth which are known as ship ship interaction and confined water effect in cooperative scenarios ships are usually close to each other where hydrodynamic effects significantly impact ship motions taking relative distance as an example in cooperative collision avoidance the extreme ship ship longitudinal distance could be less than one ship length for formation control the relative distance lies in a range from less than one ship length to longer than two times of ship length in both longitudinal and transverse directions due to the specificity of sailing missions relative distances in cooperative manipulation are usually less than half of ship length requiring a physical contact of objectives on the other hand when the longitudinal distance of ship is less than two times of the ship length and transverse distance of ship ship or ship bank is less than 0 5 times of the ship length strong ship ship or ship bank interaction could be observed when the depth to draft ratio is less than 1 5 significant shallow water effects will arise the influences of ship ship and confined water cause resistance changes and have significant impacts on ship motion in the ship ship interaction the impacts have a bearing on encounter situations during head on and overtaking the lateral force follows the process of repulsion attraction repulsion at the same time the yaw moment is diverse in the head on situation the yaw moment experiences four phases bow repulsion bow attraction bow repulsion bow attraction in the overtaking situation there are two phases bow repulsion bow attraction the tendency in various water depth velocity ship ship distance is similar but the magnitudes are affected in the confined water the hull experiences bank suction bank repulsion bow out sinkage and trim those phenomena are related to ship bank distance water depth velocity and shape of bank these effects are usually unfavorable to the hydrodynamic performance of ships which may lead to unexpected collision and grounding furthermore in busy inland waterways it is foreseeable that the hydrodynamic effects are stronger than those in open water thus it is much more challenging to achieve cooperative control of mass as there are much more numbers of sailing and berthing ships much narrower channels and smaller ship ship distances much shallower water depths moreover types of ships influence the effects predicting the wave patterns of homogeneous ships is possible however for heterogeneous ships the wake patterns are hard to predict so as the ship motions besides the sizes of ships also increase the difficulty of controlling the motions of the ships for instance when tugboats assist a ship to a specified quay tugboats are usually connected to the bow midship and stern because of the huge difference in ship sizes the hydrodynamic performance and motions of the tugboats are significantly influence regardless of the low speed of the large ship however we could also make use of the hydrodynamic effects if the effects can be accurately predicted a reasonable formation could minimize the forces and moment reduce the harmful ship motions save energy both for the individuals and the entire convoy like theoretical and experimental methods traditional methods have some deficiencies such as oversimplified research objects and high economic costs cfd method is getting admitted for its convenience economic and foundation of mathematics cfd methods such as potential flow methods viscous flow methods are mostly adopted to predict the hydrodynamic performances of ships the former method focuses on the wave making resistance of research objects by ignoring the viscosity of the fluid the simulation process is time saving and the results are relatively accurate at high speed of ships fr 0 2 for the wave making resistance component takes up more than 50 of total resistance for the latter method the viscous flow method the numerical solving process is relatively time consuming however the results are more accurate and more details of the changes of ship pressure ship resistance flow field could be obtained besides when the fr 0 2 a viscous flow based double body could be adopted to study the resistance and pressure of the objects by ignoring the free surface for the convenience and accuracy when utilizing cfd methods it is significant to determine the needs of simulation as for forces moment and flow field development tendency study at high speed the potential flow method is sufficient as for studies at slow speed the viscous flow based double body method could get accurate results to have an insight into the details of the changes the viscous flow method is a more suitable way at present the research for cooperative motion control of mass and hydrodynamic effects on ships is separated in the literature few studies combine cooperative control of mass and hydrodynamic effects in the study of hydrodynamic effects the forces and moments of the two ships in different scenarios are considered and the interaction between multiple ships is lacking simultaneously most research holds the assumptions to simplify the problem such as the two ships courses are parallel or the ships are parallel to the bank so that the effects of drift can be ignored besides the propeller and rudder also affect the magnitude of hydrodynamic forces and moment at present the research on confined water effects mainly regards the bank as regular shapes and thus the h t is constant however in reality the bank shapes are arbitrary and the h t varies with the bank shapes and seabed it is worth noting that the autonomy degrees of ships in the categories of research according to the imo international maritime organization there are four degrees of autonomy identified of ships ship with automated processes and decision support remotely controlled ship with seafarers on board remotely controlled ship without seafarers on board and fully autonomous ship because the formation control of ships requires precise speed or position tracking ability ships are usually assumed to be fully autonomous in related research on the contrary hydrodynamic analysis of ships is usually for existing manned ships with no or low autonomy levels in summary considering the influence of hydrodynamic effects on cooperative control of mass has great potential in achieving precise control optimizing formation shape reducing resistance and motion improving energy efficiency and navigation safety 7 conclusion this article aims at connecting the research on cooperative control of multi mass and hydrodynamic effects a systematic survey on hydrodynamic effects on cooperative multiple mass is carried out based on 121 publications between 2010 and 2020 bibliometrics about existing research on cooperative motion control of multiple mass including cooperative collision avoidance formation control and cooperative manipulation are provided to show the trend of research as well as the research for hydrodynamic effects then the research for cooperative motion control is connected to hydrodynamic research by parameters related to hydrodynamic interactions in the cooperative scenarios such as distance between the ships and objects velocities and dimensions of the involving ships consequently the hydrodynamic interactions that should be considered in each cooperative scenario are identified moreover existing methods to predict related hydrodynamic interactions are provided however this paper only makes a qualitative analysis of the hydrodynamic interaction on cooperative control of mass we need to quantify hydrodynamic interaction effects in future work which is the foundation for precise cooperative control of mass and exploiting the potential of energy saving declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

technology wuhan 430063 china maritime autonomous surface ships mass receive enormous attention in recent years compared to an individual mass greater efficiency and operational capability can be realized by cooperative mass an increasing number of researches propose different methods for cooperative multiple ships such as cooperative collision avoidance formation control etc however in existing research hydrodynamic effects such as the ship ship and confined water effects are ignored when designing motion controllers for ships in fact in the cooperative scenarios mass are close to each other where hydrodynamic effects significantly impact ship motions neglecting hydrodynamic interactions may lead to control failures thus this paper aims at connecting the research on cooperative control of multi mass and hydrodynamic effects systematic reviews on existing literature on cooperative mass are carried out in this work subsequently mentioned cooperative scenarios are analyzed and the parameters involving hydrodynamic interactions are collected then existing research on hydrodynamic effects related to the cooperative scenarios is reviewed to summarize the impacts of hydrodynamics on cooperative motion control of mass keywords cooperative mass hydrodynamic effects motion control formation control ship ship interaction bibliometrics 1 introduction a maritime autonomous surface ship mass is a ship which to a varying degree can make decisions and determine actions by itself and has great potential in improving the safety and efficiency of waterborne transport thus recent years have witnessed a rapid increase in research on mass moreover for potential efficiency gains additional operational capability and fault tolerance cooperative control of multiple ships has gained increasing attention however in existing research hydrodynamic effects such as ship ship and ship bank effects are ignored when designing motion controllers for ships in fact in the cooperative scenarios such as formation and cooperative task performing mass are close to each other where hydrodynamic effects significantly impact ship motions neglecting hydrodynamic interactions may lead to control failures which in extreme cases can result in a collision li et al 2017 in terms of energy saving observations from animal motions such as goose in flocks prove that the follower or the whole system could save energy by specific convoy shapes this biological phenomenon indicates that reasonable formation of the mass could minimize the drag and save energy both for the individuals and the entire convoy tian et al 2017 thus a well understanding of the hydrodynamic interactions between multi mass can help avoid rapid changes in the motions of mass which may lead to a collision or even a failure of the mission and bring potential advantages in energy saving at present the research for cooperative motion control of mass and hydrodynamic effects on ships are separated existing literature for the control of ships was usually from the perspective of an individual ship such as motion control liu et al 2016 l wang et al 2019 collision avoidance techniques campbell et al 2012 huang et al 2019a b tam et al 2009 collision risk chen et al 2019a b c d chen et al 2020a provided a systematic review on cooperative control of multiple ships but hydrodynamic effects are not mentioned for the hydrodynamic interactions most of the research objects were large ships or very large ships lee and hong 2017 considering the confined water effects and ship ship interaction effects lee 2003 yit sian et al 2016 between two ships for small ships only some autonomous underwater vehicles auv consider the hydrodynamic interaction impacts on the control system thus this article aims at connecting the research on cooperative control of multi mass and hydrodynamic effects systematic reviews on existing literature on cooperative mass are carried out in this work then mentioned cooperative scenarios are analyzed and the parameters involving hydrodynamic interactions such as distance velocity and dimension are collected subsequently existing research on hydrodynamic effects related to the cooperative scenarios is reviewed to summarize the impacts of hydrodynamics on cooperative motion control of mass the main contributions of this article are as follows 1 bibliometrics of existing research on cooperative motion control of multi mass and hydrodynamic effects 2 a review of parameters related to hydrodynamic effects analysis in cooperative scenarios 3 hydrodynamic effects that should be considered in cooperative motion control of multi mass and the methods to predict the effects the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides the methodology in which the basic framework of the survey and the classification of the research for cooperative multiple mass and hydrodynamic effects are introduced in section 3 the bibliometric analysis of existing literature on cooperative multi mass and hydrodynamic effects is presented section 4 discusses the research of cooperative motion control of mass and it also analyzes the parameters related to hydrodynamic effects section 5 reviews the existing research on hydrodynamic effects and provides the methods for predicting the hydrodynamic effects in the cooperative scenarios in section 6 we discuss the main findings and the connection between the two types of research the conclusions of this article are provided in section 7 2 methodology 2 1 framework of the survey according to the objectives cooperative control of ships can be divided into three types chen et al 2020a cooperative collision avoidance aims at finding collision free trajectories for ships through communication or predefined protocols formation control aims at steering a convoy of ships to form a specific geometric configuration cooperative manipulation aims at coordinating a convoy of ships to perform specific tasks the ship maneuvering motion is greatly affected by hydrodynamic forces and moments acting between two ships passing too close to each other in confined waters such as in a harbor or narrow channel two types of effects are the focuses in existing research for hydrodynamic effects ship ship interaction means the lateral force and yaw moment are induced due to the ships are navigating in close quarter confined water effects mean the ship maneuvering is affected by the lateral and vertical limits of the navigation area vantorre et al 2003 which contain two aspects bank effects and shallow water effects hydrodynamic effects arise with the change of distance velocity dimensions of the involved ships or bank shape therefore the framework of this survey is presented in fig 1 firstly bibliometrics about existing research on cooperative motion control of multiple mass are provided to show the research trend including cooperative collision avoidance formation control and cooperative manipulation the research for hydrodynamic effects is also reviewed secondly the research for cooperative motion control is connected to hydrodynamic research by parameters related to hydrodynamic interactions in the cooperative scenarios such as distance between the ships and objects velocities and dimensions of the involving ships thirdly the hydrodynamic interactions that should be considered in each cooperative scenario are identified then existing methods to predict related hydrodynamic interactions are provided in this way the research on cooperative motion control of multi mass and hydrodynamic effects are connected 2 2 literature search in the existing literature studies on cooperative motion control and hydrodynamic effects are separated therefore in this research two parts of the literature are collected the literature search method and process are as follows 1 the first step is to collect extensive literature in web of science published during 2010 2020 limiting the language to english and research domain to engineering a research on cooperative motion control of mass studies with the following keywords in title keywords and abstract mass or asv or unmanned surface vessel or unmanned surface vehicle or autonomous surface vessel or autonomous vehicle and format or cooperate or coordinate or communicate or flock or platoon or manipulate or target tracking or group or multi research with keywords that indicate that it is out of our scope is excluded such as underwater rov uuv auv aircraft drone car and truck b research on hydrodynamic effects studies with the following keywords in title keywords and abstract hydrodynamic interact or ship ship interact or ship to ship interact or interact effect between ships or ship ship hydrodynamic interact or hydrodynamic interference or bank effect or riverside effect or restrict waterway or restrict water or restrict channel or confined water or wall effect or ship bank distance or ship bank interaction or vessel bank distance 2 the second step is to check the literature and remove the research that is out of this survey s scope 3 the third step is to add the papers which are the source of certain research or are cited in the selected papers but not included in the database through literature collection and filtering a total of 121 articles 61 for cooperative motion control and 60 for hydrodynamic effects are closely consistent with the research scope the following review is based on this literature database 3 bibliometric analysis in this chapter bibliometric analysis is used to show the timeline and source distribution of 121 articles collected in the previous section 3 1 global analysis fig 2 provides the world cloud of the literature that we collected there are 4 clusters and most of them are strongly connected the red and blue clusters are mainly related to cooperative control while the green and yellow clusters are interrelated to hydrodynamic effects then the correlation analysis is carried out for the keywords of two aspects 3 2 correlation analysis of research on cooperative multiple mass when the keyword mass is taken as the center there are few links between mass and hydrodynamic effects as shown in fig 3 a most of the existing research on mass focuses on the robust controller design to resist uncertain dynamics and external disturbance moreover the main objects are to improve the safety of navigation to adapt to the real marine environment and to avoid collision with static or dynamic obstacles thus the design of a closed loop system not only needs to improve the accuracy and stability of the algorithm but also needs to consider the rules and regulations such as colregs the international regulations for preventing collisions at seas while the keyword formation is taken as the center fig 3b the keywords related to the control of the mass show in fig 3a are also there such as collision avoidance external disturbance and uncertainty however rules and seamanship are not mentioned there are more links between the center and keywords related to hydrodynamic effects in fig 3b than in fig 3a with the help of cfd computational fluid dynamics zhang et al 2017 2019 a b and experimental methods panda et al 2021 the changes of resistance to the velocity are studied and whether the interaction effects will cause the collision or grounding is analyzed in fig 3c ship resistance is closely linked to energy management however few researchers have studied the relations between formation and interaction effects for energy management liang et al 2017 rattanasiri et al 2015 hydrodynamic effects have been considered in the literature for auv formation control thus in fig 3d auv is taken as the center robustness external disturbance and the mathematical maneuvering model are also essential when designing the controllers for auvs when planning the path the factors such as collision avoidance total resistance and trajectory smoothness are considered besides when an auv operating in confined water or when the formation members are close to each other the interaction effects with flow field of the auvs would affect the forces motion with various distances sizes and velocities these interaction forces can be calculated quantitatively by experimental techniques or cfd simulations 3 2 1 correlation analysis of hydrodynamic effects as shown in fig 4 a in the studies for the ship ship interaction bank effects and shallow water effects are also considered the main reason is that the confined water effects amplify the interaction effects and vice versa fig 4b velocity encounter situation relative distance and ship size are the key factors therefore the potential flow double body which ignores the free surface effect and the fixed model tests can be used to accurately predict the changes of ship resistance and motion under different conditions in fig 4b the influencing factors and research methods of confined water effects are consistent with the ship ship interaction these two kinds of hydrodynamic effects may cause uncontrollable forces and moment acting on the ship and make the ship s trajectory deviate from the original course increasing the difficulty of maneuvering and the risk of collision and grounding when ships are sailing in channels canals or harbor areas the bank shapes are arbitrarily lataire et al 2017 within the existing publications bank shapes include vertical slope mound submerged wedge shaped and semi circle but the most common bank shapes are vertical and slope see fig 4c different degrees of freedom dof of ships are considered in the research see fig 4d the ship ship interaction and bank effects acting on the ship hull result in horizontal motions of the ships i e surge sway and yaw the shallow water effects force the ships to squat combination sinkage and trim thus the vertical motion of the ship hull such as heave and pitch are considered in some comprehensive scenarios the rolling of the hull has also been taken into consideration 3 3 timeline distribution of publications fig 5 is the timeline distribution of keywords reflecting the popularity importance and development trend of scientific research formation control of ships started at the very beginning researchers have realized the non linear and underactuated characteristics of ships they aimed to design controllers for collision avoidance path planning trajectory tracking and other multi mass cooperation issues in different encounter situations with the deepening of the research the colregs good seamanship external disturbance and uncertainties become hotspots li et al 2021 moreover energy management started to receive attention regarding hydrodynamic effects the research methods of predicting the hydrodynamic effects in confined water have undergone a series of development beginning based on slender body theory then potential flow is proposed in some cases the classical potential flow method cannot meet the engineering requirements thus researchers improve and develop the potential flow i e high order panel method and boundary value problem bvp or adopt the viscous flow method the research object has been expanded and developed from the same ships in the open sea to different scaled ships in different conditions such as moored and the passing ship tugboat and the assisted ship auvs and the host ship in confined channels in a word the research scenes become more complex and closer to reality 3 4 source distribution of publications a minimum threshold of 2 articles per journal is set fourteen journals meet the requirement see fig 6 journals in the red block are those where the research for hydrodynamic effects published where the blue block includes the journals where studies for cooperative control published the overlap is ocean engineering since it has a wide range of topics including hydrodynamics experimental approaches automatic control of marine systems etc overall the journal s impact factor of cooperative multiple mass is higher than that of hydrodynamic effects explaining why most papers on ship control systems designing were published in control related journals rather than marine or navigation related journals 3 5 discussion of global analysis to conclude through the global analysis of 121 articles collected in the previous section it can be found that cooperative multiple mass and hydrodynamic effects have some connection to a certain extent taking hydrodynamic effects into account ensures the maneuverability of the ship and has a connection with energy management however few existing studies combine cooperative control of mass and hydrodynamic effects at the same time 4 cooperative motion control of multiple mass this section reviews the existing research for the three types of cooperative control cooperative collision avoidance formation control and cooperative manipulation parameters related to hydrodynamic interactions in the cooperative scenarios are collected to find out the hydrodynamic effects that should be considered such as distance between the ships and objects velocities and dimensions of the ships 4 1 cooperative collision avoidance two main types of methods for cooperative collision avoidance are found in existing research 1 assumption based e g potential field daily and bevly 2008 2 rule based he et al 2017 the assumption based method predicts other ships actions either by assuming that others sail with constant speed and heading lazarowska 2017 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 or according to holonomic or kinematic models candeloro et al 2017 the rule based uses pre defined rules as the protocol to realize cooperation among controllers ships could coordinate their behavior through rule compliant decision making colregs are the most frequently used protocol other predefined protocols that define the actions that ships should take under certain encountering situations could also be used such as the half half rule in reciprocal velocity obstacle method huang et al 2018 2019 in accordance with colregs encountering situations can be divided into head on overtaking and crossing tam and bucknall 2013 table 1 shows that most studies focus on the crossing situation the reason is that crossing is the most common situation in shipping and sailing and it is widely defined in colregs however in the head on and overtaking situations given the high relative speed between ships and little time for ships to take appropriate actions the collision risk is high besides ships sail in parallel in such situations if the ship to ship distance is small the hydrodynamic interaction forces arise and they have strong influences on the maneuverability of the ships 4 3 formation control due to the improved degree of autonomy and personnel risk minimization by reducing human operator interaction unmanned ships are being used in several specialist fields liu and bucknall 2018 ranging from military operations such as search and rescue to civil fields such as resource exploration hydrography the formation control of multiple mass has become a hotspot and enormous related studies have been carried out in recent decades in formation control control strategies are designed to achieve the goal that each independent mass accurately meets the desired requirements in course speed and relative attitude mu et al 2020 the formation shapes of a convoy can be divided into two types amorphous and morphous the former implies that the ships are without specified desired formations i e each member is independent rather than treating the entire ships as one fixed structure qin et al 2017 the swarm is a representative phenomenon on the contrary morphous signifies the ships formation type is predefined and the involved ships need to cooperate to maintain the desired formation shapes an overview of publications for formation control of ships is presented in table 2 formations usually contain 3 7 ships among which a 3 ship formation is the most common the formation shape can be a queue a line a triangle a square or a trapezium the most common formation shape is a triangle with one leading ship and two following ships or 3 5 ships in a train formation these two formation shapes are inspired by a wild goose or duck swarm and such bionic experiences the formation tracking starts with a straight path develops into a curve or a circular path which suits the complex reality rather than focusing on the formation control algorithms our paper pays attention to the hydrodynamic interaction problems which are closely related to the dimension and the distance in the sway and surge direction with other ships static or dynamic obstacles thus the ratio of ship length to minimum distance is the most important factor in peng et al 2016 and wang and peng 2014 the minimum distance between ships is less than the ship s length the ship to ship interaction effects at this small distance arises but the influences of hydrodynamic forces on the ships are ignored in those papers what s more in qin et al 2017 tiang and mahyuddin 2016 wang et al 2017 the mass was treated as a particle and the ship length was neglected these simplifications are inappropriate for further studies in the perspective of the robustness of the control systems besides when the mass execute maritime searches and rescue missions the space between the mass and channel are usually close and the water depth could be shallow owing to the asymmetric flow around the ship hull forces and moments acting on the hull especially lateral forces and yaw moments and ship trimming to stern phenomenon are much more complicated than that in open and deep waters besides with smaller separation distances and higher speeds near the waterway the ship s trajectory deviates from the original course and the bow is exclusive with a large yaw angle the influence would significantly increase the difficulty of maneuvering to conclude two main hydrodynamic characteristics of ships in convoy need to be considered ship to ship interaction and the confined water effects on the independent hull or the convoy firstly in a convoy the distance between the ships could be very close the involved ships may sail in each other s wake areas which turns out to cause a change of flow characteristics and the hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull thus the mass can utilize the sailing wake from the group members to reduce total resistance and achieve energy consumption hence the distance between the vehicles and the arrangement of formation have apparent influences on the multi mass s total resistance secondly in confined waterways such as shallow water the mass convoy may have difficulties following its intended course and the possibility of grounding and collision increases therefore in light of robust maneuvering and navigation safety it is evident and essential to take ship ship ship bank and shallow water effects into account when modeling the mathematical models of the ships in the controlling algorithms moreover optimizing the convoy configurations in formation control which would in turn improve the propulsion efficiency and provide energy benefits for the sailing system to some extent chen et al 2019a b c d 2020b 4 3 cooperative manipulation according to the application scenarios cooperative manipulation can be divided into cooperative object transport caging and self assembly an overview of related publications is given in table 3 cooperative object transport regards a swarm of mass as tugboats to cooperatively move a large floating object e g disable ships baris et al 2016 esposito et al 2008 and large offshore structures feemster et al 2004 on the water according to the size of different objects the number of mass can be flexibly changed as shown in table 3 the mass are homogeneous while the object is much larger than the mass from the point of mechanics the tugboats are attached to the barge based on newton s third law the force acting on the tugboats and the object is the same due to the large scale difference tugboats are more sensitive to force changes it is necessary to consider the scale ratio between the tugboats and floating objects to ensure the accomplishment of a mission caging indicates the application that two ships are connected by a rope arrichiello et al 2012 bhattacharya et al 2011 or a boom giron sierra et al 2014 to trap and transport something caging systems are usually used to collect liquid on the water such as spilling oil in bhattacharya et al 2011 giron sierra et al 2014 pereda et al 2011 a caging system consisted of two ships is proposed for oil skimming and cleanings in arrichiello et al 2012 two ships are connected with a flexible floating rope they coordinate to capture a floating target from a given location and transport it to a designated position self assembly means a large team of autonomous robotic boats into floating platforms for humanitarian aid to hurricane stricken islands ad hoc landing strips encircling oil spills or refueling depots in the middle of the ocean o hara et al 2014 in these situations many small self propelled mass units join together to create floating bridges or islands for example in paulos et al 2015 an island formed of six modules and a bridge of 33 modules that span one corner of the pool is constructed simulations and model tests are the main methods to study the cooperative manipulation of mass in most research mass cooperates toward a predefined goal while anti collision with other ships or obstacles is not considered in some cases the space between the units is small even less than half of the ship length and the wake interaction is neglected these assumptions are inappropriate for practical usage to conclude for cooperative manipulation there are usually physical connections between the participants such as towlines ropes or booms problems related to cooperative object transport caging and self assembly have been investigated however avoiding collision with other ships or static and dynamic obstacles is rarely considered meanwhile unlike with cooperative collision avoidance and formation control involving homogeneous ships the ship s dimensions in the cooperative object transports i e tugboats and barge are pretty different also the distances between the ships are small might be less than half of the ship s length or zero under these circumstances the hydrodynamic interaction effects produce stronger negative influences on the smaller ones motion than the larger ones however little research focuses on this phenomenon for the cooperative manipulation of the mass 4 4 summary of potential hydrodynamic effects in cooperative mass scenarios the hydrodynamic effects between two ships approach zero when the longitudinal distance between the ships larger than twice the ship length vantorre et al 2002 therefore we collect the relative position and distances in the cooperative scenarios within this range see fig 7 the main findings are as follows 1 in cooperative collision avoidance cases encountering situations include head on overtaking and crossing in the head on and overtaking scenes especially in overtaking the distance between ships would be less than twice the ship length and most studies set the involved objects to the same scale 2 in formation scenarios formation shapes include triangle in line queue rectangle and trapezoid the most common formation shape is a triangle with one leading ship and two following ships in this case the relative transverse and longitudinal distances between ships are usually less than twice the ship length when the formation shape is in line the lateral distance between ships is even less than the ship length in formation scenarios the members are mostly homogeneous the scale ratio of participating ships is 1 3 in cooperative manipulation cases the ships are usually linked by towlines ropes or booms and stay very close to each other in some scenarios the ships are attached to each other at different positions and angles where the ship ship interaction effects are strong and cannot be ignored moreover the hydrodynamic force has greater influences on the motion of the smaller ones than that of the larger ones in summary in the cooperative scenarios the distances between ships are close thus the ship ship interaction effects cannot be ignored however little research focuses on this phenomenon for the cooperative manipulation of the mass besides most existing research focuses on open water where the closest distance between the ships are large however when the ships are sailing in the inland rivers or ports where the traffic is dense the distances between ships are within the range that the ship ship interaction effects are strong moreover in locks or ports where the ship bank distances and ukc under keel clearance are small shallow water effects cannot be ignored besides the space between ships the velocity the dimension ratio of ships and the shapes of the bank are also essential factors that need to be taken into account 5 hydrodynamic effects maneuvering characteristics of the mass are affected by hydrodynamic interaction thus it is necessary to study the hydrodynamic effects on motion control of cooperative multiple mass in this section research objects and methods of hydrodynamic effects that may relate to the cooperative scenarios are introduced 5 1 research objects 5 1 1 ship ship interactions when the ship is navigating near another they are close at transverse sp and longitudinal directions i e distances between o1 o2 along the x axis where o i is located at the midship of the ship x i pointing to the bow y i pointing to starboard the decrease of the local cross section of the flow results in the increase of flow velocity and the reduction of pressure liu et al 2020 producing the lateral force and the turning moment see fig 8 this is the so called ship ship hydrodynamic interaction at present the ship ship hydrodynamic interaction effects are mainly for an individual conventional manned ship and the auv convoy x wang et al 2019 for mass especially for the cooperative multi mass meeting special tasks as a convoy the research on ship ship interaction effects has a non negligible influence on its maneuverability in this case the wake making of the frontal ship has an impact on other ships the wake making of ships is a form of energy which may have favorable or unfavorable interference to the ships around under different position layouts the minimum and maximum value on the resistance and motion curve may appear in an individual or the whole mass convoy with the favorable wake making interference the resistance can be reduced and the navigation efficiency can be improved haseltalab and negenborn 2019 hydrodynamic interaction under different situations have been analyzed including ships in the process of head on encountering and overtaking the interference of passing ships on mooring ships chen et al 2019a b c d koop 2020 lee 2015 setiawan and muin 2018 yuan et al 2019 and two ships moving parallel during replenishment or lightering operations gierusz and waszkiel 2012 lataire et al 2012a b rattanasiri et al 2015 setiawan and muin 2018 zhang et al 2019 a b in the head on and overtaking situation the evolution of lateral force is characterized as repulsion attraction repulsion meanwhile the yaw moment is diverse in different encounter situations in the head on situation the evolution of the yaw moment is bow repulsion bow attraction bow repulsion bow attraction xu et al 2017 in the overtaking situation there are only two phases i e bow repulsion bow attraction xu et al 2019 when the ships are abeam of one another the bow of one ship turns away from the bow of the other causing their respective sterns to swing toward each other thus overtaking is regarded as the most dangerous situation yuan et al 2015 and more than half of the collected papers focused on this situation see fig 9 with the decrease of water depth or lateral distances between ships or the increase of speed the magnitudes of the lateral force and yaw moment will increase when a ship passes by a moored ship hydrodynamic interactions will result in unexpected movements of the moored ship a good understanding of this phenomenon benefits the design of the mooring system moreover when the ships are sailing side by side during replenishment or lightering operations the two ships in close proximity at the same direction and speed and the hydrodynamic interfere continuously which would produce a persistent effect on the automatic navigation control mode thus it is essential to consider ship ship hydrodynamic interaction effects in different situations in accordance with newton s law the ships experience even forces and moments however ships always differ in their scales thus the smaller ones are much more difficult to stay in their original motion state that is to say the effect on the smaller ship is more distinct than that on the larger one maritime and coastguard agency 2002 therefore when studying the ship ship interaction effects on the multi mass it is necessary to consider the longitudinal and transverse distance between ships and the influence of the scale ratio drafts d depth draft ratio h d where h is the water depth and other variables a large number of results show that the ship ship hydrodynamic interaction effects occur in the range of the longitudinal distance being twice the length of the ship and the transverse distance being 0 5 times the maximum length of the ships but most of the ship ship interaction effects are for the ships with similar scales li et al 2017 5 1 2 confined water effects confined water effects as shown in fig 10 mean that ships are restricted by the bottom and the bank wall in navigation waterways which include shallow water effects bank effects and coupled shallow water bank effects when a ship approaches the bank or near some fixed obstacles such as piers locks and docks or in a narrow channel the asymmetric flow around the ship induced by the vicinity of banks and bottom causing pressure differences between starboard to port sides bow to stern section lataire and delefortrie 2007 panda et al 2021 then the ships would be attracted by the suction effect and this lateral force tends to increase slightly with decreasing h d while when the ukc drops to a very small value the attraction force vanishes to zero and turns into a repulsion force it is confirmed in lataire and vantorre 2008 vantorre et al 2003 that this transition phenomenon is fr and ukc dependent where fr v gl 1 2 v is ship speed g is the acceleration of gravity l is the ship length unlike the lateral force acting on the hull the bow is pushed away by the bank cushion producing the yaw moment which increases dramatically with the decrease of h d when the ship bank distance is smaller and the speed is higher the bank effects more prominent which leads to the ship attracted closer to the bank and the yaw angle getting larger this phenomenon is known as bank effects in the shallow water areas the ukc is smaller than the design value which leads to an additional sinkage and trim besides with the changes of sinkage the wetted surface is altered resulting in a different frictional resistance simultaneously the pressure field of the ship will change causing variations in viscous pressure resistance and wave making resistance zeng et al 2019a b confined water has a noticeable influence on the ship s maneuverability and hydrodynamic forces baric et al 2019 when the ship is sailing nearshore especially during the berthing and unberthing procedures when the ship sails at an extremely low speed the rudder efficiency decreases or even fails under these circumstances external disturbances such as wind wave and current have a more pronounced influence on the ship s motion which request higher robustness of the maneuvering and control systems moreover when a ship s motion changes are large the hydrodynamic force acting on the ship is non linear due to the flow separation and viscous effects this phenomenon aggravates the squat of the ships the so called confined water effects are affected by multiple factors like h d ship bank distance d to breadth b depth froude number fr h ship sailing speed v and type of bank as shown in fig 11 fig 11a shows that most research studies on the confined water effects focus on shallow water h d 1 5 and very shallow water h d 1 2 du et al 2020 in shallow water the dimensionless froude number based on the water depth fr h v gh 1 2 is introduced to indicate the wave making resistance and the generated waves pattern related to both water depth and forward speed in the collected literature when fr h 1 fig 11b the speed is in the subcritical region havelock 1908 when fr h 0 5 the generated waves can be described by the secondary wave pattern which is known as the kelvin wave pattern with an angle of 19 2 8 the wave angle does not change with advancing speed when 0 5 fr h 1 the wave making area becomes larger meanwhile the wave angle rises with the increase of fr h resulting in a lift of resistance when the fr h approaches the critical speed fr h 1 it is evident that the wave making resistance increases significantly zeng et al 2020 and the ship trims to the stern in fig 11c when the bank boundary is limited the restricted horizontal channel reflects the ship waves making the wave pattern more complicated than in open water specifically when 0 25 d b 1 the bank effects are most significant duan et al 2020 interaction effects increase sharply as the lateral distance decreases when d b 3 ship bank interaction usually can be ignored liu et al 2017 a b thus ittc defines the dimensions of the towing tank as follows ittc recommended procedures and guidelines 2011 1 v v 0 67 m l b 3 4 1 1 f r h 2 0 67 m l b 3 4 1 1 v g h 2 where δv is the calculated return flow velocity v is the ship velocity m a x a a x is the maximum transverse section of the model m2 a is the sectional area of the tank m2 for all the fr h 1 fig 11 b δv v 0 which means the bank effects cause the increase of velocity consistent with the bernoulli phenomenon equation 1 shows that as the water depth becomes shallower the ship breadth and speed increase the channel gets narrower the bank effects are more obvious hence the impacts of confined water effects must be well understood to avoid marine accidents like collision and grounding du et al 2018 besides the shapes of the bank result in different effects as shown in fig 11e the vertical and slope banks are the commonest but some scholars study the special types of the bank including mound lee 2013 wedge shaped lee 2012 semi circle lee et al 2015 and submerged kim and ng 2017 maimun et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 due to the distinctiveness of the research circumstances the speed of the ship is mainly moderate 0 1 fr 0 2 and slow fr 0 1 see fig 11d 5 1 3 advancing speed effect ship speed is an essential factor in studying hydrodynamic interaction between ships and in confined waters which would aggravate ship ship hydrodynamic interaction effects ship bank effects and shallow water effects according to the bernoulli equation the pressure p at any point on the hull can be calculated as follows 2 p ρ φ t v φ 1 2 φ φ where ρ is the fluid density φ t x y z is the perturbation potential v is the velocity vector of the ship and v i is the horizontal velocity of the ith ship the hydrodynamic forces and moment acting on the ship are as following 3 x i s i p n 1 i τ n 1 i d s 4 y i s i p n 2 i d s 5 n i s i p x n 2 i y n 1 i d s where x i y i n i are the forces and moment along the three axes i is the ship number i 1 2 n i n 1 i n 2 i n 3 i is the outer normal vector of the ship τ is the tangential force s is the wetted surface of the ship to analyze the ship forces and motions in confined water areas a mathematical model is established through a series of experiments which can quantitatively analyze changes of the longitudinal force the sway force and the yaw moment under all realistic bank geometries and water depths the formulations are as follow 6 x 1 2 ρ v 2 l d ξ x 1 ξ x 2 f r 2 m e q 2 1 ξ x 3 t p 7 y 1 2 ρ v e f f y 2 l d 1 d 2 b ξ y 1 f r v t ξ y 2 d h e f f d ξ y 3 f r v t ξ y 4 8 n 1 2 ρ v e f f n 2 l 2 d 1 d 2 b d h e f f d ξ n 1 ξ n 2 f r e f f n ξ n 3 f r e f f n 2 where v is the longitudinal speed along the x axis ξ n is the coefficient of the mathematical model m eq is equivalent blockage parameter t p is the thrust of the propeller d2b is the dimensionless distance to the bank fr vt is the froude number calculated according to the speed in propeller wake h eff is the effective water depth taking squat into account v effy is the y axial speed in the flow field induced by the propeller v effn is the z axial speed in the flow field induced by the propeller fr effn is the froude number calculated according to the z axial speed in the flow field induced by the propeller among these parameters m eq and d2b are related to fr h details about parameter setting can be found in lataire and vantorre 2008 thus fr h can be used as a criterion when the distance between the ship and the closest bank y infl is larger than b 5fr h 5 the bank effects can be ignored because the forces and moment are proportional to the square of the ship velocity the influence of velocity on the forces and moment is more significant than other factors thus the advancing speed effect is of great importance for the cooperative control of mass and should be well understood besides the advancing speed of a ship is a significant factor when choosing cfd methods from the view of the resistance component total resistance includes frictional resistance viscous pressure resistance and wave making resistance the proportion of these resistance components vary with a change of speed at low speed fr 0 2 the frictional resistance makes up 70 80 of total resistance the viscous pressure resistance accounts for 10 and the wave making resistance is small enough to be ignored birk 2019 zeng et al 2019a b at this condition the free surface can be regarded as a rigid wall and a double body method can be used in simulating the hydrodynamic effects of ships many pieces of literature show that the double body method can still obtain relatively accurate results at a low speed duan et al 2020 zou and larsson 2013 for high speed ships the frictional resistance accounts for about 50 and the viscous pressure resistance only 5 and the proportion of wave making resistance increases to 40 50 of total resistance in this situation the free surface effects must be considered for improving computational efficiency and obtaining satisfactory predictions the potential flow method is usually adopted 5 2 research methods three main methodologies are utilized to explore the hydrodynamic effects shown in fig 12 theoretical method experimental method and numerical simulation method results of theoretical studies within the framework of the slender body assumption are universal raven 2019a setiawan and muin 2018 sulistyawati et al 2019 various factors affecting the hydrodynamic effects of the ship are also clearly visible however research objects are simplified for the primary purpose which means this method is not available for solving actual problems experimental methods are divided into full scale tests paulauskas et al 2020 and ship model tests lataire et al 2012a b lataire and vantorre 2017 lee 2013 liu et al 2017 a b mucha et al 2018 zeng et al 2018a b the cost of the former method is high while the latter is influenced by the scale effect the numerical simulation is cost effective and shortens the research periods it has been widely used to replace some time consuming and difficult to operate experiments huang et al 2020 the numerical methods for predicting the hydrodynamic interaction between ships and confined water include potential flow bari and matveev 2016 kadri and weihs 2015 ren et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 and viscous flow the potential flow method assumes that the fluid is nonviscous and irrotational yuan 2019 the process of solving hydrodynamic forces is transformed into satisfying the laplace equation in the fluid domain and the initial boundary value problem is usually solved by the green function in the 1960s and 1970s the panel method and rankine panel method zhou et al 2015 were proposed then the high order panel method xu et al 2017 2019 was proposed to improve the defects of the constant panel method cpm compared to the potential flow method the viscous flow method simulates the flow on the water surface the flow is generally set as turbulent flow and the viscous incompressible navier stokes n s equation is applied to solve such flow phenomena besides the direct numerical simulation dns is proposed to replace the original flow with the mean flow field at present two averaging methods are used to study the viscous flow problem one is the large eddy simulation les with spatial average and the other is the reynolds average navier stokes rans for the system average the dns directly solves the n s equation and calculates the evolution of all variables in three dimensional space theoretically the dns can obtain all the information of turbulent flow without any turbulence model thus it is an accurate method to simulate turbulence however from the perspective of the spatial domain it is necessary to take a very small scale mesh to capture the vortices to ensure accuracy while for the sake of stability of the simulation process it is necessary to set up a very small time step to distinguish the detailed spatial structure and time characteristics of the turbulence in the time domain considering the current computers computational efficiency and memory capacity the dns is only adopted to solve turbulent problems with medium or lower reynolds number or cases with simple geometric structures however to analyze the hydrodynamic interactions among cooperative mass the amount of grid would be enormous it may not be appropriate to utilize the dns method to study the ship ship and ship bank interaction effects the les is a turbulence simulation method between rans and dns the principle of which is all variables of the flow could be filtered into large scale and small scale large scale quantities that are greatly affected by boundary conditions are directly calculated by solving differential equations in contrast the small scale quantities are obtained by establishing the subgrid scale turbulent model compared with dns the les method reduces the computation workload and is suitable to solve cases with higher reynolds number and more complex geometry structure when the turbulent model is appropriate les is more precise than rans though this method is developing some unexpected obstacles exist for example les asks for a better computing capacity and lacks accuracy on the boundary layer of small scale flows therefore the les method is not yet widely used as a practical tool for engineering conditions the rans equation is based on the statistical theory and regards the turbulence as the superposition of time averaged flow and instantaneous impulse flow thus compared with dns and les there are some deviations in the calculation results of rans therefore some researchers advised using detached eddy simulation des to simulate the turbulence whose basic idea is combining les with s a turbulence model les is used to simulate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the ship in the region where large eddy transport is the main feature rans is used in the region where dissipation is the main feature in conclusion theoretically dns and les are more accurate than rans however they are limited by the computing performance and the model complexity furthermore little research is carried with des because the accuracy of that cannot be verified hence it is evident that solving the rans equation is the first choice to study the ship ship and confined water hydrodynamic interaction effects on motion control of cooperative multiple mass at present the rans equation can be solved by open usage and commercial cfd code as shown in table 5 compared with commercial software open usage has higher requirements for programming while the commercial software is easy to operate and the accuracy is guaranteed therefore much research utilizes the existing commercial software to study the hydrodynamic performance of the ship when adopting the rans equation to work on turbulence flow the reynolds stress term is added leading the reynolds equations not closed thus the turbulence model is introduced and the relationship between the additional stress caused by turbulence impulse and the time average strain rate is established in this way the reynolds equations can be closed and solved with the finite volume method fvm the main turbulence models are eddy viscosity models and reynolds stress models most research on the ship s hydrodynamic effects used two equation based turbulence model including sst k ω realizable k ω and rng k ω panda et al 2021 see table 6 6 discussion hydrodynamic performances of ships are seriously affected by ship ship distance ship bank distance and water depth which are known as ship ship interaction and confined water effect in cooperative scenarios ships are usually close to each other where hydrodynamic effects significantly impact ship motions taking relative distance as an example in cooperative collision avoidance the extreme ship ship longitudinal distance could be less than one ship length for formation control the relative distance lies in a range from less than one ship length to longer than two times of ship length in both longitudinal and transverse directions due to the specificity of sailing missions relative distances in cooperative manipulation are usually less than half of ship length requiring a physical contact of objectives on the other hand when the longitudinal distance of ship is less than two times of the ship length and transverse distance of ship ship or ship bank is less than 0 5 times of the ship length strong ship ship or ship bank interaction could be observed when the depth to draft ratio is less than 1 5 significant shallow water effects will arise the influences of ship ship and confined water cause resistance changes and have significant impacts on ship motion in the ship ship interaction the impacts have a bearing on encounter situations during head on and overtaking the lateral force follows the process of repulsion attraction repulsion at the same time the yaw moment is diverse in the head on situation the yaw moment experiences four phases bow repulsion bow attraction bow repulsion bow attraction in the overtaking situation there are two phases bow repulsion bow attraction the tendency in various water depth velocity ship ship distance is similar but the magnitudes are affected in the confined water the hull experiences bank suction bank repulsion bow out sinkage and trim those phenomena are related to ship bank distance water depth velocity and shape of bank these effects are usually unfavorable to the hydrodynamic performance of ships which may lead to unexpected collision and grounding furthermore in busy inland waterways it is foreseeable that the hydrodynamic effects are stronger than those in open water thus it is much more challenging to achieve cooperative control of mass as there are much more numbers of sailing and berthing ships much narrower channels and smaller ship ship distances much shallower water depths moreover types of ships influence the effects predicting the wave patterns of homogeneous ships is possible however for heterogeneous ships the wake patterns are hard to predict so as the ship motions besides the sizes of ships also increase the difficulty of controlling the motions of the ships for instance when tugboats assist a ship to a specified quay tugboats are usually connected to the bow midship and stern because of the huge difference in ship sizes the hydrodynamic performance and motions of the tugboats are significantly influence regardless of the low speed of the large ship however we could also make use of the hydrodynamic effects if the effects can be accurately predicted a reasonable formation could minimize the forces and moment reduce the harmful ship motions save energy both for the individuals and the entire convoy like theoretical and experimental methods traditional methods have some deficiencies such as oversimplified research objects and high economic costs cfd method is getting admitted for its convenience economic and foundation of mathematics cfd methods such as potential flow methods viscous flow methods are mostly adopted to predict the hydrodynamic performances of ships the former method focuses on the wave making resistance of research objects by ignoring the viscosity of the fluid the simulation process is time saving and the results are relatively accurate at high speed of ships fr 0 2 for the wave making resistance component takes up more than 50 of total resistance for the latter method the viscous flow method the numerical solving process is relatively time consuming however the results are more accurate and more details of the changes of ship pressure ship resistance flow field could be obtained besides when the fr 0 2 a viscous flow based double body could be adopted to study the resistance and pressure of the objects by ignoring the free surface for the convenience and accuracy when utilizing cfd methods it is significant to determine the needs of simulation as for forces moment and flow field development tendency study at high speed the potential flow method is sufficient as for studies at slow speed the viscous flow based double body method could get accurate results to have an insight into the details of the changes the viscous flow method is a more suitable way at present the research for cooperative motion control of mass and hydrodynamic effects on ships is separated in the literature few studies combine cooperative control of mass and hydrodynamic effects in the study of hydrodynamic effects the forces and moments of the two ships in different scenarios are considered and the interaction between multiple ships is lacking simultaneously most research holds the assumptions to simplify the problem such as the two ships courses are parallel or the ships are parallel to the bank so that the effects of drift can be ignored besides the propeller and rudder also affect the magnitude of hydrodynamic forces and moment at present the research on confined water effects mainly regards the bank as regular shapes and thus the h t is constant however in reality the bank shapes are arbitrary and the h t varies with the bank shapes and seabed it is worth noting that the autonomy degrees of ships in the categories of research according to the imo international maritime organization there are four degrees of autonomy identified of ships ship with automated processes and decision support remotely controlled ship with seafarers on board remotely controlled ship without seafarers on board and fully autonomous ship because the formation control of ships requires precise speed or position tracking ability ships are usually assumed to be fully autonomous in related research on the contrary hydrodynamic analysis of ships is usually for existing manned ships with no or low autonomy levels in summary considering the influence of hydrodynamic effects on cooperative control of mass has great potential in achieving precise control optimizing formation shape reducing resistance and motion improving energy efficiency and navigation safety 7 conclusion this article aims at connecting the research on cooperative control of multi mass and hydrodynamic effects a systematic survey on hydrodynamic effects on cooperative multiple mass is carried out based on 121 publications between 2010 and 2020 bibliometrics about existing research on cooperative motion control of multiple mass including cooperative collision avoidance formation control and cooperative manipulation are provided to show the trend of research as well as the research for hydrodynamic effects then the research for cooperative motion control is connected to hydrodynamic research by parameters related to hydrodynamic interactions in the cooperative scenarios such as distance between the ships and objects velocities and dimensions of the involving ships consequently the hydrodynamic interactions that should be considered in each cooperative scenario are identified moreover existing methods to predict related hydrodynamic interactions are provided however this paper only makes a qualitative analysis of the hydrodynamic interaction on cooperative control of mass we need to quantify hydrodynamic interaction effects in

20447,autonomous underwater vehicle plays a more and more important role in the exploration of marine resources path planning and obstacle avoidance is the core technology to realize the autonomy of auv which will determine the application prospect of auv this paper mainly describes the state of the art methods of path planning and obstacle avoidance for auv and aims to become a starting point for researchers who are initiating their endeavors in this field moreover the objective of this paper is to give a comprehensive overview of work on recent advances and new breakthroughs also to discuss some future directions worthy to research in this area the focus of this article is put on these path planning algorithms that deal with constraints and characteristics of auv and the influence of marine environments since most of the time auv will operate in the environments full of obstacles we divide path planning methods of auv into two categories global path planning with known static obstacles and local path planning with unknown and dynamic obstacles we describe the basic principles of each method and survey most related work to them an in depth discussion and comparisons between different path planning algorithms are also provided lastly we propose some potential future research directions that are worthy to investigate in this field keywords autonomous underwater vehicle path planning obstacle avoidance dynamic obstacles 1 introduction with recent advances in technology autonomous underwater vehicle auv is becoming more and more important in the exploration and exploitation of ocean resources auv can complete a variety of subsea tasks in civil and military fields such as ocean pollutant monitoring ramos et al 2001 mine hunting hagen et al 2003 marine biology exploration sagala and bambang 2011 pipeline following and inspection liu et al 2018 and anti submarine warfare etc the autonomy of auv is essential for it to operate in complex environments which has attracted wide attentions of researchers from all over the world in recent years higher requirements are put forward for the autonomy of auv to meet the future development of the ocean the path planning and obstacle avoidance is the core technology to realize the autonomy of auv and will determine the application prospect of auv the path planning of auv is considered as a series of translations and forward angle changes from the starting position to the destination according to certain optimization standards zeng et al 2016 when planning a path most of the time auv will operate in the environments full of obstacles there are many cases when the location and contour of static obstacles can be measured or obtained beforehand in these cases there is usually a global map about everything including obstacles before planning a path auv can use this information to find a collision free path between the starting point and the target point in advance with global path planning methods these global path planning methods can also be used in the barrier free environments while taking the path length energy consumption and current into account instead of obstacle avoidance in dynamic and uncertain underwater environments it is difficult or even impossible to obtain the information of various obstacles before path planning in this case there is usually planned path from a global path planner and auv still needs a local path planner to avoid these unknown and dynamic obstacles such as ships reefs and moving animals or fish etc therefore in this paper we divide the path planning methods of auv into two categories global path planning with known static obstacles and local path planning with unknown and dynamic obstacles as shown in fig 1 for global path planning of auv with known static obstacles researchers have proposed many commonly used methods such as a algorithm dechter and pearl 1985 genetic algorithm cobb and grefenstette 1993 particle swarm optimization eberhart and kennedy 1995 differential evolution storn and price 1997 and ant colony optimization dorigo et al 1991 with the increasing complexity and uncertainty of the environments the requirements for auv path planning are also becoming higher cai et al 2020 mac et al 2016 in this case the obstacles encountered by auv might be unknown and even dynamic taking dynamic constraints into account the rapidly exploring random trees algorithm is a suitable method proposed for local path planning in high dimensional unknown environments tan et al 2004 in addition the artificial potential field method khatib 1986 and fuzzy logic algorithm cordón et al 1996 can use airborne sensors to sense the surrounding environmental information in real time and deal with unknown static or dynamic obstacles in recent years based on the development in deep neural network some self learning methods like neural network hansen and salamon 1990 and reinforcement learning sutton and barto 1998 were introduced into the local path planning of auv deep reinforcement learning mnih et al 2015 a combination of deep neural network and reinforcement learning has also been proposed and applied in auv local path planning these self learning methods does not require any priori knowledge of the environments and can deal with the problem of real time dynamic path planning in addition their planning time can be greatly reduced after training because of recent advances in technology and new breakthroughs in the field of path planning for auv it is necessary to make a comprehensive survey on it though several surveys already exist zeng et al 2015 li et al 2018 a most recent survey by okereke et al 2020 only focused on machine learning path planning methods for auv in terms of underwater internet of things uiot the objective of this survey is to give an overview of work on path planning for auv and technical details of some representative algorithms and also to discuss some open problems to be solved in this area the focus of this article is put on these path planning algorithms that deal with constraints and characteristics of auv and the influence of marine environments it also provides an in depth discussion and comparison between different path planning algorithms the rest of this article starts with an introduction of the kinematic and dynamic model of auv in section 2 and an analysis of challenges and differences of path planning for auv compared to other mobile robots is also provided section 3 surveys and discusses global path planning algorithms in environments with known static obstacles section 4 describes and discusses local path planning methods with unknown and dynamic obstacles in section 5 we propose some potential future research directions that are worthy to investigate in this field finally section 6 concludes 2 modeling and analysis of auv in this section the kinematic and dynamic models of auv control are introduced which put many constraints and steering characteristics on auv this makes it challenging to implement path planning methods on auv and different from other robot platforms on land or in the air the models are based on fosson s comprehensive work fossen 2011 including general two dimensional and three dimensional kinematics transformation and in depth derivation of dynamics motion equations 2 1 kinematics kinematics is based on the geometric method to study the motion of vehicles without considering the influence of force and mass to describe the kinematic characteristics of auv we will apply the inertial north east down ned reference frame and the body frame fig 2 describes auv as a six degree of freedom dof vehicle with two rotational and translational velocity components in each dimension fossen 2011 as shown in fig 2 the body frame is attached to the vehicle and has its axes forward surge to starboard sway and towards the keel heave wiig 2019 the translation velocities along the x y and z directions are expressed as u v and w respectively and the rotation velocities are expressed as p q and r respectively the rotation angles of each axis are expressed as ϕ θ and ψ respectively and k m and n represent the moment in x y and z direction respectively vibhute 2018 the rotation matrix of 6 dof auv is composed of the basic rotation matrix of x y and z axes in the geometric analysis the basic rotation matrix of x y and z axes are 1 r x ϕ 1 0 0 0 c o s ϕ s i n ϕ 0 s i n ϕ c o s ϕ 2 r y θ c o s θ 0 s i n θ 0 1 0 s i n θ 0 c o s θ 3 r z ψ c o s ψ s i n ψ 0 s i n ψ c o s ψ 0 0 0 1 combining these principal rotations gives the rotation matrix r as 4 r r z ψ r y θ r x ϕ the relationship between the orientation and angular velocity is 5 j 1 s i n ϕ t a n θ c o s ϕ t a n θ 0 c o s ϕ s i n ϕ 0 s i n ϕ c o s θ c o s ϕ c o s θ hence the auv kinematics in 6 dof are 6 η r 0 3 3 h e l l o c h e c k t h e c o m m a n d 3 3 j ν in the formula the generalized velocity vector and position vector are respectively represented by the following matrix 7 η x y z ϕ θ ψ t 2 2 dynamics referring to the fossen 2011 maneuvering model the nonlinear equation of the dynamic motion for auv has the following general form 8 m ν c ν ν d ν g η b f where m denotes the inertia matrix c contains coriolis and centripetal terms and d indicates the hydrodynamic damping matrix vector g denotes a combination of gravity and buoyancy vector f is the control input variable of auv which is transformed into the force and moment of control motion by matrix b the control input vector is 9 f t u t q t r t where t u is the thrust force produced by rotating the propeller t q is the vertical motion control force generated by the left and right rudders t r is the horizontal motion control force generated by the upper and lower rudders assuming that the center of gravity x g y g z g and buoyancy of auv are rigid bodies at one point the 6 dof translational and rotational motions will be expressed as follows m u v r w q x g q 2 r 2 y g p q r z g p r q x t o t a l m v w p u r y g r 2 p 2 z g q r p x g q p r y t o t a l m w u q v p z g p 2 q

axial or transverse direction and x t o t a l y t o t a l z t o t a l and k t o t a l m t o t a l n t o t a l are the total external forces on each degree of freedom the above modeling of auv put some unique constraints in its motion control with path planning methods which makes it different from other mobile robots on the one hand as a highly nonlinear system auv is affected by the change of mass center buoyancy center and hydrodynamic coefficient xiang et al 2014 on the other hand auv has underactuated characteristics and parts of its speed cannot be directly controlled but can only be generated when the propeller and rudder angle are manipulated for example when auv rotates part of the forward speed will be converted into swing speed and the heave motion is controlled in a similar way in addition the collected sensory data will affect the performance of path planning methods for auv general mobile robots use the electromagnetic wave generated by laser sensor to navigate and avoid obstacles ye and borenstein 2002 and some of them use the camera biswas and veloso 2012 to obtain images directly to judge the position of obstacles however because auv works in the marine environment and it detects the surrounding obstacles according to the ultrasonic wave generated by sonar sensor kimball and rock 2008 data collected with sonar sensors will be interfered by underwater sound waves which will result in inaccurate information and low quality data received and largely affect the accuracy of obstacle avoidance for auv in addition auv path planning also needs to consider the influence of ocean currents moreover underwater tasks performed by auvs usually need to follow some specific path patterns for example when auv completes some unknown search and detection missions there is usually an algorithm to generate a coverage path in the task editor which requires auv to bypass unforeseen obstacles when executing this path mode bagnitckii et al 2017 in some situation multi auv also needs to follow a certain formation mode to improve the efficiency of the mission ding et al 2014 although these make it more challenging to implement general path planning methods for auv compared to other mobile robots many researchers have proposed effective path planning methods to overcome these challenges in sections 3 and 4 we will review most popular path planning methods for auv in terms of global path planning with known static obstacles and local path planning with unknown and dynamic obstacles 3 global path planning with known static obstacles in the environments of large pollution free area there are no obstacles in the workspace of auv in this case a global path planner without considerations of obstacle avoidance can be used and the path length is usually one of the key optimization objectives for auv path planning the objective of auv is to find the shortest path from the starting point to the designated position in accordance with its turning characteristics for example li 2019 proposed a 3d cubic bezier curve method to solve the problem that the distance between the bezier curve and last several targets is large this idea was shown to be able to enable auv to get the shortest path with good continuity in addition different from other robot platforms on land or in the air the battery life of auv is limited and auv cannot be re charged in time when performing underwater tasks therefore the energy consumption must be kept at the lowest level for auv path planning especially in the ocean environments with strong currents if the path planning direction of auv is consistent with the direction of currents the energy consumption would be greatly reduced therefore how to make rational use of ocean currents is a problem that many researchers pay attention to in barrier free environment yao et al 2018 proposed a path planning method with continuous direction for auv based on the edge search algorithm the proposed method does not fix the specific location of the next point and uses the current to reach the next point to the maximum extent which can reduce the energy consumption on the other hand most of the time auv will operate in the environments full of obstacles and there are many cases when the location and contour of static obstacles can be measured or obtained beforehand in these cases there is usually a global map about everything including obstacles before planning a path auv can use this information to find a collision free path between the starting point and the target point in advance with global path planning methods because the position of the static obstacle is fixed auv can use the environmental modeling method to get an understanding of the distribution and contour of the obstacles in advance the commonly used environmental modeling methods by auvs include grid method cao et al 2016 cell tree zhang and jia 2012 electronic chart sun and zhang 2012 etc the integrity of obstacle information in the model will determine the accuracy of static path planning in this static environment with known obstacles how to quickly and efficiently plan an optimal path is crucial to promote the development of auv compared with dynamic path planning for unknown and dynamic obstacle avoidance its advantage is that it can increase the possibility of finding the optimal path ralli and hirzinger 1997 in this section we will review popular global path planning methods for auv traveling in environments with known static obstacles these methods were also used by researchers for auv path planning in barrier free environments with more focus on the path length energy consumption and ocean current instead of obstacle avoidance 3 1 a algorithm a algorithm is the most effective direct search algorithm in the static environment it combines heuristic searching and searching based on the shortest path duchoň et al 2014 in the a algorithm the search area is generally divided into small squares with each square representing a node the a algorithm uses an evaluation function f n g n h n which provides guidances for the selection of nodes in an open list in the evaluation function g n is the actual cost of node n found so far from the initial node and the cost estimate h n is the manhattan distance from node n to the target node yao et al 2010 as shown in fig 3 the a algorithm calculates the f value of the surrounding nodes and selects the node with the smallest f value as the next traversal node until the target node is found due to the particularity of the marine environment carroll et al 1992 considered the maximum operation depth of auv and current information in the heuristic function when they used the a algorithm for path planning to shorten the search time szczerba et al 2000 proposed a sparse a algorithm using the maximum turning angle and the maximum path length as constraints for the basic a algorithm yan et al 2012a proposed an a algorithm based on circle search in their method a virtual terrain is used to map the 3d space into a 2d search area which can meet the constraints of the change rate of the auv s pitch angle and heading angle in addition the search step size and search direction of the algorithm are flexible so that auv can quickly get out of the threat and reach the destination based on a sparse a algorithm chen et al 2012 constructed the search space of obstacles by randomly distributing points and combined with a visibility inspection method under the constraint of maximum turning radius to make auv path smoother according to the anisotropy of the current flow yan et al 2012b expanded the sub nodes of a algorithm in a specific direction which simplifies the spatial range and greatly shortens the path planning time wang and pang 2019 applied the a search algorithm to a chemical plume tracking task with auv specifically they get the source location according to the partially observable markov decision process jiu et al 2019 and search the shortest path of chemical source with the a search algorithm to overcome defects of the traditional a algorithm li and zhang 2020 designed a multi directional a algorithm which reduced the number of search nodes to get the optimal path in summary a algorithm is usually modified to improve the expansion of heuristic function or sub node to better adapt to the application of auv path planning when the a algorithm searches for the next node it has to calculate and select the node with the smallest f value each time it is time consuming to calculate the f value of all nodes in the map especially for the search area with a large map this might make the speed of planning for a path very slow 3 2 genetic algorithm inspired by the natural selection and evolution the genetic algorithm is proposed and has been widely used to solve various optimization problems the genetic algorithm works by initializing the population randomly selecting the suitable individuals with a fitness function carrying on the selection crossover mutation genetic operations and constantly updating the population haupt and werner 2007 fig 4 shows one iterative process of the genetic algorithm through operating on the object directly the genetic algorithm can obtain and guide the search space automatically without defining rules restricted by genetic algorithm researchers usually modify the algorithm in terms of the genetic operator evaluation factor or individual selection of population to adapt to the characteristics of auv for example alvarez and caiti 2001 applied genetic algorithm to path planning of underwater vehicle in their method a new genetic operator is added to the algorithm to make it converge to the global minimum when there are different minimum values in the ocean flow field to complete the obstacle avoidance task under strong currents alvarez et al 2004 proposed an improved genetic algorithm in their method an iterative operator is added to change the initial population and a random migration operator is added to improve the mutation rate their results show that auv can obtain the path with minimum energy consumption zhang 2006 designed a hierarchical path planning method based on the genetic algorithm firstly the auv workspace is decomposed into obstacle region and free region by octree then the genetic algorithm is used to search the path of the free region according to the current information provided by electronic charts an adaptive function is established for genetic algorithm sun and zhang 2012 in their method the ocean current is used as an evaluation factor of the adaptive function in the algorithm which saves the energy consumption of auv li et al 2013 show that adding a node deletion operator and a smoothing operator into the genetic algorithm can get a better path in addition cao et al 2016 improved the initial population generation method of the genetic algorithm and designed tangential operators to greatly improve the convergence speed of auv path planning yan and pan 2019 proposed an improved genetic algorithm to solve the premature problem in the traditional genetic algorithm in their method the population entropy is used as the diversity evaluation standard and an adaptive method is used to adjust the probability in crossover and mutation in addition considering the kinematic characteristics of auv as shown in section 2 the individuals who are close to obstacles or do not conform to the actual attitude of auv are eliminated in the genetic algorithm the biggest advantage of genetic algorithm is that it does not need to know how to find the optimal solution before planning the genetic algorithm has been successfully applied to auv path planning in environments with known static obstacles however if the parameters of the algorithm were not adjusted properly some problems might happen e g individual peak value or the planning speed might be very slow 3 3 differential evolution similar to the genetic algorithm the differential evolutionary algorithm is also a global optimization algorithm consisting of mutation crossover and selection operation storn and price 1997 however different from the genetic algorithm the mutation vector in differential evolution is generated by the difference vector of the parent generation besides it intersects with the individual vector of the parent generation to generate a new individual vector and directly selects with the individual of the parent generation therefore the differential evolution algorithm is expected to be more effective than the genetic algorithm in path planning to improve the performance of differential evolution algorithm in auv application usually the cost function of the algorithm is modified in consideration of the kinematic constraints of the auv model shown in section 2 for example in order to adapt to the complex environments of auv path planning zhang et al 2014 proposed an adaptive differential evolutionary algorithm in their method the cost function with penalty method takes the curvature constraint caused by auv model path length and energy consumption into account which was used to adjust the algorithm s parameters adaptively according to the position and size of the obstacles li et al 2014a applied the differential evolution algorithm to the obstacle avoidance task of auv they first classified the obstacles and constructed an avoidance function with the differential evolution algorithm they verified the proposed method by conducting experiments with single and multiple obstacles on a simulation platform in addition mahmoud et al 2018 used a differential evolution algorithm to optimize the control points of b spline generation which enables auv to effectively deal with various obstacles in three dimensional space in their method the penalty method defined in the cost function takes into account the kinematic constraints of the auv on surge sway yaw and pitch components as well as the constraints on the depth maneuver in their experiments the auv path planning based on differential evolution algorithm can make full use of the expected current to deal with the unexpected current interference however the parent individuals generated by the algorithm are not optimized and the computational efficiency is low 3 4 particle swarm optimization particle swarm optimization is an evolutionary computing technique based on random population eberhart and kennedy 1995 which is derived from the study of birds foraging behavior when birds are looking for food they do not know the specific location of food but only know their current locations and the distance from food their search strategy is to find the bird closest to food and walk with it patle et al 2019 the flow chart of a particle swarm optimization algorithm is shown in fig 5 in fig 5 pbest is called the individual extremum which means the optimal solution found by a particle and gbest means the optimal solution in the whole particle swarm namely the global extremum the whole process of the particle swarm optimization algorithm is to use information of the current position x and velocity v of particles pbest and gbest to iterate until an optimal solution is found particle swarm optimization and its most important variant quantum particle swarm optimization sun et al 2004 have been widely applied in various path planning tasks of auv for example yang and zhang 2009 proposed an adapted inertia weight particle swarm optimization algorithm in which the update of each particle changes with the evolution of the population the proposed method considers the speed and direction of the current in the fitness function of the algorithm which not only completes the obstacle avoidance for auv but also enables auv to work in the presence of strong currents tang et al 2010 applied the particle swarm optimization algorithm to path planning of auv in 3d environments in their method the 3d space is sliced for dimension reduction and a path effective function is introduced to solve the critical point problem simulated experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in path planning for auv docking li et al 2019c proposed an adaptive quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm based on b spline function b spline function allows auv to obtain a smoother path by setting multiple internal control points since the attitude of auv is controlled by rudder and propeller the constraint of curvature radius caused by kinematics of auv is considered when the particle position is updated in their method in addition the algorithm uses the quantum behavior to update particles considers the travel time in the fitness function and adds a mutation operator which greatly improves the search performance to speed up the convergence wang et al 2020 proposed an improved quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm in their method the safety length and angle of the path are considered for constructing the fitness function and the cubic spline interpolation algorithm hou and andrews 1978 is used to smooth the path in addition since the translational velocity of auv is affected by the eddy flow field the component of flow velocity is considered in the wave swing and heave of auv lim et al 2020b proposed a particle swarm optimization algorithm with selective differential evolution for off line path planning of auv selecting the most suitable particle for differential evolution hybridization can greatly reduce the computation the proposed algorithm is simulated and tested in an environment with known obstacles and time invariant non uniform currents compared with other mobile robots the particle swarm optimization for auv path planning mainly modifies the adaptability function to resist the interference of current or changes the update process of particles to adapt to the underactuated auv particle swarm optimization has no crossover and mutation operation and only needs to adjust a few parameters in addition it has a memory function and can find the optimal path in a short time however due to the lack of dynamic regulation of particle velocity particle swarm optimization is easy to fall into local optimums 3 5 ant colony optimization similar to particle swarm optimization which is inspired by birds foraging behavior the ant colony algorithm is a heuristic optimization method proposed by simulating the foraging behavior of ant colony in nature the fundamental idea behind the ant colony algorithm is that it uses the behavior of a single ant to represent one feasible solution of the path optimization problem and the behavior of the entire ant colony constitutes the solution space of the problem the mechanism of the ant colony algorithm is shown in fig 6 to be specific ants can sense the chemicals released by groups called pheromones and show certain intelligent behaviors in the process of foraging fig 6 a in the presence of obstacles ants will randomly crawl to both sides of the path fig 6 b as time goes the pheromone concentrated on the short path is larger than that on the long path dorigo et al 1991 according to the intensity of pheromone they can be guided to bypass the obstacles and find the shortest path to food sources fig 6 c wang and wei 2009 improved the ant colony optimization algorithm and applied it to auv path planning specifically they defined the area covered or partially covered by obstacles as inaccessible region with the grid method in addition a cutting operator and insertion point operator are added to allow auv to find a smooth path around the inaccessible area quickly however the distance between auv and the obstacle might be very close which poses a great threat to the safety of the vehicle zhang and jia 2012 used the distance between auv and obstacles as heuristic information and added a penalty factor in the ant colony optimization algorithm to eliminate the path close to the obstacle their simulation results show that the proposed method may produce too large yaw angle which does not conform to the yaw characteristics of auv to avoid static obstacles in three dimensional space yang et al 2015 proposed an ant colony optimization algorithm based on pheromone elimination in their method the pheromone is divided into two parts attraction and repulsion so ants can explore first and then develop in the search path which can overcome the shortcoming of making auv fall into local extremum easily in traditional ant colony optimization algorithm in addition in their method the main running direction is determined when initializing the population and the maximum horizontal and vertical moving ranges of auv are limited to speed up the convergence dong and xu 2017 proposed an ant colony algorithm with a reinforcement idea from reinforcement learning sutton and barto 1998 specifically a positive reward will be given to safe paths and a negative reward will be given to collision paths during the training process yu et al 2018 proposed a c o a by combining the ant colony optimization aco algorithm with a search phanthong 2015 based on fine grained modeling a c o a takes the advantages of the a algorithm which uses admissible heuristic functions for pairwise path planning and the aco algorithm which establishes the target s marching order through coarse grained modeling based on the representative estimation strategy their experimental results show that auv can successfully pass through the area with dense obstacles to reduce invalid search ma et al 2018 introduced an alarm pheromone in the ant colony optimization algorithm when an ant reaches the infeasible area it releases alarm messages to alert the ants behind compared with other methods it can not only build a collision free path for auv but also can keep auv away from obstacles as far as possible to solve the limitation of single objective programming in the actual marine environment hu and zhang 2019 proposed an multi objective ant colony optimization strategy in their method the evaluation function for pheromone update is no longer determined by a single path length but also considers the impact of the current on energy consumption and the safety of auv their results in simulated experiments show that the algorithm can make auv reach the target point without collision under the constraint of multi target with regard to energy consumption which is an important factor for auv path planning ma et al 2020 applied the firework ant colony algorithm zhang et al 2018 to the path planning of auv the initial pheromones of the ant colony algorithm are derived from the initial reference path generated by the improved fireworks algorithm which can obtain the global optimal solution in a shorter time to allow auv to find an optimal path in complex seabeds che et al 2020 proposed the ant colony algorithm with particle swarm optimization the particle swarm optimization algorithm is introduced into the path length heuristic function to improve the pheromone update rules in addition considering the difficulty of auv in three dimensional space the proposed method limits the initialization range of individual population greatly improves the search efficiency and avoids a series of unnecessary pitching and heave compared with the traditional ant colony algorithm the optimized path in the simulation is greatly shortened the ant colony optimization algorithm can easily find an optimal path to the target point in environments with known static obstacles the searching efficiency can be greatly improved with distributed computing and positive feedback mechanism but the convergence might be very slow therefore the application of ant colony algorithm to auv path planning still needs further investigations 3 6 discussion table 1 shows advantages and disadvantages of global path planning methods with collision avoidance of known obstacles compared with other algorithms the a algorithm is the most direct heuristic search algorithm without any preprocessing operation however if the task is executed in a large scale environment a large number of nodes need to be calculated which results in a low searching efficiency according to the principle of survival of the fittest the genetic algorithm usually carries out a large number of evolutionary operations therefore it will occupy a large storage space and has more parameters to be adjusted resulting in a slow convergence speed the advantage of the genetic algorithm is that it has strong global search ability and can overcome the sub optimal solution problem of the a algorithm similar to the genetic algorithm a differential evolutionary algorithm also has genetic operators such as selective cross mutation which can be defined with different methods it is verified that the robustness of the differential evolutionary algorithm is superior to the genetic algorithm in a wide range of path planning applications the ant colony optimization algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm are bionic methods inspired upon the behavior mechanism of biological groups in nature they can adapt to the environment in a shorter time with the cooperation between individual organisms the most significant feature of the ant colony optimization algorithm is that it adopts a positive feedback mechanism which can promote the ants to move towards the direction with high pheromone concentration because the distribution of the initial pheromones is sparse it takes more time to search at the beginning which leads to a slow convergence in the later stage with the increase of pheromone concentration the convergence rate increases obviously different from the ant colony algorithm the particle swarm algorithm makes use of information shared among groups and has faster convergence speed in the initial stage meanwhile the particle swarm optimization algorithm has fewer parameters and certain memory functions which can greatly reduce the searching time however the lack of dynamic regulation of particle velocity makes it prone to convergence at local optimum 4 local path planning with unknown and dynamic obstacles in dynamic and uncertain underwater environments it is difficult or even impossible to obtain the information of various obstacles before path planning obviously unknown and dynamic obstacles will pose big safety issues for auvs to perform underwater tasks in this case there is usually a planned path from a global path planner and auv still needs a local path planner to avoid these unknown and dynamic obstacles in recent years many path planning methods have been proposed for unknown and dynamic obstacle avoidance like rapidly exploring random trees artificial potential field fuzzy logic algorithm neural network reinforcement learning and even deep reinforcement learning different form other robot platforms on land or in the air these methods mostly use sonar sensors nussbaum et al 1996 ghatak et al 2006 zou et al 2007 to obtain the real time distances and angles of surrounding obstacles and use local dynamic path planning technology to complete obstacle avoidance tasks which greatly improves the autonomy of auv 4 1 rapidly exploring random trees rrt the fundamental idea behind the rrt algorithm is to scatter some points randomly in the search space and then connect them into a motion path for robot via calculation the mechanism of a basic rrt algorithm is shown in fig 7 in fig 7 x i n i t is the starting node and x r a n d is the target node through collision detection of random sampling points in the state space the nearest x n e a r node to the target node can be found which extends the x n e w node to the open undetected area the rrt algorithm considers both the algebraic constraints caused by obstacles and the differential constraints caused by dynamics of auv in section 2 tan et al 2004 and can effectively find a collision free path from the starting node to the target node tan et al 2005 combined rrt with a hybrid modeling technique maneuver automaton ma to capture the key dynamics of a nonlinear autonomous underwater vehicle auv such as rudder deflection and rudder rate in the path planning with obstacles their proposed rrt algorithm increases the generation of sub nodes which allows auv to complete the task safely with greater probability to reduce unnecessary space exploration hernández et al 2011 proposed the homotopy rapidly exploring random trees hrrt algorithm hrrt can prevent the tree from growing out of the space region of homotopy class and allow auv to move towards the target point in different ways while avoiding obstacles hernández et al 2015 applied the transition rapidly exploring random trees jaillet et al 2010 algorithm to auv path planning in their method the distance between seabed and auv is considered in the costmap of rrt algorithm their experimental results show that auv can complete corresponding underwater exploration tasks near the seabed li et al 2017 proposed a liveness based rrt li rrt by adding a liveness index to describe the effectiveness of each node in the tree in li rrt a collision detection index collision degree offspring collision and adjacent collision that will greatly affect the expansion ability are also defined their numerical simulation experimental results show that auv can avoid collision with the coast in underwater environments yu et al 2017 proposed a smooth rrt algorithm for auv motion planning in accordance with the steering characteristics of auv compared with the classical rrt a convergence factor and angle factor are introduced which can reduce the generation of unnecessary nodes in addition the hydrodynamic angle is considered when auv calculates the motion angle and the greedy strategy is used to make the path smoother simulated experimental results show that auv can reduce the number of turns in presence of many obstacles taheri et al 2019 proposed a closed loop rapidly exploring random tree cl rrt algorithm to solve the kinematic constraints caused by obstacles and the characteristics of auv in cl rrt three fuzzy proportional derivative controllers and auv models in section 2 were used to evaluate whether the range and vertices of the search tree satisfy the nonholonomic dynamic constraints of auv it was verified on xpc target generator that cl rrt could find collision free paths in 3d space with clutter obstacles but the experiment did not involve an actual auv r r t is one of the sampling based algorithms proposed in recent years karaman and frazzoli 2011 it not only ensures the probability completeness but also solves the problem that the rrt algorithm might get a suboptimal solution in addition r r t changes the expansion mode of nodes and selects the node with the lowest cost in the extended domain as the parent node with a cost function fu et al 2019 improved the r r t algorithm using heuristic ellipsoid subset sampling for centralized search their experimental results with terrain obstacles and floating objects show that auv can approach the optimal path faster 4 2 artificial potential field artificial potential field is a real time path planning method proposed by khatib 1986 through the establishment of virtual potential field the robot can approach the target point and avoid collision with obstacles the force analysis of the artificial potential field algorithm is shown in fig 8 in which f a represents the attraction force of the target point to the robot and f r represents the repulsion force generated by the obstacle the direction of resultant force f is obtained via vector operation of forces to guide the robot moving towards the target point due to the advantages of low cost simple mathematical calculation and convenient real time observation artificial potential field has been widely used in path planning of autonomous mobile robot cao et al 2006 however if the resultant force is zero the robot cannot find the path or carry out a closed loop motion to solve this problem and make it suitable for auv path planning ding et al 2005 introduced a third virtual force in the artificial potential field algorithm with this modification when encountering concave obstacles which are situations that auvs need to confront in the marine environment auv can move along the boundary of the obstacle and start the dynamic recognition range to prevent forgetting obstacles saravanakumar and asokan 2013 put forward a multi point potential field method which discretizes the surface of the obstacle facing the auv head into multiple points by analyzing the force acting on multiple points and obstacles the underwater vehicle is guided to the point where the total potential energy is minimum the proposed method is tested in a 3d simulation environment and experimental results show it can effectively avoid dynamic and static obstacles in addition they emphasize that the proposed multi point potential field method is more suitable for the 6 dof auvs working in 3d space and is not meant for autonomous ground vehicles agvs operating in 3d terrain cheng et al 2015 proposed an artificial potential field method in consideration of both the current and dynamic obstacles this method combines the current and the speed of the auv to resist the adverse effect of the current on the auv navigation then the direction of auv s velocity can be accurately determined with the relationship between repulsion force and gravity their results show it can overcome influence of the current and avoid collision with dynamic obstacles villar et al 2016 proposed an artificial potential field method for obstacle avoidance of auv with a mechanical scanning sonar specifically different attraction and repulsion constants are used in the potential function to create an optimal path and virtual obstacles are also introduced to solve the local minimum problem in a target search task ge et al 2018 proposed an improved potential field method for multi auv obstacle avoidance in their method the dispersion degree the homodromous degree and district difference degree are considered in the potential field function which can allow auvs to complete the search task accurately and avoid falling into local traps noguchi and maki 2019 proposed a path planning method based on artificial potential field algorithm and reinforcement learning rummery and niranjan 1994 because the environmental information obtained by sensors is limited and fuzzy binary bayes filter thrun 2002 is used to estimate the occupancy probability of obstacles in the workspace of auv experiments show that this method can generate a safe path without contact with obstacles khalaji and tourajizadeh 2020 extracted the kinematics and dynamics model of auv in section 2 then based on lyapunov theory lefeber et al 2003 a new nonlinear controller is proposed which uses the potential field algorithm to avoid local stationary or moving obstacles in addition an adjustable avoidance gain is added to the potential function and the simulation results show that auv can bypass the obstacle with the minimum deviation from the reference trajectory fan et al 2020 proposed an improved artificial potential field method for real time path planning of auv in their method a distance correction factor is added to the exclusion function to solve the local minimum problem and the relative velocity method is introduced to detect and avoid dynamic obstacles considering the potential obstacles and forbidden areas in the monitoring system of the underwater internet of things lin et al 2020 proposed a joint control model for multiple auvs based on the artificial potential field algorithm in their method the software defined networking lin et al 2018 paradigm is used to improve the flexibility and controllability of group based auv in addition each auv in the system not only pays attention to the influence of the surrounding obstacles but also takes dynamics of all auvs into account the simulated experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively manage the path planning for all auvs the artificial potential field method has great advantages in avoiding unknown obstacles however the local minimum problem should be considered to avoid the instability of auv caused by limited force which might bring more loss to the equipment or environment 4 3 fuzzy logic algorithm the fuzzy logic algorithm represents a nonlinear mapping from the state space to the control space cordón et al 1996 which is usually defined according to the expert s knowledge fig 9 shows the basic principle of the fuzzy logic algorithm applied to an auv platform as shown in fig 9 information detected from sensors is first processed by fuzzifer then fuzzy rules defined according to experts experience will be used for fuzzy inference and decision making the result of reasoning is defuzzified to control the movement of auv for obstacle avoidance with a fuzzy logic algorithm sensory information between auv and surrounding obstacles is usually taken as input of the fuzzy controller and new driving instructions are outputted for auv khanmohammadi et al 2007 applied a robust fuzzy controller to the obstacle avoidance of auv the forward looking sonar obtains the angle velocity and distance of the obstacle as the input of the controller and the two outputs of the controller are the change of the angle of attack of the two rods and the change of the propeller speed their simulation results show that the fuzzy controller can effectively avoid moving obstacles to overcome the limitations of the controllable degree of freedom of underactuated underwater vehicles xu and feng 2009 integrated a fuzzy logic controller into the finite state automata to realize the intelligent transformation of horizontal and vertical obstacle avoidance behaviors in addition considering that the two rudders are controlled to a large angle at the same time and auv may be out of control the emergency yaw and emergency ascent are set in the horizontal plane and vertical plane respectively the fuzzy logic algorithm does not work well when auvs confront a strong sea flow therefore yang et al 2009 used q learning watkins and dayan 1992 to adjust the peak value of fuzzy membership function against current behavior their experimental results show that auv can successfully avoid obstacles and its trajectory is unaffected by ocean currents abbasi et al 2010 used line of sight guidance to make auv move towards the target by considering the experience of experts and taking the velocity of moving obstacles as one of the inputs to the fuzzy controller auv can generate left or right turn when encountering obstacles their method enables the auv to bypass fixed or moving obstacles and reach the target effectively to improve the intelligence of decision making for auv obstacle avoidance yang and zhu 2011 added an acceleration braking module in the fuzzy reasoning process fang et al 2015 obtained the corresponding hydrodynamic coefficients of auv through the planar motion mechanism as the important data input of the fuzzy control and used the bk bandler and kohout 1980 triangular sub product of the fuzzy relations to determine the turning angle of auv when the obstacle exists this self tuning fuzzy control system was tested to be able to avoid obstacles in the horizontal plane to solve the problem that the boundary design of fuzzy logic in path planning relies heavily on expert experience sun et al 2018b used quantum behaved particle swarm optimization sun et al 2016 to optimize the membership function value of fuzzy logic in addition sonars are set in the horizontal plane and vertical plane respectively and the virtual acceleration and velocity of auv in 3d space can be obtained using the fuzzy system of acceleration or deceleration module their results show that auv with their proposed method can automatically avoid dynamic obstacles because the speed of moving obstacles in real environments is difficult to obtain li et al 2019b take changes of the distance between auv and obstacles as additional input to the fuzzy membership function their results show that when the obstacle moves rapidly the proposed method is obviously better than the traditional fuzzy logic algorithm the biggest advantage of the fuzzy logic algorithm is that it does not need accurate mathematical models and the operation principle is essentially similar to human cognition many researchers have achieved good results in obstacle avoidance of auv using the fuzzy logic algorithm however the definition of fuzzy rules relies heavily on the expert s experience and cannot adapt to the environment in complex and uncertain underwater environments the construction of fuzzy rule base would be difficult or even impossible 4 4 neural network neural network is proposed for exploring the law of intelligent activities by simulating human brains the traditional neural network for path planning takes the data collected by sensors as the input after training the output drives the action for obstacle avoidance of auv duan et al 2001 used a fuzzy neural network for real time auv obstacle avoidance in addition li and guo 2012 designed a dynamic neural network which was tested to be able to bypass the uneven obstacles and reach the target position in 3d spaces however data for training a traditional neural network has to be collected beforehand therefore yang and meng 2003 proposed a bio inspired neural network which does not need any training process in bio inspired neural network the dynamic characteristics of neurons are expressed by a shunt equation derived from the uniform diaphragm model of the biological neural system hodgkin and huxley 1952 fig 10 shows the structure of a 2d bio inspired neural network in fig 10 each black circle represents a neuron each neuron interacts with eight adjacent neurons to generate a real time path according to the dynamic activity diagram of the neural network because of the high self adaptability bio inspired neural network is more widely used in the real time path planning of auv an improved bionic neural network based on yan and zhu 2011 is used for auv full coverage path planning when encountering moving obstacles the activity of neural network will receive a great inhibition prompting auv to adjust its direction guerrero gonzález et al 2011 used the self organizing neural network to generate the transformation between the spatial coordinates and the speed coordinates of auv propeller and proposed a bio inspired neural network based on animal learning for obstacle avoidance of auv the proposed method can drive auv to rotate a certain angle according to the activation of the neural network nodes in unknown dynamic environment zhu et al 2014 applied the bio inspired neural network and map planning method to auv path planning specifically considering the uncertainty of the ultrasonic sensor in underwater measurement ultrasonic sensory information is fused into a grid map to deal with dynamic obstacles using dempster shafer pagac et al 1998 information rule ni et al 2017 proposed an improved dynamic bio inspired neural network for auv path planning the network changes dynamically according to the detection range of sensors and introduces virtual targets into the environment their experiments show that it can solve the complex calculation problem of auv in a very large 3d environment and the problem that the target direction cannot be found when the size of the obstacle is larger than the detection range of the sensor considering that the distance between obstacles and auv should not be too close cao and peng 2018 proposed a potential field bio inspired neural network in the proposed method a repulsive potential field is used to enlarge the obstacle and an attractive potential field is introduced to optimize the path which can effectively keep auv away from the obstacle in addition a leader follower biological inspired neural network was also proposed for multi auv obstacle avoidance by ding et al 2014 specifically the velocity and trajectory of a virtual auv is obtained using the position of the leading auv then the kinematics auv formation control law is designed by backstepping kwan and lewis 2000 once obstacles are detected the main auv will change the formation into a straight line to pass through the obstacle area with a bio inspired neural network moreover wu et al 2018 added a lateral inhibition effect of obstacles into the bionic neural network which is effective for solving various collision avoidance problems of a single auv as well as multi auv in dynamic environments sun et al 2018a applied the glasius bio inspired neural network to multiple auvs coverage path planning glasius bionic neural network used difference equations to calculate the activity value of neurons which can improve the self adaptability of the algorithm and greatly reduce the path planning time of auvs 4 5 reinforcement learning reinforcement learning allows an agent to learn how to perform a task by interacting with environment via trial and error sutton and barto 1998 for obstacle avoidance of auv with reinforcement learning auv first detects the surrounding information e g information of obstacles as its current state estimation s t and performs an action a t which will transition the state s t of the environment to a next state then auv will get a reward signal r t from the environment which will be used to update its policy the objective of auv is to learn an optimal policy which will select actions maximizing the expected cumulative reward fig 11 illustrates the mechanism of an auv path planning with reinforcement learning the introduction of reinforcement learning into obstacle avoidance of auv enables it to learn through its own experience and gradually adapt to the environment without knowing the complete prior knowledge or even the prior knowledge at all kawano and ura 2002b proposed a path planning algorithm combining q learning watkins and dayan 1992 a teaching method and bayesian network for non holonomic auv the teaching method includes intensive teaching of suggestions for auv choosing actions and global teaching of keeping a distance from the target point in the whole learning process learning experience is stored in a bayesian network which enables auv to deal with obstacles of any shape in addition the error caused by the coupling of current and the yaw motion is taken as the input and the continuous iterative learning is used to better resist the current however because of the influence of non markovian effect the proposed method is slow to converge therefore they further proposed a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach in which the high level is composed of a motion planning module considering the position of auv and the low level refers to the speed of auv to stabilize the yaw motion kawano and ura 2002a as a result the learning speed of the algorithm is shown to be significantly improved in consideration of the high risk of trial and error chen et al 2009 proposed to use neural network and case based q learning greenwald et al 2003 for auv path planning the neural network with multi layer error feedback has a strong approximation ability which can improve the generalization of q learning and case based q learning was used to guarantee the convergence with information provided by a multi beam forward sonar the proposed method was shown to be able to enable auv to find an optimal path among multiple obstacles in the real time obstacle avoidance of small auvs a single beam sonar is used to measure information of obstacles in turn and the steering action is selected based on a reinforcement learning method huang et al 2014 when auv approaches an obstacle it gains a negative enhancement and when auv moves away from the obstacle it receives a positive reward the simulation results show that auv can safely avoid the obstacles in the range of 90 degree open angle by learning to control the change of propeller and course of auv in the presence of dynamic obstacles gore et al 2019 show that by allowing auv to obtain state information within a markov decision process it can learn to take corresponding actions to obtain the path with minimum deviation from obstacles noguchi and maki 2019 applied sarsa λ to path planning of auv and they show that it can find collision free paths to capture sea urchins in complex environments in their method considering the limitation and fuzziness of the information obtained with sonar sensors the map based on occupancy probability is used to obtain the state information of auv in addition bhopale et al 2019 proposed a modified q learning algorithm based on back propagation neural network to deal with unknown obstacles in the environment the proposed method overcomes the problem of dimensional disaster and introduces a factor b ˆ to balance exploration and exploitation for example when obstacles are detected b ˆ is set to be 1 for pure exploitation compared with standard q learning the probability of collision between auv and obstacles is reduced based on hierarchical reinforcement learning sun et al 2020 designed hierarchical deep q network for auv path planning the obstacle avoidance and the target approaching are set as two subtasks to obtain different selection strategies in addition the combination of hierarchical deep q network and priority experience replay improves the learning efficiency of auv moreover cao et al 2020 proposed a potential field hierarchical reinforcement learning approach to improve the cooperation efficiency of multi auv in a target searching task in their method the multi agent cooperative maxq algorithm was used for hierarchical reinforcement learning hrl cheng et al 2007 li et al 2010 shen et al 2006 and a potential field was used to automatically adjust parameters of hrl the proposed method was shown to be able to enable multi auv to successfully bypass the dynamic and static obstacles and find the nearest target point to each auv in simulated experiments compared with other mobile robots when applying reinforcement learning to auv path planning it usually uses the output of the learning algorithm to select actions from the action space and directly control the rudder elevator and propeller of auv when the current exists in the environment the reinforcement learning algorithm will take the current as one of the state inputs and use continuous iterative learning to better deal with the current reinforcement learning has proven to be able to facilitate auv to complete target search and navigation in environments with unknown obstacles though mostly in simulations however how to learn to find an optimal policy in tasks with large state space and apply to a physical auv platform still remain to be a huge challenge 4 6 deep reinforcement learning deep reinforcement learning drl combines the perception of deep learning with the decision making of reinforcement learning the advantage of drl is that it can use deep learning e g a deep neural network to automatically learn low dimensional state characteristics of high dimensional states by reducing dimensions through iterative interaction with the environment it solves the limitations of reinforcement learning caused by large state and action space arulkumaran et al 2017 deep reinforcement learning has opened up a new way to solve the problem of learning from the complex nonlinear high dimensional sensory input in unknown environments drl has been widely used in obstacle avoidance of surface unmanned aerial singla et al 2019 yan et al 2019 and more and more researchers have started trying to apply it to auv path planning for example in a target search task cao et al 2019 applied the asynchronous advantages actor critic a3c method mnih et al 2016 to obstacle avoidance of auv in their method an a3c network structure was used in which each thread independently interacts with the environment the learning results of all threads were collected into a global actor critic pair and combined with a dual stream q network simonyan and zisserman 2014 the network structure is composed of multiple convolution layers and long term and long short term memory hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the input information goes through otsu method gupta et al 2018 disk shaped structural closing operation disk shaped structural coordinate system transformation and rasterization to remove the noise points of the original sonar image their simulated experiments show that auv with a3c can effectively avoid obstacles in various environments and complete the target search task efficiently in addition wu et al 2019 proposed an end to end auv motion control framework based on the proximal policy optimization algorithm schulman et al 2017 which takes the original sonar sensory information as the input directly and does not need to consider the dynamic characteristics of auv in their experiments the reward function takes multiple objectives such as waypoint tracking obstacle avoidance collision penalty and speed as constraints making the algorithm more suitable for auv path planning in underwater dangerous environments full of obstacles in addition in order to avoid the difficulty and noise of underwater positioning they proposed a new state encoder and reward shaping strategy which can realize learning without knowing the position of auv their results in detailed comparative experiments show that auv can complete the obstacle avoidance task in a 2d environment moreover hou et al 2020 designed a path planning algorithm based on deterministic policy gradient heess et al 2015 according to the nonlinear characteristics of auv it is not abstracted as a point and two suitable neural network approximators are developed to control the propeller power and rudder position of auv the reward function takes the distance of obstacles obtained by a sonar array and the difference between the current distance distance from current position to target point and previous distance distance from previous position to target point into account their simulation results show that auv can plan a collision free path in unknown continuous environment with deep reinforcement learning havenstrøm et al 2021 directly used 2d sonar images as one of the state inputs and the output of the system is processed by the low pass filter to act on the control fin for completing the path tracking and obstacle avoidance tasks at the same time in their method the idea of course learning is introduced by constructing different levels of scenes from no obstacles to the introduction of obstacles and currents in addition a quadratic penalty reward function is designed to analyze the proportion of path tracking and obstacle avoidance in detail they verified the effectiveness of their method on a 3d simulation platform although deep reinforcement learning has achieved good performance for auv path planning problems such as sample inefficiency still prevent it from being applied to auv in the complex real world 4 7 other algorithms besides the above popular methods there are also literatures about the application of some other algorithms to auv path planning for instance he and zhou 2010 proposed that the whole working space of auv should be divided dynamically for large scale environments and the fast marching algorithm sethian 1999 can be used to find a collision free path wang et al 2013 proposed a vector polar histogram method for auv obstacle avoidance which can determine an optimal movement direction for auv when its sensor detects the presence of multiple obstacles sun and zhu 2016 used the d lite algorithm koenig and likhachev 2005 to repeatedly confirm whether the path distance from the current point to the target point is the shortest besides it can also quickly replan the path of auv when a moving obstacle is detected braginsky and guterman 2016 designed an obstacle avoidance method for auv considering both horizontal and vertical directions in the horizontal direction a two layer obstacle avoidance algorithm is adopted which includes a pre planning method based on the bk product of fuzzy relations bui and kim 2006 and a reactive obstacle avoidance algorithm based on the potential field and edge detection algorithm borenstein and koren 1991 when the obstacle fills the entire field of view of the sonar it can stimulate the reactive vertical travel in addition wang et al 2016 proposed a rolling window optimization algorithm to avoid unknown obstacles yan et al 2018a used the largest polar angle algorithm to generate obstacle avoidance contours for irregular obstacles moreover liu et al 2019 proposed a learning fixed height histogram method based on estimation of distribution algorithm larranaga and lozano 2001 to complete path planning in dynamic environments in the proposed method a plan window which can dynamically change its size is introduced to deal with moving obstacles 4 8 discussion table 2 compares advantages and disadvantages of above surveyed popular methods for local path planning with unknown and or dynamic obstacles among them the rrt algorithm is based on probability sampling which can consider algebraic constraints caused by obstacles and differential constraints caused by dynamics of auv at the same time through random sampling of points the search space of rrt can be easily extended to the unexplored area which is very suitable for solving path planning problems in high dimensional space therefore the rrt algorithm has a strong exploration ability in environments with unknown obstacles though its real time performance is not too high compared with other methods artificial potential field is simple in structure and easy to be implemented for auv control at the bottom layer and it plays an important role in real time obstacle avoidance for auv however artificial potential field does not consider the constraints of dynamics of auv and the obstacle size when multiple obstacles are close to each other auv with artificial potential field may fail to find the direction to travel and easily fall into the local minimum point the fuzzy logic algorithm has strong robustness in dealing with practical problems and has been widely used in auv to avoid unknown and dynamic obstacles it does not need an accurate mathematical model and is suitable for solving highly complex and nonlinear problems however the formulations of fuzzy rules and membership degree in the fuzzy logic algorithm rely heavily on experts knowledge which cannot be changed once it is determined therefore in unknown and uncertain environments the fuzzy logic algorithm might not work well since no prior knowledge can be obtained on the other hand neural network can store empirical knowledge and deal with nonlinear mapping problems by learning autonomously with simple rules however traditional neural networks need to collect samples before learning which is a very time consuming process and might be difficult or even impossible in many situations for auv path planning bio inspired neural network was proposed to solve this problem it does not need any pre training process and is very suitable to deal with unknown dynamic environments bio inspired neural network still has the shortcoming that it cannot explain the reasoning basis for the output reinforcement learning rl has strong decision making ability and auv with reinforcement learning can plan an optimal path without any prior knowledge moreover rl shows strong adaptability and flexibility in complex and uncertain environments however hand crafted features need to be used for state representation in rl in addition dimension disaster prevents auv from planning a path efficiently in high dimensional environments and reward delay results in a slow speed of convergence for auv path planning with rl deep reinforcement learning drl does not require manual features for state representation but learn the features automatically it implements an end to end learning from raw sensory input data to auv s actions which allows auv to learn to plan an optimal path in high dimensional and complex environments however usually millions of samples are needed for auv with drl to learn to plan an optimal path which prevents it from applying to real auv platforms 5 outlook and future directions path planning has been an important research branch for improving the autonomy of auv and attracted lots of attentions from worldwide researchers for the last decades though many path planning algorithms have been proposed and implemented on auv there are still many potential problems for auv path planning remaining to be further explored especially in consideration of the characteristics and constraints of auv and its working environment 5 1 path planning for real auv platform any collision may cause serious and irreparable damage to auv in complex underwater environment although many of the above surveyed methods have been shown to be able to plan a collision free path in simulations only a few of them can work well on physical auv platform in real marine environments for example guerrero gonzález et al 2011 tested a bionic neural network for auv obstacle avoidance in the shallow water area of mar menor lagoon their experimental results show that when approaching obstacles such as other ships on the water surface the conditioning circuit chang and gaudiano 1998 grossberg and levine 1987 of the neural network can drive auv to change its direction and effectively guide it to move between obstacles in addition hernández et al 2011 used sparus auv to test the performance of the hrrt algorithm for obstacle avoidance in the underwater robotics lab of the university of girona obstacles of different shapes are made with insulating board and placed in the water with a depth of 3 m the results show that the hrrt algorithm can generate a path in less than 100 ms which meets certain real time requirement but cannot guide auv to move along the generated path autonomously fan et al 2020 used the underwater robot named intelligence ocean i to verify the effectiveness of an improved artificial potential field method in their method a distance correction factor is added to the exclusion function to solve the problem of local minimum and relative speed method is introduced for dynamic obstacle detection and avoidance however obstacle avoidance in 3d environments are not considered in their experiments on the other hand multi auv cooperation can not only improve the efficiency of performing underwater tasks but also present more intelligent behaviors compared to a single auv li et al 2014b the task distribution li and zhang 2017 collaborative search ge et al 2018 formation control yuan et al 2017 and other aspects of multiple auvs have achieved good results though most of them are also only tested on simulation platforms wu et al 2018 cao et al 2020 for path planning of multi auv in real environment it is more challenging because it needs to take other auvs into account more importantly the communication between auvs is limited and usually only underwater acoustic communication can be used for multi auv cooperation compared to other robotic platforms on land or in the air cao et al 2019 carried out multi auv target search experiments with deep reinforcement learning model for obstacle avoidance in a pool of 10 m 20 m in their experiments a remote controlled submersible was placed in the pool as an obstacle their results show that two auvs completed the collision free search to the target point with the pre trained deep reinforcement learning model achieving similar performance to the simulation experiments however due to the lacking of underwater acoustic communication for multi auv the experiments are only carried out on the surface of the pool with wifi wireless communication data acquisition methods of wireless sensor networks based on mobile sink mehto et al 2020 might be useful to overcome the limitation of acoustic communication for multi auv communication since auv is a relatively resource poor device which is similar to mobile sink 5 2 path planning in uncertain environments for local path planning the fuzzy logic algorithm does not need accurate mathematical models and have been tested to be able to achieve good results however the fuzzy rules are usually defined based on the expert s experience and cannot adapt to the environment in complex uncertain underwater environment there is no prior knowledge available and the construction of fuzzy rules would be difficult or even impossible the path planning of auv with reinforcement learning rl can plan an optimal path by interaction with the environment without any prior knowledge therefore auv with reinforcement learning can adapt flexibly and work well in complex and uncertain environments auv with deep reinforcement learning drl can even learn in high dimensional and complex environments from raw sensory input data in an end to end way however rl and drl is sample inefficient and slow to converge because of the scarce reward signals goecks et al 2020 it is difficult or even unpractical to design an efficient reward function for each task which makes applying traditional rl and drl methods directly to path planning of physical auvs a great challenge riedmiller et al 2018 nevertheless sampling in a simulated environment is faster cheaper and safer than learning directly in the real world but using the policy trained in simulation directly in the real auv is difficult and risky since there is a gap between simulation and reality kober and peters 2014 many sim to real algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem such as domain adaption tzeng et al 2015 inverse dynamics model christiano et al 2016 domain randomization tobin et al 2017 and progressive network shojania and li 2007 etc but there seems no work on path planning of auv in terms of this prospect yet zhao et al 2020 on the other hand some researchers proposed to leverage human s knowledge to speed up auv s learning e g by allowing a human trainer to provide demonstrations evaluative feedback li et al 2019a etc for example chu et al 2020 proposed a deep imitation reinforcement learning dirl for motion control of the unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs dirl combines imitation learning from expert demonstrations and used the learned policy to initialize the td3 algorithm fujimoto et al 2018 in addition zhang et al 2020 proposed deep interactive reinforcement learning for auv path tracking task by allowing a human trainer to transfer her knowledge via delivering evaluative feedback over the quality of auv s actions therefore how to make full use of human experience and knowledge to improve auv path planning would be an interesting research direction 5 3 combination of different path planning algorithms the above surveyed path planning methods all have their own advantages and disadvantages in specific application scenarios it would be immensely useful to combine multiple path planning algorithms which can complement each other and better deal with unknown dynamic obstacles and complex situations for instance the combination of fuzzy logic algorithm and reinforcement learning can improve the control accuracy of the system in strong current yang et al 2009 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system and particle swarm optimization algorithm can be used together to generate feasible path in environments full of moving targets yan et al 2018b quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm with selective differential evolution can significantly shorten the time to generate the best path lim et al 2020a in addition yao and zhao 2018 used the improved genetic algorithm combined with the gray wolf optimization algorithm mirjalili et al 2014 to optimize the improved interfered fluid dynamical yao et al 2015 coefficient and verified that the combination of path planning algorithm and some mathematical methods can better deal with dynamic obstacles 6 conclusion in this article we have surveyed most recent work on path planning and obstacle avoidance for auv we introduced the kinematic and dynamic model of auv and give an overview of work on path planning for auv and technical details of some representative algorithms that deal with constraints and characteristics of auv and the influence of marine environments we also provide an in depth discussion and comparison between different path planning algorithms and propose some potential future research directions that are worthy to investigate in this field path planning methods of auv are mainly divided into two categories global path planning with known static obstacles and local path planning with unknown and dynamic obstacles when there is a global map about everything including obstacles before planning a path e g the location and contour of static obstacles can be measured or obtained beforehand auv can use this information to find a collision free path between the starting point and the target point in advance with global path planning methods global path planning for auv mainly includes a algorithm genetic algorithm differential evolution algorithm particle swarm optimization algorithm and ant colony optimization algorithm a algorithm is suitable for working in a simple and small scale marine environment since a large number of nodes need to be calculated in large scale environments resulting in a low searching efficiency auv path planning with genetic algorithm needs to have a large storage space and powerful computing system since a large number of evolutionary operations to be carried out and more parameters to be updated the differential evolutionary algorithm is similar to the genetic algorithm and is verified to be more robust than the genetic algorithm in a wide range of auv path planning applications the ant colony optimization algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm can adapt to the environment in a shorter time the particle swarm optimization algorithm has fewer parameters and certain memory functions greatly reducing the searching time in dynamic and uncertain underwater environments local path planning methods are needed to avoid unknown and dynamic obstacles by obtaining the local environmental information with sensors in real time on top of a planned path from a global path planner common local path planning methods include rrt artificial potential field fuzzy logic algorithm neural network reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning etc the rrt algorithm can be easily extended to the unexplored area which is very suitable for solving path planning problems in high dimensional space however the real time performance of rrt is not too high compared with other methods artificial potential field plays an important role in real time obstacle avoidance for auv however when the distance between two obstacles is too close or there are obstacles near the target point it may fail to find the direction to travel and easily fall into the local minimum point since it does not consider the constraints of dynamics of auv and the obstacle size the fuzzy logic algorithm was shown to be robust in dealing with practical problems and has been widely used in auv to avoid unknown and dynamic obstacles it does not need an accurate mathematical model and is suitable for solving highly complex and nonlinear problems however fuzzy logic algorithm requires human experts to be fully familiar with the operation mechanism of auv and establish an appropriate rule base and might not work well in unknown and uncertain environments auv path planning with neural network can store empirical knowledge and deal with nonlinear mapping problems by learning autonomously with simple rules traditional neural networks need to collect samples before learning which is a very time consuming process and might be difficult or even impossible in many situations for auv path planning bio inspired neural network does not need any pre training process and is very suitable to deal with unknown dynamic environments auv with reinforcement learning rl can plan an optimal path without any prior knowledge and work well in complex and fully uncertain environments deep reinforcement learning drl further implements an end to end learning to map the original sonar image to the action of auv which allows auv to learn to plan an optimal path in high dimensional and uncertain marine environments rl and drl can make use of samples in simulation and human knowledge to solve the sample inefficiency problem for applying to actual auv

comparisons between different path planning algorithms are also provided lastly we propose some potential future research directions that are worthy to investigate in this field keywords autonomous underwater vehicle path planning obstacle avoidance dynamic obstacles 1 introduction with recent advances in technology autonomous underwater vehicle auv is becoming more and more important in the exploration and exploitation of ocean resources auv can complete a variety of subsea tasks in civil and military fields such as ocean pollutant monitoring ramos et al 2001 mine hunting hagen et al 2003 marine biology exploration sagala and bambang 2011 pipeline following and inspection liu et al 2018 and anti submarine warfare etc the autonomy of auv is essential for it to operate in complex environments which has attracted wide attentions of researchers from all over the world in recent years higher requirements are put forward for the autonomy of auv to meet the future development of the ocean the path planning and obstacle avoidance is the core technology to realize the autonomy of auv and will determine the application prospect of auv the path planning of auv is considered as a series of translations and forward angle changes from the starting position to the destination according to certain optimization standards zeng et al 2016 when planning a path most of the time auv will operate in the environments full of obstacles there are many cases when the location and contour of static obstacles can be measured or obtained beforehand in these cases there is usually a global map about everything including obstacles before planning a path auv can use this information to find a collision free path between the starting point and the target point in advance with global path planning methods these global path planning methods can also be used in the barrier free environments while taking the path length energy consumption and current into account instead of obstacle avoidance in dynamic and uncertain underwater environments it is difficult or even impossible to obtain the information of various obstacles before path planning in this case there is usually planned path from a global path planner and auv still needs a local path planner to avoid these unknown and dynamic obstacles such as ships reefs and moving animals or fish etc therefore in this paper we divide the path planning methods of auv into two categories global path planning with known static obstacles and local path planning with unknown and dynamic obstacles as shown in fig 1 for global path planning of auv with known static obstacles researchers have proposed many commonly used methods such as a algorithm dechter and pearl 1985 genetic algorithm cobb and grefenstette 1993 particle swarm optimization eberhart and kennedy 1995 differential evolution storn and price 1997 and ant colony optimization dorigo et al 1991 with the increasing complexity and uncertainty of the environments the requirements for auv path planning are also becoming higher cai et al 2020 mac et al 2016 in this case the obstacles encountered by auv might be unknown and even dynamic taking dynamic constraints into account the rapidly exploring random trees algorithm is a suitable method proposed for local path planning in high dimensional unknown environments tan et al 2004 in addition the artificial potential field method khatib 1986 and fuzzy logic algorithm cordón et al 1996 can use airborne sensors to sense the surrounding environmental information in real time and deal with unknown static or dynamic obstacles in recent years based on the development in deep neural network some self learning methods like neural network hansen and salamon 1990 and reinforcement learning sutton and barto 1998 were introduced into the local path planning of auv deep reinforcement learning mnih et al 2015 a combination of deep neural network and reinforcement learning has also been proposed and applied in auv local path planning these self learning methods does not require any priori knowledge of the environments and can deal with the problem of real time dynamic path planning in addition their planning time can be greatly reduced after training because of recent advances in technology and new breakthroughs in the field of path planning for auv it is necessary to make a comprehensive survey on it though several surveys already exist zeng et al 2015 li et al 2018 a most recent survey by okereke et al 2020 only focused on machine learning path planning methods for auv in terms of underwater internet of things uiot the objective of this survey is to give an overview of work on path planning for auv and technical details of some representative algorithms and also to discuss some open problems to be solved in this area the focus of this article is put on these path planning algorithms that deal with constraints and characteristics of auv and the influence of marine environments it also provides an in depth discussion and comparison between different path planning algorithms the rest of this article starts with an introduction of the kinematic and dynamic model of auv in section 2 and an analysis of challenges and differences of path planning for auv compared to other mobile robots is also provided section 3 surveys and discusses global path planning algorithms in environments with known static obstacles section 4 describes and discusses local path planning methods with unknown and dynamic obstacles in section 5 we propose some potential future research directions that are worthy to investigate in this field finally section 6 concludes 2 modeling and analysis of auv in this section the kinematic and dynamic models of auv control are introduced which put many constraints and steering characteristics on auv this makes it challenging to implement path planning methods on auv and different from other robot platforms on land or in the air the models are based on fosson s comprehensive work fossen 2011 including general two dimensional and three dimensional kinematics transformation and in depth derivation of dynamics motion equations 2 1 kinematics kinematics is based on the geometric method to study the motion of vehicles without considering the influence of force and mass to describe the kinematic characteristics of auv we will apply the inertial north east down ned reference frame and the body frame fig 2 describes auv as a six degree of freedom dof vehicle with two rotational and translational velocity components in each dimension fossen 2011 as shown in fig 2 the body frame is attached to the vehicle and has its axes forward surge to starboard sway and towards the keel heave wiig 2019 the translation velocities along the x y and z directions are expressed as u v and w respectively and the rotation velocities are expressed as p q and r respectively the rotation angles of each axis are expressed as ϕ θ and ψ respectively and k m and n represent the moment in x y and z direction respectively vibhute 2018 the rotation matrix of 6 dof auv is composed of the basic rotation matrix of x y and z axes in the geometric analysis the basic rotation matrix of x y and z axes are 1 r x ϕ 1 0 0 0 c o s ϕ s i n ϕ 0 s i n ϕ c o s ϕ 2 r y θ c o s θ 0 s i n θ 0 1 0 s i n θ 0 c o s θ 3 r z ψ c o s ψ s i n ψ 0 s i n ψ c o s ψ 0 0 0 1 combining these principal rotations gives the rotation matrix r as 4 r r z ψ r y θ r x ϕ the relationship between the orientation and angular velocity is 5 j 1 s i n ϕ t a n θ c o s ϕ t a n θ 0 c o s ϕ s i n ϕ 0 s i n ϕ c o s θ c o s ϕ c o s θ hence the auv kinematics in 6 dof are 6 η r 0 3 3 h e l l o c h e c k t h e c o m m a n d 3 3 j ν in the formula the generalized velocity vector and position vector are respectively represented by the following matrix 7 η x y z ϕ θ ψ t 2 2 dynamics referring to the fossen 2011 maneuvering model the nonlinear equation of the dynamic motion for auv has the following general form 8 m ν c ν ν d ν g η b f where m denotes the inertia matrix c contains coriolis and centripetal terms and d indicates the hydrodynamic damping matrix vector g denotes a combination of gravity and buoyancy vector f is the control input variable of auv which is transformed into the force and moment of control motion by matrix b the control input vector is 9 f t u t q t r t where t u is the thrust force produced by rotating the propeller t q is the vertical motion control force generated by the left and right rudders t r is the horizontal motion control force generated by the upper and lower rudders assuming that the center of gravity x g y g z g and buoyancy of auv are rigid bodies at one point the 6 dof translational and rotational motions will be expressed as follows m u v r w q x g q 2 r 2 y g p q r z g p r q x t o t a l m v w p u r y g r 2 p 2 z g q r p x g q p r y t o t a l m w u q v p z g p 2 q

axial or transverse direction and x t o t a l y t o t a l z t o t a l and k t o t a l m t o t a l n t o t a l are the total external forces on each degree of freedom the above modeling of auv put some unique constraints in its motion control with path planning methods which makes it different from other mobile robots on the one hand as a highly nonlinear system auv is affected by the change of mass center buoyancy center and hydrodynamic coefficient xiang et al 2014 on the other hand auv has underactuated characteristics and parts of its speed cannot be directly controlled but can only be generated when the propeller and rudder angle are manipulated for example when auv rotates part of the forward speed will be converted into swing speed and the heave motion is controlled in a similar way in addition the collected sensory data will affect the performance of path planning methods for auv general mobile robots use the electromagnetic wave generated by laser sensor to navigate and avoid obstacles ye and borenstein 2002 and some of them use the camera biswas and veloso 2012 to obtain images directly to judge the position of obstacles however because auv works in the marine environment and it detects the surrounding obstacles according to the ultrasonic wave generated by sonar sensor kimball and rock 2008 data collected with sonar sensors will be interfered by underwater sound waves which will result in inaccurate information and low quality data received and largely affect the accuracy of obstacle avoidance for auv in addition auv path planning also needs to consider the influence of ocean currents moreover underwater tasks performed by auvs usually need to follow some specific path patterns for example when auv completes some unknown search and detection missions there is usually an algorithm to generate a coverage path in the task editor which requires auv to bypass unforeseen obstacles when executing this path mode bagnitckii et al 2017 in some situation multi auv also needs to follow a certain formation mode to improve the efficiency of the mission ding et al 2014 although these make it more challenging to implement general path planning methods for auv compared to other mobile robots many researchers have proposed effective path planning methods to overcome these challenges in sections 3 and 4 we will review most popular path planning methods for auv in terms of global path planning with known static obstacles and local path planning with unknown and dynamic obstacles 3 global path planning with known static obstacles in the environments of large pollution free area there are no obstacles in the workspace of auv in this case a global path planner without considerations of obstacle avoidance can be used and the path length is usually one of the key optimization objectives for auv path planning the objective of auv is to find the shortest path from the starting point to the designated position in accordance with its turning characteristics for example li 2019 proposed a 3d cubic bezier curve method to solve the problem that the distance between the bezier curve and last several targets is large this idea was shown to be able to enable auv to get the shortest path with good continuity in addition different from other robot platforms on land or in the air the battery life of auv is limited and auv cannot be re charged in time when performing underwater tasks therefore the energy consumption must be kept at the lowest level for auv path planning especially in the ocean environments with strong currents if the path planning direction of auv is consistent with the direction of currents the energy consumption would be greatly reduced therefore how to make rational use of ocean currents is a problem that many researchers pay attention to in barrier free environment yao et al 2018 proposed a path planning method with continuous direction for auv based on the edge search algorithm the proposed method does not fix the specific location of the next point and uses the current to reach the next point to the maximum extent which can reduce the energy consumption on the other hand most of the time auv will operate in the environments full of obstacles and there are many cases when the location and contour of static obstacles can be measured or obtained beforehand in these cases there is usually a global map about everything including obstacles before planning a path auv can use this information to find a collision free path between the starting point and the target point in advance with global path planning methods because the position of the static obstacle is fixed auv can use the environmental modeling method to get an understanding of the distribution and contour of the obstacles in advance the commonly used environmental modeling methods by auvs include grid method cao et al 2016 cell tree zhang and jia 2012 electronic chart sun and zhang 2012 etc the integrity of obstacle information in the model will determine the accuracy of static path planning in this static environment with known obstacles how to quickly and efficiently plan an optimal path is crucial to promote the development of auv compared with dynamic path planning for unknown and dynamic obstacle avoidance its advantage is that it can increase the possibility of finding the optimal path ralli and hirzinger 1997 in this section we will review popular global path planning methods for auv traveling in environments with known static obstacles these methods were also used by researchers for auv path planning in barrier free environments with more focus on the path length energy consumption and ocean current instead of obstacle avoidance 3 1 a algorithm a algorithm is the most effective direct search algorithm in the static environment it combines heuristic searching and searching based on the shortest path duchoň et al 2014 in the a algorithm the search area is generally divided into small squares with each square representing a node the a algorithm uses an evaluation function f n g n h n which provides guidances for the selection of nodes in an open list in the evaluation function g n is the actual cost of node n found so far from the initial node and the cost estimate h n is the manhattan distance from node n to the target node yao et al 2010 as shown in fig 3 the a algorithm calculates the f value of the surrounding nodes and selects the node with the smallest f value as the next traversal node until the target node is found due to the particularity of the marine environment carroll et al 1992 considered the maximum operation depth of auv and current information in the heuristic function when they used the a algorithm for path planning to shorten the search time szczerba et al 2000 proposed a sparse a algorithm using the maximum turning angle and the maximum path length as constraints for the basic a algorithm yan et al 2012a proposed an a algorithm based on circle search in their method a virtual terrain is used to map the 3d space into a 2d search area which can meet the constraints of the change rate of the auv s pitch angle and heading angle in addition the search step size and search direction of the algorithm are flexible so that auv can quickly get out of the threat and reach the destination based on a sparse a algorithm chen et al 2012 constructed the search space of obstacles by randomly distributing points and combined with a visibility inspection method under the constraint of maximum turning radius to make auv path smoother according to the anisotropy of the current flow yan et al 2012b expanded the sub nodes of a algorithm in a specific direction which simplifies the spatial range and greatly shortens the path planning time wang and pang 2019 applied the a search algorithm to a chemical plume tracking task with auv specifically they get the source location according to the partially observable markov decision process jiu et al 2019 and search the shortest path of chemical source with the a search algorithm to overcome defects of the traditional a algorithm li and zhang 2020 designed a multi directional a algorithm which reduced the number of search nodes to get the optimal path in summary a algorithm is usually modified to improve the expansion of heuristic function or sub node to better adapt to the application of auv path planning when the a algorithm searches for the next node it has to calculate and select the node with the smallest f value each time it is time consuming to calculate the f value of all nodes in the map especially for the search area with a large map this might make the speed of planning for a path very slow 3 2 genetic algorithm inspired by the natural selection and evolution the genetic algorithm is proposed and has been widely used to solve various optimization problems the genetic algorithm works by initializing the population randomly selecting the suitable individuals with a fitness function carrying on the selection crossover mutation genetic operations and constantly updating the population haupt and werner 2007 fig 4 shows one iterative process of the genetic algorithm through operating on the object directly the genetic algorithm can obtain and guide the search space automatically without defining rules restricted by genetic algorithm researchers usually modify the algorithm in terms of the genetic operator evaluation factor or individual selection of population to adapt to the characteristics of auv for example alvarez and caiti 2001 applied genetic algorithm to path planning of underwater vehicle in their method a new genetic operator is added to the algorithm to make it converge to the global minimum when there are different minimum values in the ocean flow field to complete the obstacle avoidance task under strong currents alvarez et al 2004 proposed an improved genetic algorithm in their method an iterative operator is added to change the initial population and a random migration operator is added to improve the mutation rate their results show that auv can obtain the path with minimum energy consumption zhang 2006 designed a hierarchical path planning method based on the genetic algorithm firstly the auv workspace is decomposed into obstacle region and free region by octree then the genetic algorithm is used to search the path of the free region according to the current information provided by electronic charts an adaptive function is established for genetic algorithm sun and zhang 2012 in their method the ocean current is used as an evaluation factor of the adaptive function in the algorithm which saves the energy consumption of auv li et al 2013 show that adding a node deletion operator and a smoothing operator into the genetic algorithm can get a better path in addition cao et al 2016 improved the initial population generation method of the genetic algorithm and designed tangential operators to greatly improve the convergence speed of auv path planning yan and pan 2019 proposed an improved genetic algorithm to solve the premature problem in the traditional genetic algorithm in their method the population entropy is used as the diversity evaluation standard and an adaptive method is used to adjust the probability in crossover and mutation in addition considering the kinematic characteristics of auv as shown in section 2 the individuals who are close to obstacles or do not conform to the actual attitude of auv are eliminated in the genetic algorithm the biggest advantage of genetic algorithm is that it does not need to know how to find the optimal solution before planning the genetic algorithm has been successfully applied to auv path planning in environments with known static obstacles however if the parameters of the algorithm were not adjusted properly some problems might happen e g individual peak value or the planning speed might be very slow 3 3 differential evolution similar to the genetic algorithm the differential evolutionary algorithm is also a global optimization algorithm consisting of mutation crossover and selection operation storn and price 1997 however different from the genetic algorithm the mutation vector in differential evolution is generated by the difference vector of the parent generation besides it intersects with the individual vector of the parent generation to generate a new individual vector and directly selects with the individual of the parent generation therefore the differential evolution algorithm is expected to be more effective than the genetic algorithm in path planning to improve the performance of differential evolution algorithm in auv application usually the cost function of the algorithm is modified in consideration of the kinematic constraints of the auv model shown in section 2 for example in order to adapt to the complex environments of auv path planning zhang et al 2014 proposed an adaptive differential evolutionary algorithm in their method the cost function with penalty method takes the curvature constraint caused by auv model path length and energy consumption into account which was used to adjust the algorithm s parameters adaptively according to the position and size of the obstacles li et al 2014a applied the differential evolution algorithm to the obstacle avoidance task of auv they first classified the obstacles and constructed an avoidance function with the differential evolution algorithm they verified the proposed method by conducting experiments with single and multiple obstacles on a simulation platform in addition mahmoud et al 2018 used a differential evolution algorithm to optimize the control points of b spline generation which enables auv to effectively deal with various obstacles in three dimensional space in their method the penalty method defined in the cost function takes into account the kinematic constraints of the auv on surge sway yaw and pitch components as well as the constraints on the depth maneuver in their experiments the auv path planning based on differential evolution algorithm can make full use of the expected current to deal with the unexpected current interference however the parent individuals generated by the algorithm are not optimized and the computational efficiency is low 3 4 particle swarm optimization particle swarm optimization is an evolutionary computing technique based on random population eberhart and kennedy 1995 which is derived from the study of birds foraging behavior when birds are looking for food they do not know the specific location of food but only know their current locations and the distance from food their search strategy is to find the bird closest to food and walk with it patle et al 2019 the flow chart of a particle swarm optimization algorithm is shown in fig 5 in fig 5 pbest is called the individual extremum which means the optimal solution found by a particle and gbest means the optimal solution in the whole particle swarm namely the global extremum the whole process of the particle swarm optimization algorithm is to use information of the current position x and velocity v of particles pbest and gbest to iterate until an optimal solution is found particle swarm optimization and its most important variant quantum particle swarm optimization sun et al 2004 have been widely applied in various path planning tasks of auv for example yang and zhang 2009 proposed an adapted inertia weight particle swarm optimization algorithm in which the update of each particle changes with the evolution of the population the proposed method considers the speed and direction of the current in the fitness function of the algorithm which not only completes the obstacle avoidance for auv but also enables auv to work in the presence of strong currents tang et al 2010 applied the particle swarm optimization algorithm to path planning of auv in 3d environments in their method the 3d space is sliced for dimension reduction and a path effective function is introduced to solve the critical point problem simulated experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in path planning for auv docking li et al 2019c proposed an adaptive quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm based on b spline function b spline function allows auv to obtain a smoother path by setting multiple internal control points since the attitude of auv is controlled by rudder and propeller the constraint of curvature radius caused by kinematics of auv is considered when the particle position is updated in their method in addition the algorithm uses the quantum behavior to update particles considers the travel time in the fitness function and adds a mutation operator which greatly improves the search performance to speed up the convergence wang et al 2020 proposed an improved quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm in their method the safety length and angle of the path are considered for constructing the fitness function and the cubic spline interpolation algorithm hou and andrews 1978 is used to smooth the path in addition since the translational velocity of auv is affected by the eddy flow field the component of flow velocity is considered in the wave swing and heave of auv lim et al 2020b proposed a particle swarm optimization algorithm with selective differential evolution for off line path planning of auv selecting the most suitable particle for differential evolution hybridization can greatly reduce the computation the proposed algorithm is simulated and tested in an environment with known obstacles and time invariant non uniform currents compared with other mobile robots the particle swarm optimization for auv path planning mainly modifies the adaptability function to resist the interference of current or changes the update process of particles to adapt to the underactuated auv particle swarm optimization has no crossover and mutation operation and only needs to adjust a few parameters in addition it has a memory function and can find the optimal path in a short time however due to the lack of dynamic regulation of particle velocity particle swarm optimization is easy to fall into local optimums 3 5 ant colony optimization similar to particle swarm optimization which is inspired by birds foraging behavior the ant colony algorithm is a heuristic optimization method proposed by simulating the foraging behavior of ant colony in nature the fundamental idea behind the ant colony algorithm is that it uses the behavior of a single ant to represent one feasible solution of the path optimization problem and the behavior of the entire ant colony constitutes the solution space of the problem the mechanism of the ant colony algorithm is shown in fig 6 to be specific ants can sense the chemicals released by groups called pheromones and show certain intelligent behaviors in the process of foraging fig 6 a in the presence of obstacles ants will randomly crawl to both sides of the path fig 6 b as time goes the pheromone concentrated on the short path is larger than that on the long path dorigo et al 1991 according to the intensity of pheromone they can be guided to bypass the obstacles and find the shortest path to food sources fig 6 c wang and wei 2009 improved the ant colony optimization algorithm and applied it to auv path planning specifically they defined the area covered or partially covered by obstacles as inaccessible region with the grid method in addition a cutting operator and insertion point operator are added to allow auv to find a smooth path around the inaccessible area quickly however the distance between auv and the obstacle might be very close which poses a great threat to the safety of the vehicle zhang and jia 2012 used the distance between auv and obstacles as heuristic information and added a penalty factor in the ant colony optimization algorithm to eliminate the path close to the obstacle their simulation results show that the proposed method may produce too large yaw angle which does not conform to the yaw characteristics of auv to avoid static obstacles in three dimensional space yang et al 2015 proposed an ant colony optimization algorithm based on pheromone elimination in their method the pheromone is divided into two parts attraction and repulsion so ants can explore first and then develop in the search path which can overcome the shortcoming of making auv fall into local extremum easily in traditional ant colony optimization algorithm in addition in their method the main running direction is determined when initializing the population and the maximum horizontal and vertical moving ranges of auv are limited to speed up the convergence dong and xu 2017 proposed an ant colony algorithm with a reinforcement idea from reinforcement learning sutton and barto 1998 specifically a positive reward will be given to safe paths and a negative reward will be given to collision paths during the training process yu et al 2018 proposed a c o a by combining the ant colony optimization aco algorithm with a search phanthong 2015 based on fine grained modeling a c o a takes the advantages of the a algorithm which uses admissible heuristic functions for pairwise path planning and the aco algorithm which establishes the target s marching order through coarse grained modeling based on the representative estimation strategy their experimental results show that auv can successfully pass through the area with dense obstacles to reduce invalid search ma et al 2018 introduced an alarm pheromone in the ant colony optimization algorithm when an ant reaches the infeasible area it releases alarm messages to alert the ants behind compared with other methods it can not only build a collision free path for auv but also can keep auv away from obstacles as far as possible to solve the limitation of single objective programming in the actual marine environment hu and zhang 2019 proposed an multi objective ant colony optimization strategy in their method the evaluation function for pheromone update is no longer determined by a single path length but also considers the impact of the current on energy consumption and the safety of auv their results in simulated experiments show that the algorithm can make auv reach the target point without collision under the constraint of multi target with regard to energy consumption which is an important factor for auv path planning ma et al 2020 applied the firework ant colony algorithm zhang et al 2018 to the path planning of auv the initial pheromones of the ant colony algorithm are derived from the initial reference path generated by the improved fireworks algorithm which can obtain the global optimal solution in a shorter time to allow auv to find an optimal path in complex seabeds che et al 2020 proposed the ant colony algorithm with particle swarm optimization the particle swarm optimization algorithm is introduced into the path length heuristic function to improve the pheromone update rules in addition considering the difficulty of auv in three dimensional space the proposed method limits the initialization range of individual population greatly improves the search efficiency and avoids a series of unnecessary pitching and heave compared with the traditional ant colony algorithm the optimized path in the simulation is greatly shortened the ant colony optimization algorithm can easily find an optimal path to the target point in environments with known static obstacles the searching efficiency can be greatly improved with distributed computing and positive feedback mechanism but the convergence might be very slow therefore the application of ant colony algorithm to auv path planning still needs further investigations 3 6 discussion table 1 shows advantages and disadvantages of global path planning methods with collision avoidance of known obstacles compared with other algorithms the a algorithm is the most direct heuristic search algorithm without any preprocessing operation however if the task is executed in a large scale environment a large number of nodes need to be calculated which results in a low searching efficiency according to the principle of survival of the fittest the genetic algorithm usually carries out a large number of evolutionary operations therefore it will occupy a large storage space and has more parameters to be adjusted resulting in a slow convergence speed the advantage of the genetic algorithm is that it has strong global search ability and can overcome the sub optimal solution problem of the a algorithm similar to the genetic algorithm a differential evolutionary algorithm also has genetic operators such as selective cross mutation which can be defined with different methods it is verified that the robustness of the differential evolutionary algorithm is superior to the genetic algorithm in a wide range of path planning applications the ant colony optimization algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm are bionic methods inspired upon the behavior mechanism of biological groups in nature they can adapt to the environment in a shorter time with the cooperation between individual organisms the most significant feature of the ant colony optimization algorithm is that it adopts a positive feedback mechanism which can promote the ants to move towards the direction with high pheromone concentration because the distribution of the initial pheromones is sparse it takes more time to search at the beginning which leads to a slow convergence in the later stage with the increase of pheromone concentration the convergence rate increases obviously different from the ant colony algorithm the particle swarm algorithm makes use of information shared among groups and has faster convergence speed in the initial stage meanwhile the particle swarm optimization algorithm has fewer parameters and certain memory functions which can greatly reduce the searching time however the lack of dynamic regulation of particle velocity makes it prone to convergence at local optimum 4 local path planning with unknown and dynamic obstacles in dynamic and uncertain underwater environments it is difficult or even impossible to obtain the information of various obstacles before path planning obviously unknown and dynamic obstacles will pose big safety issues for auvs to perform underwater tasks in this case there is usually a planned path from a global path planner and auv still needs a local path planner to avoid these unknown and dynamic obstacles in recent years many path planning methods have been proposed for unknown and dynamic obstacle avoidance like rapidly exploring random trees artificial potential field fuzzy logic algorithm neural network reinforcement learning and even deep reinforcement learning different form other robot platforms on land or in the air these methods mostly use sonar sensors nussbaum et al 1996 ghatak et al 2006 zou et al 2007 to obtain the real time distances and angles of surrounding obstacles and use local dynamic path planning technology to complete obstacle avoidance tasks which greatly improves the autonomy of auv 4 1 rapidly exploring random trees rrt the fundamental idea behind the rrt algorithm is to scatter some points randomly in the search space and then connect them into a motion path for robot via calculation the mechanism of a basic rrt algorithm is shown in fig 7 in fig 7 x i n i t is the starting node and x r a n d is the target node through collision detection of random sampling points in the state space the nearest x n e a r node to the target node can be found which extends the x n e w node to the open undetected area the rrt algorithm considers both the algebraic constraints caused by obstacles and the differential constraints caused by dynamics of auv in section 2 tan et al 2004 and can effectively find a collision free path from the starting node to the target node tan et al 2005 combined rrt with a hybrid modeling technique maneuver automaton ma to capture the key dynamics of a nonlinear autonomous underwater vehicle auv such as rudder deflection and rudder rate in the path planning with obstacles their proposed rrt algorithm increases the generation of sub nodes which allows auv to complete the task safely with greater probability to reduce unnecessary space exploration hernández et al 2011 proposed the homotopy rapidly exploring random trees hrrt algorithm hrrt can prevent the tree from growing out of the space region of homotopy class and allow auv to move towards the target point in different ways while avoiding obstacles hernández et al 2015 applied the transition rapidly exploring random trees jaillet et al 2010 algorithm to auv path planning in their method the distance between seabed and auv is considered in the costmap of rrt algorithm their experimental results show that auv can complete corresponding underwater exploration tasks near the seabed li et al 2017 proposed a liveness based rrt li rrt by adding a liveness index to describe the effectiveness of each node in the tree in li rrt a collision detection index collision degree offspring collision and adjacent collision that will greatly affect the expansion ability are also defined their numerical simulation experimental results show that auv can avoid collision with the coast in underwater environments yu et al 2017 proposed a smooth rrt algorithm for auv motion planning in accordance with the steering characteristics of auv compared with the classical rrt a convergence factor and angle factor are introduced which can reduce the generation of unnecessary nodes in addition the hydrodynamic angle is considered when auv calculates the motion angle and the greedy strategy is used to make the path smoother simulated experimental results show that auv can reduce the number of turns in presence of many obstacles taheri et al 2019 proposed a closed loop rapidly exploring random tree cl rrt algorithm to solve the kinematic constraints caused by obstacles and the characteristics of auv in cl rrt three fuzzy proportional derivative controllers and auv models in section 2 were used to evaluate whether the range and vertices of the search tree satisfy the nonholonomic dynamic constraints of auv it was verified on xpc target generator that cl rrt could find collision free paths in 3d space with clutter obstacles but the experiment did not involve an actual auv r r t is one of the sampling based algorithms proposed in recent years karaman and frazzoli 2011 it not only ensures the probability completeness but also solves the problem that the rrt algorithm might get a suboptimal solution in addition r r t changes the expansion mode of nodes and selects the node with the lowest cost in the extended domain as the parent node with a cost function fu et al 2019 improved the r r t algorithm using heuristic ellipsoid subset sampling for centralized search their experimental results with terrain obstacles and floating objects show that auv can approach the optimal path faster 4 2 artificial potential field artificial potential field is a real time path planning method proposed by khatib 1986 through the establishment of virtual potential field the robot can approach the target point and avoid collision with obstacles the force analysis of the artificial potential field algorithm is shown in fig 8 in which f a represents the attraction force of the target point to the robot and f r represents the repulsion force generated by the obstacle the direction of resultant force f is obtained via vector operation of forces to guide the robot moving towards the target point due to the advantages of low cost simple mathematical calculation and convenient real time observation artificial potential field has been widely used in path planning of autonomous mobile robot cao et al 2006 however if the resultant force is zero the robot cannot find the path or carry out a closed loop motion to solve this problem and make it suitable for auv path planning ding et al 2005 introduced a third virtual force in the artificial potential field algorithm with this modification when encountering concave obstacles which are situations that auvs need to confront in the marine environment auv can move along the boundary of the obstacle and start the dynamic recognition range to prevent forgetting obstacles saravanakumar and asokan 2013 put forward a multi point potential field method which discretizes the surface of the obstacle facing the auv head into multiple points by analyzing the force acting on multiple points and obstacles the underwater vehicle is guided to the point where the total potential energy is minimum the proposed method is tested in a 3d simulation environment and experimental results show it can effectively avoid dynamic and static obstacles in addition they emphasize that the proposed multi point potential field method is more suitable for the 6 dof auvs working in 3d space and is not meant for autonomous ground vehicles agvs operating in 3d terrain cheng et al 2015 proposed an artificial potential field method in consideration of both the current and dynamic obstacles this method combines the current and the speed of the auv to resist the adverse effect of the current on the auv navigation then the direction of auv s velocity can be accurately determined with the relationship between repulsion force and gravity their results show it can overcome influence of the current and avoid collision with dynamic obstacles villar et al 2016 proposed an artificial potential field method for obstacle avoidance of auv with a mechanical scanning sonar specifically different attraction and repulsion constants are used in the potential function to create an optimal path and virtual obstacles are also introduced to solve the local minimum problem in a target search task ge et al 2018 proposed an improved potential field method for multi auv obstacle avoidance in their method the dispersion degree the homodromous degree and district difference degree are considered in the potential field function which can allow auvs to complete the search task accurately and avoid falling into local traps noguchi and maki 2019 proposed a path planning method based on artificial potential field algorithm and reinforcement learning rummery and niranjan 1994 because the environmental information obtained by sensors is limited and fuzzy binary bayes filter thrun 2002 is used to estimate the occupancy probability of obstacles in the workspace of auv experiments show that this method can generate a safe path without contact with obstacles khalaji and tourajizadeh 2020 extracted the kinematics and dynamics model of auv in section 2 then based on lyapunov theory lefeber et al 2003 a new nonlinear controller is proposed which uses the potential field algorithm to avoid local stationary or moving obstacles in addition an adjustable avoidance gain is added to the potential function and the simulation results show that auv can bypass the obstacle with the minimum deviation from the reference trajectory fan et al 2020 proposed an improved artificial potential field method for real time path planning of auv in their method a distance correction factor is added to the exclusion function to solve the local minimum problem and the relative velocity method is introduced to detect and avoid dynamic obstacles considering the potential obstacles and forbidden areas in the monitoring system of the underwater internet of things lin et al 2020 proposed a joint control model for multiple auvs based on the artificial potential field algorithm in their method the software defined networking lin et al 2018 paradigm is used to improve the flexibility and controllability of group based auv in addition each auv in the system not only pays attention to the influence of the surrounding obstacles but also takes dynamics of all auvs into account the simulated experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively manage the path planning for all auvs the artificial potential field method has great advantages in avoiding unknown obstacles however the local minimum problem should be considered to avoid the instability of auv caused by limited force which might bring more loss to the equipment or environment 4 3 fuzzy logic algorithm the fuzzy logic algorithm represents a nonlinear mapping from the state space to the control space cordón et al 1996 which is usually defined according to the expert s knowledge fig 9 shows the basic principle of the fuzzy logic algorithm applied to an auv platform as shown in fig 9 information detected from sensors is first processed by fuzzifer then fuzzy rules defined according to experts experience will be used for fuzzy inference and decision making the result of reasoning is defuzzified to control the movement of auv for obstacle avoidance with a fuzzy logic algorithm sensory information between auv and surrounding obstacles is usually taken as input of the fuzzy controller and new driving instructions are outputted for auv khanmohammadi et al 2007 applied a robust fuzzy controller to the obstacle avoidance of auv the forward looking sonar obtains the angle velocity and distance of the obstacle as the input of the controller and the two outputs of the controller are the change of the angle of attack of the two rods and the change of the propeller speed their simulation results show that the fuzzy controller can effectively avoid moving obstacles to overcome the limitations of the controllable degree of freedom of underactuated underwater vehicles xu and feng 2009 integrated a fuzzy logic controller into the finite state automata to realize the intelligent transformation of horizontal and vertical obstacle avoidance behaviors in addition considering that the two rudders are controlled to a large angle at the same time and auv may be out of control the emergency yaw and emergency ascent are set in the horizontal plane and vertical plane respectively the fuzzy logic algorithm does not work well when auvs confront a strong sea flow therefore yang et al 2009 used q learning watkins and dayan 1992 to adjust the peak value of fuzzy membership function against current behavior their experimental results show that auv can successfully avoid obstacles and its trajectory is unaffected by ocean currents abbasi et al 2010 used line of sight guidance to make auv move towards the target by considering the experience of experts and taking the velocity of moving obstacles as one of the inputs to the fuzzy controller auv can generate left or right turn when encountering obstacles their method enables the auv to bypass fixed or moving obstacles and reach the target effectively to improve the intelligence of decision making for auv obstacle avoidance yang and zhu 2011 added an acceleration braking module in the fuzzy reasoning process fang et al 2015 obtained the corresponding hydrodynamic coefficients of auv through the planar motion mechanism as the important data input of the fuzzy control and used the bk bandler and kohout 1980 triangular sub product of the fuzzy relations to determine the turning angle of auv when the obstacle exists this self tuning fuzzy control system was tested to be able to avoid obstacles in the horizontal plane to solve the problem that the boundary design of fuzzy logic in path planning relies heavily on expert experience sun et al 2018b used quantum behaved particle swarm optimization sun et al 2016 to optimize the membership function value of fuzzy logic in addition sonars are set in the horizontal plane and vertical plane respectively and the virtual acceleration and velocity of auv in 3d space can be obtained using the fuzzy system of acceleration or deceleration module their results show that auv with their proposed method can automatically avoid dynamic obstacles because the speed of moving obstacles in real environments is difficult to obtain li et al 2019b take changes of the distance between auv and obstacles as additional input to the fuzzy membership function their results show that when the obstacle moves rapidly the proposed method is obviously better than the traditional fuzzy logic algorithm the biggest advantage of the fuzzy logic algorithm is that it does not need accurate mathematical models and the operation principle is essentially similar to human cognition many researchers have achieved good results in obstacle avoidance of auv using the fuzzy logic algorithm however the definition of fuzzy rules relies heavily on the expert s experience and cannot adapt to the environment in complex and uncertain underwater environments the construction of fuzzy rule base would be difficult or even impossible 4 4 neural network neural network is proposed for exploring the law of intelligent activities by simulating human brains the traditional neural network for path planning takes the data collected by sensors as the input after training the output drives the action for obstacle avoidance of auv duan et al 2001 used a fuzzy neural network for real time auv obstacle avoidance in addition li and guo 2012 designed a dynamic neural network which was tested to be able to bypass the uneven obstacles and reach the target position in 3d spaces however data for training a traditional neural network has to be collected beforehand therefore yang and meng 2003 proposed a bio inspired neural network which does not need any training process in bio inspired neural network the dynamic characteristics of neurons are expressed by a shunt equation derived from the uniform diaphragm model of the biological neural system hodgkin and huxley 1952 fig 10 shows the structure of a 2d bio inspired neural network in fig 10 each black circle represents a neuron each neuron interacts with eight adjacent neurons to generate a real time path according to the dynamic activity diagram of the neural network because of the high self adaptability bio inspired neural network is more widely used in the real time path planning of auv an improved bionic neural network based on yan and zhu 2011 is used for auv full coverage path planning when encountering moving obstacles the activity of neural network will receive a great inhibition prompting auv to adjust its direction guerrero gonzález et al 2011 used the self organizing neural network to generate the transformation between the spatial coordinates and the speed coordinates of auv propeller and proposed a bio inspired neural network based on animal learning for obstacle avoidance of auv the proposed method can drive auv to rotate a certain angle according to the activation of the neural network nodes in unknown dynamic environment zhu et al 2014 applied the bio inspired neural network and map planning method to auv path planning specifically considering the uncertainty of the ultrasonic sensor in underwater measurement ultrasonic sensory information is fused into a grid map to deal with dynamic obstacles using dempster shafer pagac et al 1998 information rule ni et al 2017 proposed an improved dynamic bio inspired neural network for auv path planning the network changes dynamically according to the detection range of sensors and introduces virtual targets into the environment their experiments show that it can solve the complex calculation problem of auv in a very large 3d environment and the problem that the target direction cannot be found when the size of the obstacle is larger than the detection range of the sensor considering that the distance between obstacles and auv should not be too close cao and peng 2018 proposed a potential field bio inspired neural network in the proposed method a repulsive potential field is used to enlarge the obstacle and an attractive potential field is introduced to optimize the path which can effectively keep auv away from the obstacle in addition a leader follower biological inspired neural network was also proposed for multi auv obstacle avoidance by ding et al 2014 specifically the velocity and trajectory of a virtual auv is obtained using the position of the leading auv then the kinematics auv formation control law is designed by backstepping kwan and lewis 2000 once obstacles are detected the main auv will change the formation into a straight line to pass through the obstacle area with a bio inspired neural network moreover wu et al 2018 added a lateral inhibition effect of obstacles into the bionic neural network which is effective for solving various collision avoidance problems of a single auv as well as multi auv in dynamic environments sun et al 2018a applied the glasius bio inspired neural network to multiple auvs coverage path planning glasius bionic neural network used difference equations to calculate the activity value of neurons which can improve the self adaptability of the algorithm and greatly reduce the path planning time of auvs 4 5 reinforcement learning reinforcement learning allows an agent to learn how to perform a task by interacting with environment via trial and error sutton and barto 1998 for obstacle avoidance of auv with reinforcement learning auv first detects the surrounding information e g information of obstacles as its current state estimation s t and performs an action a t which will transition the state s t of the environment to a next state then auv will get a reward signal r t from the environment which will be used to update its policy the objective of auv is to learn an optimal policy which will select actions maximizing the expected cumulative reward fig 11 illustrates the mechanism of an auv path planning with reinforcement learning the introduction of reinforcement learning into obstacle avoidance of auv enables it to learn through its own experience and gradually adapt to the environment without knowing the complete prior knowledge or even the prior knowledge at all kawano and ura 2002b proposed a path planning algorithm combining q learning watkins and dayan 1992 a teaching method and bayesian network for non holonomic auv the teaching method includes intensive teaching of suggestions for auv choosing actions and global teaching of keeping a distance from the target point in the whole learning process learning experience is stored in a bayesian network which enables auv to deal with obstacles of any shape in addition the error caused by the coupling of current and the yaw motion is taken as the input and the continuous iterative learning is used to better resist the current however because of the influence of non markovian effect the proposed method is slow to converge therefore they further proposed a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach in which the high level is composed of a motion planning module considering the position of auv and the low level refers to the speed of auv to stabilize the yaw motion kawano and ura 2002a as a result the learning speed of the algorithm is shown to be significantly improved in consideration of the high risk of trial and error chen et al 2009 proposed to use neural network and case based q learning greenwald et al 2003 for auv path planning the neural network with multi layer error feedback has a strong approximation ability which can improve the generalization of q learning and case based q learning was used to guarantee the convergence with information provided by a multi beam forward sonar the proposed method was shown to be able to enable auv to find an optimal path among multiple obstacles in the real time obstacle avoidance of small auvs a single beam sonar is used to measure information of obstacles in turn and the steering action is selected based on a reinforcement learning method huang et al 2014 when auv approaches an obstacle it gains a negative enhancement and when auv moves away from the obstacle it receives a positive reward the simulation results show that auv can safely avoid the obstacles in the range of 90 degree open angle by learning to control the change of propeller and course of auv in the presence of dynamic obstacles gore et al 2019 show that by allowing auv to obtain state information within a markov decision process it can learn to take corresponding actions to obtain the path with minimum deviation from obstacles noguchi and maki 2019 applied sarsa λ to path planning of auv and they show that it can find collision free paths to capture sea urchins in complex environments in their method considering the limitation and fuzziness of the information obtained with sonar sensors the map based on occupancy probability is used to obtain the state information of auv in addition bhopale et al 2019 proposed a modified q learning algorithm based on back propagation neural network to deal with unknown obstacles in the environment the proposed method overcomes the problem of dimensional disaster and introduces a factor b ˆ to balance exploration and exploitation for example when obstacles are detected b ˆ is set to be 1 for pure exploitation compared with standard q learning the probability of collision between auv and obstacles is reduced based on hierarchical reinforcement learning sun et al 2020 designed hierarchical deep q network for auv path planning the obstacle avoidance and the target approaching are set as two subtasks to obtain different selection strategies in addition the combination of hierarchical deep q network and priority experience replay improves the learning efficiency of auv moreover cao et al 2020 proposed a potential field hierarchical reinforcement learning approach to improve the cooperation efficiency of multi auv in a target searching task in their method the multi agent cooperative maxq algorithm was used for hierarchical reinforcement learning hrl cheng et al 2007 li et al 2010 shen et al 2006 and a potential field was used to automatically adjust parameters of hrl the proposed method was shown to be able to enable multi auv to successfully bypass the dynamic and static obstacles and find the nearest target point to each auv in simulated experiments compared with other mobile robots when applying reinforcement learning to auv path planning it usually uses the output of the learning algorithm to select actions from the action space and directly control the rudder elevator and propeller of auv when the current exists in the environment the reinforcement learning algorithm will take the current as one of the state inputs and use continuous iterative learning to better deal with the current reinforcement learning has proven to be able to facilitate auv to complete target search and navigation in environments with unknown obstacles though mostly in simulations however how to learn to find an optimal policy in tasks with large state space and apply to a physical auv platform still remain to be a huge challenge 4 6 deep reinforcement learning deep reinforcement learning drl combines the perception of deep learning with the decision making of reinforcement learning the advantage of drl is that it can use deep learning e g a deep neural network to automatically learn low dimensional state characteristics of high dimensional states by reducing dimensions through iterative interaction with the environment it solves the limitations of reinforcement learning caused by large state and action space arulkumaran et al 2017 deep reinforcement learning has opened up a new way to solve the problem of learning from the complex nonlinear high dimensional sensory input in unknown environments drl has been widely used in obstacle avoidance of surface unmanned aerial singla et al 2019 yan et al 2019 and more and more researchers have started trying to apply it to auv path planning for example in a target search task cao et al 2019 applied the asynchronous advantages actor critic a3c method mnih et al 2016 to obstacle avoidance of auv in their method an a3c network structure was used in which each thread independently interacts with the environment the learning results of all threads were collected into a global actor critic pair and combined with a dual stream q network simonyan and zisserman 2014 the network structure is composed of multiple convolution layers and long term and long short term memory hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the input information goes through otsu method gupta et al 2018 disk shaped structural closing operation disk shaped structural coordinate system transformation and rasterization to remove the noise points of the original sonar image their simulated experiments show that auv with a3c can effectively avoid obstacles in various environments and complete the target search task efficiently in addition wu et al 2019 proposed an end to end auv motion control framework based on the proximal policy optimization algorithm schulman et al 2017 which takes the original sonar sensory information as the input directly and does not need to consider the dynamic characteristics of auv in their experiments the reward function takes multiple objectives such as waypoint tracking obstacle avoidance collision penalty and speed as constraints making the algorithm more suitable for auv path planning in underwater dangerous environments full of obstacles in addition in order to avoid the difficulty and noise of underwater positioning they proposed a new state encoder and reward shaping strategy which can realize learning without knowing the position of auv their results in detailed comparative experiments show that auv can complete the obstacle avoidance task in a 2d environment moreover hou et al 2020 designed a path planning algorithm based on deterministic policy gradient heess et al 2015 according to the nonlinear characteristics of auv it is not abstracted as a point and two suitable neural network approximators are developed to control the propeller power and rudder position of auv the reward function takes the distance of obstacles obtained by a sonar array and the difference between the current distance distance from current position to target point and previous distance distance from previous position to target point into account their simulation results show that auv can plan a collision free path in unknown continuous environment with deep reinforcement learning havenstrøm et al 2021 directly used 2d sonar images as one of the state inputs and the output of the system is processed by the low pass filter to act on the control fin for completing the path tracking and obstacle avoidance tasks at the same time in their method the idea of course learning is introduced by constructing different levels of scenes from no obstacles to the introduction of obstacles and currents in addition a quadratic penalty reward function is designed to analyze the proportion of path tracking and obstacle avoidance in detail they verified the effectiveness of their method on a 3d simulation platform although deep reinforcement learning has achieved good performance for auv path planning problems such as sample inefficiency still prevent it from being applied to auv in the complex real world 4 7 other algorithms besides the above popular methods there are also literatures about the application of some other algorithms to auv path planning for instance he and zhou 2010 proposed that the whole working space of auv should be divided dynamically for large scale environments and the fast marching algorithm sethian 1999 can be used to find a collision free path wang et al 2013 proposed a vector polar histogram method for auv obstacle avoidance which can determine an optimal movement direction for auv when its sensor detects the presence of multiple obstacles sun and zhu 2016 used the d lite algorithm koenig and likhachev 2005 to repeatedly confirm whether the path distance from the current point to the target point is the shortest besides it can also quickly replan the path of auv when a moving obstacle is detected braginsky and guterman 2016 designed an obstacle avoidance method for auv considering both horizontal and vertical directions in the horizontal direction a two layer obstacle avoidance algorithm is adopted which includes a pre planning method based on the bk product of fuzzy relations bui and kim 2006 and a reactive obstacle avoidance algorithm based on the potential field and edge detection algorithm borenstein and koren 1991 when the obstacle fills the entire field of view of the sonar it can stimulate the reactive vertical travel in addition wang et al 2016 proposed a rolling window optimization algorithm to avoid unknown obstacles yan et al 2018a used the largest polar angle algorithm to generate obstacle avoidance contours for irregular obstacles moreover liu et al 2019 proposed a learning fixed height histogram method based on estimation of distribution algorithm larranaga and lozano 2001 to complete path planning in dynamic environments in the proposed method a plan window which can dynamically change its size is introduced to deal with moving obstacles 4 8 discussion table 2 compares advantages and disadvantages of above surveyed popular methods for local path planning with unknown and or dynamic obstacles among them the rrt algorithm is based on probability sampling which can consider algebraic constraints caused by obstacles and differential constraints caused by dynamics of auv at the same time through random sampling of points the search space of rrt can be easily extended to the unexplored area which is very suitable for solving path planning problems in high dimensional space therefore the rrt algorithm has a strong exploration ability in environments with unknown obstacles though its real time performance is not too high compared with other methods artificial potential field is simple in structure and easy to be implemented for auv control at the bottom layer and it plays an important role in real time obstacle avoidance for auv however artificial potential field does not consider the constraints of dynamics of auv and the obstacle size when multiple obstacles are close to each other auv with artificial potential field may fail to find the direction to travel and easily fall into the local minimum point the fuzzy logic algorithm has strong robustness in dealing with practical problems and has been widely used in auv to avoid unknown and dynamic obstacles it does not need an accurate mathematical model and is suitable for solving highly complex and nonlinear problems however the formulations of fuzzy rules and membership degree in the fuzzy logic algorithm rely heavily on experts knowledge which cannot be changed once it is determined therefore in unknown and uncertain environments the fuzzy logic algorithm might not work well since no prior knowledge can be obtained on the other hand neural network can store empirical knowledge and deal with nonlinear mapping problems by learning autonomously with simple rules however traditional neural networks need to collect samples before learning which is a very time consuming process and might be difficult or even impossible in many situations for auv path planning bio inspired neural network was proposed to solve this problem it does not need any pre training process and is very suitable to deal with unknown dynamic environments bio inspired neural network still has the shortcoming that it cannot explain the reasoning basis for the output reinforcement learning rl has strong decision making ability and auv with reinforcement learning can plan an optimal path without any prior knowledge moreover rl shows strong adaptability and flexibility in complex and uncertain environments however hand crafted features need to be used for state representation in rl in addition dimension disaster prevents auv from planning a path efficiently in high dimensional environments and reward delay results in a slow speed of convergence for auv path planning with rl deep reinforcement learning drl does not require manual features for state representation but learn the features automatically it implements an end to end learning from raw sensory input data to auv s actions which allows auv to learn to plan an optimal path in high dimensional and complex environments however usually millions of samples are needed for auv with drl to learn to plan an optimal path which prevents it from applying to real auv platforms 5 outlook and future directions path planning has been an important research branch for improving the autonomy of auv and attracted lots of attentions from worldwide researchers for the last decades though many path planning algorithms have been proposed and implemented on auv there are still many potential problems for auv path planning remaining to be further explored especially in consideration of the characteristics and constraints of auv and its working environment 5 1 path planning for real auv platform any collision may cause serious and irreparable damage to auv in complex underwater environment although many of the above surveyed methods have been shown to be able to plan a collision free path in simulations only a few of them can work well on physical auv platform in real marine environments for example guerrero gonzález et al 2011 tested a bionic neural network for auv obstacle avoidance in the shallow water area of mar menor lagoon their experimental results show that when approaching obstacles such as other ships on the water surface the conditioning circuit chang and gaudiano 1998 grossberg and levine 1987 of the neural network can drive auv to change its direction and effectively guide it to move between obstacles in addition hernández et al 2011 used sparus auv to test the performance of the hrrt algorithm for obstacle avoidance in the underwater robotics lab of the university of girona obstacles of different shapes are made with insulating board and placed in the water with a depth of 3 m the results show that the hrrt algorithm can generate a path in less than 100 ms which meets certain real time requirement but cannot guide auv to move along the generated path autonomously fan et al 2020 used the underwater robot named intelligence ocean i to verify the effectiveness of an improved artificial potential field method in their method a distance correction factor is added to the exclusion function to solve the problem of local minimum and relative speed method is introduced for dynamic obstacle detection and avoidance however obstacle avoidance in 3d environments are not considered in their experiments on the other hand multi auv cooperation can not only improve the efficiency of performing underwater tasks but also present more intelligent behaviors compared to a single auv li et al 2014b the task distribution li and zhang 2017 collaborative search ge et al 2018 formation control yuan et al 2017 and other aspects of multiple auvs have achieved good results though most of them are also only tested on simulation platforms wu et al 2018 cao et al 2020 for path planning of multi auv in real environment it is more challenging because it needs to take other auvs into account more importantly the communication between auvs is limited and usually only underwater acoustic communication can be used for multi auv cooperation compared to other robotic platforms on land or in the air cao et al 2019 carried out multi auv target search experiments with deep reinforcement learning model for obstacle avoidance in a pool of 10 m 20 m in their experiments a remote controlled submersible was placed in the pool as an obstacle their results show that two auvs completed the collision free search to the target point with the pre trained deep reinforcement learning model achieving similar performance to the simulation experiments however due to the lacking of underwater acoustic communication for multi auv the experiments are only carried out on the surface of the pool with wifi wireless communication data acquisition methods of wireless sensor networks based on mobile sink mehto et al 2020 might be useful to overcome the limitation of acoustic communication for multi auv communication since auv is a relatively resource poor device which is similar to mobile sink 5 2 path planning in uncertain environments for local path planning the fuzzy logic algorithm does not need accurate mathematical models and have been tested to be able to achieve good results however the fuzzy rules are usually defined based on the expert s experience and cannot adapt to the environment in complex uncertain underwater environment there is no prior knowledge available and the construction of fuzzy rules would be difficult or even impossible the path planning of auv with reinforcement learning rl can plan an optimal path by interaction with the environment without any prior knowledge therefore auv with reinforcement learning can adapt flexibly and work well in complex and uncertain environments auv with deep reinforcement learning drl can even learn in high dimensional and complex environments from raw sensory input data in an end to end way however rl and drl is sample inefficient and slow to converge because of the scarce reward signals goecks et al 2020 it is difficult or even unpractical to design an efficient reward function for each task which makes applying traditional rl and drl methods directly to path planning of physical auvs a great challenge riedmiller et al 2018 nevertheless sampling in a simulated environment is faster cheaper and safer than learning directly in the real world but using the policy trained in simulation directly in the real auv is difficult and risky since there is a gap between simulation and reality kober and peters 2014 many sim to real algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem such as domain adaption tzeng et al 2015 inverse dynamics model christiano et al 2016 domain randomization tobin et al 2017 and progressive network shojania and li 2007 etc but there seems no work on path planning of auv in terms of this prospect yet zhao et al 2020 on the other hand some researchers proposed to leverage human s knowledge to speed up auv s learning e g by allowing a human trainer to provide demonstrations evaluative feedback li et al 2019a etc for example chu et al 2020 proposed a deep imitation reinforcement learning dirl for motion control of the unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs dirl combines imitation learning from expert demonstrations and used the learned policy to initialize the td3 algorithm fujimoto et al 2018 in addition zhang et al 2020 proposed deep interactive reinforcement learning for auv path tracking task by allowing a human trainer to transfer her knowledge via delivering evaluative feedback over the quality of auv s actions therefore how to make full use of human experience and knowledge to improve auv path planning would be an interesting research direction 5 3 combination of different path planning algorithms the above surveyed path planning methods all have their own advantages and disadvantages in specific application scenarios it would be immensely useful to combine multiple path planning algorithms which can complement each other and better deal with unknown dynamic obstacles and complex situations for instance the combination of fuzzy logic algorithm and reinforcement learning can improve the control accuracy of the system in strong current yang et al 2009 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system and particle swarm optimization algorithm can be used together to generate feasible path in environments full of moving targets yan et al 2018b quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm with selective differential evolution can significantly shorten the time to generate the best path lim et al 2020a in addition yao and zhao 2018 used the improved genetic algorithm combined with the gray wolf optimization algorithm mirjalili et al 2014 to optimize the improved interfered fluid dynamical yao et al 2015 coefficient and verified that the combination of path planning algorithm and some mathematical methods can better deal with dynamic obstacles 6 conclusion in this article we have surveyed most recent work on path planning and obstacle avoidance for auv we introduced the kinematic and dynamic model of auv and give an overview of work on path planning for auv and technical details of some representative algorithms that deal with constraints and characteristics of auv and the influence of marine environments we also provide an in depth discussion and comparison between different path planning algorithms and propose some potential future research directions that are worthy to investigate in this field path planning methods of auv are mainly divided into two categories global path planning with known static obstacles and local path planning with unknown and dynamic obstacles when there is a global map about everything including obstacles before planning a path e g the location and contour of static obstacles can be measured or obtained beforehand auv can use this information to find a collision free path between the starting point and the target point in advance with global path planning methods global path planning for auv mainly includes a algorithm genetic algorithm differential evolution algorithm particle swarm optimization algorithm and ant colony optimization algorithm a algorithm is suitable for working in a simple and small scale marine environment since a large number of nodes need to be calculated in large scale environments resulting in a low searching efficiency auv path planning with genetic algorithm needs to have a large storage space and powerful computing system since a large number of evolutionary operations to be carried out and more parameters to be updated the differential evolutionary algorithm is similar to the genetic algorithm and is verified to be more robust than the genetic algorithm in a wide range of auv path planning applications the ant colony optimization algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm can adapt to the environment in a shorter time the particle swarm optimization algorithm has fewer parameters and certain memory functions greatly reducing the searching time in dynamic and uncertain underwater environments local path planning methods are needed to avoid unknown and dynamic obstacles by obtaining the local environmental information with sensors in real time on top of a planned path from a global path planner common local path planning methods include rrt artificial potential field fuzzy logic algorithm neural network reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning etc the rrt algorithm can be easily extended to the unexplored area which is very suitable for solving path planning problems in high dimensional space however the real time performance of rrt is not too high compared with other methods artificial potential field plays an important role in real time obstacle avoidance for auv however when the distance between two obstacles is too close or there are obstacles near the target point it may fail to find the direction to travel and easily fall into the local minimum point since it does not consider the constraints of dynamics of auv and the obstacle size the fuzzy logic algorithm was shown to be robust in dealing with practical problems and has been widely used in auv to avoid unknown and dynamic obstacles it does not need an accurate mathematical model and is suitable for solving highly complex and nonlinear problems however fuzzy logic algorithm requires human experts to be fully familiar with the operation mechanism of auv and establish an appropriate rule base and might not work well in unknown and uncertain environments auv path planning with neural network can store empirical knowledge and deal with nonlinear mapping problems by learning autonomously with simple rules traditional neural networks need to collect samples before learning which is a very time consuming process and might be difficult or even impossible in many situations for auv path planning bio inspired neural network does not need any pre training process and is very suitable to deal with unknown dynamic environments auv with reinforcement learning rl can plan an optimal path without any prior knowledge and work well in complex and fully uncertain environments deep reinforcement learning drl further implements an end to end learning to map the original sonar image to the action of auv which allows auv to learn to plan an optimal path in high dimensional and uncertain marine environments rl and drl can make use of samples in simulation and human knowledge to solve the sample inefficiency problem for applying to actual auv

method for the estimation of the swh having an rmse 0 23 m for swh 3 m which is the region of interest for offshore wind energy applications the methodology enables information on the spatial distribution of wave height in very high resolution to be obtained sea state resolved from the satellite data using the artificial neural network shows that windfarm infrastructure directly influences wave propagation the overall variance of significant wave height throughout a wind farm was calculated providing information on regions of interest with considerably different wave heights as compared to the nearest wave buoy the new model will help towards improved downscaling of general sea state forecasts locating hotspots of different wave height properties and correct prioritization of maintenance jobs to perform in wind turbines keywords offshore renewable energy machine learning artificial neural networks wave forecasting synthetic aperture radar remote sensing 1 introduction state of the art development and use of renewable energy resources are key to reducing co2 emissions and consequently the effects of climate change and improving the quality of the environment ipcc 2011 for this reason the european union established a set of rules and targets through the revised renewable energy directive in 2016 requiring that 27 of energy mix the combination of different energy sources is met by renewable resources by 2030 carlini et al 2017 with a low carbon footprint and comparatively low levelized cost of electricity lcoe the average net cost of electricity produced by a specific plant over its lifetime offshore wind farms are an important means of achieving this target however due to the nature of working in the marine environment costs of building and maintaining an offshore wind farm are large sarker and faiz 2016 through minimising operations and maintenance costs the lcoe generated may be further reduced enhancing the transition to a low carbon economy in the offshore engineering sector the variable accuracy and the low resolution of current wave forecasting models have several significant cost implications for developers and contractors röckmann et al 2017 in particular for the offshore renewable energy industry accurate wave forecasts are key during both the construction and operational phases of offshore wind farms shafiee 2015 a major expense for offshore windfarms around 25 30 of lifetime costs is scheduled and unscheduled maintenance sarker and faiz 2016 with logistical and environmental constraints on unscheduled maintenance wind turbines may be non operational resulting in direct loss of profit for indefinite periods of time therefore the safe deployment of technical crews within offshore wind farms is critical to the sector however there are restrictions in deployment and accessibility seasickness may directly limit efficiency and safety of operational crews further if the wave height is higher than a specific limit depending on the type of the maintenance vehicle 1 5 m in most common crew transfer vehicles ctvs gundegjerde et al 2015 the service crew cannot be transferred from the service vehicle to the wind turbine therefore whilst wave heights are close to the cut off limits lost trips to and from the turbine may be made when they are actually inaccessible or missed opportunities to perform maintenance may occur when the turbine is accessible but the crew was not mobilized a financial cost for the operator of the wind farm is incurred in both cases taylor and jeon 2018 only if wave height is known at and between all wind turbines i e at a sub wind farm array scale optimized deployment and routing of service vehicles during unscheduled and scheduled maintenance is possible wave height an indicator of wave energy is one of the most important parameters of ocean waves as it determines possible impacts to the natural environments beaches de bakker et al 2016 atmosphere ricchi et al 2016 etc infrastructure offshore engineering ports harbours coastal settlements etc randolph and gourvenec 2017 and in this case maintenance procedures of offshore structures taylor and jeon 2018 for maritime operations and planning the main parameter of interest is the significant wave height swh subject to swh forecasts go no go decisions are made on all operations and maintenance activities in offshore windfarms in the days and hours preceding the mission swh is defined as the mean wave height of the highest one third of all waves present 1 s w h 1 n 3 j 1 n 3 h j where j is the rank number of the wave based on the wave height j 1 is the highest wave and n is the total number of waves over a specific time period holthuijsen 2010 as a parameter it is used in most applications instead of the mean wave height since larger waves are more significant important than smaller ones forecasting of wave conditions e g swh peak period mean period with different lead times is normally performed through numerical models that use physical rules to simulate the creation and propagation process of waves within a study area de león et al 2018 a number of forecasting tools are widely available corresponding to different forcing datasets and following different methodologies some of the most widely used include wave model wam staneva et al 2017 the wamdi group 1988 simulating waves nearshore swan amarouche et al 2019 booij et al 1999 and wavewatch iii de león et al 2018 tolman 2002 publicly available global models like wavewatch iii can provide hindcasts forecasts and 2d wave spectrums of ocean waves globally with a typical spatial resolution of 2 10 km however when compared with field data from buoys the reliability of the forecasts varies depending on a number of parameters such as lead time expected swh correlation with meteorological conditions and boundary conditions moreover spatial resolution is limited to the grid size used by the respective forecasting model a detailed analysis on the wave forecasting models and their reliability is reported by bidlot et al 2002 operational wave models that provide near real time wave parameter forecasts are currently limited to meso scale gridded datasets such forecasts are mainly produced by the governmental meteorological services of coastal states depending on the need for global local or infrastructure scale the grid size of numerical wave forecasting tools changes accordingly however at small scales for example within an operational windfarm where turbines are less than 1 km apart operational forecasting is time consuming and require high level of information zamani et al 2008 wind wake effects have been extensively studied in the past for wind farms cortez and dorrego 2020 yang et al 2019 multiple parameters affect the length of the wind wake and the intensity of the turbulence such as local wind conditions wind turbine characteristics wind farm layout patterns and seasonal factors sun et al 2020 barthelmie et al barthelmie et al 2007 showed through field measurements that the turbulence intensity is increasing with increased wind speed similarly to wind wake wave wake effect is expected in offshore wind farms with this phenomenon not well documented in the literature machine learning ml tools and artificial neural networks anns have provided a reliable solution for short term localized forecasting of various other environmental parameters including ocean conditions james et al 2018 jain and deo 2006 surface water acharya et al 2018 and groundwater tapoglou et al 2014 and others jain and deo 2006 tapoglou et al 2016 amirkhani et al 2015 anns were initially inspired by the structure and the functional aspects of biological neural networks mcculloch and pitts 1943 and were originally suggested as mathematical models to simulate human brain function the effectiveness of anns in solving remote sensing problems has been well demonstrated in various studies since ann can easily combine data coming from different sources into a unique integrated algorithm alexakis et al 2019 wave characteristic have also been forecasted at point locations with different lead times and ml methodologies or ensembles of them kumar et al 2018 alexandre et al 2015 krasnopolsky et al 2002 have highlighted the ability of anns in simplifying the necessary calculations of the numerical models numerous training algorithms have been developed in the past with the most important ones being levenberg marquardt moré 1978 and bayesian regularization burden et al 2009 the capability of the anns to perform quicker than traditional modelling is linked to the simple mathematical calculations they have to perform as opposed to traditional modelling tools where partial differential equations are solved for each grid cell in the forecasting location moreover calculations of parameters in traditional models are consecutive meaning that the input of a grid cell is the output of the previous one while in ann models calculations can be done for multiple grid cells at the same time this simplicity enables the use of graphics processing units gpus instead of central processing units cpus jain and deo 2006 recent developments in space borne remote monitoring notably synthetic aperture radar sar is only now providing the large data sets needed to apply machine learning methods to physical oceanography pramudya et al 2019 spaceborne synthetic aperture radar sar is an active microwave remote sensing instrument providing two dimensional information of the normalised radar cross section and represents the ability of a surface to reflect the radar signal pleskachevsky et al 2019 space borne sar uniquely provides the capability to map the roughness of the ocean surface at high spatial resolutions reaching 5 m using the backscatter of the radar verrier et al 2018 at a daily timestep and independent of weather conditions zhang et al 2012 over the past 40 years since seasat born et al 1979 sar has been established for the use monitoring ocean surface and internal waves fernandes et al 2000 and derivation of dominant wavelength and propagation direction c band sar is typically used for applications that require medium penetration romeiser et al 2015 imaging radars equipped with c band are generally not hindered by atmospheric effects and are capable of seeing through tropical clouds and rain showers satellite sar has been extensively used in the past providing a large dataset of available satellite images satellite sar images have been used in the past to successfully extract wind characteristics in coastal areas corazza et al 2020 la et al 2020 zanchetta and zecchetto 2021 satellite images have been used in the past for significant wave hindcasting by training anns with numerical model data romeiser et al 2015 stopa and mouche 2017 zen et al 2021 described how wind and wave conditions are affected by offshore wind farms using low resolution satellite products including sar images here a new methodology for deriving local scale swh from sar images is presented and the potential applications to the offshore wind industry are discussed the remainder of this paper is structured as follows the methodology and data are presented in section 2 results and discussion are given in sections 3 and 4 respectively followed by conclusions in section 5 2 data and methodologies 2 1 data the data to calculate swh were provided from sar images taken of liverpool bay irish sea and southern north sea fig 1 sourced from the european space agency sentinel 1 satellite service torres et al 2012 the irish and north sea regions were selected as regions of interest due to the presence of operational wind farms galloper and greater gabbard race bank and hornsea one and burbo bank and burbo bank extension at liverpool bay fig 1 as well as a sufficiently high volume of swh buoy data to validate remote monitoring data from centre for environment fisheries and aquaculture science cefas the period of study was june 2018 to june 2019 2 1 1 satellite images raw data was captured by the c band synthetic aperture radar c band sar deployed on the sentinel 1 satellite torres et al 2012 data obtained are level 1 single look complex slc vertical vertical vv and vertical horizontal vh polarization c band sar data from both sentinel 1a and 1b satellites were employed interferometric wide swath mode iw mode images that cover both land and ocean surface with high resolution were used contrary to wave mode that is usually used extensively in the past for wave simulation purposes pleskachevsky et al 2019 stopa and mouche 2017 zen et al 2021 iw mode images are available for the coastal area region important for offshore wind because existing wind farms have been places in the threshold between coastal area and open seas a total of 240 sar images were acquired from the sentinel 1 missions associated wave buoy data were downloaded in order to develop and give a robust validation of sea state prediction across the wind farm locations to validate satellite sar results data from three sea surface directional waverider mkiii buoys were used buoys are amongst the most accurate means of point measurements of sea state seemann et al 2015 these data were sourced from cefas wavenet website wyatt et al 2005 under academic licence conditions the cefas wavenet data includes waverider buoys located close to operational wind farms at southwold dowsing and liverpool bay fig 1 2 1 2 wave buoys data from three buoys were used for the analysis for the time period 1st june 2018 to 1st june 2019 the buoy data are recorded and are available in 30 minute windows the measurement at a specific time corresponds to a statistical measure of the waves that passed at the buoy in the last 30 minutes in order to extract the measurements that are at the same time with the satellite images the time window that follows the satellite image time is used and not the most recent measurement for example if a satellite image was taken at 12 05 then the wave buoy measurement at 12 30 based on sea state between 12 00 and 12 30 will be used in fig 2 the swh distribution of the entity of the data at the buoys and the ones used for the training of the network are depicted for all buoys 2 2 methodology the methodology for converting sar satellite data to sea state measurements is separated into two steps first the download and processing of the satellite images followed by the application of the anns to correlate them with the buoy swh data the methodology followed is summarized in fig 3 2 2 1 satellite image pre processing the sar images from sentinel 1a and 1b level 1 slc are pre processed the sar images consist of amplitude return phase information and dual polarization information european space agency 2019 preprocessing of the sar images is required before acquiring the vv and vh polarization at specific locations satellite images were batch downloaded then processing used the open source sentinel application platform tool snap http step esa int main toolboxes snap processing steps followed sowter et al 2016 1 debursting of sar images to merge all sub swaths and retrieve a fluent image 2 a geometric terrain ellipsoid correction to convert the sentinel 1 slc data from slant range geometry to the wgs 1984 coordinate system 3 an average height range doppler approach was implemented incorporating information from the shuttle radar topography mission 3 arc second digital elevation model and satellite orbit and velocity to correct topographic distortions including shadowing layover and foreshortening and 4 a final subsetting of the sar image to acquire information only in the area of interest the results in terms of vh and vv bands were exported in net cdf4 cf format for use in the ann 2 2 2 artificial neural networks anns the feed forward neural network haykin 1994 is the most common type of ann in which the processing of the information is done in one direction through the network from the input towards the output fig 4 by training the ann with known sets for inputs outputs the neural weights are adjusted to reflect the appropriate input output relationship and decrease the error between the ann output and the field data after the training process takes place the ann can be used with a set of inputs to simulate the output parameter one of the most commonly used ann training method also used in this work is back propagation rojas 1996 the optimal architecture of an ann is defined by varying the number of neurons in the hidden layer and successively training and testing against variable sets previously unknown to the network in this study an anns is developed in order to simulate the swh distribution this ann architecture uses the longitude and the latitude coordinate system universal transverse mercator utm zone 35n world geodetic system wgs 1984 coordinates as well as data from the sentinel 1 dual polarization bands as input parameters the estimated output parameters of the model is the swh comparable against the buoys trial and error determined the optimal multi layer perceptron mlp architecture to a three layer network consisting of an input layer x and y coordinates and polarization values at each data point one hidden layer and the output layer fig 4 in order to minimize the uncertainty due to the small diverse dataset a monte carlo procedure was followed dehghani et al 2014 tapoglou et al 2019 in this case the training was performed 100 times having 100 different training validation testing datasets and initial neural weight parameters each time in each realization of the algorithm a random selection of data within the dataset was performed keeping the 70 15 15 distribution between the training validation testing datasets respectively training was based on the levenberg marquardt method a modification of the raphson newton algorithm for finding an optimum solution to a minimization problem moré 1978 a total of 240 satellite images were downloaded corresponding to different times during the year and spread between the three locations due to the stochastic nature of initialization of the ann random division of the dataset into training and testing data random initial neural weight values and the small dataset a monte carlo procedure took place in order to minimize the uncertainty of the results more specifically the training process was repeated 100 times for each tested architecture and the results presented from this point onwards represent the average value of the individual trainings the values for the same time from the buoys were considered accurate swh values and used as the output of the ann for ann inputs a procedure took place to identify the most useful parameters the vv and vh polarization on the location of the available data prediction point were used but in order to eliminate any error from exceptional circumstances the vv vh readings of the buoy itself wind turbines or passing ships vv and vh polarization for the neighbouring at a 5 pixel radius were averaged and used as an input to the network coordinates and bathymetry were also used as ann input parameters in total 7 input parameters were use spot vv spot vh neighbouring average vv neighbouring average vh longitude latitude and bathymetry spot vh and vv refer to the readings at exactly the point of interest while neighbouring average vh and vv use the average of the values within a radius of 5 pixels the output of the ann was the swh at the longitude latitude location specified in the inputs since there is no universally applicable rule about the structure of the ann a process took place in order to find the optimal ann structure architectures with only one hidden layer were tested within a 5 15 nodes range to correspond to the limited number of inputs sample size and the expected complexity of the problem the methodology was developed in matlab r2018a using gpu programming to accelerate the calculations performed the reported execution times refer to the use of a nvidia titan v graphics card 3 results the purpose of the paper is to examine the wave field throughout one wind farm using satellite images and how this can be used for forecasting purposes in order to determine the process to reach this goal and its accuracy the analysis will be presented in different levels first the appropriate ann architecture will be discussed sections 3 1 after defining the optimal architecture and discussing its accuracy the appropriate resolution to present results spatially will be discussed next the results throughout the burbo bank and burbo bank extension for two distinct cases will be presented in order to examine how different are the conditions in the buoy compared to the burbo band and burbo bank extension windfarms the variance between the buoy and even grid cell was calculated 3 1 1artificial neural network the results for different architectures and activation functions after the monte carlo procedure are summarized in table 1 from the results of the training testing evaluation the architecture chosen for the rest of the analysis was the one using levenberg marquardt training algorithm with 10 hidden nodes in a single layer due to the balance achieved between the training testing and validation error on average the absolute residual error for the whole dataset was 0 24 m of the buoy values with absolute deviations ranging from 0 005 m to 1 4 m for the same dates the hindcast of the atlantic european north west shelf cmems nws ocean wave analysis and forecast product northwestshelf analysis forecast wav 004 014 provided on a regular grid at 0 016 sourced by marine copernicus haykin 1994 has simulated values within 0 21 m of the buoy values but with considerably smaller range 0 08m 0 51 m for the same area the copernicus hindcast has assimilated numerous data sources including buoy data wind data and surface currents further the copernicus product averaged the swh within a 30 min window similar to the buoy on the other hand satellite images capture only a specific moment during the wave propagation process meaning that any high or low wave data are not smoothened over a specific timeframe due to the level of data assimilation of cmems nws and the drawbacks of the satellite images it is difficult to achieve accuracy better than the one reported by the cmems nws model however the aim of the paper is to provide a high resolution hindcast depicting the variation of swh within array and highlighting the effect of infrastructure in the wave propagation process this task requires significant computation and modelling cost to perform with numerical models rendering it unviable option for operational purposes the ann model has limited data availability for swh 3 m therefore it is not expected to be accurate above this value for this reason we exclude the values over 3 m for the rest of the analysis for this specific architecture the statistical analysis of the monte carlo procedure for swh 3 m is presented in table 2 the regression plot for the average of the ann ensemble is presented in fig 5 fig 5 does not distinguish between training testing and validation datasets since the values presented are the average of the ann ensemble that was constructed with different members of the ensemble having different dataset division the performance of the methodology in each buoy location separately for the data presented in fig 5 are presented in terms of rmse scatter index bias and efficiency coefficient in table 3 3 2 visualization resolution computational cost by using the native resolution of the satellite image it is possible to apply the methodology in each pixel of the satellite image separately however the results are spatially variable and are difficult to interpret this partially has to do with the local variability of the sea state and the fact that the grid cell is smaller than the wave length when using lower resolutions the predicted value in a larger area is affected by the satellite image properties in a specific location which may be biased in order to find the optimal strategy for large spatial scale visualization of the results two strategies in three different resolutions are discussed an area of around 15 km2 around liverpool bay buoy using a satellite image taken at 06 29 a m on the 18th march 2019 was used as an test area on that time and date the liverpool bay buoy reported a swh of 1 33 m for the first strategy native satellite image resolution fig 6 a was used and the results within a medium fig 6 b1 slightly larger than the expected wave length and low resolution fig 6 c1 which corresponds to the same resolution of cmems nws 0 016 model grid cells were averaged for the second strategy evaluation points were considered in three different resolutions native satellite resolution fig 6 a medium resolution fig 6 b2 and low resolution fig 6 c2 in the second strategy the methodology was only applied for the specific points and the computational characteristics for these three executions are described in table 4 while swh is a statistical measure and cannot be estimated by one wave at a time by training an ann to link satellite image characteristics to swh measured in buoys and then averaging within the wavelength a good estimate of the swh is produced 3 3 sea state models the purpose of this paper is to examine the wave field within a wind farm and how it is affected by infrastructure having examined the choice of resolution the next step is to compare the results of the hindcasts to the ann satellite image methodology in a wind farm burbo bank and burbo bank extension wind farm located on the burbo flats in liverpool bay and consists of 57 wind turbines with 344 mw installed capacity was selected liverpool bay buoy is located outside burbo bank and burbo bank extension wind farm but in close proximity 3 5 km north and 1 5 km east of the northern and western wind turbine of the array two examples are processed presented and discussed in this paper the first corresponding to an average swh and the second corresponding to high swh conditions in both examples the wave direction was north north west which is the prevailing wave direction in the region for the first case the satellite image of 2nd april 2019 captured at 06 30 16 a m by sentinel 1 b will be used after the evaluation of all the points in the satellite image using the trained ensemble of anns the results were visualized as a raster layer in arcgis pro fig 7 b with mean swh of 0 97 m the corresponding time slice for the cmems nws 0 016 hindcast 06 00 a m 07 00am had a mean swh of 0 93 m fig 7a and the difference between the swh evaluated by the anns and evaluated by the cmems nws 0 016deg had a mean value of 0 023 m fig 7c correspondingly in the same time the liverpool bay buoy located 3 km north of the west part of burbo bank extension measured a swh of 0 89 m at 6 30am and 1 07 m at 7 00am the second case study based on a satellite image of 8th december 2018 captured at 18 06 15 by sentinel 1b is used to evaluate the sea state under high swh conditions after processing the data the ann model derived the sea state with mean swh of 2 04 m fig 9 b the corresponding time slice for the cmems nws 0 016 hindcast 18 00 19 00 had a mean swh of 2 28 m the mean difference between the wave heights evaluated by the anns fig 9 b and modelled by the cmems nws 0 016 fig 9 a is 0 342 m and is distributed as presented in fig 9c at the same time and date at the liverpool bay buoy closest available to the wind farm recorded a swh at 2 67 m at 18 00 and 18 30 again as with the first case the trend is in average wave conditions is similar in both the cmems nws 0 016deg and ann models on average higher swh are present in northwest regions and lower swh in eastern locations the anns had a limited dataset used for the training representing these high swh conditions fig 5 therefore the difference between the two models is larger ranging from 0 93 m to 0 97 and skewed with an average of 0 342 m fig 10 3 4 swh buoy variance in order to examine how the wave field changes throughout the wind farm depending on the sea state conditions the gridded variance between the buoy and the wind farm is calculated the buoy was chosen as a point of reference since it is the closest place where measurements are available the buoy is located outside the array 3 5 km north and 1 5 km east of the northern and western wind turbine the mean variance between the swh recorded in the buoy and that simulated in each grid cell values for the entire dataset is calculated 2 v a r i a n c e i 1 m n 1 m b u o y n s a t e l l i t e i n b u o y n where v a r i a n c e i is the variance as calculated at the i th pixel of the study area m is the number of available data number of satellite images with corresponding buoy data b u o y n is the value corresponding to the nth data series and s a t e l l i t e i n the value derived from the ann ensemble for the i th pixel and for the nth data series the mean variance was calculated for three ranges of swh according to the corresponding value at the buoy the first category corresponds to calm and smooth conditions with swh 0 5 m fig 11 a the second 0 5 m swh 2 5 m corresponds to slight and moderate conditions fig 11b and the third swh 2 5 m to rough conditions fig 11c while large deviations as a percentage are present at the first category the absolute values are also small corresponding to small variations throughout in the moderate to rough conditions there are recognisable patterns and occasions with significantly different values compared to the buoy as a general pattern as expected regions closer to the buoy have similar values with the recorder in the buoy especially in the case of rougher seas there is a distinct pattern of changing swh eastern of the burbo bank and burbo bank extension wind farms 4 discussion 4 1 ann sea sate forecasting here a new methodology is proposed integrating ann and satellite image to provide valuable information of swh at high resolution hindcasts made at a range of sea states are within the error range of physical models techniques available the ann model has an average divergence from sea truth data wave buoy values of 0 24 m comparable to the best available open source hydrodynamic model cmems nws hindcast with a divergence of 0 21 m the cmems nws model results are well within its expected hindcast capability which is reported to have an expected deviation of 0 331 m in the uk northwest approaches and 0 365 m for the north sea approaches saulter 2018 moreover it is reported that the cmems nws 0 016 model offers significant improvements when compared to previous model versions fernandes et al 2000 especially near coastal areas the cmems nws model is a hindcast product integrating field data from buoys satellite images and altimetry data saulter 2018 specifically it uses the cefas wavenet buoy data it is validated against including but not exclusively the data from the liverpool bay dowsing and southwold that were also used for the development of the ann model the ann provides a hindcast as good as the hindcast of traditional models available but with minimal computational cost or the need for secondary information since the model was developed and validated using a data from different physical locations the ann developed now provides a tool to estimate swh at any global location directly from sar satellite images confidence could be increased still further by adding additional in situ data sources to the ann training routine since the polarization bands of the sentinel 1 sar images are available at very high resolution down to 5 m it is possible to simulate the swh at ultra fine resolutions resolving sea state at such resolution at such scales would be very time consuming and require high computational cost if using traditional physical based numerical modelling tools 4 2 wake effects and significant wave height calming the ann results offer a more detailed view of the swh within offshore wind farms specifically they detail ribbons of reduced swh within the windfarm which are not reproduced in the larger scale physical sea state forecasts fig 7 the reduced swh was shown to be linked to the infrastructure of multiple turbine monopiles appearing as a wake of lower swh in fig 7b that monopiles which have a small diameter relative to wave length have such a significant effect on sea state is surprising although it is noted that the effect is most prominent at lower sea states where wave lengths are expected to be shorter jeng 2018 the swh calming phenomena is not visible in the difference maps fig 9 likely as different directions of wave overlap resulting in no net shadow of the wind turbines however the observational evidence for swh wake calming provides valuable information for planning of offshore windfarm operations and maintenance whilst further research is required swh wake calming may enable better optimization of ship deployment routing options and prioritization of maintenance jobs the ann model can help significantly in reducing maintenance cost in offshore wind farms by helping towards providing a more accurate swh forecast more specifically the developed model provides a good platform for downscaling general sea state forecasts by deriving information from the satellite images and identifying hotspots of different from the average swh in different conditions it is possible to downscale general sea state forecasts in very high resolution while it is established that satellite parameters relate to wind speed zanchetta and zecchetto 2021 young and donelan 2018 in this case the wake effect presented in figs 7 and 9 is not just the identification of atmospheric wakes atmospheric wake is expected to be stronger in the case of larger wind speed barthelmie et al 2007 as in case of fig 9 however the wake is more apparent in the case of fig 7 for wave wake effects the opposite pattern is expected waves of larger wave length such in case in fig 9 are more unaffected by the presence of the wind turbine compared to smaller wavelengths such as in fig 7 moreover atmospheric wake effect will be visible throughout the wind farm and not only in the outer wind turbines as in fig 7 therefore the phenomenon of wake captured in fig 7 is a sign of wave wake effect as trained by the ann 5 conclusions significant wave height provides a measure for maritime planning logistics and safety it is especially critical in the emerging offshore renewable energy industry for operations and maintenance in offshore windfarms here an artificial neural network is trained using remote satellite monitoring to provide the first detailed measurements of sea state within an operational windfarm the machine learning methodology integrated wave buoy data to simulate significant wave height through vv vh polarization data of sentinel 1 synthetic aperture radar images in order to minimize the uncertainty due to the stochastic nature of artificial neural network initialization a monte carlo simulation approach was used based on an ensemble of 100 trainings tested against wave buoy data a levenberg marquardt training algorithm having 10 nodes in the hidden layer was found to have the best performance the proposed model was developed and tested at several different locations thus it could be applied in any offshore location with little computational cost and any spatial resolution the trained artificial neural network ensemble was used for the simulation of the significant wave height in the burbo bank and burbo bank extension wind farm liverpool bay uk the artificial neural network satellite image methodology had comparable results to physical modelling hindcasts cmems nws 0 016deg comparison to local wave buoy data was 0 24 m and 0 21 m respectively both well within specified capabilities of the current physical based sea state models of the north sea and the irish sea the new artificial neural network methodology not only provides comparable performance but also offers spatial distribution information of significant wave height at very high resolution reaching 5 m for low computational cost finally for the first time the high resolution artificial neural network model was able to detail the effect of windfarm infrastructure on wave propagation wave calming by infrastructure is shown to have a large effect potentially impacting operations and maintenance in offshore wind farms credit authorship contribution statement evdokia tapoglou software validation

20448,accurate wave forecasts are essential for the safe and efficient maritime operations and in particular the maintenance of offshore wind farms here machine learning and remote monitoring from satellites are integrated to provide uniquely detailed predictions of significant wave height swh c band synthetic aperture radar images from european space agency sentinel 1 satellites were combined with wave buoy data from around the uk using the cefas wavenet a total of 240 images in wide swarth mode were collected that represent significant wave height ranging from 0 to 4 7 m image properties related to sea surface roughness in dual polarization mode together with the wave buoy data trained an ensemble of artificial neural networks the trained networks were shown to provide an effective method for the estimation of the swh having an rmse 0 23 m for swh 3 m which is the region of interest for offshore wind energy applications the methodology enables information on the spatial distribution of wave height in very high resolution to be obtained sea state resolved from the satellite data using the artificial neural network shows that windfarm infrastructure directly influences wave propagation the overall variance of significant wave height throughout a wind farm was calculated providing information on regions of interest with considerably different wave heights as compared to the nearest wave buoy the new model will help towards improved downscaling of general sea state forecasts locating hotspots of different wave height properties and correct prioritization of maintenance jobs to perform in wind turbines keywords offshore renewable energy machine learning artificial neural networks wave forecasting synthetic aperture radar remote sensing 1 introduction state of the art development and use of renewable energy resources are key to reducing co2 emissions and consequently the effects of climate change and improving the quality of the environment ipcc 2011 for this reason the european union established a set of rules and targets through the revised renewable energy directive in 2016 requiring that 27 of energy mix the combination of different energy sources is met by renewable resources by 2030 carlini et al 2017 with a low carbon footprint and comparatively low levelized cost of electricity lcoe the average net cost of electricity produced by a specific plant over its lifetime offshore wind farms are an important means of achieving this target however due to the nature of working in the marine environment costs of building and maintaining an offshore wind farm are large sarker and faiz 2016 through minimising operations and maintenance costs the lcoe generated may be further reduced enhancing the transition to a low carbon economy in the offshore engineering sector the variable accuracy and the low resolution of current wave forecasting models have several significant cost implications for developers and contractors röckmann et al 2017 in particular for the offshore renewable energy industry accurate wave forecasts are key during both the construction and operational phases of offshore wind farms shafiee 2015 a major expense for offshore windfarms around 25 30 of lifetime costs is scheduled and unscheduled maintenance sarker and faiz 2016 with logistical and environmental constraints on unscheduled maintenance wind turbines may be non operational resulting in direct loss of profit for indefinite periods of time therefore the safe deployment of technical crews within offshore wind farms is critical to the sector however there are restrictions in deployment and accessibility seasickness may directly limit efficiency and safety of operational crews further if the wave height is higher than a specific limit depending on the type of the maintenance vehicle 1 5 m in most common crew transfer vehicles ctvs gundegjerde et al 2015 the service crew cannot be transferred from the service vehicle to the wind turbine therefore whilst wave heights are close to the cut off limits lost trips to and from the turbine may be made when they are actually inaccessible or missed opportunities to perform maintenance may occur when the turbine is accessible but the crew was not mobilized a financial cost for the operator of the wind farm is incurred in both cases taylor and jeon 2018 only if wave height is known at and between all wind turbines i e at a sub wind farm array scale optimized deployment and routing of service vehicles during unscheduled and scheduled maintenance is possible wave height an indicator of wave energy is one of the most important parameters of ocean waves as it determines possible impacts to the natural environments beaches de bakker et al 2016 atmosphere ricchi et al 2016 etc infrastructure offshore engineering ports harbours coastal settlements etc randolph and gourvenec 2017 and in this case maintenance procedures of offshore structures taylor and jeon 2018 for maritime operations and planning the main parameter of interest is the significant wave height swh subject to swh forecasts go no go decisions are made on all operations and maintenance activities in offshore windfarms in the days and hours preceding the mission swh is defined as the mean wave height of the highest one third of all waves present 1 s w h 1 n 3 j 1 n 3 h j where j is the rank number of the wave based on the wave height j 1 is the highest wave and n is the total number of waves over a specific time period holthuijsen 2010 as a parameter it is used in most applications instead of the mean wave height since larger waves are more significant important than smaller ones forecasting of wave conditions e g swh peak period mean period with different lead times is normally performed through numerical models that use physical rules to simulate the creation and propagation process of waves within a study area de león et al 2018 a number of forecasting tools are widely available corresponding to different forcing datasets and following different methodologies some of the most widely used include wave model wam staneva et al 2017 the wamdi group 1988 simulating waves nearshore swan amarouche et al 2019 booij et al 1999 and wavewatch iii de león et al 2018 tolman 2002 publicly available global models like wavewatch iii can provide hindcasts forecasts and 2d wave spectrums of ocean waves globally with a typical spatial resolution of 2 10 km however when compared with field data from buoys the reliability of the forecasts varies depending on a number of parameters such as lead time expected swh correlation with meteorological conditions and boundary conditions moreover spatial resolution is limited to the grid size used by the respective forecasting model a detailed analysis on the wave forecasting models and their reliability is reported by bidlot et al 2002 operational wave models that provide near real time wave parameter forecasts are currently limited to meso scale gridded datasets such forecasts are mainly produced by the governmental meteorological services of coastal states depending on the need for global local or infrastructure scale the grid size of numerical wave forecasting tools changes accordingly however at small scales for example within an operational windfarm where turbines are less than 1 km apart operational forecasting is time consuming and require high level of information zamani et al 2008 wind wake effects have been extensively studied in the past for wind farms cortez and dorrego 2020 yang et al 2019 multiple parameters affect the length of the wind wake and the intensity of the turbulence such as local wind conditions wind turbine characteristics wind farm layout patterns and seasonal factors sun et al 2020 barthelmie et al barthelmie et al 2007 showed through field measurements that the turbulence intensity is increasing with increased wind speed similarly to wind wake wave wake effect is expected in offshore wind farms with this phenomenon not well documented in the literature machine learning ml tools and artificial neural networks anns have provided a reliable solution for short term localized forecasting of various other environmental parameters including ocean conditions james et al 2018 jain and deo 2006 surface water acharya et al 2018 and groundwater tapoglou et al 2014 and others jain and deo 2006 tapoglou et al 2016 amirkhani et al 2015 anns were initially inspired by the structure and the functional aspects of biological neural networks mcculloch and pitts 1943 and were originally suggested as mathematical models to simulate human brain function the effectiveness of anns in solving remote sensing problems has been well demonstrated in various studies since ann can easily combine data coming from different sources into a unique integrated algorithm alexakis et al 2019 wave characteristic have also been forecasted at point locations with different lead times and ml methodologies or ensembles of them kumar et al 2018 alexandre et al 2015 krasnopolsky et al 2002 have highlighted the ability of anns in simplifying the necessary calculations of the numerical models numerous training algorithms have been developed in the past with the most important ones being levenberg marquardt moré 1978 and bayesian regularization burden et al 2009 the capability of the anns to perform quicker than traditional modelling is linked to the simple mathematical calculations they have to perform as opposed to traditional modelling tools where partial differential equations are solved for each grid cell in the forecasting location moreover calculations of parameters in traditional models are consecutive meaning that the input of a grid cell is the output of the previous one while in ann models calculations can be done for multiple grid cells at the same time this simplicity enables the use of graphics processing units gpus instead of central processing units cpus jain and deo 2006 recent developments in space borne remote monitoring notably synthetic aperture radar sar is only now providing the large data sets needed to apply machine learning methods to physical oceanography pramudya et al 2019 spaceborne synthetic aperture radar sar is an active microwave remote sensing instrument providing two dimensional information of the normalised radar cross section and represents the ability of a surface to reflect the radar signal pleskachevsky et al 2019 space borne sar uniquely provides the capability to map the roughness of the ocean surface at high spatial resolutions reaching 5 m using the backscatter of the radar verrier et al 2018 at a daily timestep and independent of weather conditions zhang et al 2012 over the past 40 years since seasat born et al 1979 sar has been established for the use monitoring ocean surface and internal waves fernandes et al 2000 and derivation of dominant wavelength and propagation direction c band sar is typically used for applications that require medium penetration romeiser et al 2015 imaging radars equipped with c band are generally not hindered by atmospheric effects and are capable of seeing through tropical clouds and rain showers satellite sar has been extensively used in the past providing a large dataset of available satellite images satellite sar images have been used in the past to successfully extract wind characteristics in coastal areas corazza et al 2020 la et al 2020 zanchetta and zecchetto 2021 satellite images have been used in the past for significant wave hindcasting by training anns with numerical model data romeiser et al 2015 stopa and mouche 2017 zen et al 2021 described how wind and wave conditions are affected by offshore wind farms using low resolution satellite products including sar images here a new methodology for deriving local scale swh from sar images is presented and the potential applications to the offshore wind industry are discussed the remainder of this paper is structured as follows the methodology and data are presented in section 2 results and discussion are given in sections 3 and 4 respectively followed by conclusions in section 5 2 data and methodologies 2 1 data the data to calculate swh were provided from sar images taken of liverpool bay irish sea and southern north sea fig 1 sourced from the european space agency sentinel 1 satellite service torres et al 2012 the irish and north sea regions were selected as regions of interest due to the presence of operational wind farms galloper and greater gabbard race bank and hornsea one and burbo bank and burbo bank extension at liverpool bay fig 1 as well as a sufficiently high volume of swh buoy data to validate remote monitoring data from centre for environment fisheries and aquaculture science cefas the period of study was june 2018 to june 2019 2 1 1 satellite images raw data was captured by the c band synthetic aperture radar c band sar deployed on the sentinel 1 satellite torres et al 2012 data obtained are level 1 single look complex slc vertical vertical vv and vertical horizontal vh polarization c band sar data from both sentinel 1a and 1b satellites were employed interferometric wide swath mode iw mode images that cover both land and ocean surface with high resolution were used contrary to wave mode that is usually used extensively in the past for wave simulation purposes pleskachevsky et al 2019 stopa and mouche 2017 zen et al 2021 iw mode images are available for the coastal area region important for offshore wind because existing wind farms have been places in the threshold between coastal area and open seas a total of 240 sar images were acquired from the sentinel 1 missions associated wave buoy data were downloaded in order to develop and give a robust validation of sea state prediction across the wind farm locations to validate satellite sar results data from three sea surface directional waverider mkiii buoys were used buoys are amongst the most accurate means of point measurements of sea state seemann et al 2015 these data were sourced from cefas wavenet website wyatt et al 2005 under academic licence conditions the cefas wavenet data includes waverider buoys located close to operational wind farms at southwold dowsing and liverpool bay fig 1 2 1 2 wave buoys data from three buoys were used for the analysis for the time period 1st june 2018 to 1st june 2019 the buoy data are recorded and are available in 30 minute windows the measurement at a specific time corresponds to a statistical measure of the waves that passed at the buoy in the last 30 minutes in order to extract the measurements that are at the same time with the satellite images the time window that follows the satellite image time is used and not the most recent measurement for example if a satellite image was taken at 12 05 then the wave buoy measurement at 12 30 based on sea state between 12 00 and 12 30 will be used in fig 2 the swh distribution of the entity of the data at the buoys and the ones used for the training of the network are depicted for all buoys 2 2 methodology the methodology for converting sar satellite data to sea state measurements is separated into two steps first the download and processing of the satellite images followed by the application of the anns to correlate them with the buoy swh data the methodology followed is summarized in fig 3 2 2 1 satellite image pre processing the sar images from sentinel 1a and 1b level 1 slc are pre processed the sar images consist of amplitude return phase information and dual polarization information european space agency 2019 preprocessing of the sar images is required before acquiring the vv and vh polarization at specific locations satellite images were batch downloaded then processing used the open source sentinel application platform tool snap http step esa int main toolboxes snap processing steps followed sowter et al 2016 1 debursting of sar images to merge all sub swaths and retrieve a fluent image 2 a geometric terrain ellipsoid correction to convert the sentinel 1 slc data from slant range geometry to the wgs 1984 coordinate system 3 an average height range doppler approach was implemented incorporating information from the shuttle radar topography mission 3 arc second digital elevation model and satellite orbit and velocity to correct topographic distortions including shadowing layover and foreshortening and 4 a final subsetting of the sar image to acquire information only in the area of interest the results in terms of vh and vv bands were exported in net cdf4 cf format for use in the ann 2 2 2 artificial neural networks anns the feed forward neural network haykin 1994 is the most common type of ann in which the processing of the information is done in one direction through the network from the input towards the output fig 4 by training the ann with known sets for inputs outputs the neural weights are adjusted to reflect the appropriate input output relationship and decrease the error between the ann output and the field data after the training process takes place the ann can be used with a set of inputs to simulate the output parameter one of the most commonly used ann training method also used in this work is back propagation rojas 1996 the optimal architecture of an ann is defined by varying the number of neurons in the hidden layer and successively training and testing against variable sets previously unknown to the network in this study an anns is developed in order to simulate the swh distribution this ann architecture uses the longitude and the latitude coordinate system universal transverse mercator utm zone 35n world geodetic system wgs 1984 coordinates as well as data from the sentinel 1 dual polarization bands as input parameters the estimated output parameters of the model is the swh comparable against the buoys trial and error determined the optimal multi layer perceptron mlp architecture to a three layer network consisting of an input layer x and y coordinates and polarization values at each data point one hidden layer and the output layer fig 4 in order to minimize the uncertainty due to the small diverse dataset a monte carlo procedure was followed dehghani et al 2014 tapoglou et al 2019 in this case the training was performed 100 times having 100 different training validation testing datasets and initial neural weight parameters each time in each realization of the algorithm a random selection of data within the dataset was performed keeping the 70 15 15 distribution between the training validation testing datasets respectively training was based on the levenberg marquardt method a modification of the raphson newton algorithm for finding an optimum solution to a minimization problem moré 1978 a total of 240 satellite images were downloaded corresponding to different times during the year and spread between the three locations due to the stochastic nature of initialization of the ann random division of the dataset into training and testing data random initial neural weight values and the small dataset a monte carlo procedure took place in order to minimize the uncertainty of the results more specifically the training process was repeated 100 times for each tested architecture and the results presented from this point onwards represent the average value of the individual trainings the values for the same time from the buoys were considered accurate swh values and used as the output of the ann for ann inputs a procedure took place to identify the most useful parameters the vv and vh polarization on the location of the available data prediction point were used but in order to eliminate any error from exceptional circumstances the vv vh readings of the buoy itself wind turbines or passing ships vv and vh polarization for the neighbouring at a 5 pixel radius were averaged and used as an input to the network coordinates and bathymetry were also used as ann input parameters in total 7 input parameters were use spot vv spot vh neighbouring average vv neighbouring average vh longitude latitude and bathymetry spot vh and vv refer to the readings at exactly the point of interest while neighbouring average vh and vv use the average of the values within a radius of 5 pixels the output of the ann was the swh at the longitude latitude location specified in the inputs since there is no universally applicable rule about the structure of the ann a process took place in order to find the optimal ann structure architectures with only one hidden layer were tested within a 5 15 nodes range to correspond to the limited number of inputs sample size and the expected complexity of the problem the methodology was developed in matlab r2018a using gpu programming to accelerate the calculations performed the reported execution times refer to the use of a nvidia titan v graphics card 3 results the purpose of the paper is to examine the wave field throughout one wind farm using satellite images and how this can be used for forecasting purposes in order to determine the process to reach this goal and its accuracy the analysis will be presented in different levels first the appropriate ann architecture will be discussed sections 3 1 after defining the optimal architecture and discussing its accuracy the appropriate resolution to present results spatially will be discussed next the results throughout the burbo bank and burbo bank extension for two distinct cases will be presented in order to examine how different are the conditions in the buoy compared to the burbo band and burbo bank extension windfarms the variance between the buoy and even grid cell was calculated 3 1 1artificial neural network the results for different architectures and activation functions after the monte carlo procedure are summarized in table 1 from the results of the training testing evaluation the architecture chosen for the rest of the analysis was the one using levenberg marquardt training algorithm with 10 hidden nodes in a single layer due to the balance achieved between the training testing and validation error on average the absolute residual error for the whole dataset was 0 24 m of the buoy values with absolute deviations ranging from 0 005 m to 1 4 m for the same dates the hindcast of the atlantic european north west shelf cmems nws ocean wave analysis and forecast product northwestshelf analysis forecast wav 004 014 provided on a regular grid at 0 016 sourced by marine copernicus haykin 1994 has simulated values within 0 21 m of the buoy values but with considerably smaller range 0 08m 0 51 m for the same area the copernicus hindcast has assimilated numerous data sources including buoy data wind data and surface currents further the copernicus product averaged the swh within a 30 min window similar to the buoy on the other hand satellite images capture only a specific moment during the wave propagation process meaning that any high or low wave data are not smoothened over a specific timeframe due to the level of data assimilation of cmems nws and the drawbacks of the satellite images it is difficult to achieve accuracy better than the one reported by the cmems nws model however the aim of the paper is to provide a high resolution hindcast depicting the variation of swh within array and highlighting the effect of infrastructure in the wave propagation process this task requires significant computation and modelling cost to perform with numerical models rendering it unviable option for operational purposes the ann model has limited data availability for swh 3 m therefore it is not expected to be accurate above this value for this reason we exclude the values over 3 m for the rest of the analysis for this specific architecture the statistical analysis of the monte carlo procedure for swh 3 m is presented in table 2 the regression plot for the average of the ann ensemble is presented in fig 5 fig 5 does not distinguish between training testing and validation datasets since the values presented are the average of the ann ensemble that was constructed with different members of the ensemble having different dataset division the performance of the methodology in each buoy location separately for the data presented in fig 5 are presented in terms of rmse scatter index bias and efficiency coefficient in table 3 3 2 visualization resolution computational cost by using the native resolution of the satellite image it is possible to apply the methodology in each pixel of the satellite image separately however the results are spatially variable and are difficult to interpret this partially has to do with the local variability of the sea state and the fact that the grid cell is smaller than the wave length when using lower resolutions the predicted value in a larger area is affected by the satellite image properties in a specific location which may be biased in order to find the optimal strategy for large spatial scale visualization of the results two strategies in three different resolutions are discussed an area of around 15 km2 around liverpool bay buoy using a satellite image taken at 06 29 a m on the 18th march 2019 was used as an test area on that time and date the liverpool bay buoy reported a swh of 1 33 m for the first strategy native satellite image resolution fig 6 a was used and the results within a medium fig 6 b1 slightly larger than the expected wave length and low resolution fig 6 c1 which corresponds to the same resolution of cmems nws 0 016 model grid cells were averaged for the second strategy evaluation points were considered in three different resolutions native satellite resolution fig 6 a medium resolution fig 6 b2 and low resolution fig 6 c2 in the second strategy the methodology was only applied for the specific points and the computational characteristics for these three executions are described in table 4 while swh is a statistical measure and cannot be estimated by one wave at a time by training an ann to link satellite image characteristics to swh measured in buoys and then averaging within the wavelength a good estimate of the swh is produced 3 3 sea state models the purpose of this paper is to examine the wave field within a wind farm and how it is affected by infrastructure having examined the choice of resolution the next step is to compare the results of the hindcasts to the ann satellite image methodology in a wind farm burbo bank and burbo bank extension wind farm located on the burbo flats in liverpool bay and consists of 57 wind turbines with 344 mw installed capacity was selected liverpool bay buoy is located outside burbo bank and burbo bank extension wind farm but in close proximity 3 5 km north and 1 5 km east of the northern and western wind turbine of the array two examples are processed presented and discussed in this paper the first corresponding to an average swh and the second corresponding to high swh conditions in both examples the wave direction was north north west which is the prevailing wave direction in the region for the first case the satellite image of 2nd april 2019 captured at 06 30 16 a m by sentinel 1 b will be used after the evaluation of all the points in the satellite image using the trained ensemble of anns the results were visualized as a raster layer in arcgis pro fig 7 b with mean swh of 0 97 m the corresponding time slice for the cmems nws 0 016 hindcast 06 00 a m 07 00am had a mean swh of 0 93 m fig 7a and the difference between the swh evaluated by the anns and evaluated by the cmems nws 0 016deg had a mean value of 0 023 m fig 7c correspondingly in the same time the liverpool bay buoy located 3 km north of the west part of burbo bank extension measured a swh of 0 89 m at 6 30am and 1 07 m at 7 00am the second case study based on a satellite image of 8th december 2018 captured at 18 06 15 by sentinel 1b is used to evaluate the sea state under high swh conditions after processing the data the ann model derived the sea state with mean swh of 2 04 m fig 9 b the corresponding time slice for the cmems nws 0 016 hindcast 18 00 19 00 had a mean swh of 2 28 m the mean difference between the wave heights evaluated by the anns fig 9 b and modelled by the cmems nws 0 016 fig 9 a is 0 342 m and is distributed as presented in fig 9c at the same time and date at the liverpool bay buoy closest available to the wind farm recorded a swh at 2 67 m at 18 00 and 18 30 again as with the first case the trend is in average wave conditions is similar in both the cmems nws 0 016deg and ann models on average higher swh are present in northwest regions and lower swh in eastern locations the anns had a limited dataset used for the training representing these high swh conditions fig 5 therefore the difference between the two models is larger ranging from 0 93 m to 0 97 and skewed with an average of 0 342 m fig 10 3 4 swh buoy variance in order to examine how the wave field changes throughout the wind farm depending on the sea state conditions the gridded variance between the buoy and the wind farm is calculated the buoy was chosen as a point of reference since it is the closest place where measurements are available the buoy is located outside the array 3 5 km north and 1 5 km east of the northern and western wind turbine the mean variance between the swh recorded in the buoy and that simulated in each grid cell values for the entire dataset is calculated 2 v a r i a n c e i 1 m n 1 m b u o y n s a t e l l i t e i n b u o y n where v a r i a n c e i is the variance as calculated at the i th pixel of the study area m is the number of available data number of satellite images with corresponding buoy data b u o y n is the value corresponding to the nth data series and s a t e l l i t e i n the value derived from the ann ensemble for the i th pixel and for the nth data series the mean variance was calculated for three ranges of swh according to the corresponding value at the buoy the first category corresponds to calm and smooth conditions with swh 0 5 m fig 11 a the second 0 5 m swh 2 5 m corresponds to slight and moderate conditions fig 11b and the third swh 2 5 m to rough conditions fig 11c while large deviations as a percentage are present at the first category the absolute values are also small corresponding to small variations throughout in the moderate to rough conditions there are recognisable patterns and occasions with significantly different values compared to the buoy as a general pattern as expected regions closer to the buoy have similar values with the recorder in the buoy especially in the case of rougher seas there is a distinct pattern of changing swh eastern of the burbo bank and burbo bank extension wind farms 4 discussion 4 1 ann sea sate forecasting here a new methodology is proposed integrating ann and satellite image to provide valuable information of swh at high resolution hindcasts made at a range of sea states are within the error range of physical models techniques available the ann model has an average divergence from sea truth data wave buoy values of 0 24 m comparable to the best available open source hydrodynamic model cmems nws hindcast with a divergence of 0 21 m the cmems nws model results are well within its expected hindcast capability which is reported to have an expected deviation of 0 331 m in the uk northwest approaches and 0 365 m for the north sea approaches saulter 2018 moreover it is reported that the cmems nws 0 016 model offers significant improvements when compared to previous model versions fernandes et al 2000 especially near coastal areas the cmems nws model is a hindcast product integrating field data from buoys satellite images and altimetry data saulter 2018 specifically it uses the cefas wavenet buoy data it is validated against including but not exclusively the data from the liverpool bay dowsing and southwold that were also used for the development of the ann model the ann provides a hindcast as good as the hindcast of traditional models available but with minimal computational cost or the need for secondary information since the model was developed and validated using a data from different physical locations the ann developed now provides a tool to estimate swh at any global location directly from sar satellite images confidence could be increased still further by adding additional in situ data sources to the ann training routine since the polarization bands of the sentinel 1 sar images are available at very high resolution down to 5 m it is possible to simulate the swh at ultra fine resolutions resolving sea state at such resolution at such scales would be very time consuming and require high computational cost if using traditional physical based numerical modelling tools 4 2 wake effects and significant wave height calming the ann results offer a more detailed view of the swh within offshore wind farms specifically they detail ribbons of reduced swh within the windfarm which are not reproduced in the larger scale physical sea state forecasts fig 7 the reduced swh was shown to be linked to the infrastructure of multiple turbine monopiles appearing as a wake of lower swh in fig 7b that monopiles which have a small diameter relative to wave length have such a significant effect on sea state is surprising although it is noted that the effect is most prominent at lower sea states where wave lengths are expected to be shorter jeng 2018 the swh calming phenomena is not visible in the difference maps fig 9 likely as different directions of wave overlap resulting in no net shadow of the wind turbines however the observational evidence for swh wake calming provides valuable information for planning of offshore windfarm operations and maintenance whilst further research is required swh wake calming may enable better optimization of ship deployment routing options and prioritization of maintenance jobs the ann model can help significantly in reducing maintenance cost in offshore wind farms by helping towards providing a more accurate swh forecast more specifically the developed model provides a good platform for downscaling general sea state forecasts by deriving information from the satellite images and identifying hotspots of different from the average swh in different conditions it is possible to downscale general sea state forecasts in very high resolution while it is established that satellite parameters relate to wind speed zanchetta and zecchetto 2021 young and donelan 2018 in this case the wake effect presented in figs 7 and 9 is not just the identification of atmospheric wakes atmospheric wake is expected to be stronger in the case of larger wind speed barthelmie et al 2007 as in case of fig 9 however the wake is more apparent in the case of fig 7 for wave wake effects the opposite pattern is expected waves of larger wave length such in case in fig 9 are more unaffected by the presence of the wind turbine compared to smaller wavelengths such as in fig 7 moreover atmospheric wake effect will be visible throughout the wind farm and not only in the outer wind turbines as in fig 7 therefore the phenomenon of wake captured in fig 7 is a sign of wave wake effect as trained by the ann 5 conclusions significant wave height provides a measure for maritime planning logistics and safety it is especially critical in the emerging offshore renewable energy industry for operations and maintenance in offshore windfarms here an artificial neural network is trained using remote satellite monitoring to provide the first detailed measurements of sea state within an operational windfarm the machine learning methodology integrated wave buoy data to simulate significant wave height through vv vh polarization data of sentinel 1 synthetic aperture radar images in order to minimize the uncertainty due to the stochastic nature of artificial neural network initialization a monte carlo simulation approach was used based on an ensemble of 100 trainings tested against wave buoy data a levenberg marquardt training algorithm having 10 nodes in the hidden layer was found to have the best performance the proposed model was developed and tested at several different locations thus it could be applied in any offshore location with little computational cost and any spatial resolution the trained artificial neural network ensemble was used for the simulation of the significant wave height in the burbo bank and burbo bank extension wind farm liverpool bay uk the artificial neural network satellite image methodology had comparable results to physical modelling hindcasts cmems nws 0 016deg comparison to local wave buoy data was 0 24 m and 0 21 m respectively both well within specified capabilities of the current physical based sea state models of the north sea and the irish sea the new artificial neural network methodology not only provides comparable performance but also offers spatial distribution information of significant wave height at very high resolution reaching 5 m for low computational cost finally for the first time the high resolution artificial neural network model was able to detail the effect of windfarm infrastructure on wave propagation wave calming by infrastructure is shown to have a large effect potentially impacting operations and maintenance in offshore wind farms credit authorship contribution statement evdokia tapoglou software validation

20449,in this article a new conceptual design of flexible oscillating wing with time varying camber deformation is introduced and the two dimensional transient numerical simulation has also been conducted to compare the propulsive performance of current flexible oscillating wing with that of conventional rigid oscillating wing by using of the commercial software ansys fluent 18 2 coupled with the dynamic mesh technique at moderate high reynolds number of 1 0 106 in addition the influence of the deflection amplitude the deflection frequency as well as the deflection position along the chord length of the wing on the propulsive performance of current flexible oscillating wing have been analyzed the numerical simulation results demonstrate that the introduction of flexible deformation motion does much good on improving the propulsive performance of oscillating wing and there exists optimum motion parameters leading to the highest propulsive efficiency compared with the conventional rigid oscillating wing the existence of flexible deformation motion presents greater propulsive efficiency by largely increasing the thrust force within the whole period of motion and the maximum value of η can be increased by 28 3 compared with that of conventional rigid wing furthermore the results also reveal that the optimum deflection motion should coincide with the rotation center of rigid motion and that conclusion provides much benefit for the future design of prototype manufacture keywords oscillating wing flexible deformation dynamic mesh technique propulsive performance 1 introduction in recent years the underwater bionic propulsion technique has become a research hot spot the aquatic creatures have successfully applied the physical principles of unsteady hydrodynamics to acquire excellent motion abilities after hundreds of millions of years of evolution and among them the oscillating wing swimming mode of mammals such as fishes and penguins has the characteristics of high speed high propulsive efficiency low noise good maneuverability etc which cannot be compared by current man made ships or underwater vehicles liu et al 2020 works of researching learning imitating and other means to copy and reconstruct the motion characteristics and functions of these oscillating wings and applying them to underwater vehicles are of great significance to improve the motion ability of underwater vehicles therefore plenty of works concerning about the hydrodynamic performance and mechanism of oscillating wing have been conducted by scholars and researchers from both at home and abroad the bionic propulsion using oscillating wing is a relatively new field of research and the pioneering work has been conducted by lighthill lighthill et al 1971 who successfully applied the two dimensional wing theory of aerodynamics into the oscillating wing s bionic propulsion and a novel theory of slender body has been proposed ignoring the changes of flow fields caused by the wing s oscillating motion after that wu has proposed a two dimensional wavy plate theory by utilizing the linear potential theory wu et al 1971 in this theory the oscillating wing can be regarded as an elastic plate and the motion of two dimensional oscillating wing was analyzed by referring to the method of studying the wing s vibration deformation in the air tong and zhuang has extended that theory into the three dimensional wavy plate theory by using of the semi analytical and semi numerical method and that theory has been widely recognized and adopted by plenty of international scholars apart from the theoretical study researches concerning the oscillating wing also involve experimental research and numerical simulation in the experimental aspect freymuth firstly observed that when the positive thrust force is generated the shedding vortex in the flow field of oscillating wing presented an anti karmen vortex street distribution the similar flow structures was also detected by lu and kim by using of the dye emission technique freymuth et al 1988 jeanmond and olivier have captured the boundary layer structure and have explained reason why the positive thrust force was generated form the view of flow stability jeanmond et al 2017 the early measurement of the flow field mainly relies on wire film anemometer technology and the biggest disadvantage is that the flow field velocity can be easily influenced when it is used and only single point can be measured failing to collect the information of whole flow field and instantaneous flow structure with the development of measurement technology the piv and dpiv technology are increasingly utilized in flow field measurement plenty of works have been conducted to acquire the instantaneous flow velocity and vortex in the flow field of oscillating wing by utilizing the piv and dpiv technology the experimental measurement objects involves the naca series of wings flat plates and real fishtail shape the motion trajectory of oscillating wing ranges from standard sinusoidal motion to non sinusoidal motion the characteristic reynolds number alters from 4 102 1 0 106 lu et al 2015 le et al 2013 kim et al 2017 young et al 2013 tian et al 2016 besides that there has also been a lot of numerical work in past decades and several typical numerical methods have been established to simulate the flapping foil s unsteady motion e g dynamic grid method or sling mesh technique overset grid method boundary element method bem and immersed boundary method ibm early numerical simulation of oscillating wing was mainly based on potential flow theory and the panel element method is the most widely used among them pan et al 2012 mantia et al 2009 priovolos et al 2018 filippas et al 2018 xu and wu 2013 abbaspour et al 2018 politis et al 2016 liu et al 2017 the numerical simulation based on potential flow theory has acquired some valuable results in the hydrodynamic performance prediction of oscillating wing compared with the cfd method it takes less time and the programming is relatively simple however the numerical calculation accuracy is relatively low for the sake of ignoring the effect of viscosity with the development of computer and computational fluid dynamics increasing number of direct numerical simulation dns work has been carries out and the biggest benefit of dns lies in that the flow field of oscillating wing can be better reflected and more relevant details will be captured dong et al 2006 pan et al 2014 dong et al 2006 lin et al 2018 park et al 2016 majumdar et al 2020 huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 2020b however constrained by the computation resource and method the current dns method is only applicable in the low and medium reynolds number which is much lower than that of flying birds and swimming fish and the fluid mechanism behind still remains unclear all the work mentioned above has mainly focused on investigating the hydrodynamic performance of rigid oscillating wing and there exists little deformation on the surface of wing during the whole motion process in fact both the fish s wing and bird s fin are elastic and they can use the deformable structure to improve their own motion ability therefore there exists much necessity to investigate the propulsive performance of flexible oscillating wing there are actually a few works investigating the effect of flexible deformation on propulsive performance of oscillating wing in miao s work the effect of camber deformation on propulsive performance of a two dimensional oscillating wing was investigated by using the commercial software fluent 6 1 and the characteristic reynolds number in their study ranges from 102 to 104 in their study the simulation result shows that the highest propulsive efficiency can be increased by 30 73 and the optimum motion frequency leading to highest propulsive efficiency varies with the reynolds number miao et al 2006 similar work has also been conducted by the hoke et al and the reynolds number chosen in their work is 1100 hoke et al 2015 which is identical with that in miao s work the difference among them lies in that both the propulsive performance and energy harvesting property of flexible oscillating wing are investigated priovolos carried out hydroelastic analysis on the propulsive performance of flexible oscillating wing by using the vortex based method and the numerical results show that the chordwise flexibility can significantly improve the propulsive efficiency of oscillating wing in their work 10 increase in propulsive efficiency has been reported compared with the rigid oscillating wing priovolos et al 2018 the characteristic reynolds number selected in the above works are all around the order of 104 which is far less than the reynolds number of creatures undertaking the oscillating motion re 105 108 therefore there exists much necessity to carry out the analysis on the hydrodynamic performance of flexible wing within the range of realistic reynolds number to further improve the propulsive efficiency of oscillating wing the current study proposed a novel conceptual design of flexible oscillating wing seen in fig 1 where the wing surface can undergoes constant deformation during the whole motion period to obtain more energy from the flow field so as to improve the propulsive performance of oscillating wing in this article a transient 2d numerical simulation based on the dynamic mesh technique is employed to investigate the effect of flexible deformation on the propulsive performance of oscillating wing at the reynolds number of 106 in addition the effect of deflection parameters such as deflection amplitude deflection frequency and the deflection position along the chord length of wing on the propulsive efficiency will be analyzed and discussed the structure of this article is organized as followed in the second part the physical model will be introduced accompanying with the motion equation of flexible oscillating wing as well as the definition of hydrodynamic parameters thereafter the numerical method as well as the validation of current code will be presented in sec 3 followed by the analysis of the effect of motion parameters on flexible oscillating wing s propulsive performance and the concluding remarks will be drawn in the final part 2 research object the physical model selected in current study is a two dimensional naca0012 wing and the chord length of the wing is taken as the characteristic length c the rotation point located at the center line of the foil with a distance xr from the leading edge which is one third the chord length the reason why the naca0012 wing is selected comes from the two aspects for the one our intention of simulation is basically from the pioneer simulation work of biomimetic propulsion studies by shao et al 2010 and pan et al 2014 in which propulsive performance of a two dimensional oscillating wing was numerical investigated with a comparative small reynolds number re 200 our current study can be considered as an extension of these pioneer works instead to the simulation work of small reynolds number the current work focus on the propulsive performance of oscillating wing at moderate high reynolds number re 1 0 106 and the time varying camber deformation was also given the due consideration for another according to the asharf s study abbaspour and najafi 2018 when the thickness of wing lies in the range of 12 20 the highest value of c t mean mean value of thrust force coefficient will be obtained and there exists small difference among the corresponding values in view of that the naca wing with the thickness of 12 naca0012 is selected in our study for the purpose of achieving the comparative propulsive performance the oscillating wing motion in our study consists of two parts the rigid motion and the flexible deformation motion as for the rigid motion the oscillating wing undergoes so called heaving pitching motion that is the heaving motion along the vertical direction as well as the pitching motion with respect to its pivot center o both the two motions execute harmonic motion with the same motion frequency while there exists a phase lag the corresponding motion equations are shown in formula 1 where the h 0 and θ 0 represent the heaving amplitude and pitching amplitude respectively the f denotes the oscillating frequency ϕ0 is the phase difference between these two motions the value of ϕ0 is suggested to be set as 90 for the purpose of acquiring the optimal propulsive performance according to kinsey s work kinsey et al 2011 1 h t h 0 cos 2 π f t θ t θ 0 cos 2 π f t φ 0 as for the flexible deformation motion the abscissa vale of any point on the hydrofoil surface remains unchanged and only the ordinate undergoes harmonic motion taking the arbitrary point p x0 y0 on the surface of hydrofoil as an example the corresponding coordinates after the flexible deformation motion is set as p x 1 y 1 the relationship between the coordinate values before and after the motion is seen in formula 2 where xs represents the starting point of the flexible deformation motion f is the motion frequency which is set to be identical to the value of rigid motion frequency for the purpose of increasing the feasibility of prototyping manufacture a 0 is the motion amplitude of flexible deformable motion which serves as a parameter to control the amount of deformation 2 x 1 x 0 y 1 y 0 δ y x t y 0 a 0 sin 2 π f t x s c x s 2 in order to intuitively illustrate the motion process of current flexible oscillating wing with time varying camber deformation the motion process during one complete motion period is shown in fig 2 considering that the positive and negative signs of the a 0 plays detrimental role in determining the deformation attitudes of oscillating wing seen in fig 2 a therefore there exists much necessity to investigate them separately as can be vividly seen in fig 2 the flexible oscillating is initially located at the maximum displacement along the vertical direction at this time the pitching angle equals to 0 and there exists no deformation on the surface of current oscillating wing as the time goes on the flexible oscillating wing starts to move downward along the vertical direction accompanied with the pitching motion with respect to its pivot center besides that the harmonic deformation is taking place on the wing surface and the deformation magnitude reaches the maximum value at the t t 0 25 the flexible oscillating wing moves to the equilibrium position y 0 with the maximum value of pitching angle θ θ 0 and the deformation magnitude after that the flexible oscillating wing keeps moving downward accompanied by a reversed pitching motion and the deformation magnitude on the surface of oscillating wing decreases gradually until it becomes zero at the time of t t 0 50 the corresponding value of pitching angle and the heaving displacement are θ 0 and y h 0 respectively up to now the prescribed motion of the flexible oscillating wing in the first half cycle has been completed and the wing is about to start the second half cycle of motion considering the motion equations in formula 1 and 2 are all periodic and the wing itself is also geometrically symmetric therefore the motion attitudes of flexible oscillating wing in second half cycle is completely identical with that in the first half cycle hence no more description is required here the power consumed by the rigid oscillating wing is the sum of consumed power from the both heaving motion and pitching motion the power consumed by the heaving motion can be calculated as p y t y t v t where the y t and the v t represents the transient heaving force and heaving velocity along the vertical direction respectively similarly the power consumed by the pitching motion can be calculated as the product of the instantaneous pitching torque with respect to the pivot center m θ t and the pitching velocity ω t p θ t m θ t ω t apart from the power consumed by the rigid motion the power required to active the flexible deformation in this article is defined in formula 3 where the s represent the whole area of the oscillating wing p is the static pressure on the surface of the wing v n denotes the velocity in the direction normal to the surface of the wing surface 3 p d e f o r m s p v n d s thus the average input power p in required by the flexible oscillating system in single motion period can be expressed as 4 p i n 0 1 p y t p θ t p d e f o r m d t t the average output power p out of current flexible oscillating wing can be calculated as the product of average thrust force coefficient c t mean and the incoming flow velocity v p out c t mean v where the c t mean is the average value of thrust force coefficient and it can be calculated as formula 5 where t is the thrust force c t is the corresponding thrust force coefficient ρ is the density of the fluid v is the incoming velocity 5 c t m e a n 0 1 c t d t t 0 1 t 0 5 ρ v c 2 d t t therefore the propulsive efficiency of current flexible oscillating wing can be expressed as the ratio of the output power and the input power η pout pin 3 numerical methodology 3 1 navier stokes solver the unsteady flow filed of the oscillating wing can be considered as incompressible and viscous therefore the in compressible navier stokes equations of fluid motion can be expressed in equations 6 and 7 where u denotes the velocity vector f is the body force acting on the fluid and p is the pressure 6 u 0 7 d u d t f 1 ρ p ν 2 u the commercial code fluent 18 2 based on the control volume method is utilized to solve the two dimensional navier stokes equations in current study only the 2d simulation is carried out to simulate the flexible oscillating wing and the reason comes from two aspects for the one the emphasis of this study is to investigate the propulsive performance of current novel flexible oscillating wing as well as to make a comparison between the rigid oscillating wing and the flexible oscillating wing the other reason lies in that there exists little difference in the variation trends of hydrodynamic coefficients under different motion parameters between the 2d and 3d numerical simulation according to kinsey s research kinsey et al 2012 the characteristic reynolds number based on the chord length of oscillating wing and incoming velocity can be calculated as r e v c ν and the re number selected in current study is set as 1 0 106 where ν is the kinematic viscosity coefficient of the fluid the grid height of the boundary layer around the surface of flexible oscillating wing has also been adjusted to satisfy the requirement of y y u τ ν 1 where the y represents the height of the first layer grid point u τ is the friction velocity the transient reynolds averaged numerical computation was carried out to simulate the unsteady wing s oscillating motion as for the discretization of the governing equations the convective terms are discretised by using of the third order accuracy quick scheme while the diffusion terms discretization was realized by utilizing the second order accuracy central difference scheme when it comes to the time discretization a second order accurate backward implicit scheme was selected and the coupling between the velocity and pressure is achieved by means of the piso algorithm as described in a numerical study carried out by zhu et al zhu et al 2018 the single equation of spalart allmaras s a turbulence has the characteristic of simple and stable properties and it has been validated to be in good agreement with the experiment results in view of that the single equation of spalart allmaras s a turbulence will be utilized in following calculation 3 2 computational domain and boundary conditions a square like region with the length and width of 70c is selected as the computation domain whose geometric center coincides with the flexible oscillating wing s rotation center o the whole computation domain can be divided into two parts the stationary domain marked with the orange color and the motion zone in addition the motion zone also consists of two parts the rectangular shape marked with the blue color zone is used for the heaving motion by using of the dynamic layering technique while the circular shape marked with the red color with the radius of 5c seen in fig 3 c is utilized to realize the pitching motion and the flexible deformation motion in addition considering that the grids on the surface of oscillating wing are always in constant motion a grid smoothing technique is employed to satisfy the real time grid deformation requirements in our current design three sliding interfaces marked with interface1 interface3 are introduced for information exchange between the stationary zone and the motion zone seen in fig 3 a the sliding interface1 and interface2 are employed to satisfy the information exchange between motion domains of wing s heaving motion and stationary domain while the sliding interface3 is adopted to allow the information exchange between the motion domains of wing s pitching motion and the stationary domain considering that there exist two separate motions in current simulation hence two pre written user defined functions udfs are introduced to realize the above two motions in specific the define zone motion function is applied into the wing to achieve the prescribed heaving and pitching motion defined in equation 1 while the define grid motion function is utilized to achieve the prescribed deformation motion defined in equation 2 the meshes used in current study are all quadrilateral cells for the purpose of improving the calculation accuracy which are generated by the icem software and the dynamic stretch and compression grid method are utilized to enable the wing to fulfill the flexible deformation motion as for the boundary conditions setting the uniform free stream velocity inlet condition was applied to the upstream top and bottom boundaries with a turbulence intensity of 2 and viscosity ratio of 2 a zero static pressure conditions are applied to the outer boundary faces and the reference pressure is taken as 1 atm zhu et al 2018 in addition a normalized criterion for judging the convergence is established that the difference between the hydrodynamic coefficients ie the mean value of thrust force in single motion period and the propulsive efficiency generated in two successive motion periods should be less than 0 1 3 3 sensitivity study and code validation in this subsection the grid independence test the time steps in one motion period test ts t and the code validation test will be carried out in comparison with the calculation results of miao and ho s work and the corresponding results were shown in fig 4 miao et al 2006 in miao and ho s work a two dimensional naca0014 foil undergoing combined heaving motion and deflection motion was selected as the computation model and the motion equation of heaving motion is identical with that of our current study while the deflection motion is shown in formula 8 where a 0 denotes the deflection amplitude c is chord length of the wing ψ is the phase lag between the above two motions and the value is fixed as 90 in their simulation 8 y a 0 c x 2 cos 2 π f t ψ as for the grid independence test five sets of grid were designed and refinement ratio of mesh in two directions were 2 and the corresponding grid numbers are 4 2 104 8 4 104 1 68 104 3 36 105 and 6 72 105 respectively and the five grid codes are g1 to g5 respectively the motion parameters are set as h 0 0 4 a 0 0 7 re 1 0 104 fig 4 a presents the calculation results in mean value of drag force coefficients c d mean c t mean under five set of grids and it can be vividly seen from fig 4 a that the value of c d mean obtained in the first set of grid g1 yields obvious underestimation than the corresponding reference value with the grid number s continuous growth the difference between the calculation results and the reference value presents corresponding decrease and when the grid number alters from the g4 o g5 there exists little difference among them in view of this the fourth set of grid will be adopted in following calculation for the purpose of ensuring the calculation accuracy and saving the computation resources as for the time steps ts in single motion period test five different time steps were selected and the corresponding values are 1000 2000 3000 4000 and 5000 respectively the motion parameters are also set as h 0 0 4 a 0 0 7 re 1 0 104 and the corresponding testing results are shown in fig 4 b similar with fig 4 a when the value of time steps is set too small the difference between the calculation results and the reference value will be too obvious and the little the value of time step is the bigger the gap among the calculation results and the reference value will be when the value time steps exceeds 4000 the calculation difference between the calculation result and the reference result is less than 0 5 thus the time steps will be set as 4000 in following calculation for the balance of numerical accuracy and saving computation resource in order to validate the calculation accuracy of current numerical code the variation of the drag force coefficient c d as well as the lift force coefficient c l in single motion period is calculated and the results obtained by the miao and ho under the same calculation conditions are also included in fig 5 it can be vividly seen from fig 5 that our simulation results under current numerical code compare well with the miao and ho s work and there exists double peaks corresponding to the oscillating wing s up and down strokes which phenomenon is in good consistence with the dickinson s experimental results dickinson et al 1999 therefore it can be concluded that our newly developed numerical code is suitable for the simulation of flexible deformation wing considering that the typical reynolds number of the current study 1 0 106 is much higher than the re number in miao and ho s work 1 0 104 there exists much necessity in carrying out the validation test among similar re numbers in view of that another test has been carried out for the selected oscillating wing at different non dimensional oscillating frequencies f and fixed conditions of re 5 105 h 0 1 0 c θ 0 75 where the ν is the kinetic parameter of the fluid a comparison between the simulations results by using of our current code and results of kinsey kinsey et al 2011 is presented in table 1 it can be vividly seen from table 1 that our current calculation results are in good agreement with that of kinsey and the biggest difference among them is less than 5 0 meaning that our current numerical method should gain its due reliability 4 results and discussion considering that the main purpose of this study is to investigate the propulsive performance of flexible deformation oscillating wing the motion parameters of the rigid oscillating wing corresponding to equation 1 will be fixed as h 0 0 50 θ 30 unless otherwise specified in addition a non dimensional motion frequency f is introduced to give objective evaluation on propulsive performance of oscillating wing and it can be calculated as f fc v 4 1 effect of deformation amplitude on propulsive performance of current flexible oscillating wing in this subsection the influence of deformation amplitude a 0 on propulsive performance of current flexible oscillating wing will be analyzed as is stated above the deformation amplitude is of vital significance in flexible oscillating wing s motion attitudes in specific the magnitude of a 0 directly determines the defection amplitude of oscillating wing while the corresponding motion direction can be determined by the sign of a 0 therefore for the simplicity of expression here the deflection mode of oscillating wing is called deflection mode a when the value of a 0 is larger than zero otherwise is called deflection mode b in the following the impact of a 0 on propulsive performance of current oscillating wing will be carried out from the aspect of thrust force coefficient and the propulsive efficiency the motion parameters are set as f 0 25 xs 0 30 fig 6 shows the variation curves of mean value of thrust force coefficient c t mean under different deformation amplitudes and the value of rigid wing is also added in the figure corresponding to the condition that the a 0 of flexible deformation wing is 0 as is stated before investigation on propulsive performance of flexible deformation oscillating will be carried out under the two distinct motion modes when the deflection motion a is adopted the motion process of oscillating wing can be seen in fig 2 a the mean value of c t mean generated by the wing s oscillating motion is much lower than that of the traditional rigid wing in particular when the a 0 equals to 0 15 the c t mean of flexible deformation wing 0 122 is reduced by 70 4 compared with that value of rigid oscillating wing 0 412 with the further increase of a 0 the sign of c t mean turns into the opposite side when the a 0 exceeds 0 225 meaning that no more thrust force will be produced under that deflection mode thus it can be concluded that the deflection mode a is not favorable for the flexible deformation oscillating wing on the other hand when the a 0 value is smaller than 0 the deflection mode b will be utilized by the flexible oscillating wing as can be seen in fig 6 the c t mean shows the continuous growth with the further increase of a 0 and when the a 0 equals to 0 75 the corresponding c t mean has increased by 111 16 than that value of rigid wing therefore it can be concluded that the deflection mode b is favorable for the propulsive performance of flexible deformation oscillating wing fig 7 presents the variation curves of oscillating wing s thrust force coefficient in one complete motion period as evidently seen in fig 7 there exist double peaks and valleys in the thrust force coefficient curve of oscillating wing during one complete motion period that is the changing period of thrust force coefficient is half of the oscillating wing s motion period that phenomenon is consistent with that of rigid wing besides that when the a 0 is larger than 0 seen in fig 7 a the thrust force coefficient curves of oscillating wing gradually moves downward along the coordinate axis with the further increase of a 0 and especially when the a 0 0 75 the corresponding thrust force coefficient curve is almost located in the negative half axis of the coordinate axis only when the non dimensional motion time t t lies in the range of 0 4375 0 5 and 0 875 1 0 the corresponding c t mean is positive meaning that only a few thrust force is generated during the whole motion process of oscillating wing that s why the corresponding c t mean is negative in addition the motion time corresponding to the peak value of c t mean moves backward which is the higher the a 0 is the later the highest thrust force will be obtained it can be concluded that when the deflection motion a a 0 0 is adopted by the flexible oscillating wing the thrust force coefficient will be greatly reduced or even turn into the negative value and the motion time corresponding to the highest thrust force coefficient will be greatly delayed which will produce detrimental effect on the propulsive performance of flexible deformation oscillating wing on the other side when the a 0 is 0 seen in fig 7 b the variation curves of oscillating wing s thrust force coefficient keeps moving upward with the increase of a 0 especially when the a 0 equals to 0 75 the corresponding variation curve of thrust force coefficient is almost located in the positive axis of the coordinate axis only when the non dimensional motion time t t lies in the range of 0 0 1875 and 0 5625 0 625 the corresponding thrust force coefficient is negative that is to say the thrust force generated by the flexible deformation oscillating wing in a whole motion period is almost positive and therefore the resulting c t mean is positive besides that it can be also gotten from fig 7 b that the higher the a 0 is the little the motion time corresponding to the peak value of c t will be meaning that the increase of a 0 promotes the earlier coming of the highest thrust force coefficient which is contrary to that phenomenon of a 0 0 therefore it can be concluded that the deflection mode b utilized by the flexible deformation oscillating wing is of great benefit for the propulsive performance of current flexible oscillating wing fig 8 presents the contours of static pressure distributions and velocity streamlines around the flexible oscillating wing at t t 0 25 under different values of a 0 when the a 0 0 shown in fig 8 a obvious pressure difference emerges on the upper and lower surface of the flexible oscillating wing and a positive pressure zone emerges in the deformation direction of oscillating wing corresponding to the left upper side while a negative pressure zone appears in the opposite direction the resulting pressure difference points to the right lower side which is opposite to the flexible wing s advancing direction proving an explanation why the deflection mode a will produce adverse effect upon the flexible oscillating wing s propulsive performance apart from that it can be also shown in fig 8 a that the pressure difference between the two sides of oscillating wing exhibits gradual increase with the constant growth of a 0 and the resulting drag force along the horizontal direction also presents simultaneous increase which may explain why the corresponding c t mean keeps cutting down with the constant increase of a 0 on the other side when the a 0 turns into the negative value seen in fig 8 b an apparent pressure difference also emerges around the two sides of flexible oscillating wing however compared with fig 8 a the positive pressure zone moves to the right lower direction of oscillating which is contrary to the oscillating wing s deformation direction the corresponding negative pressure zone moves to the left upper direction the resulting force generated by the pressure difference along the horizontal direction is identical with the oscillating wing s advancing direction that s why the deformation mode b adopted by the oscillating wing promotes the flexible oscillating wing s propulsive performance similar with the a 0 0 the pressure difference between the upper and lower side of oscillating wing shows continuous growth with the increase of a 0 and the corresponding thrust force along the horizontal direction also exhibits obvious growth which may explain the numerical results gotten in fig 6 fig 9 presents the variation curves of propulsive efficiency of flexible oscillating wing under different deformation amplitudes and the corresponding value of rigid wing is also added in fig 9 considering that when the a 0 exceeds 0 15 no more thrust force will be generated hence only the case of a 0 is less than 0 15 will be investigated here as can be vividly seen in fig 9 the obvious change has been taken place after the introduction of the flexible motion in specific when the a 0 is larger than zero the propulsive efficiency shows rapid decrease as a result of the large reduction of thrust force coefficient and the propulsive efficiency of flexible oscillating is lower than that of rigid wing that conclusion is in good agreement with the results acquired above when it comes to a 0 0 the propulsive efficiency increases first and then shows gradual decrease as the a 0 keeps increasing and there exists an optimum a 0 leading to the highest propulsive efficiency in specific when the a 0 equals to 0 30 the highest propulsive efficiency obtained by the flexible oscillating wing is 60 3 increased by 28 3 than the value of rigid wing 47 with the further increase of a 0 although the c t mean of flexible oscillating wing increase constantly the corresponding value of propulsive efficiency presents sharp decrease meaning that the growth of a 0 will surely does much good on improving the output of the oscillating wing s system mainly reflected in the thrust force coefficient the input power of the system increases greatly at the same time which is mainly used for overcoming the energy consumed by the oscillating wing s surface deflection in other words acquiring a larger thrust force serves no purpose if it is achieved at the expense of decreased propulsive efficiency in order to give an explanation for the numerical results obtained from fig 9 the vortex structures around the flexible oscillating wing at t t 0 25 under different values of a 0 is presented in fig 10 the z vorticity is introduced to evaluate the vortex field and it can be calculated as z v y u x where the u and v are the horizontal and vertical velocity in the flow field respectively the vortex structures in fig 10 clearly demonstrates that there exists shedding vortex structures on the both upper and lower surface of flexible oscillating wing under different value of a 0 and the vortex structures shedding from the upper surface of oscillating wing presents anticlockwise rotation while the corresponding vortex structures shedding from the lower surface exhibits clockwise rotation and the two types of vortex structures finally forms into an anti carmen vortex street in the flow field of the flexible oscillating wing generating a backward jet according to the theorem of impulse a forward impulse is obtained by the flexible oscillating wing therefore a forward thrust force is acquired to enhance its propulsive performance in addition it can be also vividly seen from fig 10 that the vortex intensity on the upper surface of flexible oscillating wing increase first and then decrease with the constant growth of a 0 and the highest value of vortex intensity is obtained when a 0 0 30 in contrast the vortex intensity on the lower surface of flexible oscillating wing firstly decrease and then increase the smallest value of vortex intensity is acquired at a 0 0 30 since the magnitude of vortex density directly indicates the degree of energy dissipation thus the energy consumption of the system under the condition of a 0 0 30 reaches minimum and the highest propulsive efficiency can be obtained in addition from the perspective of the motion process the pitching angle of the oscillating wing is going to decrease as well as to rotate clockwise at the next moment the increase of the vortex intensity on the lower surface of the oscillating wing will execute a clockwise torque on the oscillating wing which is consistent with the oscillating wing s following motion which may also explain why the higher propulsive efficiency is obtained under that working condition 4 2 effect of non dimensional frequency on propulsive performance of current flexible oscillating wing in this subsection the influence of non dimensional oscillating frequency on propulsive performance of current flexible oscillating wing will be analyzed and the comparison with the conventional rigid wing will be also carried out other motion parameters are set as a 0 0 30 xs 0 30 the mean value of thrust force coefficient and propulsive efficiency of flapping foil under different non dimensional oscillating frequencies are shown in fig 11 as for the mean value of thrust force coefficient seen in fig 11 a the c t mean of rigid oscillating wing and the flexible oscillating wing increase synchronously with the growth of non dimensional oscillating frequency and the propulsive efficiency of flexible wing is higher than that of rigid wing under a constant oscillating frequency for example the c t mean of flexible oscillating wing reaches 3 025 when f equals to 0 5 which is 71 1 higher than that of rigid oscillating wing 1 768 meaning that the introduction of flexible oscillating wing promotes the improvement of oscillating wing s propulsive performance the reason for the increase of c t mean can be referred to fig 12 and fig 13 which exhibits the contours of pressure distribution and static pressure coefficient under three typical non dimensional oscillating frequencies as vividly shown in figs 12 and 13 there exists obvious pressure difference between the upper and lower surface of flexible oscillating wing and when the f 0 10 the positive pressure and the negative pressure zones emerge in the left upper and right lower of the oscillating wing respectively and the resulting force along the horizontal directional is opposite to the oscillating wing s advancing direction that s why the negative thrust force is generated seen in fig 11 a when the f is larger than 0 10 0 25 and 0 50 the positive and negative pressure zone are interchanged compared with the situation of f 0 10 thus the positive thrust force will be acquired apart from that the pressure difference between the upper side and lower side shows gradual increase with the constant growth of f and the resulting force along the advancing direction increase accordingly which is responsible for the phenomenon that the c t mean shows corresponding growth with increase of f as for the propulsive efficiency seen in fig 11 b the η value of oscillating wing exhibits obvious enhancement after the introductio n of flexible deflection motion and the effect of enhancement is more remarkable when the value of f is less than 0 30 besides that the propulsive efficiency of rigid and flexible oscillating increases first and then decrease and there exists an optimum f leading to highest propulsive efficiency the optimum value of f corresponding to highest propulsive efficiency for the flexible and rigid oscillating wing are 0 25 and 0 30 respectively meaning that the optimum f of oscillating wing will come ahead of time after the introduction of the flexible deflection motion in addition compared with the rigid oscillating wing the maximum propulsive efficiency value of flexible oscillating wing has increased by 11 5 the vortex flow fields of the flexible deformation oscillating wing under five non dimensional oscillating frequencies are presented in fig 14 to give a reasonable explanation for the numerical results gotten above the vortex structures shedding from the flexible oscillating wing under different values of f can be vividly seen in fig 14 and a vortex ring structures emerged at the rear part of oscillating wing the vortex intensity on the upper surface of flexible oscillating wing presents the tendency of decreasing first and then increasing and the minimum value is acquired when the f 0 25 on the other hand the vortex intensity on the lower surface of flexible oscillating wing presents the opposite changing tendency and the maximum value of vortex intensity is obtained at the same value of f 0 25 as stated before the smaller the vortex intensity is the little the energy consumption will be which may provide an explanation for why the highest propulsive efficiency is acquired at f 0 25 considering that the non dimensional oscillating frequency plays a key role in evaluating the propulsive performance of flexible oscillating wing there exists much necessity to carry out the analysis on the evolution process of flexible oscillating wing since the geometry shapes as well as the motion equation are both symmetrical hence only half of the motion period will be analyzed and the corresponding vortex evolution process under three typical value of f are presented in fig 15 as can be seen in fig 15 the leading edge vortices lev appear on the lower surface of flexible oscillating wing at the initial motion time under different oscillating frequencies and the lev keeps moving downward and eventually turned into trailing edge vortices tev at the motion time of t 0 50 t in addition the obvious detached vortex structures and the streamline separation on the lower surface of flexible oscillating wing can be easily observed in fig 15 when the f 0 10 the existence of streamline separation on the lower surface of oscillating wing pushes the local streamlines out resulting in an up ward bending on the surface of oscillating wing while the flexible oscillating wing is going to bend and deform in opposite direction in the next moment therefore the existence of detached vortex structure and the streamline separation shall lead to much energy consumption which will produce detrimental effect on the propulsive performance of flexible oscillating wing the similar phenomenon of streamline separation can be also detected when f 0 50 and the difference lies in that the streamline separation has taken place on the upper side of the flexible oscillating wing when the f equals to 0 25 there exists little streamline separation meaning that fewer energy is consumed that s why the higher propulsive efficiency can be obtained 4 3 effect of defection position on propulsive performance of current flexible oscillating wing in this subsection the effect of deflection position along the direction of wing s chord length on flexible oscillating wing s propulsive performance will be analyzed other motion parameters are set as a 0 0 3 f 0 25 the variation curves of thrust force coefficient and corresponding mean value of flexible oscillating foil under different deflection positions are presented in fig 16 as can be seen in fig 16 a the variation curve of thrust force coefficient keeps moving downward along the axis of coordinate when the deflection position moves backward along the chord length of oscillating wing in particular when xs 0 the thrust force coefficient of flexible deformation oscillating wing is located in the negative half axis only when the non dimensional time t t lies in the range of 0 0 1875 and 0 53 0 65 however when the deflection position changes into 1 0 the majority of the thrust force coefficient s variation curves are located in the negative half of the axis the corresponding value of t t lies in the range of 0 0 4125 and 0 49 0 7835 as for the mean value of thrust force coefficient seen in fig 16 b the value of c t mean presents a tendency of gradual decrease and when the xs is larger than 0 90 the corresponding value of c t mean turns into a negative magnitude meaning that no positive thrust force will be generated in addition it can be also noted from fig 16 b that the c t mean of flexible oscillating wing is larger than that of rigid oscillating wing when xs is less than 0 60 especially when xs 0 the c t mean of oscillating wing is almost twice that of rigid oscillating wing while when the xs 0 60 the value of c t mean are almost identical with each other with the further increase of xs the c t mean of flexible oscillating wing starts to be less than that of rigid oscillating wing therefore a conclusion can be drawn that the c t mean of flexible oscillating wing will keep decreasing until it becomes negative fig 17 exhibits the pressure distribution of current flexible oscillating wing under three typical deflection positions and it can be easily gotten that the a positive pressure zone is shown in the right lower part of the oscillating wing while a negative pressure zone emerges in left upper part and the direction of pressure difference is identical with that of the oscillating wing s advancing direction thus a positive thrust force can be acquired besides that it can be also see from fig 17 that the pressure difference between upper surface and lower surface presents gradual decrease with the growth of xs resulting in the gradual decrease of c t mean with the further increase of xs as seen in fig 17 d and fig 17 e the positive pressure zone moves to the upper left part of wing while the negative pressure zone presents the lower right part and the direction of the pressure difference is opposite to the flexible deformation wing s advancing direction that s why a negative thrust force is generated under these motion conditions the propulsive efficiency curves of current flexible oscillating wing are shown in fig 18 and the propulsive efficiency presents a tendency of increasing first and then decreasing with the growth of xs and there exists an optimum value of xs leading to the highest propulsive efficiency and the location of the deflection position coincides with the rotation center of rigid wing xs xr 0 30 besides that it can be also acquired from fig 18 that when the value of xs is less than 0 45 the propulsive efficiency of flexible oscillating wing is larger than that of rigid oscillating wing and the propulsive efficiency reaches the highest value when the xs 0 30 a conclusion can be drawn that the value of xs plays vital role in improving the propulsive efficiency of flexible deformation oscillating wing and the highest propulsive efficiency will be acquired when the deflection position coincides with the rotation center of rigid wing which can provide much guidance for the future design of prototype the vortex structures around the flexible oscillating wing at t t 0 25 under four typical values of xs are presented in fig 19 and it can be easily found that the vortex intensity on the surface of flexible oscillating wing presents a tendency of increasing first and then deceasing with the further increase of the xs and the highest vortex intensity is acquired in xs 0 30 as is stated before the higher the vortex intensity is the little the energy consumption will be as well as a higher value of propulsive efficiency will be obtained 5 conclusions in this article a novel conceptual design of flexible oscillating is introduced by adding a time varying camber deformation to the conventional rigid oscillating wing and a two dimensional transient numerical simulation is carried out to evaluate the propulsive performance of current flexible oscillating wing by using of the commercial software code ansys fluent 18 2 conclusions acquired in this article can be summarized as 1 the effect of deflection amplitude a 0 on the propulsive performance of oscillating wing has been analyzed and the numerical simulation results shows that the deflection motion type a a 0 0 will produce the detrimental effect on the wing s propulsive performance while the deflection motion type b a 0 0 does much good on improving the propulsive performance by increasing the thrust force coefficients greatly the propulsive efficiency presents a tendency of increasing first and then decreasing and there exists optimum a 0 leading to the highest propulsive efficiency and the maximum value can be increased by 28 3 compared with that of conventional rigid wing 2 a non dimensional oscillating frequency f combining the effect of motion amplitude motion frequency and the incoming velocity is introduced to give an accurate evaluation on the propulsive performance of flexible oscillating wing similar with the a 0 the thrust force coefficient shows conformable increase with the growth of f while the propulsive efficiency climbs to the peak value and decrease subsequently and there also exists optimum value of f corresponding to the highest propulsive efficiency in addition the optimum value of f is smaller than that of rigid oscillating wing meaning that a smaller oscillating frequency is required for the flexible oscillating wing to acquire the highest propulsive efficiency 3 the position of deflection motion xs also plays vital role in deciding the propulsive efficiency of flexible oscillating wing and the numerical results demonstrate that the more backward the deformation position is the smaller the thrust force coefficient will be within the range of numerical calculation conditions as for the propulsive efficiency the highest propulsive will be acquired when the deflection position coincides with the rotation centre of rigid oscillating wing that conclusion is of vital significance for the future design of prototype credit authorship contribution statement

20449,in this article a new conceptual design of flexible oscillating wing with time varying camber deformation is introduced and the two dimensional transient numerical simulation has also been conducted to compare the propulsive performance of current flexible oscillating wing with that of conventional rigid oscillating wing by using of the commercial software ansys fluent 18 2 coupled with the dynamic mesh technique at moderate high reynolds number of 1 0 106 in addition the influence of the deflection amplitude the deflection frequency as well as the deflection position along the chord length of the wing on the propulsive performance of current flexible oscillating wing have been analyzed the numerical simulation results demonstrate that the introduction of flexible deformation motion does much good on improving the propulsive performance of oscillating wing and there exists optimum motion parameters leading to the highest propulsive efficiency compared with the conventional rigid oscillating wing the existence of flexible deformation motion presents greater propulsive efficiency by largely increasing the thrust force within the whole period of motion and the maximum value of η can be increased by 28 3 compared with that of conventional rigid wing furthermore the results also reveal that the optimum deflection motion should coincide with the rotation center of rigid motion and that conclusion provides much benefit for the future design of prototype manufacture keywords oscillating wing flexible deformation dynamic mesh technique propulsive performance 1 introduction in recent years the underwater bionic propulsion technique has become a research hot spot the aquatic creatures have successfully applied the physical principles of unsteady hydrodynamics to acquire excellent motion abilities after hundreds of millions of years of evolution and among them the oscillating wing swimming mode of mammals such as fishes and penguins has the characteristics of high speed high propulsive efficiency low noise good maneuverability etc which cannot be compared by current man made ships or underwater vehicles liu et al 2020 works of researching learning imitating and other means to copy and reconstruct the motion characteristics and functions of these oscillating wings and applying them to underwater vehicles are of great significance to improve the motion ability of underwater vehicles therefore plenty of works concerning about the hydrodynamic performance and mechanism of oscillating wing have been conducted by scholars and researchers from both at home and abroad the bionic propulsion using oscillating wing is a relatively new field of research and the pioneering work has been conducted by lighthill lighthill et al 1971 who successfully applied the two dimensional wing theory of aerodynamics into the oscillating wing s bionic propulsion and a novel theory of slender body has been proposed ignoring the changes of flow fields caused by the wing s oscillating motion after that wu has proposed a two dimensional wavy plate theory by utilizing the linear potential theory wu et al 1971 in this theory the oscillating wing can be regarded as an elastic plate and the motion of two dimensional oscillating wing was analyzed by referring to the method of studying the wing s vibration deformation in the air tong and zhuang has extended that theory into the three dimensional wavy plate theory by using of the semi analytical and semi numerical method and that theory has been widely recognized and adopted by plenty of international scholars apart from the theoretical study researches concerning the oscillating wing also involve experimental research and numerical simulation in the experimental aspect freymuth firstly observed that when the positive thrust force is generated the shedding vortex in the flow field of oscillating wing presented an anti karmen vortex street distribution the similar flow structures was also detected by lu and kim by using of the dye emission technique freymuth et al 1988 jeanmond and olivier have captured the boundary layer structure and have explained reason why the positive thrust force was generated form the view of flow stability jeanmond et al 2017 the early measurement of the flow field mainly relies on wire film anemometer technology and the biggest disadvantage is that the flow field velocity can be easily influenced when it is used and only single point can be measured failing to collect the information of whole flow field and instantaneous flow structure with the development of measurement technology the piv and dpiv technology are increasingly utilized in flow field measurement plenty of works have been conducted to acquire the instantaneous flow velocity and vortex in the flow field of oscillating wing by utilizing the piv and dpiv technology the experimental measurement objects involves the naca series of wings flat plates and real fishtail shape the motion trajectory of oscillating wing ranges from standard sinusoidal motion to non sinusoidal motion the characteristic reynolds number alters from 4 102 1 0 106 lu et al 2015 le et al 2013 kim et al 2017 young et al 2013 tian et al 2016 besides that there has also been a lot of numerical work in past decades and several typical numerical methods have been established to simulate the flapping foil s unsteady motion e g dynamic grid method or sling mesh technique overset grid method boundary element method bem and immersed boundary method ibm early numerical simulation of oscillating wing was mainly based on potential flow theory and the panel element method is the most widely used among them pan et al 2012 mantia et al 2009 priovolos et al 2018 filippas et al 2018 xu and wu 2013 abbaspour et al 2018 politis et al 2016 liu et al 2017 the numerical simulation based on potential flow theory has acquired some valuable results in the hydrodynamic performance prediction of oscillating wing compared with the cfd method it takes less time and the programming is relatively simple however the numerical calculation accuracy is relatively low for the sake of ignoring the effect of viscosity with the development of computer and computational fluid dynamics increasing number of direct numerical simulation dns work has been carries out and the biggest benefit of dns lies in that the flow field of oscillating wing can be better reflected and more relevant details will be captured dong et al 2006 pan et al 2014 dong et al 2006 lin et al 2018 park et al 2016 majumdar et al 2020 huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 2020b however constrained by the computation resource and method the current dns method is only applicable in the low and medium reynolds number which is much lower than that of flying birds and swimming fish and the fluid mechanism behind still remains unclear all the work mentioned above has mainly focused on investigating the hydrodynamic performance of rigid oscillating wing and there exists little deformation on the surface of wing during the whole motion process in fact both the fish s wing and bird s fin are elastic and they can use the deformable structure to improve their own motion ability therefore there exists much necessity to investigate the propulsive performance of flexible oscillating wing there are actually a few works investigating the effect of flexible deformation on propulsive performance of oscillating wing in miao s work the effect of camber deformation on propulsive performance of a two dimensional oscillating wing was investigated by using the commercial software fluent 6 1 and the characteristic reynolds number in their study ranges from 102 to 104 in their study the simulation result shows that the highest propulsive efficiency can be increased by 30 73 and the optimum motion frequency leading to highest propulsive efficiency varies with the reynolds number miao et al 2006 similar work has also been conducted by the hoke et al and the reynolds number chosen in their work is 1100 hoke et al 2015 which is identical with that in miao s work the difference among them lies in that both the propulsive performance and energy harvesting property of flexible oscillating wing are investigated priovolos carried out hydroelastic analysis on the propulsive performance of flexible oscillating wing by using the vortex based method and the numerical results show that the chordwise flexibility can significantly improve the propulsive efficiency of oscillating wing in their work 10 increase in propulsive efficiency has been reported compared with the rigid oscillating wing priovolos et al 2018 the characteristic reynolds number selected in the above works are all around the order of 104 which is far less than the reynolds number of creatures undertaking the oscillating motion re 105 108 therefore there exists much necessity to carry out the analysis on the hydrodynamic performance of flexible wing within the range of realistic reynolds number to further improve the propulsive efficiency of oscillating wing the current study proposed a novel conceptual design of flexible oscillating wing seen in fig 1 where the wing surface can undergoes constant deformation during the whole motion period to obtain more energy from the flow field so as to improve the propulsive performance of oscillating wing in this article a transient 2d numerical simulation based on the dynamic mesh technique is employed to investigate the effect of flexible deformation on the propulsive performance of oscillating wing at the reynolds number of 106 in addition the effect of deflection parameters such as deflection amplitude deflection frequency and the deflection position along the chord length of wing on the propulsive efficiency will be analyzed and discussed the structure of this article is organized as followed in the second part the physical model will be introduced accompanying with the motion equation of flexible oscillating wing as well as the definition of hydrodynamic parameters thereafter the numerical method as well as the validation of current code will be presented in sec 3 followed by the analysis of the effect of motion parameters on flexible oscillating wing s propulsive performance and the concluding remarks will be drawn in the final part 2 research object the physical model selected in current study is a two dimensional naca0012 wing and the chord length of the wing is taken as the characteristic length c the rotation point located at the center line of the foil with a distance xr from the leading edge which is one third the chord length the reason why the naca0012 wing is selected comes from the two aspects for the one our intention of simulation is basically from the pioneer simulation work of biomimetic propulsion studies by shao et al 2010 and pan et al 2014 in which propulsive performance of a two dimensional oscillating wing was numerical investigated with a comparative small reynolds number re 200 our current study can be considered as an extension of these pioneer works instead to the simulation work of small reynolds number the current work focus on the propulsive performance of oscillating wing at moderate high reynolds number re 1 0 106 and the time varying camber deformation was also given the due consideration for another according to the asharf s study abbaspour and najafi 2018 when the thickness of wing lies in the range of 12 20 the highest value of c t mean mean value of thrust force coefficient will be obtained and there exists small difference among the corresponding values in view of that the naca wing with the thickness of 12 naca0012 is selected in our study for the purpose of achieving the comparative propulsive performance the oscillating wing motion in our study consists of two parts the rigid motion and the flexible deformation motion as for the rigid motion the oscillating wing undergoes so called heaving pitching motion that is the heaving motion along the vertical direction as well as the pitching motion with respect to its pivot center o both the two motions execute harmonic motion with the same motion frequency while there exists a phase lag the corresponding motion equations are shown in formula 1 where the h 0 and θ 0 represent the heaving amplitude and pitching amplitude respectively the f denotes the oscillating frequency ϕ0 is the phase difference between these two motions the value of ϕ0 is suggested to be set as 90 for the purpose of acquiring the optimal propulsive performance according to kinsey s work kinsey et al 2011 1 h t h 0 cos 2 π f t θ t θ 0 cos 2 π f t φ 0 as for the flexible deformation motion the abscissa vale of any point on the hydrofoil surface remains unchanged and only the ordinate undergoes harmonic motion taking the arbitrary point p x0 y0 on the surface of hydrofoil as an example the corresponding coordinates after the flexible deformation motion is set as p x 1 y 1 the relationship between the coordinate values before and after the motion is seen in formula 2 where xs represents the starting point of the flexible deformation motion f is the motion frequency which is set to be identical to the value of rigid motion frequency for the purpose of increasing the feasibility of prototyping manufacture a 0 is the motion amplitude of flexible deformable motion which serves as a parameter to control the amount of deformation 2 x 1 x 0 y 1 y 0 δ y x t y 0 a 0 sin 2 π f t x s c x s 2 in order to intuitively illustrate the motion process of current flexible oscillating wing with time varying camber deformation the motion process during one complete motion period is shown in fig 2 considering that the positive and negative signs of the a 0 plays detrimental role in determining the deformation attitudes of oscillating wing seen in fig 2 a therefore there exists much necessity to investigate them separately as can be vividly seen in fig 2 the flexible oscillating is initially located at the maximum displacement along the vertical direction at this time the pitching angle equals to 0 and there exists no deformation on the surface of current oscillating wing as the time goes on the flexible oscillating wing starts to move downward along the vertical direction accompanied with the pitching motion with respect to its pivot center besides that the harmonic deformation is taking place on the wing surface and the deformation magnitude reaches the maximum value at the t t 0 25 the flexible oscillating wing moves to the equilibrium position y 0 with the maximum value of pitching angle θ θ 0 and the deformation magnitude after that the flexible oscillating wing keeps moving downward accompanied by a reversed pitching motion and the deformation magnitude on the surface of oscillating wing decreases gradually until it becomes zero at the time of t t 0 50 the corresponding value of pitching angle and the heaving displacement are θ 0 and y h 0 respectively up to now the prescribed motion of the flexible oscillating wing in the first half cycle has been completed and the wing is about to start the second half cycle of motion considering the motion equations in formula 1 and 2 are all periodic and the wing itself is also geometrically symmetric therefore the motion attitudes of flexible oscillating wing in second half cycle is completely identical with that in the first half cycle hence no more description is required here the power consumed by the rigid oscillating wing is the sum of consumed power from the both heaving motion and pitching motion the power consumed by the heaving motion can be calculated as p y t y t v t where the y t and the v t represents the transient heaving force and heaving velocity along the vertical direction respectively similarly the power consumed by the pitching motion can be calculated as the product of the instantaneous pitching torque with respect to the pivot center m θ t and the pitching velocity ω t p θ t m θ t ω t apart from the power consumed by the rigid motion the power required to active the flexible deformation in this article is defined in formula 3 where the s represent the whole area of the oscillating wing p is the static pressure on the surface of the wing v n denotes the velocity in the direction normal to the surface of the wing surface 3 p d e f o r m s p v n d s thus the average input power p in required by the flexible oscillating system in single motion period can be expressed as 4 p i n 0 1 p y t p θ t p d e f o r m d t t the average output power p out of current flexible oscillating wing can be calculated as the product of average thrust force coefficient c t mean and the incoming flow velocity v p out c t mean v where the c t mean is the average value of thrust force coefficient and it can be calculated as formula 5 where t is the thrust force c t is the corresponding thrust force coefficient ρ is the density of the fluid v is the incoming velocity 5 c t m e a n 0 1 c t d t t 0 1 t 0 5 ρ v c 2 d t t therefore the propulsive efficiency of current flexible oscillating wing can be expressed as the ratio of the output power and the input power η pout pin 3 numerical methodology 3 1 navier stokes solver the unsteady flow filed of the oscillating wing can be considered as incompressible and viscous therefore the in compressible navier stokes equations of fluid motion can be expressed in equations 6 and 7 where u denotes the velocity vector f is the body force acting on the fluid and p is the pressure 6 u 0 7 d u d t f 1 ρ p ν 2 u the commercial code fluent 18 2 based on the control volume method is utilized to solve the two dimensional navier stokes equations in current study only the 2d simulation is carried out to simulate the flexible oscillating wing and the reason comes from two aspects for the one the emphasis of this study is to investigate the propulsive performance of current novel flexible oscillating wing as well as to make a comparison between the rigid oscillating wing and the flexible oscillating wing the other reason lies in that there exists little difference in the variation trends of hydrodynamic coefficients under different motion parameters between the 2d and 3d numerical simulation according to kinsey s research kinsey et al 2012 the characteristic reynolds number based on the chord length of oscillating wing and incoming velocity can be calculated as r e v c ν and the re number selected in current study is set as 1 0 106 where ν is the kinematic viscosity coefficient of the fluid the grid height of the boundary layer around the surface of flexible oscillating wing has also been adjusted to satisfy the requirement of y y u τ ν 1 where the y represents the height of the first layer grid point u τ is the friction velocity the transient reynolds averaged numerical computation was carried out to simulate the unsteady wing s oscillating motion as for the discretization of the governing equations the convective terms are discretised by using of the third order accuracy quick scheme while the diffusion terms discretization was realized by utilizing the second order accuracy central difference scheme when it comes to the time discretization a second order accurate backward implicit scheme was selected and the coupling between the velocity and pressure is achieved by means of the piso algorithm as described in a numerical study carried out by zhu et al zhu et al 2018 the single equation of spalart allmaras s a turbulence has the characteristic of simple and stable properties and it has been validated to be in good agreement with the experiment results in view of that the single equation of spalart allmaras s a turbulence will be utilized in following calculation 3 2 computational domain and boundary conditions a square like region with the length and width of 70c is selected as the computation domain whose geometric center coincides with the flexible oscillating wing s rotation center o the whole computation domain can be divided into two parts the stationary domain marked with the orange color and the motion zone in addition the motion zone also consists of two parts the rectangular shape marked with the blue color zone is used for the heaving motion by using of the dynamic layering technique while the circular shape marked with the red color with the radius of 5c seen in fig 3 c is utilized to realize the pitching motion and the flexible deformation motion in addition considering that the grids on the surface of oscillating wing are always in constant motion a grid smoothing technique is employed to satisfy the real time grid deformation requirements in our current design three sliding interfaces marked with interface1 interface3 are introduced for information exchange between the stationary zone and the motion zone seen in fig 3 a the sliding interface1 and interface2 are employed to satisfy the information exchange between motion domains of wing s heaving motion and stationary domain while the sliding interface3 is adopted to allow the information exchange between the motion domains of wing s pitching motion and the stationary domain considering that there exist two separate motions in current simulation hence two pre written user defined functions udfs are introduced to realize the above two motions in specific the define zone motion function is applied into the wing to achieve the prescribed heaving and pitching motion defined in equation 1 while the define grid motion function is utilized to achieve the prescribed deformation motion defined in equation 2 the meshes used in current study are all quadrilateral cells for the purpose of improving the calculation accuracy which are generated by the icem software and the dynamic stretch and compression grid method are utilized to enable the wing to fulfill the flexible deformation motion as for the boundary conditions setting the uniform free stream velocity inlet condition was applied to the upstream top and bottom boundaries with a turbulence intensity of 2 and viscosity ratio of 2 a zero static pressure conditions are applied to the outer boundary faces and the reference pressure is taken as 1 atm zhu et al 2018 in addition a normalized criterion for judging the convergence is established that the difference between the hydrodynamic coefficients ie the mean value of thrust force in single motion period and the propulsive efficiency generated in two successive motion periods should be less than 0 1 3 3 sensitivity study and code validation in this subsection the grid independence test the time steps in one motion period test ts t and the code validation test will be carried out in comparison with the calculation results of miao and ho s work and the corresponding results were shown in fig 4 miao et al 2006 in miao and ho s work a two dimensional naca0014 foil undergoing combined heaving motion and deflection motion was selected as the computation model and the motion equation of heaving motion is identical with that of our current study while the deflection motion is shown in formula 8 where a 0 denotes the deflection amplitude c is chord length of the wing ψ is the phase lag between the above two motions and the value is fixed as 90 in their simulation 8 y a 0 c x 2 cos 2 π f t ψ as for the grid independence test five sets of grid were designed and refinement ratio of mesh in two directions were 2 and the corresponding grid numbers are 4 2 104 8 4 104 1 68 104 3 36 105 and 6 72 105 respectively and the five grid codes are g1 to g5 respectively the motion parameters are set as h 0 0 4 a 0 0 7 re 1 0 104 fig 4 a presents the calculation results in mean value of drag force coefficients c d mean c t mean under five set of grids and it can be vividly seen from fig 4 a that the value of c d mean obtained in the first set of grid g1 yields obvious underestimation than the corresponding reference value with the grid number s continuous growth the difference between the calculation results and the reference value presents corresponding decrease and when the grid number alters from the g4 o g5 there exists little difference among them in view of this the fourth set of grid will be adopted in following calculation for the purpose of ensuring the calculation accuracy and saving the computation resources as for the time steps ts in single motion period test five different time steps were selected and the corresponding values are 1000 2000 3000 4000 and 5000 respectively the motion parameters are also set as h 0 0 4 a 0 0 7 re 1 0 104 and the corresponding testing results are shown in fig 4 b similar with fig 4 a when the value of time steps is set too small the difference between the calculation results and the reference value will be too obvious and the little the value of time step is the bigger the gap among the calculation results and the reference value will be when the value time steps exceeds 4000 the calculation difference between the calculation result and the reference result is less than 0 5 thus the time steps will be set as 4000 in following calculation for the balance of numerical accuracy and saving computation resource in order to validate the calculation accuracy of current numerical code the variation of the drag force coefficient c d as well as the lift force coefficient c l in single motion period is calculated and the results obtained by the miao and ho under the same calculation conditions are also included in fig 5 it can be vividly seen from fig 5 that our simulation results under current numerical code compare well with the miao and ho s work and there exists double peaks corresponding to the oscillating wing s up and down strokes which phenomenon is in good consistence with the dickinson s experimental results dickinson et al 1999 therefore it can be concluded that our newly developed numerical code is suitable for the simulation of flexible deformation wing considering that the typical reynolds number of the current study 1 0 106 is much higher than the re number in miao and ho s work 1 0 104 there exists much necessity in carrying out the validation test among similar re numbers in view of that another test has been carried out for the selected oscillating wing at different non dimensional oscillating frequencies f and fixed conditions of re 5 105 h 0 1 0 c θ 0 75 where the ν is the kinetic parameter of the fluid a comparison between the simulations results by using of our current code and results of kinsey kinsey et al 2011 is presented in table 1 it can be vividly seen from table 1 that our current calculation results are in good agreement with that of kinsey and the biggest difference among them is less than 5 0 meaning that our current numerical method should gain its due reliability 4 results and discussion considering that the main purpose of this study is to investigate the propulsive performance of flexible deformation oscillating wing the motion parameters of the rigid oscillating wing corresponding to equation 1 will be fixed as h 0 0 50 θ 30 unless otherwise specified in addition a non dimensional motion frequency f is introduced to give objective evaluation on propulsive performance of oscillating wing and it can be calculated as f fc v 4 1 effect of deformation amplitude on propulsive performance of current flexible oscillating wing in this subsection the influence of deformation amplitude a 0 on propulsive performance of current flexible oscillating wing will be analyzed as is stated above the deformation amplitude is of vital significance in flexible oscillating wing s motion attitudes in specific the magnitude of a 0 directly determines the defection amplitude of oscillating wing while the corresponding motion direction can be determined by the sign of a 0 therefore for the simplicity of expression here the deflection mode of oscillating wing is called deflection mode a when the value of a 0 is larger than zero otherwise is called deflection mode b in the following the impact of a 0 on propulsive performance of current oscillating wing will be carried out from the aspect of thrust force coefficient and the propulsive efficiency the motion parameters are set as f 0 25 xs 0 30 fig 6 shows the variation curves of mean value of thrust force coefficient c t mean under different deformation amplitudes and the value of rigid wing is also added in the figure corresponding to the condition that the a 0 of flexible deformation wing is 0 as is stated before investigation on propulsive performance of flexible deformation oscillating will be carried out under the two distinct motion modes when the deflection motion a is adopted the motion process of oscillating wing can be seen in fig 2 a the mean value of c t mean generated by the wing s oscillating motion is much lower than that of the traditional rigid wing in particular when the a 0 equals to 0 15 the c t mean of flexible deformation wing 0 122 is reduced by 70 4 compared with that value of rigid oscillating wing 0 412 with the further increase of a 0 the sign of c t mean turns into the opposite side when the a 0 exceeds 0 225 meaning that no more thrust force will be produced under that deflection mode thus it can be concluded that the deflection mode a is not favorable for the flexible deformation oscillating wing on the other hand when the a 0 value is smaller than 0 the deflection mode b will be utilized by the flexible oscillating wing as can be seen in fig 6 the c t mean shows the continuous growth with the further increase of a 0 and when the a 0 equals to 0 75 the corresponding c t mean has increased by 111 16 than that value of rigid wing therefore it can be concluded that the deflection mode b is favorable for the propulsive performance of flexible deformation oscillating wing fig 7 presents the variation curves of oscillating wing s thrust force coefficient in one complete motion period as evidently seen in fig 7 there exist double peaks and valleys in the thrust force coefficient curve of oscillating wing during one complete motion period that is the changing period of thrust force coefficient is half of the oscillating wing s motion period that phenomenon is consistent with that of rigid wing besides that when the a 0 is larger than 0 seen in fig 7 a the thrust force coefficient curves of oscillating wing gradually moves downward along the coordinate axis with the further increase of a 0 and especially when the a 0 0 75 the corresponding thrust force coefficient curve is almost located in the negative half axis of the coordinate axis only when the non dimensional motion time t t lies in the range of 0 4375 0 5 and 0 875 1 0 the corresponding c t mean is positive meaning that only a few thrust force is generated during the whole motion process of oscillating wing that s why the corresponding c t mean is negative in addition the motion time corresponding to the peak value of c t mean moves backward which is the higher the a 0 is the later the highest thrust force will be obtained it can be concluded that when the deflection motion a a 0 0 is adopted by the flexible oscillating wing the thrust force coefficient will be greatly reduced or even turn into the negative value and the motion time corresponding to the highest thrust force coefficient will be greatly delayed which will produce detrimental effect on the propulsive performance of flexible deformation oscillating wing on the other side when the a 0 is 0 seen in fig 7 b the variation curves of oscillating wing s thrust force coefficient keeps moving upward with the increase of a 0 especially when the a 0 equals to 0 75 the corresponding variation curve of thrust force coefficient is almost located in the positive axis of the coordinate axis only when the non dimensional motion time t t lies in the range of 0 0 1875 and 0 5625 0 625 the corresponding thrust force coefficient is negative that is to say the thrust force generated by the flexible deformation oscillating wing in a whole motion period is almost positive and therefore the resulting c t mean is positive besides that it can be also gotten from fig 7 b that the higher the a 0 is the little the motion time corresponding to the peak value of c t will be meaning that the increase of a 0 promotes the earlier coming of the highest thrust force coefficient which is contrary to that phenomenon of a 0 0 therefore it can be concluded that the deflection mode b utilized by the flexible deformation oscillating wing is of great benefit for the propulsive performance of current flexible oscillating wing fig 8 presents the contours of static pressure distributions and velocity streamlines around the flexible oscillating wing at t t 0 25 under different values of a 0 when the a 0 0 shown in fig 8 a obvious pressure difference emerges on the upper and lower surface of the flexible oscillating wing and a positive pressure zone emerges in the deformation direction of oscillating wing corresponding to the left upper side while a negative pressure zone appears in the opposite direction the resulting pressure difference points to the right lower side which is opposite to the flexible wing s advancing direction proving an explanation why the deflection mode a will produce adverse effect upon the flexible oscillating wing s propulsive performance apart from that it can be also shown in fig 8 a that the pressure difference between the two sides of oscillating wing exhibits gradual increase with the constant growth of a 0 and the resulting drag force along the horizontal direction also presents simultaneous increase which may explain why the corresponding c t mean keeps cutting down with the constant increase of a 0 on the other side when the a 0 turns into the negative value seen in fig 8 b an apparent pressure difference also emerges around the two sides of flexible oscillating wing however compared with fig 8 a the positive pressure zone moves to the right lower direction of oscillating which is contrary to the oscillating wing s deformation direction the corresponding negative pressure zone moves to the left upper direction the resulting force generated by the pressure difference along the horizontal direction is identical with the oscillating wing s advancing direction that s why the deformation mode b adopted by the oscillating wing promotes the flexible oscillating wing s propulsive performance similar with the a 0 0 the pressure difference between the upper and lower side of oscillating wing shows continuous growth with the increase of a 0 and the corresponding thrust force along the horizontal direction also exhibits obvious growth which may explain the numerical results gotten in fig 6 fig 9 presents the variation curves of propulsive efficiency of flexible oscillating wing under different deformation amplitudes and the corresponding value of rigid wing is also added in fig 9 considering that when the a 0 exceeds 0 15 no more thrust force will be generated hence only the case of a 0 is less than 0 15 will be investigated here as can be vividly seen in fig 9 the obvious change has been taken place after the introduction of the flexible motion in specific when the a 0 is larger than zero the propulsive efficiency shows rapid decrease as a result of the large reduction of thrust force coefficient and the propulsive efficiency of flexible oscillating is lower than that of rigid wing that conclusion is in good agreement with the results acquired above when it comes to a 0 0 the propulsive efficiency increases first and then shows gradual decrease as the a 0 keeps increasing and there exists an optimum a 0 leading to the highest propulsive efficiency in specific when the a 0 equals to 0 30 the highest propulsive efficiency obtained by the flexible oscillating wing is 60 3 increased by 28 3 than the value of rigid wing 47 with the further increase of a 0 although the c t mean of flexible oscillating wing increase constantly the corresponding value of propulsive efficiency presents sharp decrease meaning that the growth of a 0 will surely does much good on improving the output of the oscillating wing s system mainly reflected in the thrust force coefficient the input power of the system increases greatly at the same time which is mainly used for overcoming the energy consumed by the oscillating wing s surface deflection in other words acquiring a larger thrust force serves no purpose if it is achieved at the expense of decreased propulsive efficiency in order to give an explanation for the numerical results obtained from fig 9 the vortex structures around the flexible oscillating wing at t t 0 25 under different values of a 0 is presented in fig 10 the z vorticity is introduced to evaluate the vortex field and it can be calculated as z v y u x where the u and v are the horizontal and vertical velocity in the flow field respectively the vortex structures in fig 10 clearly demonstrates that there exists shedding vortex structures on the both upper and lower surface of flexible oscillating wing under different value of a 0 and the vortex structures shedding from the upper surface of oscillating wing presents anticlockwise rotation while the corresponding vortex structures shedding from the lower surface exhibits clockwise rotation and the two types of vortex structures finally forms into an anti carmen vortex street in the flow field of the flexible oscillating wing generating a backward jet according to the theorem of impulse a forward impulse is obtained by the flexible oscillating wing therefore a forward thrust force is acquired to enhance its propulsive performance in addition it can be also vividly seen from fig 10 that the vortex intensity on the upper surface of flexible oscillating wing increase first and then decrease with the constant growth of a 0 and the highest value of vortex intensity is obtained when a 0 0 30 in contrast the vortex intensity on the lower surface of flexible oscillating wing firstly decrease and then increase the smallest value of vortex intensity is acquired at a 0 0 30 since the magnitude of vortex density directly indicates the degree of energy dissipation thus the energy consumption of the system under the condition of a 0 0 30 reaches minimum and the highest propulsive efficiency can be obtained in addition from the perspective of the motion process the pitching angle of the oscillating wing is going to decrease as well as to rotate clockwise at the next moment the increase of the vortex intensity on the lower surface of the oscillating wing will execute a clockwise torque on the oscillating wing which is consistent with the oscillating wing s following motion which may also explain why the higher propulsive efficiency is obtained under that working condition 4 2 effect of non dimensional frequency on propulsive performance of current flexible oscillating wing in this subsection the influence of non dimensional oscillating frequency on propulsive performance of current flexible oscillating wing will be analyzed and the comparison with the conventional rigid wing will be also carried out other motion parameters are set as a 0 0 30 xs 0 30 the mean value of thrust force coefficient and propulsive efficiency of flapping foil under different non dimensional oscillating frequencies are shown in fig 11 as for the mean value of thrust force coefficient seen in fig 11 a the c t mean of rigid oscillating wing and the flexible oscillating wing increase synchronously with the growth of non dimensional oscillating frequency and the propulsive efficiency of flexible wing is higher than that of rigid wing under a constant oscillating frequency for example the c t mean of flexible oscillating wing reaches 3 025 when f equals to 0 5 which is 71 1 higher than that of rigid oscillating wing 1 768 meaning that the introduction of flexible oscillating wing promotes the improvement of oscillating wing s propulsive performance the reason for the increase of c t mean can be referred to fig 12 and fig 13 which exhibits the contours of pressure distribution and static pressure coefficient under three typical non dimensional oscillating frequencies as vividly shown in figs 12 and 13 there exists obvious pressure difference between the upper and lower surface of flexible oscillating wing and when the f 0 10 the positive pressure and the negative pressure zones emerge in the left upper and right lower of the oscillating wing respectively and the resulting force along the horizontal directional is opposite to the oscillating wing s advancing direction that s why the negative thrust force is generated seen in fig 11 a when the f is larger than 0 10 0 25 and 0 50 the positive and negative pressure zone are interchanged compared with the situation of f 0 10 thus the positive thrust force will be acquired apart from that the pressure difference between the upper side and lower side shows gradual increase with the constant growth of f and the resulting force along the advancing direction increase accordingly which is responsible for the phenomenon that the c t mean shows corresponding growth with increase of f as for the propulsive efficiency seen in fig 11 b the η value of oscillating wing exhibits obvious enhancement after the introductio n of flexible deflection motion and the effect of enhancement is more remarkable when the value of f is less than 0 30 besides that the propulsive efficiency of rigid and flexible oscillating increases first and then decrease and there exists an optimum f leading to highest propulsive efficiency the optimum value of f corresponding to highest propulsive efficiency for the flexible and rigid oscillating wing are 0 25 and 0 30 respectively meaning that the optimum f of oscillating wing will come ahead of time after the introduction of the flexible deflection motion in addition compared with the rigid oscillating wing the maximum propulsive efficiency value of flexible oscillating wing has increased by 11 5 the vortex flow fields of the flexible deformation oscillating wing under five non dimensional oscillating frequencies are presented in fig 14 to give a reasonable explanation for the numerical results gotten above the vortex structures shedding from the flexible oscillating wing under different values of f can be vividly seen in fig 14 and a vortex ring structures emerged at the rear part of oscillating wing the vortex intensity on the upper surface of flexible oscillating wing presents the tendency of decreasing first and then increasing and the minimum value is acquired when the f 0 25 on the other hand the vortex intensity on the lower surface of flexible oscillating wing presents the opposite changing tendency and the maximum value of vortex intensity is obtained at the same value of f 0 25 as stated before the smaller the vortex intensity is the little the energy consumption will be which may provide an explanation for why the highest propulsive efficiency is acquired at f 0 25 considering that the non dimensional oscillating frequency plays a key role in evaluating the propulsive performance of flexible oscillating wing there exists much necessity to carry out the analysis on the evolution process of flexible oscillating wing since the geometry shapes as well as the motion equation are both symmetrical hence only half of the motion period will be analyzed and the corresponding vortex evolution process under three typical value of f are presented in fig 15 as can be seen in fig 15 the leading edge vortices lev appear on the lower surface of flexible oscillating wing at the initial motion time under different oscillating frequencies and the lev keeps moving downward and eventually turned into trailing edge vortices tev at the motion time of t 0 50 t in addition the obvious detached vortex structures and the streamline separation on the lower surface of flexible oscillating wing can be easily observed in fig 15 when the f 0 10 the existence of streamline separation on the lower surface of oscillating wing pushes the local streamlines out resulting in an up ward bending on the surface of oscillating wing while the flexible oscillating wing is going to bend and deform in opposite direction in the next moment therefore the existence of detached vortex structure and the streamline separation shall lead to much energy consumption which will produce detrimental effect on the propulsive performance of flexible oscillating wing the similar phenomenon of streamline separation can be also detected when f 0 50 and the difference lies in that the streamline separation has taken place on the upper side of the flexible oscillating wing when the f equals to 0 25 there exists little streamline separation meaning that fewer energy is consumed that s why the higher propulsive efficiency can be obtained 4 3 effect of defection position on propulsive performance of current flexible oscillating wing in this subsection the effect of deflection position along the direction of wing s chord length on flexible oscillating wing s propulsive performance will be analyzed other motion parameters are set as a 0 0 3 f 0 25 the variation curves of thrust force coefficient and corresponding mean value of flexible oscillating foil under different deflection positions are presented in fig 16 as can be seen in fig 16 a the variation curve of thrust force coefficient keeps moving downward along the axis of coordinate when the deflection position moves backward along the chord length of oscillating wing in particular when xs 0 the thrust force coefficient of flexible deformation oscillating wing is located in the negative half axis only when the non dimensional time t t lies in the range of 0 0 1875 and 0 53 0 65 however when the deflection position changes into 1 0 the majority of the thrust force coefficient s variation curves are located in the negative half of the axis the corresponding value of t t lies in the range of 0 0 4125 and 0 49 0 7835 as for the mean value of thrust force coefficient seen in fig 16 b the value of c t mean presents a tendency of gradual decrease and when the xs is larger than 0 90 the corresponding value of c t mean turns into a negative magnitude meaning that no positive thrust force will be generated in addition it can be also noted from fig 16 b that the c t mean of flexible oscillating wing is larger than that of rigid oscillating wing when xs is less than 0 60 especially when xs 0 the c t mean of oscillating wing is almost twice that of rigid oscillating wing while when the xs 0 60 the value of c t mean are almost identical with each other with the further increase of xs the c t mean of flexible oscillating wing starts to be less than that of rigid oscillating wing therefore a conclusion can be drawn that the c t mean of flexible oscillating wing will keep decreasing until it becomes negative fig 17 exhibits the pressure distribution of current flexible oscillating wing under three typical deflection positions and it can be easily gotten that the a positive pressure zone is shown in the right lower part of the oscillating wing while a negative pressure zone emerges in left upper part and the direction of pressure difference is identical with that of the oscillating wing s advancing direction thus a positive thrust force can be acquired besides that it can be also see from fig 17 that the pressure difference between upper surface and lower surface presents gradual decrease with the growth of xs resulting in the gradual decrease of c t mean with the further increase of xs as seen in fig 17 d and fig 17 e the positive pressure zone moves to the upper left part of wing while the negative pressure zone presents the lower right part and the direction of the pressure difference is opposite to the flexible deformation wing s advancing direction that s why a negative thrust force is generated under these motion conditions the propulsive efficiency curves of current flexible oscillating wing are shown in fig 18 and the propulsive efficiency presents a tendency of increasing first and then decreasing with the growth of xs and there exists an optimum value of xs leading to the highest propulsive efficiency and the location of the deflection position coincides with the rotation center of rigid wing xs xr 0 30 besides that it can be also acquired from fig 18 that when the value of xs is less than 0 45 the propulsive efficiency of flexible oscillating wing is larger than that of rigid oscillating wing and the propulsive efficiency reaches the highest value when the xs 0 30 a conclusion can be drawn that the value of xs plays vital role in improving the propulsive efficiency of flexible deformation oscillating wing and the highest propulsive efficiency will be acquired when the deflection position coincides with the rotation center of rigid wing which can provide much guidance for the future design of prototype the vortex structures around the flexible oscillating wing at t t 0 25 under four typical values of xs are presented in fig 19 and it can be easily found that the vortex intensity on the surface of flexible oscillating wing presents a tendency of increasing first and then deceasing with the further increase of the xs and the highest vortex intensity is acquired in xs 0 30 as is stated before the higher the vortex intensity is the little the energy consumption will be as well as a higher value of propulsive efficiency will be obtained 5 conclusions in this article a novel conceptual design of flexible oscillating is introduced by adding a time varying camber deformation to the conventional rigid oscillating wing and a two dimensional transient numerical simulation is carried out to evaluate the propulsive performance of current flexible oscillating wing by using of the commercial software code ansys fluent 18 2 conclusions acquired in this article can be summarized as 1 the effect of deflection amplitude a 0 on the propulsive performance of oscillating wing has been analyzed and the numerical simulation results shows that the deflection motion type a a 0 0 will produce the detrimental effect on the wing s propulsive performance while the deflection motion type b a 0 0 does much good on improving the propulsive performance by increasing the thrust force coefficients greatly the propulsive efficiency presents a tendency of increasing first and then decreasing and there exists optimum a 0 leading to the highest propulsive efficiency and the maximum value can be increased by 28 3 compared with that of conventional rigid wing 2 a non dimensional oscillating frequency f combining the effect of motion amplitude motion frequency and the incoming velocity is introduced to give an accurate evaluation on the propulsive performance of flexible oscillating wing similar with the a 0 the thrust force coefficient shows conformable increase with the growth of f while the propulsive efficiency climbs to the peak value and decrease subsequently and there also exists optimum value of f corresponding to the highest propulsive efficiency in addition the optimum value of f is smaller than that of rigid oscillating wing meaning that a smaller oscillating frequency is required for the flexible oscillating wing to acquire the highest propulsive efficiency 3 the position of deflection motion xs also plays vital role in deciding the propulsive efficiency of flexible oscillating wing and the numerical results demonstrate that the more backward the deformation position is the smaller the thrust force coefficient will be within the range of numerical calculation conditions as for the propulsive efficiency the highest propulsive will be acquired when the deflection position coincides with the rotation centre of rigid oscillating wing that conclusion is of vital significance for the future design of prototype credit authorship contribution statement
