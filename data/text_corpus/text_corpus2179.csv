10895,the production of irrigated rice is increasingly challenged by freshwater scarcity water saving technologies such as alternate wetting and drying awd allow sustaining production levels under reduced water availability before implementing such innovations on a large scale their hydrological impact on the system needs to be assessed this study investigated the applicability of the water management tool weap water evaluation and planning system for evaluating the effects of awd on water use and water resources at field and irrigation system level for two different case studies in central luzon the philippines in the first study the zeigler experiment station zes of the international rice research institute irri was used for parameterization of weap and field scale assessment of awd making use of the availability of spatially and temporally highly resolved data in the second study weap was applied to an irrigation scheme in the philippines the angat maasim river irrigation system amris to assess effects on up and downstream water resources using lower resolution data simulated awd implementation during the dry season reduced water requirements by 12 27 and 34 3 on zes and amris respectively additionally awd implementation enhanced streamflow in main and lateral canals and thus increased water availability in the entire irrigation system we also conducted an ex ante assessment of future freshwater availability assuming reduced precipitation due to climate change effects alongside with irrigation supply at current levels weap showed that water levels in the reservoir will substantially decline under these circumstances leading to severe water stress in amris implementing awd in such a scenario improved water availability in the system by up to 50 weap proved to be a suitable tool for upscaling different irrigation techniques and assessing their impact on water resources on a large scale limitations of the approach and future possibilities for improvements are discussed keywords irrigation oryza sativa modeling water management water saving rice 1 introduction rice oryza sativa is one the most important staple foods with significant contribution to global food security 90 of the global rice yield is produced in asia grisp global rice science partnership 2013 with two thirds of it being produced in irrigated lowlands tuong et al 2005 paddy rice production the production of rice in flooded fields is highly water intensive today nearly half of the diverted freshwater in asia is used for irrigation in rice husain et al 2009 until 2030 rice production needs to increase by 40 to meet the future demands of the growing population khush 2005 this will increase the freshwater demand for irrigation and consumption aggravating the competitive water use between agricultural industrial and municipal water demands climate change is expected to further intensify freshwater allocation challenges the 5th ipcc assessment report states that especially asia will be adversely affected by impacts of climate change on freshwater resources hijioka et al 2014 scenarios predict an increase in extreme weather events such as droughts and floods as well as an intensification of climate effects e g el niño southern oscillation enso leading to a shift in precipitation patterns and widespread droughts several incidences from the past e g in the philippines indicated rice production s vulnerability to effects of el niño in the angat maasim river irrigation system amris one of the largest irrigation systems in the philippines water management has always been challenging a multipurpose reservoir provides irrigation water for amris but also provides more than 95 of the domestic water supply for metropolitan manila during the dry season of 1997 98 a strong el niño forced the national irrigation authority to stop water deliveries throughout the whole cropping period to secure water availability in metropolitan manila the rice production area was reduced by 83 resulting in a yield loss of 87 dawe et al 2009 however this was not a single event hilario et al 2009 assessed 17 el niño effects during 1949 2009 based on historical climate data from the national oceanic atmospheric administration www cpc noaa gov with many of them having negative impacts on rice production past events and future predictions reinforce the urgency for appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies of which integrated water management and implementation of water saving technologies are essential parts alternate wetting and drying awd is a water saving irrigation technology promoted by the international rice research institute irri that reduces water requirements by up to 40 and greenhouse gas emissions by 20 90 without affecting yields lampayan et al 2015 linquist et al 2015 sander et al 2015 although awd has been intensively studied on field scale and already implemented in many asian countries e g china the philippines and japan belder et al 2004 richards and sander 2014 tuong and bouman 2003 chapagain and yamaji 2010 impact assessments of large scale implementations on water resources have rarely been assessed before changes in water management affect water resources and their allocation which is why the impact needs to be estimated before implementation models can simulate changes in supply and demand which renders them valuable decision support tools for water managers and policy makers this study evaluates the modelling performance of the hydrological landscape planning tool water evaluation and planning system weap on different application scales in irrigated rice two case studies were conducted in the philippines with the aim to assess the applicability of weap in small and large irrigation systems under data limited and data rich conditions fig 1 1 the zeigler experiment station zes of the international rice research institute irri with main objective of parametrization of soil crop and irrigation method assumptions as well as calibration and validation of the weap model for small irrigation system under good data availability 2 amris a large scale and data poor irrigation system with the main objective to actually upscale awd implementation in a real world case study assess water savings on irrigation system level and evaluate the impacts of the implementation on water resources above and below the entire catchment finally scenarios for reduced precipitation and reservoir inflows during dry season and increased municipal demand were implemented to conduct a vulnerability assessment and so reveal the consequences of large scale implementations under various conditions accordingly the study pursues the following research questions evaluation of the accuracy of weap is weap able to assess crop water requirements of paddy rice in different irrigation schemes what is the accuracy of weap results from the perspective of existing strengths and weaknesses impact assessment of a large scale awd implementation what is the potential water savings through awd implementation what are the potential impacts on water resources particularly in the downstream area freshwater scarcity scenarios what is the impact of different irrigation techniques in different scenarios on the freshwater availability in which extent can weap evaluate the potential of awd as an adaptation and mitigation strategy for coping with water scarcity weap as a decision supportive tool for irrigated agriculture is weap a suitable tool for water management impact assessment in watersheds dominated by irrigated rice 2 materials and methods 2 1 alternate wetting and drying awd the modelling approach uses the method of a safe awd as defined and used by belder et al 2004 bouman and tuong 2000 bouman et al 2007b richards and sander 2014 and siopongco et al 2013 after transplanting at a ponded depth of about 5 cm the water level is allowed to fall to a sub surface depth of 15 cm before irrigating to initial depths 5 7 cm fields are only periodically flooded with intermitted dry periods irri 2009 as summarized by lampayan et al 2015 when applying a safe awd version soil moisture tensions in awd field experiments were never below 10 kpa and hence neither drought stress nor drought stress induced yield reductions occurred as previously determined by yadav et al 2011 an irrigation threshold of 20 kpa was the optimum in terms of maximising grain yield wpi irrigation water productivity and wp i r input water productivity with awd reduction in water use by up to 40 were realized which were mainly due to the reduction of percolation and seepage lampayan et al 2015 furthermore by allowing short term aerobic soil conditions awd reduces methane emissions sander et al 2015 methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential gwp of 28 and is produced under anaerobic conditions by methanogenic bacteria in the soil myhre et al 2013 sander et al 2015 summarized 60 experimental observations concluding a potential reduction of 19 9 86 2 of direct methane emissions by implementing awd as currently being one of the most promising climate smart technologies in paddy rice awd is implemented in several mitigation projects throughout asia 2 2 weap water evaluation and planning system weap is an integrated water resource management and planning tool developed by the stockholm environment institute www weap21 org it was initially designed to provide a decision supportive framework for water managers and strategic planners for watershed and urban water planning weap operates on a watershed scale water balance between demand and supply and offers the possibility to integrate agricultural industrial and municipal water demands it features a model for crop water requirement estimation mabia calculating daily irrigation requirements based on soil moisture levels according to calculation algorithms from the fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 dual kc approach weap aggregates and integrates the crop water requirements of mabia into the water balance of the watershed 2 3 study area two study sites differing in data availability were selected in central luzon philippines the zeigler experiment station zes of the international rice research institute irri 14 09 n 121 15 e with a distinct of approximately 200 ha and the angat maasim river irrigation system amris 14 57 n 120 57 e with an area of approximately 19 000 ha of paddy rice during the dry season in both study sites the climate is tropical with an annual average temperature of 26 c annual average precipitation of 2124 mm zes and 2551 mm amris which a distinct dry december may and rainy season june november 2 4 input data input data for zes was received from researchers from the international rice research institute as well as literature information of experiments conducted on the experimental station the input data comprised information on cropping calendars soil type and soil related hydrological properties soils at zes were classified according to their dominating soil texture class in clay silty clay silty clay loamy and sandy clay loamy soils with an assumed soil depth of 60 cm the assumptions on soil properties are listed in table 1 weather information were received from the weather station on the experimental station and include daily records for solar radiation mj m 2 rainfall mm maximum minimum and mean temperature c vapor pressure deficit and actual vapor pressure kpa relative humidity and wind speed m s 1 average of 24 h input data for amris was received from the national irrigation authority iii nia region iii bulacan and included a pictorial map of the irrigation system an irrigation schedule of 2015 and information on soil properties weather files for amris were generated with climatology resource for agro climatology nasa nasa 2016 the weather files contained daily information on solar radiation mj m 2 rainfall mm and minimum and maximum temperature c assumptions were made on minimum relative humidity 70 and wind speed 2 m s based on average local climate soils at amris were categorized as clay soils with the defined properties as listed in table 1 in zes and amris paddy fields are irrigated during the dry season in zes irrigation water is stored in reservoirs receiving water from shallow groundwater pumps and precipitation in amris irrigation water is delivered from the angat dam and distributed by gravity within the irrigation systems amris is divided into a northern and a southern irrigation system through the northern and southern main canal from here water is further subdivided into the lateral canals supplying the irrigation divisions south 1 6 and north of the angat river 6 12 the crop input parameters were adopted from the integrated crop library which are based on recommendations of the fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 allen et al 1998 physiological characteristics were modified to transplanting conditions the initial stage was set to 5 days with a kcb of 1 0 to consider the transplanting shock simulated planting and harvesting dates were set to january 1st and april 9th in the dry season and july 1st and october 7th in the wet season of every simulated year the simulation period of one cropping cycle was 99 days after transplanting land preparation and crop nursery were not considered in this modeling approach irrigation scheduling for continuous flooding follows common agricultural practice where water layers are between 30 50 mm 30 80 mm and 150 mm for minimum target and maximum water depths minimum and target water depths are increasing with plant growth fig 2 the simulation period for both study sites was 2005 2015 an awd irrigation scheme was implemented by using the irrigation schedule mask whereby irrigation was initiated when the previously defined soil water content threshold of 25 of readily available water was reached the defined irrigation amount was 50 mm for clay 60 mm for silty clay and 80 mm for silty clay loam and sandy clay loamy soils irrigation requirements of awd and its potential to reduce water requirements was assessed only for the dry season 2 5 model framework the model was set up with weap version 2016 01 available at www weap21 org the year 2005 was set as a baseline year with two cropping rotations of paddy rice for both study sites in 2005 there was no climatic abnormality and climate data was available for 2005 2016 ensuring a 10 years simulation period 2 5 1 zeigler experimental sation zes for the model set up zes was divided into four major parts and further subdivided according to the respective blocks classified by irri the model was validated in two steps first obtained water requirements were compared to minimum water requirements mwr calculated by aquacrop 5 0 a crop water productivity model developed by the food and agricultural organization fao 2016 so the accuracy and suitability of weap mabia for calculating crop water requirements of irrigated rice was evaluated in this process water requirements were partitioned into their individual components for evaporation transpiration percolation and runoff aquacrop was selected as a suitable tool for comparison and error analysis of weap mabia since it was already successfully applied for paddy rice in asia lin et al 2012 maniruzzaman et al 2015 furthermore the results of the weap model were validated by comparing with published literature as listed in table 2 2 5 2 angat maasim river irrigation system amris amris was divided into two parts north and south and then further subdivided according to the division number 1 6 in northern and 7 12 in southern part the modelling framework for amris is shown in fig 3 the model was validated with calculation formulas used in the irrigation plan from 2016 obtained by the national irrigation authority nia iii bulacan and consist of the following steps the input parameters area and planting date used in the weap model were inserted in the calculation formulas used by nia for calculating crop water requirements secondly the irrigation efficiency of the weap results was adjusted to 54 as used by nia finally the water requirements for each division were compared for both calculation methods weap and nia as well as the averaged water requirements for all divisions in the dry season 2016 2 6 scenarios impacts of freshwater scarcity on amris were addressed by creating two major scenarios in the model a precipitation change i iii representing three different intensities of reduced precipitation in the catchment 10 20 30 and inflow to the angat dam during the dry season and b manila demand growth representing the increase in freshwater demand for household consumption induced by population growth and enhanced living conditions hereby the annual freshwater demand of metropolitan manila was set to increase from 46 m 3s 1 to 50 m 3s 1 future predictions assume that climate change and population growth will both affect freshwater resources cisneros et al 2014 therefore each precipitation scenario was coupled additionally with manila demand growth and run for continuous flooded and awd managed fields 3 results and discussion 3 1 modelling crop water requirements 3 1 1 zes simulated dry season field conditions complied at all times with the requirements of awd fields are periodically flooded with intermittent dry periods fig 4 shows the simulated awd irrigation scheduling for clay and sandy clay loamy soils in two contrasting dry seasons 2011 with a seasonal precipitation of 125 mm and 2014 with a seasonal precipitation of 32 mm secondly a comparison with minimum water requirements mwr calculated by aquacrop confirmed a successful implementation irrigation amounts for the simulated period of 10 successive dry seasons were not significantly different between weap awd and mwr indicating a high irrigation efficiency of the established irrigation schedule p 0 05 irrigation requirements for weap cf were as expected significantly different from weap awd and mwr p 0 05 a loss pathway analysis for a single dry season revealed variations for weap awd weap cf and mwr table 3 transpiration and evaporation were in the same range in all calculation approaches runoff was highest in weap cf due to the simulated drainage of the field before harvest percolation showed substantial differences between the calculation methods with lowest losses in mwr weap awd had 18 4 lower percolation losses compared to weap cf and affirmed the selected irrigation schedule for awd the model was validated with experimental data from the philippines and additional literature as listed in table 2 despite of the wide range of reported reductions in water use 4 5 41 comparisons of single studies validate the simulated results in the dry season 2006 modeled reductions in water use were 42 on clay soils and 17 19 on silty and silty clay loamy soils the study of bueno et al 2010 conducted on light clay soils achieved reduction in water use by 33 41 with awd implementation in 2009 the simulated reduction in water use was 28 on clay soils and 15 19 on silty and silty clay loamy soils studies from zhang et al 2012 conducted awd trials in 2009 on light clay soils on the experimental farm of irri aimed reduction in water use of 24 5 overall simulated reduction in water use through awd implementation were 4 35 depending on soil type and precipitation with an annual average of 17 5 7 7 or 255340 m3 per dry season and an area of 200 ha average value for 2006 2015 the annual reductions are listed in table 3 modelled water requirements precipitation and irrigation under cf and awd management for the dry seasons 2006 2016 are shown in fig 5 simulated reductions in water use have spatial and temporal interrelations which are mainly caused by varying precipitation intensities and soil type awd achieves high reductions when precipitation is abundant and equally distributed the potential for reducing irrigation water input declines with decreasing precipitation and irregular precipitation patterns the highest reductions of irrigation requirements are observed in clay soils during dry seasons with high precipitation 250 mm the potential for reducing irrigation requirements is decreasing with less precipitation per wetting and lower soil clay content table 4 3 1 2 amris the water requirements calculated with weap showed a high degree of consistency with the irrigation schedule of the national irrigation authority nia fig 6 and table 6 the seasonal average of water requirements in division 1 computed by weap differs less than 5 from nia only in january weap has an 80 higher water requirement compared to nia calculations table 5 the detailed validation can be obtained from table a1 3 in the appendix a the average values of all divisions in january show only small deviations 10 2 from the water delivery schedule considering the average water requirements of the entire system the variations in both calculation approaches are in an acceptable range 7 1 the differences can be explained by different initial soil moisture contents at the beginning of the calculation approach and the use of weather forecast nia and actual weather information weap the simulated mean reduction in water use under awd for a 10 years average were 34 3 6 2 or 54 88 mm3 6 4 table a1 3 2 hydrological impacts of implementing awd in zes the number of irrigation events was reduced under awd by depending on the predominant soil texture 10 silty clay 22 9 clay 35 4 silty clay loam and 56 8 sandy clay loam similarly irrigation volume per wettening event was affected increase of 2 9 clay and 39 9 sandy clay loam and decrease of 6 2 silty clay and 11 9 silty clay loamy soils in amris a consequence of reduced irrigation requirements and altered irrigation patterns resulted in far reaching impacts on the water resources in the supply system fig 7 shows the impact of awd implementation on the stream flow in the northern main and lateral canals of the northern part of amris averaged values for dry seasons 2006 2015 under awd irrigation the streamflow was enhanced during the dry season 2010 the results for the headflow simulation of the northern main canal showed an increase of 23 9 90 m3s 1 particularly remarkable is the fact that the largest share of increase occurs during the driest months of the season in january and february where precipitation is lacking and irrigation is needed most on a much larger scale e g for a global perspective awd offers a great potential for reducing direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from lowland rice production approximately 60 of the total rice production area worldwide consists of clay and sandy soils of which a large share e g 86 of irrigated area in bangladesh is produced in pumped irrigation systems pumped irrigation systems could strongly benefit from awd implementation for both reduced water use and reduced irrigation hours bouman and tuong 2001 dawe 2005 rejesus et al 2011 this in consequence lead to a reduction of indirect greenhouse gases by reducing electricity or fuel consumption of pumps moreover farmer s adoption reaching the highest increase when farmers have a direct incentive for water savings rejesus et al 2011 the results of the zeigler experiment station demonstrate that the potential reduction of greenhouse gases due to a shift to awd management can be even greater however the reduction of water requirements and their impact on irrigation patterns strongly depend on soil characteristics emphasizing the importance of precise data input for soil and climate 3 3 future in district versus ex district scenarios the scenarios precipitation change i iii and manila demand growth had substantial effects on water resources and water availability in amris reduced water availability led to water shortages in the system that tend to be increasing with increasing distance from the headflow in precipitation change iii scenario the average headflow of the northern main canal was reduced by 20 and streamflow in the lateral canal to division 11 by 98 water demand coverage was decreasing with a gradient towards the tail end of the system the maximum reduction in water availability was in division 12 the tail end of the system with only 1 6 of water demand coverage through awd implementation in precipitation change iii scenario water requirements were reduced in the entire system consequently streamflow and water availability were enhanced aiming the highest increase of 57 in division 12 table a2 in appendix a water management in large irrigation systems has far reaching impacts on upstream water resources in weap the effects of different irrigation strategies were simulated under normal reference and scenario driven environments precipitation change altered precipitation patterns lowered water levels by 5 12 in the scenarios precipitation change and continuously flooded irrigation technique with a shift in irrigation practice towards awd water levels in the dam were altered by 4 5 to 4 6 depending of the intensity level of precipitation change taking into account increased municipal water consumption manila demand growth the volume in the dam was lowered by 13 21 under continuously flooding and only 4 13 with awd although the chosen scenarios reflect only a minor part of the complexity of global climate change models these simulations indicate potential threats and freshwater resource vulnerabilities as well as the potential of awd in a large scale implementation results have shown that the application of water saving technologies such as awd enhances water availability and demand coverage in the upstream areas as well as in the downstream and tail end areas where water scarcity effects are most severe 3 4 model uncertainties in the weap modeling approach it was not possible to implement or assess all input parameters correctly for paddy rice simulations for example it was not possible to implement capillary rise in the chosen catchment modeling approach weap mabia which represents one of the major limitations capillary rise is an important water balance parameter especially in soils with shallow groundwater table in large scale assessments intra systemic water recycling will not be considered and we assume therefore that real water requirements are underestimated by the model furthermore the results for evaporation in flooded systems weap cf indicate model inaccuracies by showing deviations for total amount of evaporated water and it s course the seasonal course of weap cf showed large differences from expected results and calculations from aquacrop for flooded conditions fig 8 weap cf simulated low evaporation rates at the beginning of the growing period and an increase during the drained period before harvest transpiration rates simulated in weap showed a decrease at the beginning from 3 mm per day to 0 5 mm per day in the first two weeks typically evaporation rates in ponded fields are highest at the beginning of the cropping period as reflected by aquacrop in fig 8 and decrease with vegetation growth and canopy cover in comparison with mwr which reflects crop soil water requirement only evaporative losses of weap cf weap awd and mwr are in a comparable range 45 48 mm ds 2006 therefore it can be assumed that ponded water layers are not reflected in weap cf and weap awd and simulated water requirements are underestimated this hypothesis can be supported by experiments of tuong et al 2005 who showed evaporation to be 67 73 higher 138 170 mm than simulated values with weap in continuously flooded systems moreover compared to results from yoshida 1979 and dedatta 1981 weap underestimates etc by 25 55 which can again be traced back to inaccurately calculated evaporation rates we identified the potential source of error for underestimated evaporation in the calculation algorithms the formula for the maximal crop coefficient kcmax is interrelated with ke and evaporation and needs to be adjusted for periods with more than 2 wetting events allen et al 1998 k c m a x max 1 2 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 k c b 0 05 where u2 wind speed measured at 2 m height m s rhmin minimum relative humidity h plant height during the current day m in literature only few references for evaporative losses under awd irrigation can be reviewed a comparison with experimental results from aerobic rice systems where water regime corresponds to minimum water requirements enables to draw the following conclusion in a study from the philippines in three successive dry seasons evaporative losses ranged between 138 170 mm cf and 54 95 mm aerobic rice tuong et al 2005 awd and the expected evaporative losses can be classified between continuously flooded and aerobic systems this classification is also supported by results from bouman et al 2007b who indicate a reduction of evaporation of up to 30 in awd compared to cf in spite of the weak points of the weap model approach mentioned above overall results and trends were in accordance with literature and theoretical background and hence not considered a serious constraint for the application of the weap model in both case studies for small scale field studies however we recommend using crop simulation models better calibrated for the particular characteristics of paddy rice such oryza2000 bouman 2001 4 conclusion and outlook rice production is essential in ensuring food security but at the same time it is a major fresh water user the importance of rigid water management in irrigated rice production systems will increase in the future in particular when competition for fresh water is considered water efficient irrigation technologies such as awd reduce the pressure on freshwater resources by reducing non productive water use in irrigation systems rice production particularly during the dry season strongly depends on sufficiently available freshwater rendering them highly vulnerable to water scarcity and prone to yield loss thus in the future climate smart water management will be one of the greatest challenges and opportunities for rice production the selected case studies represent fairly simple irrigation systems but the results of this study can be taken as a basis for applications of weap for water allocation issues in more complex irrigation systems such as asian river deltas where irrigation systems are part of a complex river network this study showed that large scale awd implementation changes water allocation patterns and thus requires elaborate temporal and spatial management of water resources particularly in catchments where agriculture competes with other water users hydrological planning tools such as weap support water planners and decision makers in water management and allocation issues resulting from this study the following main conclusions can be drawn even with minor limitations in individual aspects of the water balance weap demonstrated sufficient accuracy for crop water requirements under flooded and under awd conditions however for small scale field studies we recommend using crop simulation models better calibrated for the particular characteristics of paddy rice such oryza2000 bouman and tuong 2000 we have shown that large scale implementations of awd can reduce water requirements of the entire irrigation system mitigate impacts of seasonal water shortages and improve water allocation the current study showed weap to be a decision supportive tool suitable for catchments with rice irrigation systems the user can connect water requirements of different water users address spatial and temporal hotspots of freshwater scarcity and evaluate through simulations the impact of agricultural or other water related decisions on the water availability in the system weap provides options for reducing trade offs in water planning as well as for testing and approving water management strategies before they are implemented detailed information on impacts is imperative for scenario guided planning of any given innovation in agricultural practices and technologies thus weap could play a crucial role in ex ante assessments within planning of awd programs and thus setting spatial and temporal priorities for awd dissemination assuming continuous flooding as business as usual bau irrigation patterns can be improved by distinct aeration periods the number of aerations can range from a single period to multiple periods in the form of awd which represents the end of the scale thus the planning process may compare water requirements of simple campaigns aiming at single aeration vis à vis more frequently drained awd programs in fact a single aeration period at the middle of the season which is often called mid season drainage is common practice in many rice growing regions in turn the assumption of all farmers applying continuous flooding as bau is in many cases too simplistic weap will allow easy adjustments of the bau practices for detailed information on water requirements under different irrigation patterns employing planning tools such as weap enables decision making on water management and allocation across provincial or even national borders to improve water allocation and ensure food security furthermore we

and amris respectively additionally awd implementation enhanced streamflow in main and lateral canals and thus increased water availability in the entire irrigation system we also conducted an ex ante assessment of future freshwater availability assuming reduced precipitation due to climate change effects alongside with irrigation supply at current levels weap showed that water levels in the reservoir will substantially decline under these circumstances leading to severe water stress in amris implementing awd in such a scenario improved water availability in the system by up to 50 weap

used by belder et al 2004 bouman and tuong 2000 bouman et al 2007b richards and sander 2014 and siopongco et al 2013 after transplanting at a ponded depth of about 5 cm the water level is allowed to fall to a sub surface depth of 15 cm before irrigating to initial depths 5 7 cm fields are only periodically flooded with intermitted dry periods irri 2009 as summarized by lampayan et al 2015 when applying a safe awd version soil moisture tensions in awd field experiments were never below 10 kpa and hence neither drought stress nor drought stress induced yield reductions occurred as previously determined by yadav et al 2011 an irrigation threshold of 20 kpa was the optimum in terms of maximising grain yield wpi irrigation water productivity and wp i r input water productivity with awd reduction in water use by up to 40 were realized which were mainly due to the reduction of percolation and seepage lampayan et al 2015 furthermore by allowing short term aerobic soil conditions awd reduces methane emissions sander et al 2015 methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential gwp of 28 and is produced under anaerobic conditions by methanogenic bacteria in the soil myhre et al 2013 sander et al 2015 summarized 60 experimental observations concluding a potential reduction of 19 9 86 2 of direct methane emissions by implementing awd as currently being one of the most promising climate smart technologies in paddy rice awd is implemented in several mitigation projects throughout asia 2 2 weap water evaluation and planning system weap is an integrated water resource management and planning tool developed by the stockholm environment institute www weap21 org it was initially designed to provide a decision supportive framework for water managers and strategic planners for watershed and urban water planning weap operates on a watershed scale water balance between demand and supply and offers the possibility to integrate agricultural industrial and municipal water demands it features a model for crop water requirement estimation mabia calculating daily irrigation requirements based on soil moisture levels according to calculation algorithms from the fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 dual kc approach weap aggregates and integrates the crop water requirements of mabia into the water balance of the watershed 2 3 study area two study sites differing in data availability were selected in central luzon philippines the zeigler experiment station zes of the international rice research institute irri 14 09 n 121 15 e with a distinct of approximately 200 ha and the angat maasim river irrigation system amris 14 57 n 120 57 e with an area of approximately 19 000 ha of paddy rice during the dry season in both study sites the climate is tropical with an annual average temperature of 26 c annual average precipitation of 2124 mm zes and 2551 mm amris which a distinct dry december may and rainy season june november 2 4 input data input data for zes was received from researchers from the international rice research institute as well as literature information of experiments conducted on the experimental station the input data comprised information on cropping calendars soil type and soil related hydrological properties soils at zes were classified according to their dominating soil texture class in clay silty clay silty clay loamy and sandy clay loamy soils with an assumed soil depth of 60 cm the assumptions on soil properties are listed in table 1 weather information were received from the weather station on the experimental station and include daily records for solar radiation mj m 2 rainfall mm maximum minimum and mean temperature c vapor pressure deficit and actual vapor pressure kpa relative humidity and wind speed m s 1 average of 24 h input data for amris was received from the national irrigation authority iii nia region iii bulacan and included a pictorial map of the irrigation system an irrigation schedule of 2015 and information on soil properties weather files for amris were generated with climatology resource for agro climatology nasa nasa 2016 the weather files contained daily information on solar radiation mj m 2 rainfall mm and minimum and maximum temperature c assumptions were made on minimum relative humidity 70 and wind speed 2 m s based on average local climate soils at amris were categorized as clay soils with the defined properties as listed in table 1 in zes and amris paddy fields are irrigated during the dry season in zes irrigation water is stored in reservoirs receiving water from shallow groundwater pumps and precipitation in amris irrigation water is delivered from the angat dam and distributed by gravity within the irrigation systems amris is divided into a northern and a southern irrigation system through the northern and southern main canal from here water is further subdivided into the lateral canals supplying the irrigation divisions south 1 6 and north of the angat river 6 12 the crop input parameters were adopted from the integrated crop library which are based on recommendations of the fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 allen et al 1998 physiological characteristics were modified to transplanting conditions the initial stage was set to 5 days with a kcb of 1 0 to consider the transplanting shock simulated planting and harvesting dates were set to january 1st and april 9th in the dry season and july 1st and october 7th in the wet season of every simulated year the simulation period of one cropping cycle was 99 days after transplanting land preparation and crop nursery were not considered in this modeling approach irrigation scheduling for continuous flooding follows common agricultural practice where water layers are between 30 50 mm 30 80 mm and 150 mm for minimum target and maximum water depths minimum and target water depths are increasing with plant growth fig 2 the simulation period for both study sites was 2005 2015 an awd irrigation scheme was implemented by using the irrigation schedule mask whereby irrigation was initiated when the previously defined soil water content threshold of 25 of readily available water was reached the defined irrigation amount was 50 mm for clay 60 mm for silty clay and 80 mm for silty clay loam and sandy clay loamy soils irrigation requirements of awd and its potential to reduce water requirements was assessed only for the dry season 2 5 model framework the model was set up with weap version 2016 01 available at www weap21 org the year 2005 was set as a baseline year with two cropping rotations of paddy rice for both study sites in 2005 there was no climatic abnormality and climate data was available for 2005 2016 ensuring a 10 years simulation period 2 5 1 zeigler experimental sation zes for the model set up zes was divided into four major parts and further subdivided according to the respective blocks classified by irri the model was validated in two steps first obtained water requirements were compared to minimum water requirements mwr calculated by aquacrop 5 0 a crop water productivity model developed by the food and agricultural organization fao 2016 so the accuracy and suitability of weap mabia for calculating crop water requirements of irrigated rice was evaluated in this process water requirements were partitioned into their individual components for evaporation transpiration percolation and runoff aquacrop was selected as a suitable tool for comparison and error analysis of weap mabia since it was already successfully applied for paddy rice in asia lin et al 2012 maniruzzaman et al 2015 furthermore the results of the weap model were validated by comparing with published literature as listed in table 2 2 5 2 angat maasim river irrigation system amris amris was divided into two parts north and south and then further subdivided according to the division number 1 6 in northern and 7 12 in southern part the modelling framework for amris is shown in fig 3 the model was validated with calculation formulas used in the irrigation plan from 2016 obtained by the national irrigation authority nia iii bulacan and consist of the following steps the input parameters area and planting date used in the weap model were inserted in the calculation formulas used by nia for calculating crop water requirements secondly the irrigation efficiency of the weap results was adjusted to 54 as used by nia finally the water requirements for each division were compared for both calculation methods weap and nia as well as the averaged water requirements for all divisions in the dry season 2016 2 6 scenarios impacts of freshwater scarcity on amris were addressed by creating two major scenarios in the model a precipitation change i iii representing three different intensities of reduced precipitation in the catchment 10 20 30 and inflow to the angat dam during the dry season and b manila demand growth representing the increase in freshwater demand for household consumption induced by population growth and enhanced living conditions hereby the annual freshwater demand of metropolitan manila was set to increase from 46 m 3s 1 to 50 m 3s 1 future predictions assume that climate change and population growth will both affect freshwater resources cisneros et al 2014 therefore each precipitation scenario was coupled additionally with manila demand growth and run for continuous flooded and awd managed fields 3 results and discussion 3 1 modelling crop water requirements 3 1 1 zes simulated dry season field conditions complied at all times with the requirements of awd fields are periodically flooded with intermittent dry periods fig 4 shows the simulated awd irrigation scheduling for clay and sandy clay loamy soils in two contrasting dry seasons 2011 with a seasonal precipitation of 125 mm and 2014 with a seasonal precipitation of 32 mm secondly a comparison with minimum water requirements mwr calculated by aquacrop confirmed a successful implementation irrigation amounts for the simulated period of 10 successive dry seasons were not significantly different between weap awd and mwr indicating a high irrigation efficiency of the established irrigation schedule p 0 05 irrigation requirements for weap cf were as expected significantly different from weap awd and mwr p 0 05 a loss pathway analysis for a single dry season revealed variations for weap awd weap cf and mwr table 3 transpiration and evaporation were in the same range in all calculation approaches runoff was highest in weap cf due to the simulated drainage of the field before harvest percolation showed substantial differences between the calculation methods with lowest losses in mwr weap awd had 18 4 lower percolation losses compared to weap cf and affirmed the selected irrigation schedule for awd the model was validated with experimental data from the philippines and additional literature as listed in table 2 despite of the wide range of reported reductions in water use 4 5 41 comparisons of single studies validate the simulated results in the dry season 2006 modeled reductions in water use were 42 on clay soils and 17 19 on silty and silty clay loamy soils the study of bueno et al 2010 conducted on light clay soils achieved reduction in water use by 33 41 with awd implementation in 2009 the simulated reduction in water use was 28 on clay soils and 15 19 on silty and silty clay loamy soils studies from zhang et al 2012 conducted awd trials in 2009 on light clay soils on the experimental farm of irri aimed reduction in water use of 24 5 overall simulated reduction in water use through awd implementation were 4 35 depending on soil type and precipitation with an annual average of 17 5 7 7 or 255340 m3 per dry season and an area of 200 ha average value for 2006 2015 the annual reductions are listed in table 3 modelled water requirements precipitation and irrigation under cf and awd management for the dry seasons 2006 2016 are shown in fig 5 simulated reductions in water use have spatial and temporal interrelations which are mainly caused by varying precipitation intensities and soil type awd achieves high reductions when precipitation is abundant and equally distributed the potential for reducing irrigation water input declines with decreasing precipitation and irregular precipitation patterns the highest reductions of irrigation requirements are observed in clay soils during dry seasons with high precipitation 250 mm the potential for reducing irrigation requirements is decreasing with less precipitation per wetting and lower soil clay content table 4 3 1 2 amris the water requirements calculated with weap showed a high degree of consistency with the irrigation schedule of the national irrigation authority nia fig 6 and table 6 the seasonal average of water requirements in division 1 computed by weap differs less than 5 from nia only in january weap has an 80 higher water requirement compared to nia calculations table 5 the detailed validation can be obtained from table a1 3 in the appendix a the average values of all divisions in january show only small deviations 10 2 from the water delivery schedule considering the average water requirements of the entire system the variations in both calculation approaches are in an acceptable range 7 1 the differences can be explained by different initial soil moisture contents at the beginning of the calculation approach and the use of weather forecast nia and actual weather information weap the simulated mean reduction in water use under awd for a 10 years average were 34 3 6 2 or 54 88 mm3 6 4 table a1 3 2 hydrological impacts of implementing awd in zes the number of irrigation events was reduced under awd by depending on the predominant soil texture 10 silty clay 22 9 clay 35 4 silty clay loam and 56 8 sandy clay loam similarly irrigation volume per wettening event was affected increase of 2 9 clay and 39 9 sandy clay loam and decrease of 6 2 silty clay and 11 9 silty clay loamy soils in amris a consequence of reduced irrigation requirements and altered irrigation patterns resulted in far reaching impacts on the water resources in the supply system fig 7 shows the impact of awd implementation on the stream flow in the northern main and lateral canals of the northern part of amris averaged values for dry seasons 2006 2015 under awd irrigation the streamflow was enhanced during the dry season 2010 the results for the headflow simulation of the northern main canal showed an increase of 23 9 90 m3s 1 particularly remarkable is the fact that the largest share of increase occurs during the driest months of the season in january and february where precipitation is lacking and irrigation is needed most on a much larger scale e g for a global perspective awd offers a great potential for reducing direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from lowland rice production approximately 60 of the total rice production area worldwide consists of clay and sandy soils of which a large share e g 86 of irrigated area in bangladesh is produced in pumped irrigation systems pumped irrigation systems could strongly benefit from awd implementation for both reduced water use and reduced irrigation hours bouman and tuong 2001 dawe 2005 rejesus et al 2011 this in consequence lead to a reduction of indirect greenhouse gases by reducing electricity or fuel consumption of pumps moreover farmer s adoption reaching the highest increase when farmers have a direct incentive for water savings rejesus et al 2011 the results of the zeigler experiment station demonstrate that the potential reduction of greenhouse gases due to a shift to awd management can be even greater however the reduction of water requirements and their impact on irrigation patterns strongly depend on soil characteristics emphasizing the importance of precise data input for soil and climate 3 3 future in district versus ex district scenarios the scenarios precipitation change i iii and manila demand growth had substantial effects on water resources and water availability in amris reduced water availability led to water shortages in the system that tend to be increasing with increasing distance from the headflow in precipitation change iii scenario the average headflow of the northern main canal was reduced by 20 and streamflow in the lateral canal to division 11 by 98 water demand coverage was decreasing with a gradient towards the tail end of the system the maximum reduction in water availability was in division 12 the tail end of the system with only 1 6 of water demand coverage through awd implementation in precipitation change iii scenario water requirements were reduced in the entire system consequently streamflow and water availability were enhanced aiming the highest increase of 57 in division 12 table a2 in appendix a water management in large irrigation systems has far reaching impacts on upstream water resources in weap the effects of different irrigation strategies were simulated under normal reference and scenario driven environments precipitation change altered precipitation patterns lowered water levels by 5 12 in the scenarios precipitation change and continuously flooded irrigation technique with a shift in irrigation practice towards awd water levels in the dam were altered by 4 5 to 4 6 depending of the intensity level of precipitation change taking into account increased municipal water consumption manila demand growth the volume in the dam was lowered by 13 21 under continuously flooding and only 4 13 with awd although the chosen scenarios reflect only a minor part of the complexity of global climate change models these simulations indicate potential threats and freshwater resource vulnerabilities as well as the potential of awd in a large scale implementation results have shown that the application of water saving technologies such as awd enhances water availability and demand coverage in the upstream areas as well as in the downstream and tail end areas where water scarcity effects are most severe 3 4 model uncertainties in the weap modeling approach it was not possible to implement or assess all input parameters correctly for paddy rice simulations for example it was not possible to implement capillary rise in the chosen catchment modeling approach weap mabia which represents one of the major limitations capillary rise is an important water balance parameter especially in soils with shallow groundwater table in large scale assessments intra systemic water recycling will not be considered and we assume therefore that real water requirements are underestimated by the model furthermore the results for evaporation in flooded systems weap cf indicate model inaccuracies by showing deviations for total amount of evaporated water and it s course the seasonal course of weap cf showed large differences from expected results and calculations from aquacrop for flooded conditions fig 8 weap cf simulated low evaporation rates at the beginning of the growing period and an increase during the drained period before harvest transpiration rates simulated in weap showed a decrease at the beginning from 3 mm per day to 0 5 mm per day in the first two weeks typically evaporation rates in ponded fields are highest at the beginning of the cropping period as reflected by aquacrop in fig 8 and decrease with vegetation growth and canopy cover in comparison with mwr which reflects crop soil water requirement only evaporative losses of weap cf weap awd and mwr are in a comparable range 45 48 mm ds 2006 therefore it can be assumed that ponded water layers are not reflected in weap cf and weap awd and simulated water requirements are underestimated this hypothesis can be supported by experiments of tuong et al 2005 who showed evaporation to be 67 73 higher 138 170 mm than simulated values with weap in continuously flooded systems moreover compared to results from yoshida 1979 and dedatta 1981 weap underestimates etc by 25 55 which can again be traced back to inaccurately calculated evaporation rates we identified the potential source of error for underestimated evaporation in the calculation algorithms the formula for the maximal crop coefficient kcmax is interrelated with ke and evaporation and needs to be adjusted for periods with more than 2 wetting events allen et al 1998 k c m a x max 1 2 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 k c b 0 05 where u2 wind speed measured at 2 m height m s rhmin minimum relative humidity h plant height during the current day m in literature only few references for evaporative losses under awd irrigation can be reviewed a comparison with experimental results from aerobic rice systems where water regime corresponds to minimum water requirements enables to draw the following conclusion in a study from the philippines in three successive dry seasons evaporative losses ranged between 138 170 mm cf and 54 95 mm aerobic rice tuong et al 2005 awd and the expected evaporative losses can be classified between continuously flooded and aerobic systems this classification is also supported by results from bouman et al 2007b who indicate a reduction of evaporation of up to 30 in awd compared to cf in spite of the weak points of the weap model approach mentioned above overall results and trends were in accordance with literature and theoretical background and hence not considered a serious constraint for the application of the weap model in both case studies for small scale field studies however we recommend using crop simulation models better calibrated for the particular characteristics of paddy rice such oryza2000 bouman 2001 4 conclusion and outlook rice production is essential in ensuring food security but at the same time it is a major fresh water user the importance of rigid water management in irrigated rice production systems will increase in the future in particular when competition for fresh water is considered water efficient irrigation technologies such as awd reduce the pressure on freshwater resources by reducing non productive water use in irrigation systems rice production particularly during the dry season strongly depends on sufficiently available freshwater rendering them highly vulnerable to water scarcity and prone to yield loss thus in the future climate smart water management will be one of the greatest challenges and opportunities for rice production the selected case studies represent fairly simple irrigation systems but the results of this study can be taken as a basis for applications of weap for water allocation issues in more complex irrigation systems such as asian river deltas where irrigation systems are part of a complex river network this study showed that large scale awd implementation changes water allocation patterns and thus requires elaborate temporal and spatial management of water resources particularly in catchments where agriculture competes with other water users hydrological planning tools such as weap support water planners and decision makers in water management and allocation issues resulting from this study the following main conclusions can be drawn even with minor limitations in individual aspects of the water balance weap demonstrated sufficient accuracy for crop water requirements under flooded and under awd conditions however for small scale field studies we recommend using crop simulation models better calibrated for the particular characteristics of paddy rice such oryza2000 bouman and tuong 2000 we have shown that large scale implementations of awd can reduce water requirements of the entire irrigation system mitigate impacts of seasonal water shortages and improve water allocation the current study showed weap to be a decision supportive tool suitable for catchments with rice irrigation systems the user can connect water requirements of different water users address spatial and temporal hotspots of freshwater scarcity and evaluate through simulations the impact of agricultural or other water related decisions on the water availability in the system weap provides options for reducing trade offs in water planning as well as for testing and approving water management strategies before they are implemented detailed information on impacts is imperative for scenario guided planning of any given innovation in agricultural practices and technologies thus weap could play a crucial role in ex ante assessments within planning of awd programs and thus setting spatial and temporal priorities for awd dissemination assuming continuous flooding as business as usual bau irrigation patterns can be improved by distinct aeration periods the number of aerations can range from a single period to multiple periods in the form of awd which represents the end of the scale thus the planning process may compare water requirements of simple campaigns aiming at single aeration vis à vis more frequently drained awd programs in fact a single aeration period at the middle of the season which is often called mid season drainage is common practice in many rice growing regions in turn the assumption of all farmers applying continuous flooding as bau is in many cases too simplistic weap will allow easy adjustments of the bau practices for detailed information on water requirements under different irrigation patterns employing planning tools such as weap enables decision making on water management and allocation across provincial or even national borders to improve water allocation and ensure food security furthermore we

10896,to face the challenges induces by the climate change a better water use in agriculture is needed one of the ways to get it is the genetic selection and breeding programs of genotypes focused on their water use efficiency wue grapevine crop is commonly growing under water stress conditions to improve their wue is a general goal for viticulture in this study we show the variability in wue among clones of tempranillo cvar grown under both pot and field conditions all submitted to a large range of water availability and along three consecutive years leaf net photosynthesis rate an stomatal conductance gs were measured and intrinsic water use efficiency wuei was computed as the ratio an gs firstly we observed that the wuei showed important variations among clones field growing plants consistently showed higher wuei than pot growing ones and an important year effect was observed the differences among genotypes were significant in pot conditions but not in field nevertheless the present results show intra cultivar variability in tempranillo in wuei and therefore the possibility to build a selection program based in this criterion keywords vitis vinifera tempranillo wue stomatal conductance clonal selection water deficit 1 introduction regarding the ipcc predictions for an increase of the average temperatures and the frequency of extreme drought and or warm events ipcc 2014 the improvement of the crops water use efficiency wue has become a priority in basis and applied research in the case of the viticulture this topic is of special interest due to the wide distribution of this crop in semi arid regions flexas et al 2010 zarrouk et al 2016 to achieve an improvement of vineyard wue there are two main ways the agronomic techniques and the genetic improvement medrano et al 2015 the agronomic techniques include the irrigation management and scheduling cifre et al 2005 alternative soil management techniques as cover crops and mulching nguyen et al 2013 pou et al 2011 and different pruning techniques serra et al 2014 among others the genetic improvement is based on the large diversity of the genus vitis carbonell bejerano et al 2013 which allows its cultivation in humid and dry climates medrano et al 2018 this et al 2006 some cultivars are usually considered more drought tolerant than others and a wide variability in wue is already reported bota et al 2016 the wue reflects the balance between carbon gain and the associated cost in water and can be measured at different spatial and temporal scales medrano et al 2018 previous studies tried to quantify this variability measuring wuei in a certain leaf as representative of the plant martorell et al 2015 tomás et al 2014 or estimating wuei as the surrogate character isotope 13 c discrimination in biomass δ13c bchir et al 2016 santesteban et al 2015 in different grapevine cultivars under field conditions however the particularities of the wine market dominated by protected designations of origin dop and protected geographical indications igp in spain equivalent to vqprd in france prevent the replacement of some authorised varieties by others for this reason different clonal selection programmes have been done since last century with success as much in the private as in the public sector some of these achievements were addressed to improve productivity higher diseases resistance or particular adaptation to limiting environmental characteristics bois et al 2016 in this context tempranillo cultivars shows a huge distribution in spain and other countries with more than 200 000 ha cultivated and it is in expansion ibáñez et al 2015 this cultivar is allowed in 28 dop protected denomination of origin and at present there are 49 certified clones of tempranillo cv ibáñez et al 2015 moreover in the last decade variability in tempranillo clones has been shown by rubio and yuste 2004 who founded differences between tempranillo clones in ampelographic description by revilla et al 2009 for anthocyanin fingerprint arrizabalaga et al 2018 in the response of berry sugar and anthocyanin accumulation to elevated temperature among others tello et al 2018 torres et al 2018 in the case of the wuei our group demonstrated in a tempranillo clonal collection that in respect to a wide cultivar collection the variability is at least an 80 of the showed by cultivars tortosa et al 2016 in this study we evaluate the wuei response of seven tempranillo clones measured at different water status and experimental conditions in order to estimate the effect of environmental conditions on the wuei and to evaluate this effect on the comparison of the cultivar performance 2 material methods 2 1 plant material and water status seven tempranillo clones three commercial clones rj43 rj51 and rj78 and four experimental genotypes 232 1048 1052 and 1084 were studied during three consecutive experimental campaigns at field conditions 2015 2017 in addition during the 2017 a pot experiment was made field campaigns were done in the experimental field of the icvv instituto de las ciencias de la vid y el vino logroño la rioja spain and in the experimental field of viveros provedo a commercial nursery viveros provedo s a logroño la rioja spain we measured plant water status and gas exchange parameters in 5 6 plants per clone once per campaign except year 2016 measured tree times in june july and august respectively measurements were done in two sites at the icvv public clonal collection field experimental clones and in viveros provedo commercial clones all clones used in the different experiments were grafted onto 110 richter rootstock trained as a double cordon similarly pruned and managed on a standard procedure the pot experiment was carried out at the experimental field of university of balearic island uib with the plants grafted onto same rootstock 110 r plants were in 20 l pots 5 plants per genotype filled with organic substrate and perlite mixture 5 1 plants were irrigated three times per week from may until plant shoots were about 1 5 m high two weeks later the irrigation dosage was progressively reduced for one month to get a wide range of soil water stress 2 2 gas exchange measurements leaf net photosynthesis an and stomatal conductance gs were measured in a fully exposed mature leaf one per plant n 4 6 per clone all determinations were done between 10 00 and 13 00 h local time using an infrared open gas analyser system li 6400xt li cor inc licoln nebraska usa the co 2 concentration inside the chamber was 400 μmol co 2 mol 1 air par was always above saturation levels wuei was calculated as the ratio between an and gs for pot experiment measurements were performed every week at different plant water status until the stomatal conductance decreased to 0 05 mol h2o m 2 s 1 then irrigation was applied 2 3 data treatment of the wuei gs relationship the strong and negative wuei gs relationship is well known and prevents to compare genotypes under different water status medrano et al 2018 the results obtained were arranged in three categories according to previous reports jara rojas et al 2015 medrano et al 2002 plants under non water stress conditions gs 0 15 mol h2o m 2 s 1 moderate water stress gs between 0 15 0 075 mol h2o m 2 s 1 and severe water stress gs 0 075 mol h2o m 2 s 1 2 4 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using r team 2014 growing conditions pot versus field and genotypes were compared based on differences in their wuei gs regressions slopes using ancova from the car package fox and weisberg 2011 in some cases to increase the robustness of the comparisons we transformed the data with natural logarithm in order to increase the linearity of each regression slope differences in slopes were accepted with p value 0 05 comparison one to one were performed with cld analysis from the emmeans package lenth 2018 3 results 3 1 plant water status and wue considering all the genotypes measured in all experimental conditions gs values ranged between 0 05 and 0 45 mol h2o m 2 s 1 showing a large difference in plant water status the values of net co 2 assimilations an ranged from 3 to 21 μmol co 2 m 2 s 1 which resulted in a large variability of wuei ranging from 20 to 160 μmol co 2 mol 1 h2o the wuei was strongly and negatively related to gs as shown in fig 1 a r2 0 75 the mean values of wuei in each group non stressed moderate and severe water stress see m m section were 60 90 and 115 μmol co 2 mol 1 h20 respectively the regression between wuei gs for each water status fig 1b showed divergences in the magnitude of the effect and the level of significance in stressed plants the slope of wuei gs was higher and the p value lower conversely to observed in non stressed plants 3 2 the year effect on wue at field conditions under field conditions all the genotypes were measured each year and this allowed to test the year effect in the wuei gs relationship we observed that the slope of this relationship in 2015 was significantly different from those of 2016 and 2017 p value 0 05 table 1 generally plants of 2015 showed a higher wuei and especially at low gs but at gs larger than 0 12 wuei was similar between all years fig 2 3 3 pot vs field conditions to compare the effect of the growing conditions field vs pot we evaluated the wue response to gs in each situation along a huge range of gs under field conditions the minimal gs were around 0 045 mol h2o m 2 s 1 and the maximum gs was 0 3 while in pots the maximum reached 0 45 mol h2o m 2 s 1 fig 3 a the wuei gs relationship showed differences between pots and field conditions to confirm this observation we linearized the regressions using the natural logarithm fig 3 b analysis of co variance shows a strong effect on the intercept of the two regressions p value 0 0001 and a significant difference between the two slopes p value 0 05 at low gs difference between the wuei measured in field and pot conditions was higher and this difference was reduced with an increase of gs with a gs of 0 1 mol h2o m 2 s 1 the mean value of wuei in pot conditions was 20 lower than the field conditions and at gs of 0 3 mol h2o m 2 s 1 this difference was around 10 table 2 thus for similar conditions of water stress estimated with gs the wuei was clearly higher for field growing plants we tested this differences removing the year 2015 that showed particularly high wuei and we found the same differences in intercept higher wuei under field conditions but not in slope 3 4 genotype variability on wue to compare the genotypes individual response a linear logarithm regression of each genotype for the different gs was done comparing the performance of each individual genotype under field conditions only table 3 the wuei gs showed r2 between 0 25 and 0 73 average 47 7 regarding the lower r2 and the higher standard errors in the slope estimations no differences were found in the slopes between genotypes under field conditions under pot conditions the r2 varied between 0 48 and 0 85 average 75 1 the management of the irrigation system allowed to measure a wide range of gs with a slightly higher amplitude than under field conditions with maximum values reaching 0 45 mol h2o m 2 s 1 the resultant slopes varied with the same amplitude than in field conditions ranging between 3 7 to 2 2 table 3 in this case the gs x genotypes interaction factor of the anova was significant p value 0 01 this interaction was due to a significant difference in slope between genotypes 1052 and rj78 comparing the regression slopes between field and pot conditions inside each genotype there was no difference in slopes between field and pot conditions thus we repeated the comparison between genotypes but grouping field and pot data of each of them and the interaction factor of the ancova was significant p value 0 05 significant differences were found again between genotypes 1052 and rj78 with slopes between 4 and 2 50 table 3 then genotype 1052 was clearly more conservative in the use of water under non stressed conditions it is important to note that the difference in slope was not accompanied by a systematic higher wue of the genotype 1052 compared to the rj78 fig 4 at low water availability the 1052 showed higher wuei than the rj58 while at higher gs the opposite was observed fig 4 and table 4 4 discussion the performance of seven genotypes of tempranillo cultivar were compared in two different sites for three years and one year in pot conditions along a wide range of soil water availability conditions we found that globally plants grown in field conditions showed higher wuei compared to pot conditions and these differences increased when water availability become more limiting interestingly two of those genotypes showed a statistically different wue gs slopes under pot conditions demonstrating that a genetic diversity in wuei exist at the clonal level inside the same cultivar the an gs and wuei resultant from this study were comprised inside the range of accepted values for the grapevine bota et al 2016 martorell et al 2015 medrano et al 2002 the water management allowed us to obtain a wide range of gs that confirm that plants showed different water status from no stress to severe water stress in both field and pot conditions as was observed by medrano et al 2002 data of stem water potential measured at midday confirmed also this observation not shown overall the wide range of gs allowed us to relate wuei gs through regressions lines with a good estimate of the slope this enabled to compare the slopes between themselves to highlight environmental and genetic differences 4 1 year effect the capacity to maintain the wuei at low gs was clearly higher during the year 2015 in respect to 2016 and 2017 showing an interesting year effect this could be related to a highest water stress conditions during this year compared to 2016 2017 analysing climatic conditions during grapevine growth table 5 precipitations were of 2 6 mm in may 2015 while there were of 19 9 mm and 74 6 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively month of may corresponds to the leaf formation therefore could influence the morphology or biochemistry of the measured leaves there is poor information about the impact of the climate conditions during the leaf development and their consequences in wuei we can nevertheless hypothesise that the strong water stress conditions in may 2015 have influenced the leaf formation narrow vessels higher lma or others factors that could influence leaf performances at low gs ones mature 4 2 field vs pot responses respect to the growing conditions field versus pot data showed an important effect on the wuei gs slope with a systematic higher wue in the field than in pot for a given gs these differences increased as water stress become more severe at lower gs the highest wuei at a given gs in field can be due to a slightly higher leaf photosynthetic capacity of field plants than the plants grown in pots poorter et al 2012 this could be related with leaf biochemistry higher mesophyll conductance or increased leaf hydraulic conductance it is also highly probable that this change could be related to the deeper root system of the field plants bota et al 2001 on the other hand it is poorly probable that the difference comes from a lack of nutrient of the potted plants since pots were irrigated with hoagland solution every two weeks it is also noticeable that plants grown in pots were subjected to well watered conditions until june and then watering was decreased at the desired intensity to obtain the targeted gs on the other hand plants under field conditions were grown under a progressive drought along the summer while in potted plants water stress occurs quickly escalona et al 1999 this means that the measured pot leaves during the summer could have a lower lma because the leaves expanded under well watered conditions a higher lma induce thicker and or denser leaves and then with more photosynthetic tissue per area unit poorter et al 2012 finally a question remains does the genetic variability revealed in pots really exists under field conditions if it is the case increased number of replicates under field conditions will make such differences more evident but for to apply physiological selection criteria the sample number results critical 4 3 genotype variability under field conditions no statistical differences between genotypes were found this was due to higher standards errors in the slope estimations because of lower r2 of the wuei gs first for some of the genotypes the range of gs was lower in field than in pots this reduce the robustness of the slope estimations in many cases on the other hand in pot conditions the lower data dispersion higher r2 allowed to detect the clonal variability where genotypes 1052 and rj78 were identified as statistically different in their wuei gs regression slopes this fine adjustment of the wuei gs regressions corresponds with the fine control of the water management system and the uniformity of soil conditions among plants as was mentioned the highest range of gs also helped to reinforce the regression slope estimations allowing the ancova to find significant differences this ensure that the differences between clones of tempranillo were real and robust the absence of differences in regression slope within each genotype between field and pots allowed us to group field and pot data for each genotype increasing the robustness of each slope estimation the resultant regression obtained within each genotype shown again that genotype 1052 have significant lower slope than rj78 reinforcing the idea that an intra cultivar variability exists this difference is slope could be associated to a higher photosynthetic capacity of the genotype rj78 many factors can explain this difference like higher nitrogen content higher lma or higher mesophyll conductance tomás et al 2014 it is important to note that the difference in slope was not accompanied by a systematic higher wue of the genotype 1052 compared to the rj78 fig 4 under low water availability the genotype 1052 shows higher gs than the genotype rj58 while at higher gs it is at the reverse table 4 this means that each genotype could perform better wue than the other one depending of the water availability conditions nevertheless the physiological underlying mechanism responsible of those differences remains unknown those differences are on the basis of measurements at the leaf scale it is necessary to clarify in which extent those observed differences are also reflected at the whole plant scale and how they are related with others agronomic parameters like harvest production and grape quality 5 conclusion we confirmed that it is possible to find a genetic variability of wuei between clones of the tempranillo cultivar even though an important effect of environment and growing conditions is present we also highlighted the fact that pot and field conditions do not lead to the same values of water use efficiency and that specific climatic conditions during leaf growth influence this behaviour when this environmental variability was reduced in pots experiments a significant genetic variability was detected enabling the identification of certain genotypes with higher and lower wue the joint analysis of pot and field data showed clear coincidences among the two set of data for contrasting wue values of the analysed genotypes future studies could enlarge the panel of genotypes characterised and focus on the underlying processes

10896,to face the challenges induces by the climate change a better water use in agriculture is needed one of the ways to get it is the genetic selection and breeding programs of genotypes focused on their water use efficiency wue grapevine crop is commonly growing under water stress conditions to improve their wue is a general goal for viticulture in this study we show the variability in wue among clones of tempranillo cvar grown under both pot and field conditions all submitted to a large range of water availability and along three consecutive years leaf net photosynthesis rate an stomatal conductance gs were measured and intrinsic water use efficiency wuei was computed as the ratio an gs firstly we observed that the wuei showed important variations among clones field growing plants consistently showed higher wuei than pot growing ones and an important year effect was observed the differences among genotypes were significant in pot conditions but not in field nevertheless the present results show intra cultivar variability in tempranillo in wuei and therefore the possibility to build a selection program based in this criterion keywords vitis vinifera tempranillo wue stomatal conductance clonal selection water deficit 1 introduction regarding the ipcc predictions for an increase of the average temperatures and the frequency of extreme drought and or warm events ipcc 2014 the improvement of the crops water use efficiency wue has become a priority in basis and applied research in the case of the viticulture this topic is of special interest due to the wide distribution of this crop in semi arid regions flexas et al 2010 zarrouk et al 2016 to achieve an improvement of vineyard wue there are two main ways the agronomic techniques and the genetic improvement medrano et al 2015 the agronomic techniques include the irrigation management and scheduling cifre et al 2005 alternative soil management techniques as cover crops and mulching nguyen et al 2013 pou et al 2011 and different pruning techniques serra et al 2014 among others the genetic improvement is based on the large diversity of the genus vitis carbonell bejerano et al 2013 which allows its cultivation in humid and dry climates medrano et al 2018 this et al 2006 some cultivars are usually considered more drought tolerant than others and a wide variability in wue is already reported bota et al 2016 the wue reflects the balance between carbon gain and the associated cost in water and can be measured at different spatial and temporal scales medrano et al 2018 previous studies tried to quantify this variability measuring wuei in a certain leaf as representative of the plant martorell et al 2015 tomás et al 2014 or estimating wuei as the surrogate character isotope 13 c discrimination in biomass δ13c bchir et al 2016 santesteban et al 2015 in different grapevine cultivars under field conditions however the particularities of the wine market dominated by protected designations of origin dop and protected geographical indications igp in spain equivalent to vqprd in france prevent the replacement of some authorised varieties by others for this reason different clonal selection programmes have been done since last century with success as much in the private as in the public sector some of these achievements were addressed to improve productivity higher diseases resistance or particular adaptation to limiting environmental characteristics bois et al 2016 in this context tempranillo cultivars shows a huge distribution in spain and other countries with more than 200 000 ha cultivated and it is in expansion ibáñez et al 2015 this cultivar is allowed in 28 dop protected denomination of origin and at present there are 49 certified clones of tempranillo cv ibáñez et al 2015 moreover in the last decade variability in tempranillo clones has been shown by rubio and yuste 2004 who founded differences between tempranillo clones in ampelographic description by revilla et al 2009 for anthocyanin fingerprint arrizabalaga et al 2018 in the response of berry sugar and anthocyanin accumulation to elevated temperature among others tello et al 2018 torres et al 2018 in the case of the wuei our group demonstrated in a tempranillo clonal collection that in respect to a wide cultivar collection the variability is at least an 80 of the showed by cultivars tortosa et al 2016 in this study we evaluate the wuei response of seven tempranillo clones measured at different water status and experimental conditions in order to estimate the effect of environmental conditions on the wuei and to evaluate this effect on the comparison of the cultivar performance 2 material methods 2 1 plant material and water status seven tempranillo clones three commercial clones rj43 rj51 and rj78 and four experimental genotypes 232 1048 1052 and 1084 were studied during three consecutive experimental campaigns at field conditions 2015 2017 in addition during the 2017 a pot experiment was made field campaigns were done in the experimental field of the icvv instituto de las ciencias de la vid y el vino logroño la rioja spain and in the experimental field of viveros provedo a commercial nursery viveros provedo s a logroño la rioja spain we measured plant water status and gas exchange parameters in 5 6 plants per clone once per campaign except year 2016 measured tree times in june july and august respectively measurements were done in two sites at the icvv public clonal collection field experimental clones and in viveros provedo commercial clones all clones used in the different experiments were grafted onto 110 richter rootstock trained as a double cordon similarly pruned and managed on a standard procedure the pot experiment was carried out at the experimental field of university of balearic island uib with the plants grafted onto same rootstock 110 r plants were in 20 l pots 5 plants per genotype filled with organic substrate and perlite mixture 5 1 plants were irrigated three times per week from may until plant shoots were about 1 5 m high two weeks later the irrigation dosage was progressively reduced for one month to get a wide range of soil water stress 2 2 gas exchange measurements leaf net photosynthesis an and stomatal conductance gs were measured in a fully exposed mature leaf one per plant n 4 6 per clone all determinations were done between 10 00 and 13 00 h local time using an infrared open gas analyser system li 6400xt li cor inc licoln nebraska usa the co 2 concentration inside the chamber was 400 μmol co 2 mol 1 air par was always above saturation levels wuei was calculated as the ratio between an and gs for pot experiment measurements were performed every week at different plant water status until the stomatal conductance decreased to 0 05 mol h2o m 2 s 1 then irrigation was applied 2 3 data treatment of the wuei gs relationship the strong and negative wuei gs relationship is well known and prevents to compare genotypes under different water status medrano et al 2018 the results obtained were arranged in three categories according to previous reports jara rojas et al 2015 medrano et al 2002 plants under non water stress conditions gs 0 15 mol h2o m 2 s 1 moderate water stress gs between 0 15 0 075 mol h2o m 2 s 1 and severe water stress gs 0 075 mol h2o m 2 s 1 2 4 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using r team 2014 growing conditions pot versus field and genotypes were compared based on differences in their wuei gs regressions slopes using ancova from the car package fox and weisberg 2011 in some cases to increase the robustness of the comparisons we transformed the data with natural logarithm in order to increase the linearity of each regression slope differences in slopes were accepted with p value 0 05 comparison one to one were performed with cld analysis from the emmeans package lenth 2018 3 results 3 1 plant water status and wue considering all the genotypes measured in all experimental conditions gs values ranged between 0 05 and 0 45 mol h2o m 2 s 1 showing a large difference in plant water status the values of net co 2 assimilations an ranged from 3 to 21 μmol co 2 m 2 s 1 which resulted in a large variability of wuei ranging from 20 to 160 μmol co 2 mol 1 h2o the wuei was strongly and negatively related to gs as shown in fig 1 a r2 0 75 the mean values of wuei in each group non stressed moderate and severe water stress see m m section were 60 90 and 115 μmol co 2 mol 1 h20 respectively the regression between wuei gs for each water status fig 1b showed divergences in the magnitude of the effect and the level of significance in stressed plants the slope of wuei gs was higher and the p value lower conversely to observed in non stressed plants 3 2 the year effect on wue at field conditions under field conditions all the genotypes were measured each year and this allowed to test the year effect in the wuei gs relationship we observed that the slope of this relationship in 2015 was significantly different from those of 2016 and 2017 p value 0 05 table 1 generally plants of 2015 showed a higher wuei and especially at low gs but at gs larger than 0 12 wuei was similar between all years fig 2 3 3 pot vs field conditions to compare the effect of the growing conditions field vs pot we evaluated the wue response to gs in each situation along a huge range of gs under field conditions the minimal gs were around 0 045 mol h2o m 2 s 1 and the maximum gs was 0 3 while in pots the maximum reached 0 45 mol h2o m 2 s 1 fig 3 a the wuei gs relationship showed differences between pots and field conditions to confirm this observation we linearized the regressions using the natural logarithm fig 3 b analysis of co variance shows a strong effect on the intercept of the two regressions p value 0 0001 and a significant difference between the two slopes p value 0 05 at low gs difference between the wuei measured in field and pot conditions was higher and this difference was reduced with an increase of gs with a gs of 0 1 mol h2o m 2 s 1 the mean value of wuei in pot conditions was 20 lower than the field conditions and at gs of 0 3 mol h2o m 2 s 1 this difference was around 10 table 2 thus for similar conditions of water stress estimated with gs the wuei was clearly higher for field growing plants we tested this differences removing the year 2015 that showed particularly high wuei and we found the same differences in intercept higher wuei under field conditions but not in slope 3 4 genotype variability on wue to compare the genotypes individual response a linear logarithm regression of each genotype for the different gs was done comparing the performance of each individual genotype under field conditions only table 3 the wuei gs showed r2 between 0 25 and 0 73 average 47 7 regarding the lower r2 and the higher standard errors in the slope estimations no differences were found in the slopes between genotypes under field conditions under pot conditions the r2 varied between 0 48 and 0 85 average 75 1 the management of the irrigation system allowed to measure a wide range of gs with a slightly higher amplitude than under field conditions with maximum values reaching 0 45 mol h2o m 2 s 1 the resultant slopes varied with the same amplitude than in field conditions ranging between 3 7 to 2 2 table 3 in this case the gs x genotypes interaction factor of the anova was significant p value 0 01 this interaction was due to a significant difference in slope between genotypes 1052 and rj78 comparing the regression slopes between field and pot conditions inside each genotype there was no difference in slopes between field and pot conditions thus we repeated the comparison between genotypes but grouping field and pot data of each of them and the interaction factor of the ancova was significant p value 0 05 significant differences were found again between genotypes 1052 and rj78 with slopes between 4 and 2 50 table 3 then genotype 1052 was clearly more conservative in the use of water under non stressed conditions it is important to note that the difference in slope was not accompanied by a systematic higher wue of the genotype 1052 compared to the rj78 fig 4 at low water availability the 1052 showed higher wuei than the rj58 while at higher gs the opposite was observed fig 4 and table 4 4 discussion the performance of seven genotypes of tempranillo cultivar were compared in two different sites for three years and one year in pot conditions along a wide range of soil water availability conditions we found that globally plants grown in field conditions showed higher wuei compared to pot conditions and

year effect the capacity to maintain the wuei at low gs was clearly higher during the year 2015 in respect to 2016 and 2017 showing an interesting year effect this could be related to a highest water

10897,all animals require drinking water to live however when animals have access to streams they can impact on water quality due to direct deposition of animal faeces into the water this brings the needs of the animal to drink into direct conflict with society s desire to maintain values for stream health and water quality a literature review was conducted to collate published data on the effectiveness of fencing stock out of waterways streams to reduce faecal indicator bacteria fib concentrations in streams eighteen suitable papers were identified these originated from four different countries and used a range of different fib and experimental approaches reported values of stream fencing effectiveness covered a large range from zero to 96 with a median value of 62 overall the different experimental approaches did not appear to bias results this large range in effectiveness values indicated that while we are confident that stream fencing will improve microbial water quality in streams we have very low confidence in predicting the actual percentage reduction values that can be expected keywords e coli fecal indicator bacteria farms animals stock mitigation 1 introduction all animals require drinking water to live in intensive agricultural systems incorporating both housed and grazed systems water is supplied through water reticulation systems utilising drinking troughs in extensive agricultural systems drinking water is typically supplied by natural streams and creeks flowing through the grazing areas however when animals have access to streams they can impact on stream health habitat and water quality through damage to the stream banks trimble and mendel 1995 or from the direct deposition of animal faeces into the water kay et al 2018 this brings the needs of the animal to drink into direct conflict with society s desire to maintain high values for stream health and water quality there is therefore a need to understand the relative costs and benefits that would be achieved from fencing animals out of streams to calculate the costs of stream fencing requires information on two factors 1 the length of stream requiring fencing and 2 the cost per kilometre of installing the fence calculating both factors depends significantly on local landscape features such as stream density land use topography and labour costs stream density and land use factor information may be available through national and regional gis databases labour costs can be acquired from local fencing contractors cost analysis will also need to budget for providing alternative drinking water sources for the animals something that can be provided by contractors however although these cost variables can be determined with a reasonable level of certainty the resulting benefits of stock exclusion from streams is less clear therefore it is the scientific evidence of the benefits of stream fencing that is the focus of this review the four main contaminants that impact on water quality are nitrogen n phosphorus p sediment and faecal micro organisms mcdowell et al 2017 the n p and sediment that contribute to the overall nutrient losses from the land have multiple sources such as leaching surface runoff fertilizer inputs and soil erosion processes whereas direct inputs from animals appear to be a minor source of nutrient losses monaghan et al 2008 however faecal microbes from direct animal deposition to the stream are of greater concern as 1 the faecal material is fresh and poses a greater risk to public health soller et al 2015 and 2 this deposition frequently occurs during base flow conditions when people are most likely to be swimming or fishing in the contaminated water muirhead 2015 and thus are exposed to infection deposition of faecal material can be reduced by excluding stock from waterways but a complication resulting from stream fencing is that the fenced off area will naturally grow vegetation and act as a vegetative buffer strip reviews of the effectiveness of vegetative buffer strips aarons and gourley 2012 show they are effective at protecting the waterway when nutrient runoff flows through the buffer strip into the stream during discrete high or storm flow events which is the minority of the time in most streams defew et al 2013 in contrast the potential impacts from animals accessing the water to drink will occur daily and will have an impact on microbial concentrations during base flow conditions to address the combined effect of fencing and buffer strip mitigating different microbial transport pathways this review focused on the effect of livestock exclusion via fencing on changes in the faecal microbe numbers as measured in the stream rather than on the effectiveness of reductions in a single transport pathway the aim of our analysis was to review the international literature documenting the effectiveness of stream fencing for reducing faecal pollution of water this information will help inform a cost benefit analyses of this mitigation option 2 methods a literature search was conducted to identify journal or conference papers using the key words of livestock dairy cows cattle sheep beef deer water quality streams waterways off stream in stream faecal or fecal indicator microbial organisms coliforms total coliforms pathogens bacteria streptococci e coli escherichia coli salmonella cryptospordium giardia campylobacter fences fencing fenced unfenced access exclusion exclusion fencing protected and physically protected the usefulness of identified papers were then analysed for their suitability to determine whether they directly provided metrics or provided sufficient data to calculate metrics that could be used to document the effectiveness of stream fencing to reduce stream faecal contamination of the over 100 literature sources that were initially identified only 18 were suitable for the final analysis table 1 most of the literature was considered to be unsuitable for this specific analysis due to a number of different factors a they did not contain quantitative data e g collins et al 2007 b they focused only on animal crossing points e g davies colley et al 2004 c fencing was also associated with a land use change e g donnison et al 2004 d results were focused on manure deposition rates into the stream not changes in e coli concentrations in the water e g larsen et al 1988 e fencing was only one of a number of best management practices bmps included in the study e g meals 1996 f the study only looked at providing off stream water sources without fencing e g sheffield et al 1997 or g the study focused on the effectiveness of the mitigation on a single transport pathway monaghan et al 2016 the final list of suitable studies was selected based on only the faecal indicators of e coli or faecal coliforms and if the paper provided sufficient data to estimate the effectiveness of stream fencing change on faecal microbial numbers in the water no studies contained appropriate data that documented pathogen impacts to water and an insufficient number of studies reported data on faecal streptococci or enterococci numbers 3 results and discussion the first observation from the suitable suite of studies examined was the large contrast in research approaches used in the studies the literature represented data from only four countries one study from canada three from the uk five from new zealand and nine from the usa two papers described the effects of fencing of deer and the rest focused on beef or dairy cattle with some mixed stock types no studies were reported for sheep most of the studies focused on a single land use in some studies there were either a small number of other animals present in the research area or the study was part of a large catchment study that included multiple land uses the studies were conducted at a range of farm and catchment scales and used a variety of research methods of the 18 papers 13 used e coli as the faecal indicator bacteria fib and five papers mostly pre 2000 used faecal coliforms there was a similar spread of effectiveness values from measuring e coli or faecal coliforms in the water samples table 1 the research methods could be classified into four types of approaches modelling paired catchments up and down stream sampling and pre and post treatment sampling the modelling approaches used a range of different modelling techniques a risk index muirhead 2015 export coefficients hampson et al 2010 and total maximum daily loads benham et al 2005 the modelling studies were often used to convert the mitigation effectiveness data on a single transport pathway into the expected changes in microbial numbers in stream which is why they were included in this analysis the paired catchment approach used two catchments usually located side by side and monitored both catchments as controls until there was an established relationship between the water quality in each catchment kay et al 2007 once this relationship was established a treatment was applied to one of the catchments and monitoring continued the effectiveness of the treatment was then determined from the change in relationship between the paired catchments before and after the treatment time period the paired catchment approach is useful as it takes into account between year monitoring variability the up and down stream sampling method quite simply involved collecting samples up and down stream of fenced and unfenced sections of streams and comparing the results gary et al 1983 the pre and post treatment method involved monitoring a stream for a time period then applying the treatment fencing and then continuing monitoring and comparing the results pre and post treatment to take account of the expected year to year variability in water quality data these studies should allow for three years of monitoring for each of the pre and post treatment periods line 2003 treatment effectiveness of fencing can be calculated using two different measures to represent the actual water quality metric concentration or load the concentration measure calculated the effectiveness of stream fencing as the reduction in the concentrations of fib in the water column the concentration measure does not take account of the flow rate in the stream the load measure requires the measurement of the concentration of the fib in the water column and the flow rate in the stream these two factors are multiplied together to calculate the load of fib being discharged by the stream the fib concentrations are typically measured as a series of grab samples at set intervals and flow rates are measured continuously extrapolation techniques are therefore required to estimate fib discharged between the grab sampling time periods defew et al 2013 the load calculations then need to be summed over a set time period usually a year to account for seasonal variations in flow thirteen papers provided the data as changes in concentrations two papers as a change in load and three papers provided enough data to calculate changes of both concentrations and loads six of the 18 papers either quoted ranges of effectiveness or provided enough data to enable the calculation of the range of effectiveness all others provided a single figure or mean effectiveness values the mean effectiveness over all studies ranged from 0 to 96 which is wider than the ranges that were reported by individual studies table 1 from this literature review 21 data points single estimates or average values from each study were identified that could be used to derive effectiveness estimates following the implementation of stream fencing measures potential bias effects needed to be investigated because these 21 data points have been derived from a wide range of contrasting study approaches to identify any bias in the percentage of effectiveness the database was separated into different comparable factors which are summarised in fig 1 the majority of the studies were conducted in nz and the usa where the spread of the results effectively covered the full range from 0 to 96 effectiveness in each country in canada and the uk there were fewer studies and less spread of the data the results do not appear to represent any bias between the research conducted in different countries fig 1a when comparing the results from the different stock types it appears that on average fencing may be more effective on beef farms than dairy or mixed stock farms fig 1b it is possible that this is caused by direct deposition being the dominant source of faecal contamination in extensive beef farming operations donnison et al 2004 in dairy or mixed stock systems there are other sources of contamination such as discharges of farm dairy effluent and therefore on average fencing is less likely to be effective the deer farms have only three data points that cover a wide range of effectiveness however there is significant overlap in all results a comparison of the results from the farm and catchment scale studies is shown in fig 1c the effects of scaling are well known in environmental studies and result in decreased variability of effect as the scale increases cook et al 2013 if we ignore the zero effect results from two of the catchment studies a reduced variability in effectiveness for the catchment studies relative to the farm scale is expected fig 1c however the two catchment studies with zero reported effect of fencing meals 1989 and parkyn et al 2003 require closer investigation in the study reported by meals 1989 both pre and post treatment and paired catchment approaches were used which detected a significant reduction in faecal streptococci numbers but not in faecal coliform numbers the mean pre and post treatment concentrations of faecal coliforms ranged from 32 to 62 cfu 100 m l 1 meals 1989 this lack of a significant decrease was likely due to any reduction in faecal coliform concentrations being less than the natural variability in the data muirhead and meenken 2018 this is a real situation that could occur in any catchment the other study conducted by parkyn et al 2003 investigated up and down stream sampling of six fenced river reaches ranging in length from 196 m to 1998 m in different catchments three of the river reaches showed an improvement in e coli concentrations and three of the reaches deteriorated however because e coli concentration deteriorations were greater in magnitude the overall result showed no improvement from fencing both of the two catchment scale studies that reported zero effectiveness of stream fencing appear to be genuine results as well as the size of the catchment there is also the potential for the location of the study in the stream network to influence the documented effectiveness of the stream fencing potentially a study approach using a headwater catchment area where the land use is solely animal agriculture could be a more effective experimental approach than studying a river reach downstream of other potential sources indeed the data from the literature indicates that the range of results from the reach scale studies was greater than and completely overlapped with the headwater located studies fig 1d of the 18 papers identified 16 papers calculated the effectiveness of stream fencing by comparing stream concentrations and five compared stream loads a comparison of the results by load or concentration is shown in fig 1e the four data points from the load calculations are widely spread and similar to the concentration calculations however it should be noted that for the three papers that provided both metrics the load reduction effectiveness was always less than the corresponding concentration reduction reported table 1 it is expected that the fencing mitigation will be more effective for reducing base flow concentrations in streams than storm flow loads due to the fact that direct animal deposition is relatively small on an annual load basis but will impact during relatively low flow periods muirhead et al 2011 this is clearly shown in the results from sunohara et al 2012 where the effectiveness of the fencing mitigation decreased from 57 to 30 to 22 when they looked at the results under low all and high flow conditions respectively the study by kay et al 2018 also showed more effective reductions under low compared to high flows the load calculations include all data collected during both base and storm flow conditions whereas routine grab sampling will be biased towards data collection under base flow conditions defew et al 2013 consequently it is not surprising that individual studies show differences in fencing effectiveness between concentration and load calculation methods it is important to note that water quality sampling methods can be biased towards either base flow or storm flow conditions but this does not automatically mean the measured results are unsuitable if the water quality target to be protected is the recreational use of the river itself then it is appropriate to use a time based regular sampling methodology as the aim is to determine how often the river is suitable for use the focus in base flow in the river is the concentration of microbes relative to the water quality standards in this situation the river is generally not used during storm flow conditions which comprise only a small proportion of time in europe if these short term pollution events can be predicted and managed then these few samples can be discounted from the overall water quality assessment european parliament 2006 however if the water quality target to be protected is the lake or ocean that the river discharges to then it is often the large storm flow driven pulses of microbes that impact on water quality in this situation it is important to monitor the water quality and quantity during storm events to understand the river loads discharged to the receiving water body these river plumes then mix in the receiving water where the resulting concentrations can impact on bathing or shellfish harvesting water quality standards in the usa the loads of fib are the focus of tmdl programmes usepa 2019 thus it can be appropriate to have water quality monitoring methods that are biased towards sampling during base flow concentrations or storm flow loads depending on the water body you are trying to protect hence the published studies have aimed to address both situations the final comparison looked at results obtained from the use of different research methods fig 1f all three of the measurement methods had some studies that showed no effect of fencing as well as others that had a wide spread of effectiveness the four modelling studies showed less spread and were clustered in the 30 70 range which is not surprising given the fact that models typically use averaged data the combination of the a relatively small data set b large variation in research methodologies and c wide variation in reported results precluded any attempts at meaningful statistical analysis there are likely to be several other factors to affect the effectiveness of stream fencing that were not considered by all of the studies one of the key factors is likely to be size of the stream due to the dilution effect of larger flowrates muirhead et al 2011 this is shown in the work of sunohara et al 2012 in canada where the effectiveness of the stream fencing decreased at higher flowrates kay et al 2018 also showed fencing to be more effective at lower flows however this contrasts with earlier work by kay et al 2007 in scotland where the fencing appeared to be effective at high flows but not during low flows periods other factors that could also impact on the effectiveness of stream fencing could be typology climate and intensity of the farming systems but there was insufficient material in the papers to make any meaning full assessment of these potential affects it is likely that the fencing mitigation will be the most effective where agricultural animals are the dominant source of faecal contamination to the stream a recent national scale water quality modelling analysis of new zealand indicated that the majority 73 84 of contaminant loads were generated in first order streams supporting the need to target headwater streams mcdowell et al 2017 however stream bank fencing of headwater catchments does not appear to be more effective for reducing microbial contamination than fencing stream reaches according to the literature reviewed it therefore appears that the effectiveness of stream fencing to mitigate different contaminants in agricultural landscapes is highly variable and will depend on local factors such as climate soils and the diversity and abundance of faecal sources i e wildlife in the catchment a challenge with developing local data to determine the effectiveness of stream fencing is that a quality study can take 2 6 years to generate results kay et al 2007 line 2003 an alternative to having to use a single number to calculate cost benefit analyses is to use a range of categories covering poor most likely and high effectiveness of stream fencing a summary of all the 21 data points identified in this review shows that the data is right skewed with a median effectiveness of approximately 62 fig 2 different percentile values such as the 10th and 90th percentile values of the distribution could be used as estimates of the poor and highly effective mitigation values for further analysis if the cost benefit analysis is favourable using the poor effectiveness values this may be sufficient to encourage investment in stream fencing as a mitigation in catchments with the hope that future outcomes could be greater this is particularly pertinent as stream fencing will have wider environmental benefits than the reduced fib inputs that have been the focus of this analysis trimble and mendle 1995 aarons and gourley 2012 4 conclusions a review of the literature on the effectiveness of stream fencing has identified 18 papers published on this important topic the papers were from four different countries and used a range of different fib metrics and experimental approaches the published effectiveness covered a large range from zero to 96 with a median value of 62 overall different experimental approaches did not appear to bias results this large range in effectiveness values means that while we are confident that stream fencing will improve microbial water quality we have very low confidence in being able to estimate the actual percentage reductions that can be achieved for any particular location therefore we recommend that a range of 24 to 92 effectiveness is used to represent the 10th to 90th percentile values derived from the literature it is noted that stream fencing will also have wider environmental benefits than just reducing faecal microbial numbers in streams acknowledgements the literature review and analysis were funded by the nz ministry for primary industries this paper was completed with funding from the our land water national science challenge through the sources and flows project 
10897,all animals require drinking water to live however when animals have access to streams they can impact on water quality due to direct deposition of animal faeces into the water this brings the needs of the animal to drink into direct conflict with society s desire to maintain values for stream health and water quality a literature review was conducted to collate published data on the effectiveness of fencing stock out of waterways streams to reduce faecal indicator bacteria fib concentrations in streams eighteen suitable papers were identified these originated from four different countries and used a range of different fib and experimental approaches reported values of stream fencing effectiveness covered a large range from zero to 96 with a median value of 62 overall the different experimental approaches did not appear to bias results this large range in effectiveness values indicated that while we are confident that stream fencing will improve microbial water quality in streams we have very low confidence in predicting the actual percentage reduction values that can be expected keywords e coli fecal indicator bacteria farms animals stock mitigation 1 introduction all animals require drinking water to live in intensive agricultural systems incorporating both housed and grazed systems water is supplied through water reticulation systems utilising drinking troughs in extensive agricultural systems drinking water is typically supplied by natural streams and creeks flowing through the grazing areas however when animals have access to streams they can impact on stream health habitat and water quality through damage to the stream banks trimble and mendel 1995 or from the direct deposition of animal faeces into the water kay et al 2018 this brings the needs of the animal to drink into direct conflict with society s desire to maintain high values for stream health and water quality there is therefore a need to understand the relative costs and benefits that would be achieved from fencing animals out of streams to calculate the costs of stream fencing requires information on two factors 1 the length of stream requiring fencing and 2 the cost per kilometre of installing the fence calculating both factors depends significantly on local landscape features such as stream density land use topography and labour costs stream density and land use factor information may be available through national and regional gis databases labour costs can be acquired from local fencing contractors cost analysis will also need to budget for providing alternative drinking water sources for the animals something that can be provided by contractors however although these cost variables can be determined with a reasonable level of certainty the resulting benefits of stock exclusion from streams is less clear therefore it is the scientific evidence of the benefits of stream fencing that is the focus of this review the four main contaminants that impact on water quality are nitrogen n phosphorus p sediment and faecal micro organisms mcdowell et al 2017 the n p and sediment that contribute to the overall nutrient losses from the land have multiple sources such as leaching surface runoff fertilizer inputs and soil erosion processes whereas direct inputs from animals appear to be a minor source of nutrient losses monaghan et al 2008 however faecal microbes from direct animal deposition to the stream are of greater concern as 1 the faecal material is fresh and poses a greater risk to public health soller et al 2015 and 2 this deposition frequently occurs during base flow conditions when people are most likely to be swimming or fishing in the contaminated water muirhead 2015 and thus are exposed to infection deposition of faecal material can be reduced by excluding stock from waterways but a complication resulting from stream fencing is that the fenced off area will naturally grow vegetation and act as a vegetative buffer strip reviews of the effectiveness of vegetative buffer strips aarons and gourley 2012 show they are effective at protecting the waterway when nutrient runoff flows through the buffer strip into the stream during discrete high or storm flow events which is the minority of the time in most streams defew et al 2013 in contrast the potential impacts from animals accessing the water to drink will occur daily and will have an impact on microbial concentrations during base flow conditions to address the combined effect of fencing and buffer strip mitigating different microbial transport pathways this review focused on the effect of livestock exclusion via fencing on changes in the faecal microbe numbers as measured in the stream rather than on the effectiveness of reductions in a single transport pathway the aim of our analysis was to review the international literature documenting the effectiveness of stream fencing for reducing faecal pollution of water this information will help inform a cost benefit analyses of this mitigation option 2 methods a literature search was conducted to identify journal or conference papers using the key words of livestock dairy cows cattle sheep beef deer water quality streams waterways off stream in stream faecal or fecal indicator microbial organisms coliforms total coliforms pathogens bacteria streptococci e coli escherichia coli salmonella cryptospordium giardia campylobacter fences fencing fenced unfenced access exclusion exclusion fencing protected and physically protected the usefulness of identified papers were then analysed for their suitability to determine whether they directly provided metrics or provided sufficient data to calculate metrics that could be used to document the effectiveness of stream fencing to reduce stream faecal contamination of the over 100 literature sources that were initially identified only 18 were suitable for the final analysis table 1 most of the literature was considered to be unsuitable for this specific analysis due to a number of different factors a they did not contain quantitative data e g collins et al 2007 b they focused only on animal crossing points e g davies colley et al 2004 c fencing was also associated with a land use change e g donnison et al 2004 d results were focused on manure deposition rates into the stream not changes in e coli concentrations in the water e g larsen et al 1988 e fencing was only one of a number of best management practices bmps included in the study e g meals 1996 f the study only looked at providing off stream water sources without fencing e g sheffield et al 1997 or g the study focused on the effectiveness of the mitigation on a single transport pathway monaghan et al 2016 the final list of suitable studies was selected based on only the faecal indicators of e coli or faecal coliforms and if the paper provided sufficient data to estimate the effectiveness of stream fencing change on faecal microbial numbers in the water no studies contained appropriate data that documented pathogen impacts to water and an insufficient number of studies reported data on faecal streptococci or enterococci numbers 3 results and discussion the first observation from the suitable suite of studies examined was the large contrast in research approaches used in the studies the literature represented data from only four countries one study from canada three from the uk five from new zealand and nine from the usa two papers described the effects of fencing of deer and the rest focused on beef or dairy cattle with some mixed stock types no studies were reported for sheep most of the studies focused on a single land use in some studies there were either a small number of other animals present in the research area or the study was part of a large catchment study that included multiple land uses the studies were conducted at a range of farm and catchment scales and used a variety of research methods of the 18 papers 13 used e coli as the faecal indicator bacteria fib and five papers mostly pre 2000 used faecal coliforms there was a similar spread of effectiveness values from measuring e coli or faecal coliforms in the water samples table 1 the research methods could be classified into four types of approaches modelling paired catchments up and down stream sampling and pre and post treatment sampling the modelling approaches used a range of different modelling techniques a risk index muirhead 2015 export coefficients hampson et al 2010 and total maximum daily loads benham et al 2005 the modelling

10898,agricultural system models simulate soil water dynamics and crop evapotranspiration etc and growth to enhance soil and crop management to achieve this simulations must be critically evaluated against field experimental data in different field management conditions in many evaluations simulations deviated from field measurements which can be due to the quality of model input parameters replacing soil hydraulic properties indirectly derived from soil textural data by measured soil hydraulic property may decrease the discrepancy between measured and simulated soil water status what is the benefit of using measured soil hydraulic properties in a model instead of pedo transfer function ptf based approaches to estimate the hydraulic properties indirectly the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of using measured soil hydraulic property input parameters shpip as root zone water quality model rzwqm2 inputs compared to ptf based indirectly derived hydraulic parameter inputs with and without calibration a field experiment with soybean corn and fallow soil was conducted five model scenarios using measured shpip and shpip derived from soil texture as model inputs were created the results indicate that rzwqm2 showed a high sensitivity to the shpip calibration for fallow and corn season uncalibrated measured shpip yielded better simulation results than other shpip scenarios with regard to soil water flux crop evapotranspiration and soybean yield during the validation while the calibration of the shpip in corn and fallow slightly helped soybean soil water prediction at the surface depth hence with representative measurements of shpip it was possible to improve model simulations even without calibrating the input parameters keywords measured soil hydraulic properties model calibration rzwqm2 soil water dynamics 1 introduction estimating soil water dynamics and crop growth information at a high temporal resolution is necessary for many practical purposes such as quantifying water use efficiency and scheduling timely irrigation events agricultural system models are important tools for estimating this information by integrating the complex processes and their interactions in the crop production system and simulating soil water dynamics and crop growth berger 2001 he et al 2017 kersebaum et al 2015 moreover models are helpful tools for evaluating and improving soil water crop management systems because of their capability for simulating a wide range of soil crop atmosphere interactions at a high temporal resolution jones et al 2017a mcnider et al 2015 okada et al 2015 the most important purpose of using these models is to improve the efficiency of field management and to increase the crop production by simulating the impacts of weather and management practices on crop growth and water dynamics careful calibration and validation of the model components with field observations to assess the robustness of the model is a first step in this process angulo et al 2013 wallach et al 2011 white et al 2013 root zone water quality model rzwqm2 is one of the most widely used agricultural system models to simulate soil water crop evapotranspiration etc and crop growth ahuja et al 2000 anapalli et al 2016a it is a helpful tool for estimating soil water dynamics and crop development at a temporal resolution that is impossible to capture with manual field measurements for improving soil and crop management cameira et al 2007 landa et al 1999 however rzwqm2 should not be used as a management tool without rigorously evaluating its parameters with measurements taken in appropriately designed field experiments under different crops climatic conditions and management practices anapalli et al 2016b du et al 2017 hu et al 2006 islam et al 2012 ma et al 2007a anapalli et al 2016a evaluated the rzwqm2 with regard to measured plant and soil parameters from three years of weighing lysimeter data the model showed reasonable performance in simulating actual daily evapotranspiration soil water content and corn zea mays l growth it has also been calibrated and evaluated regarding water stress factors under several irrigation levels to enhance the crop responses to soil water deficit saseendran et al 2014 2015 soil hydraulic property input parameters shpip are a critical part of the model for obtaining realistic simulation results fang et al 2010 shpip have the most impacts on simulated soil water dynamics and subsequently on nutrient balances and crop development cameira et al 2005 ma et al 2009 saseendran et al 2004 in many studies the shpip of rzwqm2 were derived indirectly from soil textural data using pedo transfer functions and then calibrated to obtain a better match between measured and simulated soil water status data although derived shpip are useful pedo transfer functions do not always give realistic estimations notably for structured soils kaur et al 2002 mcbratney et al 2011 wang et al 2012 therefore the accuracy of using derived hydraulic properties as model input parameters even with calibration can lead to poor soil water dynamics evapotranspiration and crop growth simulations gijsman et al 2002 hupet et al 2004 kribaa et al 2001 the model s sensitivity has been tested with regard to measured and derived soil hydraulic input parameters ma et al 2007b evaluated rzwqm s sensitivity by keeping all measured soil hydraulic input parameters constant while only the lateral saturated soil hydraulic conductivity was adjusted the model produced reasonable simulations of tile flow soil water storage and water table r2 0 70 but crop yield was simulated with less accuracy r2 0 55 the soil water content changes are influenced more by soil water retention property inputs while the soil water flux is affected more by hydraulic conductivity inputs ma et al 2009 similarly the leaf area development evapotranspiration and biomass yield are influenced more by changes in plant water stress and water uptake saseendran et al 2014 2015 rzwqm2 performed satisfactorily in simulating the effects of different irrigation treatments on crop evapotranspiration crop growth and yield after calibrating the measured soil hydraulic input properties fang et al 2014a nolan et al 2010 simulated the nitrogen dynamics for deep soil profiles with larger error than for shallow depths because rzwqm2 s minimum input option for soil hydraulic parameters was applied which implies user s inputs of soil textural composition and brooks and corey parameters computed from a pedo transfer function ma et al 2012a additionally a few studies have been conducted using measured data as model inputs although there was uncertainty with those data ma et al 2012b used laboratory measured soil water retention curve swrc and field estimated swrc as model inputs to simulate maize growing season under several irrigation levels model simulations showed that field estimated swrc inputs provided better model responses to irrigation treatments than laboratory measured swrc gribb et al 2009 and starks et al 2003 found that using estimated swrc from soil texture as model inputs showed better simulations of soil water dynamics compared to laboratory measured swrc therefore the model must be provided with the most accurate soil hydraulic parameters to correctly simulate the effect of crop management practices on water dynamics and crop growth ma et al 2009 most often the shpip are measured at one location in a field these measurements may not represent a spatially variable field calibration of the model against spatially distributed soil water contents data may help to obtain field averages of shpip this calibration is best done against the soil water change data in a fallow field in order to minimize the variability and complexity introduced by crop growth and crop water uptake then these fallow soil calibrated parameter values could be tested in modeling soil water changes and biomass production in a cropped field the cropped field may have added spatial variability of soil water due to non uniform water uptake in and between crop rows and due to nonlinearity of water uptake at different soil water contents especially at lower water contents commonly the shpip parameters are calibrated against soil water content data in a cropped field which may include the spatial variability of shpip as well as the added variability of soil water due to above water uptake effects however using field measured soil hydraulic parameters as model inputs to simulate varied field conditions without calibration has not been adequately studied for that reason the objectives of this study were to i explore the effects of using measured shpip as model inputs without or with calibration on model simulation outputs of water status and crop growth under different field conditions and ii explore the effects of field conditions on the calibration of soil hydraulic property input prameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental design the experiment was conducted at the university of kentucky s spindletop research farm in lexington kentucky field study took place in a 0 2 ha the climate is humid subtropical with an average annual precipitation of 114 cm and a mean annual temperature of 13 c the soil is a maury silt loam classified as a mixed semiactive mesic typic paleudalf yang et al 2013 a soil profile was opened for collecting disturbed and undisturbed soil samples fig 1 the samples were taken at five soil depths of 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 and 80 90 cm three replicate samples were collected to determine the soil physical and hydraulic propertis at each depth the undisturbed samples were used to determine unsaturated hydraulic conductivity bulk density and soil water retention curve the soil textural analysis was based on disturbed sample material unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was measured with the double plate pressure membrane apparatus method for pressure heads of 1 5 and 10 cm wendroth and simunek 1999 and with the evaporation method for pressure heads from 10 to 650 cm wendroth and wypler 2008 wendroth et al 1993 wind 1968 soil texture was determined after destroying the soil organic matter content by using h2o2 with the sieving and pipette method gee and bauder 1986 soil water retention curve was measured with the hanging water column method for pressure heads of 3 10 20 and 50 cm berliner et al 1980 pressure plate apparatus for pressures heads of 100 330 500 1000 3000 5000 15 000 cm klute 1986 and dew point meters gee et al 1992 for the very low range of soil water potential soil dry bulk density was determined with the core sampling method blake 1965 the arithmetic mean of three replicates was used for each measured property at each layer saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured in the field with the borehole permeameter approach soil measurement systems reynolds and elrick 1986 at five depths 10 30 50 70 and 90 cm with two replicates per depth fig 1 soybeans asgrow ag3932 were planted on may 20 2015 with row spacing of 76 cm and population of 444 600 seeds per hectare and were harvested on october 23 2015 the period of the fallow soil lasted from october 24 2015 to may 1 2016 corn agrigold a6499 was planted on may 16 2016 with row spacing of 76 cm and population of 69 160 seeds per hectare and was harvested on september 27 2016 soil water content swc was measured about once per week during the crop growing seasons and about once a month during the fallow soil period at 10 cm depth increments from the soil surface down to 100 cm depth at 30 positions fig 1 using a capacitance probe diviner 2000 sentek pty ltd this probe has been tested in several studies e g geesing et al 2004 wendroth et al 2013 and it yielded satisfactory results it was also calibrated for the same field with regards to measured gravimetric water content unpublished data the soil water flux swf across the 90 cm plane i e the vertical center of the 80 90 and 90 100 cm depth compartment was quantified based on darcy s law for the days of measured soil water content using a unit gradient from soil water and soil water retention data the actual evapotranspiration etc was quantified for the soybean and corn using the soil water balance method swb djaman and irmak 2013 frimpong et al 2012 irmak et al 2008 zeleke and wade 2012 zhang et al 2008 wieser et al 2008 1 e t c p i s w f r δ s where p is precipitation i is irrigation swf is soil water flux across the lower boundary r is runoff and δs is the change in soil water storage all components of the swb method are given a unit of length per time mm day the change in soil water storage δs was obtained from consecutive capacitance probe measurements δs was quantified at 30 positions to gain insights into its spatial representativity swf is the height of water per time that is either lost across the lower boundary out of the root zone profile as deep drainage or gained through upward capillary rise into the root zone irrigation was set to zero because crops were grown under rainfed conditions runoff was also set to zero due to the low field slop daily solar radiation maximum and minimum air temperature rainfall wind speed and relative humidity were recorded at the research field with an et107 weather station campbell scientific inc fig 2 shows the daily precipitation and air temperature during the study period leaf area index lai was measured twice during the soybean growing season and twice during the corn growing season using a li cor lai 2000 plant canopy analyzer four readings of lai were taken at each lai measurement each reading consisted of two readings above the canopy and three below the canopy near the ground surface corn aboveground biomass was measured once in the mid season the total yield was determined at harvest for both crops 2 2 rzwqm2 calibration and sensitivity soil water dynamics are processed in the rzwqm2 model based on several equations modified forms of the brooks and corey 1964 equation are used for describing soil hydraulic properties ahuja et al 2000 the richards equation is applied for water redistribution in the profile between rainfall or irrigation events and for the upper and lower boundary flux infiltration during rainfall or irrigation events is described with the green ampt equation ahuja et al 2000 plant water uptake is estimated with the nimah hanks equation 1973 when the generic plant growth module is invoked actual crop evapotranspiration simulated by rzwqm2 is a sum of actual soil evaporation and actual crop transpiration ahuja et al 2000 actual soil evaporation is calculated using richards soil water movement equation by assuming that the evaporative demand is equal to the potential evaporation rate at the soil surface saseendran et al 2014 actual crop transpiration is computed by an empirical root water uptake equation nimah and hanks 1973 that is not allowed to exceed the potential plant transpiration the potential soil evaporation crop transpiration rate are obtained from the extended shuttleworth and wallace 1985 et model farahani and ahuja 1996 for estimating etc the resistances in the soil canopy residue system caused by crop residues are included by the extended shuttleworth wallace model farahani and ahuja 1996 which is a double layer version of the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 a continuous experiment on one field over two years with soybean corn and fallow soil was used to build five model scenarios table 1 with regard to soil hydraulic property input parameters for investigating the effect of using measured soil properties fig 3 the model was calibrated for each scenario separately following the calibration procedure that was explained by the model developers in several publications cameira et al 2007 2005 hanson et al 1999 kumar et al 1999 ma et al 2011 2012a ma et al 2012b 2003 saseendran et al 2004 shaffer et al 2001 all agronomic operations were input in to the model and were the same for each simulation scenario daily weather data solar radiation maximum and minimum temperature wind speed relative humidity and rainfall were used as model input data for the study period the soil profile was subdivided into ten layers the depths of the layers were 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 50 60 60 70 70 80 80 90 90 150 cm five model scenarios were built table 1 with regard to measured and derived soil hydraulic property input parameters to study the effect of using measured or indirectly estimated soil hydraulic properties as model input on simulation outputs table 1 shows the soil hydraulic input parameters for each model scenario those scenarios were as follows in the first scenario ucm the arithmetic means of measured soil texture bulk density saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and water content wc at 0 10 0 33 and 15 bar were used as model inputs at each depth without calibration for each of fallow soil corn and soybean period in the second and third scenarios measured shpip bulk density saturated hydraulic conductivity and water content at 0 10 0 33 and 15 bar were calibrated for the fallow soil fcm and corn crop ccm and then both scenarios were validated under the soybean crop in both scenarios all aforementioned shpip were calibrated within one standard error of measured values except the wc inputs at 15 bar were calibrated within two standard errors of measured values fig 3 in the fourth and fifth scenarios the estimated shpip derived from soil texture using pedo transfer function were calibrated for the fallow soil fcp and corn crop ccp and then both scenarios were validated under the soybean crop in the fourth and fifth scenarios only measured soil texture was used as model input for each depth and the other parameters were estimated using the rawls et al 1982 equation based on soil textural data the crop parameters of the corn and soybean were used as dssat default values without any adjustment by using the best representative cultivars for the corn and soybean crops which were pc0004 2700 2750 gdd and 990 004 m group 4 respectively as shown in table 2 the model was run separately for each scenario and in all scenarios the model simulation was initiated at three months ahead of planting to equilibrate the initial conditions of the soil water dynamics based on the measured precipitation saseendran et al 2014 in each of ccm fcm ccp and fcp scenarios the soil hydraulic input parameters were iteratively calibrated layer by layer starting from the surface layer until the best simulated soil water dynamics were obtained ma et al 2011 saseendran et al 2014 the performance of each model scenario was evaluated by using 1 root mean squared error rmse 2 mean bias error mbe 3 normalized root mean square errors nrmse and 4 percentage error e 2 r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 3 m b e 1 n p i o i 4 n r m s e r m s e o a v g 5 e p a v g o a v g o a v g 100 where oi is the measured value pi is the simulated value oavg is the arithmetic mean of measured values pavg is the arithmetic mean of simulated values and n is the number of measurements rmse reflects a magnitude of the mean difference between measured and simulated results there is no standard value that would characterize a satisfactory rmse because the acceptable range of rmse varies with the measured characteristic method of measurements crop type and management practice ma and selim 1996 the mbe indicates a systematic positive or negative bias in the simulations a positive value means an overestimation and a negative value indicates underestimation ma et al 2011 nrmse indicates the goodness of the model performance as suggested by ahuja and ma 2002 a perfect match between experimental and simulation results would yielded an nrmse 0 an nrmse less than 1 may be interpreted as simulation error of less than one standard deviation around the experimental mean ma et al 2011 percentage error e is the percentage error between measured and simulated values 3 results and discussions the soil hydraulic property module in rzwqm2 is among the modules with a substantial impact on the model outputs due to the direct impact of the shpip scenarios on the simulated soil water dynamics the measured and simulated swc was presented at 10 cm depth increments from the soil surface down to the 100 cm depth for evaluating the model performance under different model inputs of shpip fig 4 shows the measured and daily simulated swc during the fallow soil period the model simulated swc satisfactorily at the soil surface depth with rmse of 0 05 0 04 and 0 03 cm3 cm3 for the ucm fcm and fcp scenario respectively the nrmse values at the same depth were 0 15 0 14 and 0 11 for the ucm fcm and fcp scenario respectively fig 4 a during the corn growing season ucm ccm and ccp scenarios presented the highest rmse mbe and nrmse values at the soil surface depth 0 10 cm and their values decreased with increasing soil depth the swc was simulated with a rmse of 0 11 0 07 and 0 11 cm3 cm3 for the ucm ccm and ccp scenario respectively fig 5 a the nrmse values at the same depth were 0 58 0 35 and 0 59 for the ucm ccm and ccp scenario respectively the model provided satisfactory results of swc with all scenarios particularly during the period of high soil water however during the period of low soil water the ucm scenario showed a tendency to overestimate the swc more than ccm and ccp scenarios due to the impact of input values of wc at 0 10 0 33 and 15 bar low input values of wc at 15 bar e g wc 0 07 cm3 cm3 in the ccm and ccp scenario increased the model ability for simulating the swc at low soil water statistically the ccm scenario showed better simulations of swc than the ucm and ccp scenarios particularly at the surface depths fallow simulations demonstrated better performance statistics than the corn season because there was only evaporation from the bare soil and it was not complicated by plant transpiration fang et al 2010 additionally the ccm scenario was the best indicating higher or more complex spatial variation under corn that was helped with calibration of measured data ccm in corn compared with fallow field rmse mbe and nrmse values were decreased with increasing the soil depth for corn growing season and fallow soil period fig 6 shows the validation of all model scenarios ccm ccp fcm and fcp during the soybean growing season in general the swc at all depths increased following the rainfall events and decreased following active crop water uptake saseendran et al 2015 and drought conditions the values of the rmse and nrmse decreased with increasing soil depth all scenarios yielded satisfactory simulations of swc particularly for the wet period with the rmse values of 0 10 0 07 0 10 0 08 and 0 09 cm3 cm3 for the ucm ccm ccp fcm and fcp respectively at the surface layer fig 6 a also the nrmse values for the same layer were 0 46 0 30 0 45 0 35 and 0 40 for the ucm ccm ccp fcm and fcp respectively the statistical results for all model scenarios were comparable to those reported by cameira et al 2005 the ucm scenario presented the highest tendency of overestimating the swc during the dry period on day 258 267 of the year whereas the ccm presented the best simulations of swc followed by fcm during the same period indicating that the calibration of the shpip in corn and fallow helped soybean soil water prediction as well as due to the effect of the model input values for wc at 0 33 and 15 bar the swc simulations of all scenarios indicated that increasing model input values for wc at 0 33 bar improved the model capability to simulate the swc under wet conditions while decreasing model input values of wc at 15 bar increased the model capability to simulate the swc under dry conditions therefore extending the range between wc at 0 33 bar and wc at 15 bar was the best way to improve the simulations of swc similarly to fang et al 2014b simulation results the model yielded better swc simulations during wet than during dry conditions the measured swf for the days with measurements of swc and daily simulated swf across the 90 cm plane for the corn growing season fallow soil period and soybean growing season are presented in fig 7 the calibration for the fallow soil period and corn growing season yielded satisfactory simulations of the swf for all scenarios fig 7 a b during the fallow soil period the ucm fcm and fcp scenarios simulated the swf with rmse of 1 16 2 27 and 1 12 mm day respectively also during the corn growing season the ucm ccm and ccp scenarios simulated the swf with rmse of 0 42 0 50 and 0 59 mm day respectively the validation of all model scenarios during the soybean growing season revealed the best simulation results of swf for the ucm scenario with rmse of 0 77 mm day fig 7 c the ccm ccp fcm and fcp scenarios simulated the swf with 3 45 1 50 3 00 and 2 80 mm day respectively the simulations of the swf of all model scenarios indicated that simulated swf out of the root zone was appreciably affected by the model input parameters of soil bulk density and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity more than the swrc inputs these results are in agreement with ma et al 2009 who found that soil water dynamics were more affected by model inputs of ksat than by swrc inputs with increasing the values of soil bulk density and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity inputs the swf out of the root zone was increased which probably reflects the effect of bulk density on the soil porosity and the water holding capacity daily average actual crop evapotranspiration was computed over about 7 day periods with the soil water balance method and compared with daily simulated etc for the ucm ccm and ccp scenarios during the corn growing season fig 8 a the corn etc was simulated with a rmse of 1 24 1 27 and 1 13 mm day for the ucm ccm and ccp respectively all scenarios performed well regarding nrmse which was around 0 30 similarly to et simulation results presented by qi et al 2016 a tendency to underestimate etc particularly during the middle of the crop growing season was shown for ucm ccm and ccp scenarios moreover the ucm scenario showed a tendency to underestimate corn etc more than the other scenarios at the ripening stage of the growing season due to the effect of simulated water stress water stress is a ratio of actual crop evapotranspiration to potential crop evapotranspiration saseendran et al 2014 which appeared during this stage in the ucm simulations fig 9 a water stress at any crop development stage affects the crop growth and subsequently it affects the etc allen et al 2011 alves and cameira 2002 farahani and ahuja 1996 marek et al 2014 during the validation of all soybean modeling scenarios fig 8 b ucm ccm ccp fcm and fcp simulated the soybean etc with rmse values around 1 45 mm day and nrmse values around 0 42 which is within the range given by anapalli et al 2016a moreover the ucm and fcm scenarios offered better etc simulations than the other scenarios particularly at the ripening stage the water stress lai aboveground biomass and yield results for corn are presented in fig 9 corn water stress just appeared at the ripening stage of the ucm simulations due to the effect of the model inputs of the wc at 0 33 and 15 bar as previously mentioned simulated corn lai aboveground biomass and yield using the ucm scenario were lower than the simulations of the ccm and ccp scenarios due to the effect of simulated water stress although the plants are capable to extract soil water from soil layers to minimize water stress teuling et al 2006 the crop growth was considerably affected as the simulated water stress revealed during the validation of soybean growth simulations all scenarios showed water stress at the ripening stage except the ccm scenario fig 9 b however the ucm scenario showed higher water stress than the other scenarios simulated soybean lai fig 9 d aboveground biomass fig 9 f and yield fig 9 h were affected by simulated water stress the ucm scenario yielded better simulations of crop growth and yield than the other scenarios it simulated the soybean yield with an error of 0 9 while the other scenarios simulated the soybean yield with an error of around 70 high error values in crop yield simulations in this season were due to the effect of simulated water stress overall the simulations of the crop growth and yield were appreciably affected by simulated water stress similar results were obtained by saseendran et al 2014 and 2015 under different water stress factors and sezen et al 2014 under different irrigation treatments from the simulated results of all scenarios we found that the shpip clearly influenced all simulation results moreover the shpip much more strongly influenced the simulation results of crop growth water stress and etc than the soil water content and soil water flux during the validation phase measured shpip that were used without calibration showed better simulation results than the other model inputs of calibrated and derived shpip which indicates the advantage of using measured shpip without calibration 4 conclusions in order to improve rzwqm2 simulations the model sensitivity and capability were examined under different field conditions with regard to the soil hydraulic property input parameters measured and derived shpip were used as model inputs with and without calibration under different field conditions to explore the possibility of improving the model simulations rzwqm2 simulations showed a high sensitivity to the model inputs of the shpip model input parameters of wc at 0 1 0 3 and 15 bar showed high effect on simulated soil water dynamics crop growth and crop evapotranspiration the soil water content was affected more by input parameters of wc at 0 1 0 3 and 15 bar than other soil hydraulic inputs whereas the soil water flux was affected by the saturated hydraulic conductivity and bulk density more than the wc inputs water stress at any time during the crop growing season significantly affected the simulations of crop growth evapotranspiration and yield therefore calibrating the water stress directly after soil water dynamics would significantly improve model simulations of crop development and evapotranspiration using representative measured soil hydraulic properties as model inputs has shown to be effective for improving model performance and producing meaningful outputs especially with regard to simulated soil water dynamics crop evapotranspiration and crop development measured shpip were essential to build a rzwqm2 model that produced satisfactory results even without calibration notwithstanding similar testing across diverse field conditions soil crop and weather could be a critical need in the future to facilitate building further confidence in the using of measured soil hydraulic parameters as model inputs

10898,agricultural system models simulate soil water dynamics and crop evapotranspiration etc and growth to enhance soil and crop management to achieve this simulations must be critically evaluated against field experimental data in different field management conditions in many evaluations simulations deviated from field measurements which can be due to the quality of model input parameters replacing soil hydraulic properties indirectly derived from soil textural data by measured soil hydraulic property may decrease the discrepancy between measured and simulated soil water status what is the benefit of using measured soil hydraulic properties in a model instead of pedo transfer function ptf based approaches to estimate the hydraulic properties indirectly the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of using measured soil hydraulic property input parameters shpip as root zone water quality model rzwqm2 inputs compared to ptf based indirectly derived hydraulic parameter inputs with and without calibration a field experiment with soybean corn and fallow soil was conducted five model scenarios using measured shpip and shpip derived from soil texture as model inputs were created the results indicate that rzwqm2 showed a high sensitivity to the shpip calibration for fallow and corn season uncalibrated measured shpip yielded better simulation results than other shpip scenarios with regard to soil water flux crop evapotranspiration and soybean yield during the validation while the calibration of the shpip in corn and fallow slightly helped soybean soil water prediction at the surface depth hence with representative measurements of shpip it was possible to improve model simulations even without calibrating the input parameters keywords measured soil hydraulic properties model calibration rzwqm2 soil water dynamics 1 introduction estimating soil water dynamics and crop growth information at a high temporal resolution is necessary for many practical purposes such as quantifying water use efficiency and scheduling timely irrigation events agricultural system models are important tools for estimating this information by integrating the complex processes and their interactions in the crop production system and simulating soil water dynamics and crop growth berger 2001 he et al 2017 kersebaum et al 2015 moreover models are helpful tools for evaluating and improving soil water crop management systems because of their capability for simulating a wide range of soil crop atmosphere interactions at a high temporal resolution jones et al 2017a mcnider et al 2015 okada et al 2015 the most important purpose of using these models is to improve the efficiency of field management and to increase the crop production by simulating the impacts of weather and management practices on crop growth and water dynamics careful calibration and validation of the model components with field observations to assess the robustness of the model is a first step in this process angulo et al 2013 wallach et al 2011 white et al 2013 root zone water quality model rzwqm2 is one of the most widely used agricultural system models to simulate soil water crop evapotranspiration etc and crop growth ahuja et al 2000 anapalli et al 2016a it is a helpful tool for estimating soil water dynamics and crop development at a temporal resolution that is impossible to capture with manual field measurements for improving soil and crop management cameira et al 2007 landa et al 1999 however rzwqm2 should not be used as a management tool without rigorously evaluating its parameters with measurements taken in appropriately designed field experiments under different crops climatic conditions and management practices anapalli et al 2016b du et al 2017 hu et al 2006 islam et al 2012 ma et al 2007a anapalli et al 2016a evaluated the rzwqm2 with regard to measured plant and soil parameters from three years of weighing lysimeter data the model showed reasonable performance in simulating actual daily evapotranspiration soil water content and corn zea mays l growth it has also been calibrated and evaluated regarding water stress factors under several irrigation levels to enhance the crop responses to soil water deficit saseendran et al 2014 2015 soil hydraulic property input parameters shpip are a critical part of the model for obtaining realistic simulation results fang et al 2010 shpip have the most impacts on simulated soil water dynamics and subsequently on nutrient balances and crop development cameira et al 2005 ma et al 2009 saseendran et al 2004 in many studies the shpip of rzwqm2 were derived indirectly from soil textural data using pedo transfer functions and then calibrated to obtain a better match between measured and simulated soil water status data although derived shpip are useful pedo transfer functions do not always give realistic estimations notably for structured soils kaur et al 2002 mcbratney et al 2011 wang et al 2012 therefore the accuracy of using derived hydraulic properties as model input parameters even with calibration can lead to poor soil water dynamics evapotranspiration and crop growth simulations gijsman et al 2002 hupet et al 2004 kribaa et al 2001 the model s sensitivity has been tested with regard to measured and derived soil hydraulic input parameters ma et al 2007b evaluated rzwqm s sensitivity by keeping all measured soil hydraulic input parameters constant while only the lateral saturated soil hydraulic conductivity was adjusted the model produced reasonable simulations of tile flow soil water storage and water table r2 0 70 but crop yield was simulated with less accuracy r2 0 55 the soil water content changes are influenced more by soil water retention property inputs while the soil water flux is affected more by hydraulic conductivity inputs ma et al 2009 similarly the leaf area development evapotranspiration and biomass yield are influenced more by changes in plant water stress and water uptake saseendran et al 2014 2015 rzwqm2 performed satisfactorily in simulating the effects of different irrigation treatments on crop evapotranspiration crop growth and yield after calibrating the measured soil hydraulic input properties fang et al 2014a nolan et al 2010 simulated the nitrogen dynamics for deep soil profiles with larger error than for shallow depths because rzwqm2 s minimum input option for soil hydraulic parameters was applied which implies user s inputs of soil textural composition and brooks and corey parameters computed from a pedo transfer function ma et al 2012a additionally a few studies have been conducted using measured data as model inputs although there was uncertainty with those data ma et al 2012b used laboratory measured soil water retention curve swrc and field estimated swrc as model inputs to simulate maize growing season under several irrigation levels model simulations showed that field estimated swrc inputs provided better model responses to irrigation treatments than laboratory measured swrc gribb et al 2009 and starks et al 2003 found that using estimated swrc from soil texture as model inputs showed better simulations of soil water dynamics compared to laboratory measured swrc therefore the model must be provided with the most accurate soil hydraulic parameters to correctly simulate the effect of crop management practices on water dynamics and crop growth ma et al 2009 most often the shpip are measured at one location in a field these measurements may not represent a spatially variable field calibration of the model against spatially distributed soil water contents data may help to obtain field averages of shpip this calibration is best done against the soil water change data in a fallow field in order to minimize the variability and complexity introduced by crop growth and crop water uptake then these fallow soil calibrated parameter values could be tested in modeling soil water changes and biomass production in a cropped field the cropped field may have added spatial variability of soil water due to non uniform water uptake in and between crop rows and due to nonlinearity of water uptake at different soil water contents especially at lower water contents commonly the shpip parameters are calibrated against soil water content data in a cropped field which may include the spatial variability of shpip as well as the added variability of soil water due to above water uptake effects however using field measured soil hydraulic parameters as model inputs to simulate varied field conditions without calibration has not been adequately studied for that reason the objectives of this study were to i explore the effects of using measured shpip as model inputs without or with calibration on model simulation outputs of water status and crop growth under different field conditions and ii explore the effects of field conditions on the calibration of soil hydraulic property input prameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental design the experiment was conducted at the university of kentucky s spindletop research farm in

unsaturated hydraulic conductivity bulk density and soil water retention curve the soil textural analysis was based on disturbed sample material unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was measured with the double plate pressure membrane apparatus method for pressure heads of 1 5 and 10 cm wendroth and simunek 1999 and with the evaporation method for pressure heads from 10 to 650 cm wendroth and wypler 2008 wendroth et al 1993 wind 1968 soil texture was determined after destroying the soil organic matter content by using h2o2 with the sieving and pipette method gee and bauder 1986 soil water retention curve was measured with the hanging water column method for pressure heads of 3 10 20 and 50 cm berliner et al 1980 pressure plate apparatus for pressures heads of 100 330 500 1000 3000 5000 15 000 cm klute 1986 and dew point meters gee et al 1992 for the very low range of soil water potential soil dry bulk density was determined with the core sampling method blake 1965 the arithmetic mean of three replicates was used for each measured property at each layer saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured in the field with the borehole permeameter approach soil measurement systems reynolds and elrick 1986 at five depths 10 30 50 70 and 90 cm with two replicates per depth fig 1 soybeans asgrow ag3932 were planted on may 20 2015 with row spacing of 76 cm and population of 444 600 seeds per hectare and were harvested on october 23 2015 the period of the fallow soil lasted from october 24 2015 to may 1 2016 corn agrigold a6499 was planted on may 16 2016 with row spacing of 76 cm and population of 69 160 seeds per hectare and was harvested on september 27 2016 soil water content swc was measured about once per week during the crop growing seasons and about once a month during the fallow soil period at 10 cm depth increments from the soil surface down to 100 cm depth at 30 positions fig 1 using a capacitance probe diviner 2000 sentek pty ltd this probe has been tested in several studies e g geesing et al 2004 wendroth et al 2013 and it yielded satisfactory results it was also calibrated for the same field with regards to measured gravimetric water content unpublished data the soil water flux swf across the 90 cm plane i e the vertical center of the 80 90 and 90 100 cm depth compartment was quantified based on darcy s law for the days of measured soil water content using a unit gradient from soil water and soil water retention data the actual evapotranspiration etc was quantified for the soybean and corn using the soil water balance method swb djaman and irmak 2013 frimpong et al 2012 irmak et al 2008 zeleke and wade 2012 zhang et al 2008 wieser et al 2008 1 e t c p i s w f r δ s where p is precipitation i is irrigation swf is soil water flux across the lower boundary r is runoff and δs is the change in soil water storage all components of the swb method are given a unit of length per time mm day the change in soil water storage δs was obtained from consecutive capacitance probe measurements δs was quantified at 30 positions to gain insights into its spatial representativity swf is the height of water per time that is either lost across the lower boundary out of the root zone profile as deep drainage or gained through upward capillary rise into the root zone irrigation was set to zero because crops were grown under rainfed conditions runoff was also set to zero due to the low field slop daily solar radiation maximum and minimum air temperature rainfall wind speed and relative humidity were recorded at the research field with an et107 weather station campbell scientific inc fig 2 shows the daily precipitation and air temperature during the study period leaf area index lai was measured twice during the soybean growing season and twice during the corn growing season using a li cor lai 2000 plant canopy analyzer four readings of lai were taken at each lai measurement each reading consisted of two readings above the canopy and three below the canopy near the ground surface corn aboveground biomass was measured once in the mid season the total yield was determined at harvest for both crops 2 2 rzwqm2 calibration and sensitivity soil water dynamics are processed in the rzwqm2 model based on several equations modified forms of the brooks and corey 1964 equation are used for describing soil hydraulic properties ahuja et al 2000 the richards equation is applied for water redistribution in the profile between rainfall or irrigation events and for the upper and lower boundary flux infiltration during rainfall or irrigation events is described with the green ampt equation ahuja et al 2000 plant water uptake is estimated with the nimah hanks equation 1973 when the generic plant growth module is invoked actual crop evapotranspiration simulated by rzwqm2 is a sum of actual soil evaporation and actual crop transpiration ahuja et al 2000 actual soil evaporation is calculated using richards soil water movement equation by assuming that the evaporative demand is equal to the potential evaporation rate at the soil surface saseendran et al 2014 actual crop transpiration is computed by an empirical root water uptake equation nimah and hanks 1973 that is not allowed to exceed the potential plant transpiration the potential soil evaporation crop transpiration rate are obtained from the extended shuttleworth and wallace 1985 et model farahani and ahuja 1996 for estimating etc the resistances in the soil canopy residue system caused by crop residues are included by the extended shuttleworth wallace model farahani and ahuja 1996 which is a double layer version of the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 a continuous experiment on one field over two years with soybean corn and fallow soil was used to build five model scenarios table 1 with regard to soil hydraulic property input parameters for investigating the effect of using measured soil properties fig 3 the model was calibrated for each scenario separately following the calibration procedure that was explained by the model developers in several publications cameira et al 2007 2005 hanson et al 1999 kumar et al 1999 ma et al 2011 2012a ma et al 2012b 2003 saseendran et al 2004 shaffer et al 2001 all agronomic operations were input in to the model and were the same for each simulation scenario daily weather data solar radiation maximum and minimum temperature wind speed relative humidity and rainfall were used as model input data for the study period the soil profile was subdivided into ten layers the depths of the layers were 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 50 60 60 70 70 80 80 90 90 150 cm five model scenarios were built table 1 with regard to measured and derived soil hydraulic property input parameters to study the effect of using measured or indirectly estimated soil hydraulic properties as model input on simulation outputs table 1 shows the soil hydraulic input parameters for each model scenario those scenarios were as follows in the first scenario ucm the arithmetic means of measured soil texture bulk density saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and water content wc at 0 10 0 33 and 15 bar were used as model inputs at each depth without calibration for each of fallow soil corn and soybean period in the second and third scenarios measured shpip bulk density saturated hydraulic conductivity and water content at 0 10 0 33 and 15 bar were calibrated for the fallow soil fcm and corn crop ccm and then both scenarios were validated under the soybean crop in both scenarios all aforementioned shpip were calibrated within one standard error of measured values except the wc inputs at 15 bar were calibrated within two standard errors of measured values fig 3 in the fourth and fifth scenarios the estimated shpip derived from soil texture using pedo transfer function were calibrated for the fallow soil fcp and corn crop ccp and then both scenarios were validated under the soybean crop in the fourth and fifth scenarios only measured soil texture was used as model input for each depth and the other parameters were estimated using the rawls et al 1982 equation based on soil textural data the crop parameters of the corn and soybean were used as dssat default values without any adjustment by using the best representative cultivars for the corn and soybean crops which were pc0004 2700 2750 gdd and 990 004 m group 4 respectively as shown in table 2 the model was run separately for each scenario and in all scenarios the model simulation was initiated at three months ahead of planting to equilibrate the initial conditions of the soil water dynamics based on the measured precipitation saseendran et al 2014 in each of ccm fcm ccp and fcp scenarios the soil hydraulic input parameters were iteratively calibrated layer by layer starting from the surface layer until the best simulated soil water dynamics were obtained ma et al 2011 saseendran et al 2014 the performance of each model scenario was evaluated by using 1 root mean squared error rmse 2 mean bias error mbe 3 normalized root mean square errors nrmse and 4 percentage error e 2 r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 3 m b e 1 n p i o i 4 n r m s e r m s e o a v g 5 e p a v g o a v g o a v g 100 where oi is the measured value pi is the simulated value oavg is the arithmetic mean of measured values pavg is the arithmetic mean of simulated values and n is the number of measurements rmse reflects a magnitude of the mean difference between measured and simulated results there is no standard value that would characterize a satisfactory rmse because the acceptable range of rmse varies with the measured characteristic method of measurements crop type and management practice ma and selim 1996 the mbe indicates a systematic positive or negative bias in the simulations a positive value means an overestimation and a negative value indicates underestimation ma et al 2011 nrmse indicates the goodness of the model performance as suggested by ahuja and ma 2002 a perfect match between experimental and simulation results would yielded an nrmse 0 an nrmse less than 1 may be interpreted as simulation error of less than one standard deviation around the experimental mean ma et al 2011 percentage error e is the percentage error between measured and simulated values 3 results and discussions the soil hydraulic property module in rzwqm2 is among the modules with a substantial impact on the model outputs due to the direct impact of the shpip scenarios on the simulated soil water dynamics the measured and simulated swc was presented at 10 cm depth increments from the soil surface down to the 100 cm depth for evaluating the model performance under different model inputs of shpip fig 4 shows the measured and daily simulated swc during the fallow soil period the model simulated swc satisfactorily at the soil surface depth with rmse of 0 05 0 04 and 0 03 cm3 cm3 for the ucm fcm and fcp scenario respectively the nrmse values at the same depth were 0 15 0 14 and 0 11 for the ucm fcm and fcp scenario respectively fig 4 a during the corn growing season ucm ccm and ccp scenarios presented the highest rmse mbe and nrmse values at the soil surface depth 0 10 cm and their values decreased with increasing soil depth the swc was simulated with a rmse of 0 11 0 07 and 0 11 cm3 cm3 for the ucm ccm and ccp scenario respectively fig 5 a the nrmse values at the same depth were 0 58 0 35 and 0 59 for the ucm ccm and ccp scenario respectively the model provided satisfactory results of swc with all scenarios particularly during the period of high soil water however during the period of low soil water the ucm scenario showed a tendency to overestimate the swc more than ccm and ccp scenarios due to the impact of input values of wc at 0 10 0 33 and 15 bar low input values of wc at 15 bar e g wc 0 07 cm3 cm3 in the ccm and ccp scenario increased the model ability for simulating the swc at low soil water statistically the ccm scenario showed better simulations of swc than the ucm and ccp scenarios particularly at the surface depths fallow simulations demonstrated better performance statistics than the corn season because there was only evaporation from the bare soil and it was not complicated by plant transpiration fang et al 2010 additionally the ccm scenario was the best indicating higher or more complex spatial variation under corn that was helped with calibration of measured data ccm in corn compared with fallow field rmse mbe and nrmse values were decreased with increasing the soil depth for corn growing season and fallow soil period fig 6 shows the validation of all model scenarios ccm ccp fcm and fcp during the soybean growing season in general the swc at all depths increased following the rainfall events and decreased following active crop water uptake saseendran et al 2015 and drought conditions the values of the rmse and nrmse decreased with increasing soil depth all scenarios yielded satisfactory simulations of swc particularly for the wet period with the rmse values of 0 10 0 07 0 10 0 08 and 0 09 cm3 cm3 for the ucm ccm ccp fcm and fcp respectively at the surface layer fig 6 a also the nrmse values for the same layer were 0 46 0 30 0 45 0 35 and 0 40 for the ucm ccm ccp fcm and fcp respectively the statistical results for all model scenarios were comparable to those reported by cameira et al 2005 the ucm scenario presented the highest tendency of overestimating the swc during the dry period on day 258 267 of the year whereas the ccm presented the best simulations of swc followed by fcm during the same period indicating that the calibration of the shpip in corn and fallow helped soybean soil water prediction as well as due to the effect of the model input values for wc at 0 33 and 15 bar the swc simulations of all scenarios indicated that increasing model input values for wc at 0 33 bar improved the model capability to simulate the swc under wet conditions while decreasing model input values of wc at 15 bar increased the model capability to simulate the swc under dry conditions therefore extending the range between wc at 0 33 bar and wc at 15 bar was the best way to improve the simulations of swc similarly to fang et al 2014b simulation results the model yielded better swc simulations during wet than during dry conditions the measured swf for the days with measurements of swc and daily simulated swf across the 90 cm plane for the corn growing season fallow soil period and soybean growing season are presented in fig 7 the calibration for the fallow soil period and corn growing season yielded satisfactory simulations of the swf for all scenarios fig 7 a b during the fallow soil period the ucm fcm and fcp scenarios simulated the swf with rmse of 1 16 2 27 and 1 12 mm day respectively also during the corn growing season the ucm ccm and ccp scenarios simulated the swf with rmse of 0 42 0 50 and 0 59 mm day respectively the validation of all model scenarios during the soybean growing season revealed the best simulation results of swf for the ucm scenario with rmse of 0 77 mm day fig 7 c the ccm ccp fcm and fcp scenarios simulated the swf with 3 45 1 50 3 00 and 2 80 mm day respectively the simulations of the swf of all model scenarios indicated that simulated swf out of the root zone was appreciably affected by the model input parameters of soil bulk density and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity more than the swrc inputs these results are in agreement with ma et al 2009 who found that soil water dynamics were more affected by model inputs of ksat than by swrc inputs with increasing the values of soil bulk density and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity inputs the swf out of the root zone was increased which probably reflects the effect of bulk density on the soil porosity and the water holding capacity daily average actual crop evapotranspiration was computed over about 7 day periods with the soil water balance method and compared with daily simulated etc for the ucm ccm and ccp scenarios during the corn growing season fig 8 a the corn etc was simulated with a rmse of 1 24 1 27 and 1 13 mm day for the ucm ccm and ccp respectively all scenarios performed well regarding nrmse which was around 0 30 similarly to et simulation results presented by qi et al 2016 a tendency to underestimate etc particularly during the middle of the crop growing season was shown for ucm ccm and ccp scenarios moreover the ucm scenario showed a tendency to underestimate corn etc more than the other scenarios at the ripening stage of the growing season due to the effect of simulated water stress water stress is a ratio of actual crop evapotranspiration to potential crop evapotranspiration saseendran et al 2014 which appeared during this stage in the ucm simulations fig 9 a water stress at any crop development stage affects the crop growth and subsequently it affects the etc allen et al 2011 alves and cameira 2002 farahani and ahuja 1996 marek et al 2014 during the validation of all soybean modeling scenarios fig 8 b ucm ccm ccp fcm and fcp simulated the soybean etc with rmse values around 1 45 mm day and nrmse values around 0 42 which is within the range given by anapalli et al 2016a moreover the ucm and fcm scenarios offered better etc simulations than the other scenarios particularly at the ripening stage the water stress lai aboveground biomass and yield results for corn are presented in fig 9 corn water stress just appeared at the ripening stage of the ucm simulations due to the effect of the model inputs of the wc at 0 33 and 15 bar as previously mentioned simulated corn lai aboveground biomass and yield using the ucm scenario were lower than the simulations of the ccm and ccp scenarios due to the effect of simulated water stress although the plants are capable to extract soil water from soil layers to minimize water stress teuling et al 2006 the crop growth was considerably affected as the simulated water stress revealed during the validation of soybean growth simulations all scenarios showed water stress at the ripening stage except the ccm scenario fig 9 b however the ucm scenario showed higher water stress than the other scenarios simulated soybean lai fig 9 d aboveground biomass fig 9 f and yield fig 9 h were affected by simulated water stress the ucm scenario yielded better simulations of crop growth and yield than the other scenarios it simulated the soybean yield with an error of 0 9 while the other scenarios simulated the soybean yield with an error of around 70 high error values in crop yield simulations in this season were due to the effect of simulated water stress overall the simulations of the crop growth and yield were appreciably affected by simulated water stress similar results were obtained by saseendran et al 2014 and 2015 under different water stress factors and sezen et al 2014 under different irrigation treatments from the simulated results of all scenarios we found that the shpip clearly influenced all simulation results moreover the shpip much more strongly influenced the simulation results of crop growth water stress and etc than the soil water content and soil water flux during the validation phase measured shpip that were used without calibration showed better simulation results than the other model inputs of calibrated and derived shpip which indicates the advantage of using measured shpip without calibration 4 conclusions in order to improve rzwqm2 simulations the model sensitivity and capability were examined under different field conditions with regard to the soil hydraulic property input parameters measured and derived shpip were used as model inputs with and without calibration under different field conditions to explore the possibility of improving the model simulations rzwqm2 simulations showed a high sensitivity to the model inputs of the shpip model input parameters of wc at 0 1 0 3 and 15 bar showed high effect on simulated soil water dynamics crop growth and crop evapotranspiration the soil water content was affected more by input parameters of wc at 0 1 0 3 and 15 bar than other soil hydraulic inputs whereas the soil water flux was affected by the saturated hydraulic conductivity and bulk density more than the wc inputs water stress at any time during the crop growing season significantly affected the simulations of crop growth evapotranspiration and yield therefore calibrating the water stress directly after soil water dynamics would significantly improve model simulations of crop development and evapotranspiration using representative measured soil hydraulic properties as model inputs has shown to be effective for improving model performance and producing meaningful outputs especially with regard to simulated soil water dynamics crop evapotranspiration and crop development measured shpip were essential to build a rzwqm2 model that produced satisfactory results even without calibration notwithstanding similar testing across diverse field conditions soil crop and weather could be a critical need in the future to facilitate building further confidence in the using of measured soil hydraulic parameters as model inputs

10899,as one of the most widely promoted effective irrigation strategies for rice alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation can not only reduce water use but also increase mineral nutrient use efficiency in this research we compared the differences in grain yield grain quality phosphorus use efficiency pue and growth states of roots and shoots of lowland and upland rice cultivars that were subjected to different irrigation and phosphorus p fertilizer application treatments in a field study for two years the irrigation treatments consisted of two irrigation regimes continuously flooded cf and awd irrigation and the p fertilizer treatments included three p rates i e 0 45 and 90 kg ha 1 p0 p45 and p90 respectively the results revealed that awd irrigation led to an increase in grain yield and improved pue of both rice varieties at p45 the roots were longer and deeper under awd irrigation which contributed to the higher grain yield and higher resource use efficiency obtained with this treatment at the lower p rates both rice types translocated more p from vegetative tissues to grains which led to a better pue molecular analysis show that plant hormones iaa gibberellins cytokinins and aba and members of the ospht1 family are also involved in the regulation of p homeostasis under awd irrigation our results demonstrate that awd irrigation can also enhance pue for the rice in the field keywords alternate wetting and drying irrigation phosphorus use efficiency phytohormone rice root growth 1 introduction as a staple for over half of the world s population rice oryza sativa l has a high social and economic value shi et al 2015 due to paddy cultivation practices rice loses much more water than aerobic crops through evapotranspiration and soil percolation thus irrigated rice produces 1 kg of rice grain with 2500 l of water whereas wheat and barley produce 1 kg of grain with 500 1000 l of water bouman 2009 however freshwater is becoming increasingly scarce for one thing urban and industrial development aggravates the situation of water pollution for another population growth and decreased availability results in pollution and resource depletion bouman 2007 rijsberman 2006 water shortages have led to an increase in the area of upland rice cultivation upland rice varieties typically have a deep and thick root system which has significance for water and nutrient absorption in aerobic soil conditions the root systems of lowland and upland rice are similar when subjected to sufficient water conditions nevertheless morphological hormonal and gene expression features exhibit significant differences when the cultivars are exposed to drought environments dixit et al 2014 alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation has been under development since the 1970s and aims to obtain high yields without continuous flooded irrigation by reducing the number of irrigation events required awd irrigation can reduce irrigation water by up to 30 35 richards and sander 2014 zhang et al 2009a awd irrigation consists of many repeated soil drying and re wetting drw cycles higher mineral nutrient availability is found when the soil is subjected to drw cycles this phenomenon was first discovered by birch birch 1958 and is thus called the birch effect drw can aid the release of more molybdate reactive phosphorus mrp from the soil haygarth et al 1998 and mrp is the main form of phosphorus p that plants absorb from the soil the mrp concentration in dried and subsequently rewetted soil is significantly higher by up to 44 than that in continuously wet soil bünemann et al 2013 which demonstrates the importance of physical processes in drw cycles nevertheless whether these fluctuations can be actively applied to promote soil nutrient supply to plants has not been assessed p is a major nutrient for all living organisms because it is an irreplaceable constituent of molecules that are critical for central metabolism such as adenosine triphosphate atp nucleic acids and phospholipids plaxton and tran 2011 however a large proportion of p in soil is present in recalcitrant organic forms such as phytic acid or depending on the soil ph in inorganic forms that are bound to oxides and hydroxides of aluminum al iron fe and calcium ca holford 1997 richardson 1994 vance et al 2003 consequently only a small proportion of p in soil is available for plant uptake p fertilizers have significantly contributed to increases in global food production since the green revolution but only less than 20 of applied p is recovered by crops in the first year of growth fageria et al 2011 richardson et al 2011 as p reserves are predicted to be depleted in 50 343 years cooper et al 2011 heffer et al 2006 roberts and stewart 2002 smil 2000 appropriate management should be considered to lengthen the lifespan of phosphate reserves thus increasing phosphorus use efficiency pue has significant importance in general plants have two strategies to maximize p uptake and tolerate p deficiency first plants enhance p uptake through morphological changes such as the production of more lateral roots and root hairs or an increase in root biomass watanabe et al 2006 these changes enable the plant to explore increased soil volumes and thus access limited bioavailable p sources second plants can improve the efficiency with which they use previously assimilated p the remobilization of internal inorganic phosphate pi from source to sink organs is an important process for improving plant pue and maintaining pi homeostasis within plants shenoy and kalagudi 2005 veneklaas et al 2012 during the reproductive stage plants remobilize and transport pi from the vegetative source organs to seeds in which large amounts of pi are assimilated into the form of inositol hexakisphosphate insp6 also known as phytic acid raboy et al 2001 these sophisticated regulations of pi redistribution lead to maximum growth and optimal allocation of biomass to the reproductive organs abel et al 2002 phosphate transporter 1 pht1 is located on the plasma membrane and facilitates both the uptake of pi from soils and the translocation of pi within plants secco et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 a total of 13 putative high affinity pi transporter genes ospt1 ospt13 have been identified in the rice genome goff et al 2002 the objectives of this study were to investigate whether awd irrigation regimes and p application rates influence rice yield and pue and to compare the responses between upland rice and lowland rice when they were under different irrigation regimes and p application rates such studies would provide useful information regarding rice production that would allow the achievement of higher grain yields and higher resource use efficiencies and provide theoretical and technical support for rice irrigation fertilizer application and breeding technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant materials and growth conditions the field experiment was conducted in the town of huayang jiangxi province china 115 09 32 e 28 32 29 n during the growing seasons of 2016 2017 typical paddy soil that had been used for rice cultivation

applied at a ratio of 5 3 2 respectively the potassium fertilizer was applied only as a basal dressing the basal fertilizers were applied to the soil surface before transplantation and incorporated into the soil by shallow plowing in 2016 the flowering stage of the rice occurred from june 4 to 12 and the rice was harvested from july 12 to 14 in 2017 the flowering stage of the rice occurred from june 12 to 20 and the rice was harvested on july 18 to 20 2 2 irrigation regimes and p application treatments the two year field experiment design was split split plot of with three replications the main plots were two water treatments cf and awd irrigations the sub plots were three p application treatments 0 45 and 90 kg ha 1 p0 p45 and p90 respectively the sub sub plots were two rice varieties zhongjiazao17 and lvhan1 the plots were separated by an alley of mud to form a barrier and covered with black plastic film these irrigations were applied from 10 d after transplanting to maturity under cf irrigation the plots maintained a 3 5 cm water depth until 7 d before harvesting under awd irrigation the plots were not irrigated until the soil water potential was 15 kpa at a depth of 15 20 cm the soil water potential was measured with three tensiometers sp 11 institute of soil science of chinese academy of sciences nanjing china per plot and recorded at 12 00 h daily figure s2 p fertilizer was applied as a basal dressing before transplantation 2 3 yield and yield components at the end of the growing season the grain yield of each variety 21 m2 area in each plot was measured the crops were harvested manually and threshed with a hand driven thresher the grains were air dried for 3 d before the grain yield was determined based on a 14 moisture content yield components including the effective panicle number per m2 spikelet number per panicle grain filling percentage and 1000 grain weight were derived from 15 plants for each rice variety that were randomly selected from each plot 2 4 p accumulation and translocation phosphorus use efficiency pue rice samples three plants representing the average number of tillers in each plot were dug out using a spade 20 20 20 cm soil volume around the roots at the heading stage and maturity harvest the plants were washed with distilled water and divided into four parts roots stems leaves and panicles all plant samples were oven dried at 70 c to a constant weight and weighed the samples were finely ground to pass through a 0 15 mm sieve and subsamples were then collected to measure the p contents approximately 0 2 g of sample powder was digested with 5 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide and the p concentration of the sample was then determined via the molybdenum blue colorimetric method described by murphy and riley murphy and riley 1962 phosphorus translocation pt was calculated from the difference in the p content of the vegetative tissues stems or leaves between the heading stage and maturity pt efficiency pte was determined as the percentage ratio of the translocated p to the p content at the heading stage the pt conversion rate of the vegetative tissues ptcrv was determined as the percentage ratio of the translocated p stems or leaves to the increased p content in the panicles the internal p use efficiency iep was calculated as the grain yield kg divided by the p uptake of the plants kg the partial factor productivity of applied p pfpp was calculated as the grain yield in the p application plots kg divided by the p rate kg roberts and johnston 2015 and the p harvest index hip equaled the p in the grains kg divided by the p uptake of plants kg multiplied by 100 2 5 total root length and root depth to observe the growth of rice roots under the various irrigation regimes and p treatments we adopted a method described by uga et al uga et al 2011 after harvesting holes were dug near a plant to measure the root depth to measure the root length the roots after washing were arranged to avoid crossing floated on shallow water in a transparent glass tray 30 30 cm scanned using an epson expression 1680 scanner seiko epson corp tokyo japan and analyzed using the winrhizo root analyzer system regent instruments inc quebec canada 2 6 grain quality approximately 500 g of grains harvested from each plot were dried at 40 c in a forced air oven for quality analysis a subsample of 150 g rice grains was passed twice through a dehusker polished and then separated into broken and unbroken grains the brown rice rate milled rice rate and head rice rate are expressed as percentages of the total 150 g rice grains chalkiness was evaluated visually based on 100 milled grains per plot grains containing at least 20 of a white belly white center white back or a

there was no significant difference in zhongjiazao17 between the cf and awd irrigations at p90 whereas awd irrigation produced a higher yield of lvhan1 at p90 than cf irrigation the lower grain yield at p45 than at p0 under cf irrigation was mainly attributed to a lower percentage of filled grains whereas either a higher percentage of filled grains or number of spikelets per panicle contributed to the higher grain yield under awd irrigation the panicle numbers and 1000 grain weights of zhongjiazao17 and lvhan1 exhibited the similar trend under cf and awd irrigations i e they were lower at p0

regardless of whether the rice varieties were examined at t1 or t2 within the same irrigation regime the iaa contents in the leaves were lowest at p0 and there were no significant differences between p90 and p45 within the same irrigation regime the iaa contents in leaves decreased with increases in the p rate zhongjiazao17 exhibited higher iaa contents in the roots whereas lvhan1 exhibited higher iaa contents in the leaves the interaction between p v is significant for iaa contents in the leaves and roots at t1 and t2 at the same p rate the zr contents in the leaves did not differ between the

expression analysis the expression levels of ospht1 family members in the leaves and roots of both rice varieties were detected with the exception of ospt11 and 13 because ospt11 and 13 were exclusively induced in the roots by inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi glassop et al 2005 paszkowski et al 2002 no expression of ospt9 10 or 12 was detected in the leaves or roots at the same p rate the expression levels of most of the ospht1 family members in the leaves of zhongjiazao17 were higher under awd irrigation than under cf irrigation at t2 whereas at t1 some members exhibited lower expression levels i e ospt1 5 6 and some members exhibited similar expression levels i e ospt2 4 7 tables 9 and 10 ospt8 exhibited an expression pattern that was opposite to those found for the other members when the p rate was p90 or p45 table 10 at t1 of awd irrigation lower expression levels of the ospht1 family members were observed at p0 than at p90 and p45 whereas at t2 of awd irrigation lower expression levels of ospt1 2 3 and 6 and a higher expression of ospt8 were observed at p0 than at p90 and p45 tables 9 and 10 in most cases higher or similar expression levels of ospht1 family members were observed at p45 compared with p90 the expression levels of ospht1 family members in the roots of zhongjiazao17 were similar to those in the leaves tables 11 and 12 at the same p rate the expression levels of most of the ospht1 family members in leaves of lvhan1 were higher under awd irrigation than under cf irrigation at t1 of awd irrigation whereas at t2 of awd irrigation some members exhibited lower expression levels i e ospt1 3 8 and some members exhibited higher expression levels ospt2 7 tables 9 and 10 within the same irrigation regime the lowest expression levels of ospht1 family members with the exception of ospt2 among the three p rates were observed at p0 table 9 higher or similar expression levels of ospht1 family members were observed at p90 than at p45 the expression levels of ospht1 family members in the roots of lvhan1 were similar to those in the leaves under both the cf and awd irrigations tables 11 and 12 within the same irrigation regime the lowest expression levels of ospht1 family members ospt1 4 5 6 among the three p rates were observed at p0 tables 11 and 12 in most situations higher or similar expression levels of ospht1 family members were observed at p45 than at p90 the expression levels of most ospht1 family members in the leaves of lvhan1 were highest under awd irrigation at t1 of awd irrigation however the expression levels of most ospht1 family members in the leaves of zhongjiazao17 were highest under awd irrigation at t2 of awd irrigation tables 9 and 10 the expression levels of some ospht1 family members ospt1 2 5 7 and 8 in the roots of zhongjiazao17 increased more than those in lvhan1 at t2 of awd irrigation tables 11 and 12 whereas the expression levels of ospt3 4 and 6 in the roots of lvhan1 increased more than the corresponding expression levels in zhongjiazao17 at t2 of awd irrigation and when the p rates were p90 and p45 tables 11 and 12 the expression of almost every member of the ospht1 family in the roots of zhongjiazao17 increased more than its counterpart in lvhan1 when the p rate was p0 the interactions between i p i v and p v are significant for the expression levels of most ospht1 family members in the leaves and roots of both rice varieties 4 discussion 4 1 upland rice and lowland rice perform differently in terms of grain yield and pue under awd irrigation prior to this study little information was available describing the differences between upland and lowland rice in terms of grain yield and pue under both cf and awd irrigations upland rice often has a lower grain yield bouman et al 2005 2006 castaneda et al 2002 george et al 2002 peng et al 2006 than lowland rice in this study the lowland rice variety zhongjiazao17 had a higher yield than the upland variety lvhan1 under awd irrigation the yield difference between the two varieties under cf irrigation was similar to that observed under awd irrigation table 2 these results demonstrate that high yielding varieties that were developed for cf irrigation could still maintain a high yield under safe awd irrigation the lower numbers of panicles and spikelets per panicle and lower percentage of filled grains caused the upland rice lvhan1 to produce a lower grain yield than the lowland rice zhongjiazao17 under the same treatment table 2 a lower grain yield leads to lower iep and pfpp tables 2 and 6 4 2 low p stress has a greater influence on grain milling and appearance qualities than irrigation regime at p45 and p0 both varieties produced higher grain yields under awd irrigation than under cf irrigation at p90 lvhan1 still produced a higher grain yield under awd irrigation than under cf irrigation but zhongjiazao17 produced similar grain yields under both irrigation regimes table 2 this result indicated that lvhan1 could use p more efficiently under high p conditions than zhongjiazao17 there were no substantial differences in grain milling and appearance qualities between the awd and cf irrigations with the exception of the degree of chalkiness the rice at p0 exhibited the worst grain quality table s2 these results demonstrated that low p stress had a greater influence on grain milling and appearance qualities than the irrigation regime but the irrigation regime had a greater influence on grain nutrition 4 3 enhanced rice p uptake is mediated by morphological changes under p depletion it is widely accepted that a crop variety with good root penetration ability can maximize soil moisture capture and thereby maintain a high plant water status under drought conditions luo 2010 luo et al 2011 yue et al 2006 in this study both rice varieties exhibited greater root biomasses root lengths and root depths under awd irrigation than under cf irrigation table 3 a more developed root system can not only maintain a high plant water status but also plays an important role in nutrient absorption which ultimately positively influences the yield jian bo et al 2010 zhang et al 2009b plants enhance p uptake through morphological changes such as the production of more lateral roots and root hairs or by increasing root biomass watanabe et al 2006 these changes enable the plant to explore greater soil volumes and thus access limited bioavailable p sources additionally plant roots secrete organic acids arihara 2003 otani et al 1996 zhu et al 2012 phosphatases hall 1969 pammenter and woolhouse 1975 and other substances otani et al 1996 that release p from insoluble p sources in soil in the present study the rice roots at p45 were heavier longer and deeper than those at p90 and p0 and these values at p0 were the lowest among the three p rates these results indicated that rice can enhance p uptake through morphological changes during long term mild pi deprivation however under long term severe pi deprivation this pattern was not maintained in this study 4 4 the irrigation regime regulates pt plants can improve the pte of previously assimilated p the remobilization of internal pi from source to sink organs is an important process for improving plant pue and maintaining pi homeostasis within plants shenoy and kalagudi 2005 veneklaas et al 2012 during the reproductive stage plants remobilize and transport pi from vegetative source organs to seeds raboy et al 2001 in the present study p accumulations in the grains leaves and stems increased with increases in the p rate but pte and iep decreased with increases in the p rate within the same regime tables 4 5 and 6 these results suggest that at a lower p rate rice will translocate more p from the leaves and stem to the grains these sophisticated regulations of pi redistribution lead to maximum growth and optimal allocation of biomass to the reproductive organs abel et al 2002 both rice varieties translocated more p from vegetative source organs to grains under awd irrigation than under cf irrigation which indicated that the irrigation regime regulated the p distribution 4 5 phytohormones mediate growth regulation under awd and p treatments it has been reported that phytohormones can interact to confer drought tolerance and regulate organogenesis and seed development havlova et al 2008 pernisová et al 2009 yang et al 2003 in this study the zr contents in the leaves and roots of both varieties exhibited no differences between the awd and cf irrigations at t1 whereas the zr contents in the leaves and roots under awd irrigation were higher than those under cf irrigation at t2 tables 5 and 6 an increase in the ck level in the leaves under awd irrigation during the re watering period could contribute to a higher source activity which would lead to an increase in the grain filling of inferior spikelets zhang et al 2010 the aba contents in the leaves and roots under awd irrigation were higher than those under cf irrigation at t1 and t2 tables 5 and 6 rice plants increase their aba content under mild soil drying during grain filling which could increase the grain filling rate of inferior spikelets and the remobilization of pre stored assimilates in vegetative tissues to grains ad decrease stomatal conductance which would ultimately lead to increases in grain weight yang and zhang 2010 yang et al 2001 in the present research the iaa zr and ga contents in the leaves of the two varieties decreased under p starvation table 5 but the iaa contents in the roots of both varieties decreased with increases in the p rate table 6 suggesting that phytohormones mediate the growth regulation between underground and aboveground tissues 4 6 the ospht1 family maintains phosphate homeostasis under awd and p treatments the ospht1 family has approximately 13 members ospt1 2 4 6 and 8 have been reported to be involved in phosphate homeostasis in rice ai et al 2009 jia et al 2011 liu et al 2011 sun et al 2012 ye et al 2015 however the roles of many other members of the ospht1 family remain unclear in the present study we detected the expression levels of all ospht1 family members with the exception of ospt11 and ospt13 ospt11 and ospt13 were exclusively induced in the roots by inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi ospt1 8 was highly expressed in the leaves and roots whereas the expression of ospt9 10 and 12 was not detectable tables 9 10 11 and 12 at p45 the expression levels of most of the members of the ospht1 family increased whereas at p0 the expression levels of most of the members of the ospht1 family decreased compared with the expression levels at p90 these genes are expected to be well organized with a clear division of labor in pi uptake and translocation liu et al 2011 the expression levels of ospt2 in the roots of zhongjiazao17 and of ospt2 and 3 in the roots of lvhan1 increased at p0 which indicated that these genes may play an important role in increasing p absorption from the soil when the plants are under p starvation the expression levels of ospht1 family members differed between the cf and awd irrigations and between t1 and t2 of awd irrigation which suggests that the water condition is an important factor that affects p absorption and pt the expression levels of ospht1 family members in zhongjiazao17 and lvhan1 differed which indicated that different varieties may have different expression patterns for maintaining phosphate homeostasis 5 conclusion our study concluded that awd irrigation enables a paddy field to receive fewer irrigation events and less irrigation water which would result in reducing both water use and labor resources awd irrigation could achieve the goal of increasing the grain yield and pue of both rice varieties at p45 awd irrigation enhanced root growth which contributed to a higher grain yield and a higher resource use efficiency at lower p rates both rice varieties translocated more p from the vegetative tissues to the grains the irrigation regime phytohormones and some members of the ospht1 family participate in the regulation of p homeostasis and more studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms acknowledgements this work was supported by national key research and development

10899,as one of the most widely promoted effective irrigation strategies for rice alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation can not only reduce water use but also increase mineral nutrient use efficiency in this research we compared the differences in grain yield grain quality phosphorus use efficiency pue and growth states of roots and shoots of lowland and upland rice cultivars that were subjected to different irrigation and phosphorus p fertilizer application treatments in a field study for two years the irrigation treatments consisted of two irrigation regimes continuously flooded cf and awd irrigation and the p fertilizer treatments included three p rates i e 0 45 and 90 kg ha 1 p0 p45 and p90 respectively the results revealed that awd irrigation led to an increase in grain yield and improved pue of both rice varieties at p45 the roots were longer and deeper under awd irrigation which contributed to the higher grain yield and higher resource use efficiency obtained with this treatment at the lower p rates both rice types translocated more p from vegetative tissues to grains which led to a better pue molecular analysis show that plant hormones iaa gibberellins cytokinins and aba and members of the ospht1 family are also involved in the regulation of p homeostasis under awd irrigation our results demonstrate that awd irrigation can also enhance pue for the rice in the field keywords alternate wetting and drying irrigation phosphorus use efficiency phytohormone rice root growth 1 introduction as a staple for over half of the world s population rice oryza sativa l has a high social and economic value shi et al 2015 due to paddy cultivation practices rice loses much more water than aerobic crops through evapotranspiration and soil percolation thus irrigated rice produces 1 kg of rice grain with 2500 l of water whereas wheat and barley produce 1 kg of grain with 500 1000 l of water bouman 2009 however freshwater is becoming increasingly scarce for one thing urban and industrial development aggravates the situation of water pollution for another population growth and decreased availability results in pollution and resource depletion bouman 2007 rijsberman 2006 water shortages have led to an increase in the area of upland rice cultivation upland rice varieties typically have a deep and thick root system which has significance for water and nutrient absorption in aerobic soil conditions the root systems of lowland and upland rice are similar when subjected to sufficient water conditions nevertheless morphological hormonal and gene expression features exhibit significant differences when the cultivars are exposed to drought environments dixit et al 2014 alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation has been under development since the 1970s and aims to obtain high yields without continuous flooded irrigation by reducing the number of irrigation events required awd irrigation can reduce irrigation water by up to 30 35 richards and sander 2014 zhang et al 2009a awd irrigation consists of many repeated soil drying and re wetting drw cycles higher mineral nutrient availability is found when the soil is subjected to drw cycles this phenomenon was first discovered by birch birch 1958 and is thus called the birch effect drw can aid the release of more molybdate reactive phosphorus mrp from the soil haygarth et al 1998 and mrp is the main form of phosphorus p that plants absorb from the soil the mrp concentration in dried and subsequently rewetted soil is significantly higher by up to 44 than that in continuously wet soil bünemann et al 2013 which demonstrates the importance of physical processes in drw cycles nevertheless whether these fluctuations can be actively applied to promote soil nutrient supply to plants has not been assessed p is a major nutrient for all living organisms because it is an irreplaceable constituent of molecules that are critical for central metabolism such as adenosine triphosphate atp nucleic acids and phospholipids plaxton and tran 2011 however a large proportion of p in soil is present in recalcitrant organic forms such as phytic acid or depending on the soil ph in inorganic forms that are bound to oxides and hydroxides of aluminum al iron fe and calcium ca holford 1997 richardson 1994 vance et al 2003 consequently only a small proportion of p in soil is available for plant uptake p fertilizers have significantly contributed to increases in global food production since the green revolution but only less than 20 of applied p is recovered by crops in the first year of growth fageria et al 2011 richardson et al 2011 as p reserves are predicted to be depleted in 50 343 years cooper et al 2011 heffer et al 2006 roberts and stewart 2002 smil 2000 appropriate management should be considered to lengthen the lifespan of phosphate reserves thus increasing phosphorus use efficiency pue has significant importance in general plants have two strategies to maximize p uptake and tolerate p deficiency first plants enhance p uptake through morphological changes such as the production of more lateral roots and root hairs or an increase in root biomass watanabe et al 2006 these changes enable the plant to explore increased soil volumes and thus access limited bioavailable p sources second plants can improve the efficiency with which they use previously assimilated p the remobilization of internal inorganic phosphate pi from source to sink organs is an important process for improving plant pue and maintaining pi homeostasis within plants shenoy and kalagudi 2005 veneklaas et al 2012 during the reproductive stage plants remobilize and transport pi from the vegetative source organs to seeds in which large amounts of pi are assimilated into the form of inositol hexakisphosphate insp6 also known as phytic acid raboy et al 2001 these sophisticated regulations of pi redistribution lead to maximum growth and optimal allocation of biomass to the reproductive organs abel et al 2002 phosphate transporter 1 pht1 is located on the plasma membrane and facilitates both the uptake of pi from soils and the translocation of pi within plants secco et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 a total of 13 putative high affinity pi transporter genes ospt1 ospt13 have been identified in the rice genome goff et al 2002 the objectives of this study were to investigate whether awd irrigation regimes and p application rates influence rice yield and pue and to compare the responses between upland rice and lowland rice when they were under different irrigation regimes and p application rates such studies would provide useful information regarding rice production that would allow the achievement of higher grain yields and higher resource use efficiencies and provide theoretical and technical support for rice irrigation fertilizer application and breeding technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant materials and growth conditions the

there was no significant difference in zhongjiazao17 between the cf and awd irrigations at p90 whereas awd irrigation produced a higher yield of lvhan1 at p90 than cf irrigation the lower grain yield at p45 than at p0 under cf irrigation was mainly attributed to a lower percentage of filled grains whereas either a higher percentage of filled grains or number of spikelets per panicle contributed to

expression analysis the expression levels of ospht1 family members in the leaves and roots of both rice varieties were detected with the exception of ospt11 and 13 because ospt11 and 13 were exclusively induced in the roots by inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi glassop et al 2005 paszkowski et al 2002 no expression of ospt9 10 or 12 was detected in the leaves or roots at the same p rate the expression levels of most of the ospht1 family members in the leaves of zhongjiazao17 were higher under awd irrigation than under cf irrigation at t2 whereas at t1 some members exhibited lower expression levels i e ospt1 5 6 and some members exhibited similar expression levels i e ospt2 4 7 tables 9 and 10 ospt8 exhibited an expression pattern that was opposite to those found for the other members when the p rate was p90 or p45 table 10 at t1 of awd irrigation lower expression levels of the ospht1 family members were observed at p0 than at p90 and p45 whereas at t2 of awd irrigation lower expression levels of ospt1 2 3 and 6 and a higher expression of ospt8 were observed at p0 than at p90 and p45 tables 9 and 10 in most cases higher or similar expression levels of ospht1 family members were observed at p45 compared with p90 the expression levels of ospht1 family members in the roots of zhongjiazao17 were similar to those in the leaves tables 11 and 12 at the same p rate the expression levels of most of the ospht1 family members in leaves of lvhan1 were higher under awd irrigation than under cf irrigation at t1 of awd irrigation whereas at t2 of awd irrigation some members exhibited lower expression levels i e ospt1 3 8 and some members exhibited higher expression levels ospt2 7 tables 9 and 10 within the same irrigation regime the lowest expression levels of ospht1 family members with the exception of ospt2 among the three p rates were observed at p0 table 9 higher or similar expression levels of ospht1 family members were observed at p90 than at p45 the expression levels of ospht1 family members in the roots of lvhan1 were similar to those in the leaves under both the cf and awd irrigations tables 11 and 12 within the same irrigation regime the lowest expression levels of ospht1 family members ospt1 4 5 6 among the three p rates were observed at p0 tables 11 and 12 in most situations higher or similar expression levels of ospht1 family members were observed at p45 than at p90 the expression levels of most ospht1 family members in the leaves of lvhan1 were highest under awd irrigation at t1 of awd irrigation however the expression levels of most ospht1 family members in the leaves of zhongjiazao17 were highest under awd irrigation at t2 of awd irrigation tables 9 and 10 the expression levels of some ospht1 family members ospt1 2 5 7 and 8 in the roots of zhongjiazao17 increased more than those in lvhan1 at t2 of awd irrigation tables 11 and 12 whereas the expression levels of ospt3 4 and 6 in the roots of lvhan1 increased more than the corresponding expression levels in zhongjiazao17 at t2 of awd irrigation and when the p rates were p90 and p45 tables 11 and 12 the expression of almost every member of the ospht1 family in the roots of zhongjiazao17 increased more than its counterpart in lvhan1 when the p rate was p0 the interactions between i p i v and p v are significant for the expression levels of most ospht1 family members in the leaves and roots of both rice varieties 4 discussion 4 1 upland rice and lowland rice perform differently in terms of grain yield and pue under awd irrigation prior to this study little information was available describing the differences between upland and lowland rice in terms of grain yield and pue under both cf and awd irrigations upland rice often has a lower grain yield bouman et al 2005 2006 castaneda et al 2002 george et al 2002 peng et al 2006 than lowland rice in this study the lowland rice variety zhongjiazao17 had a higher yield than the upland variety lvhan1 under awd irrigation the yield difference between the two varieties under cf irrigation was similar to that observed under awd irrigation table 2 these results demonstrate that high yielding varieties that were developed for cf irrigation could still maintain a high yield under safe awd irrigation the lower numbers of panicles and spikelets per panicle and lower percentage of filled grains caused the upland rice lvhan1 to produce a lower grain yield than the lowland rice zhongjiazao17 under the same treatment table 2 a lower grain yield leads to lower iep and pfpp tables 2 and 6 4 2 low p stress has a greater influence on grain milling and appearance qualities than irrigation regime at p45 and p0 both varieties produced higher grain yields under awd irrigation than under cf irrigation at p90 lvhan1 still produced a higher grain yield under awd irrigation than under cf irrigation but zhongjiazao17 produced similar grain yields under both irrigation regimes table 2 this result indicated that lvhan1 could use p more efficiently under high p conditions than zhongjiazao17 there were no substantial differences in grain milling and appearance qualities between the awd and cf irrigations with the exception of the degree of chalkiness the rice at p0 exhibited the worst grain quality table s2 these results demonstrated that low p stress had a greater influence on grain milling and appearance qualities than the irrigation regime but the irrigation regime had a greater influence on grain nutrition 4 3 enhanced rice p uptake is mediated by morphological changes under p depletion it is widely accepted that a crop variety with good root penetration ability can maximize soil moisture capture and thereby maintain a high plant water status under drought conditions luo 2010 luo et al 2011 yue et al 2006 in this study both rice varieties exhibited greater root biomasses root lengths and root depths under awd irrigation than under cf irrigation table 3 a more developed root system can not only maintain a high plant water status but also plays an important role in nutrient absorption which ultimately positively influences the yield jian bo et al 2010 zhang et al 2009b plants enhance p uptake through morphological changes such as the production of more lateral roots and root hairs or by increasing root biomass watanabe et al 2006 these changes enable the plant to explore greater soil volumes and thus access limited bioavailable p sources additionally plant roots secrete organic acids arihara 2003 otani et al 1996 zhu et al 2012 phosphatases hall 1969 pammenter and woolhouse 1975 and other substances otani et al 1996 that release p from insoluble p sources in soil in the present study the rice roots at p45 were heavier longer and deeper than those at p90 and p0 and these values at p0 were the lowest among the three p rates these results indicated that rice can enhance p uptake through morphological changes during long term mild pi deprivation however under long term severe pi deprivation this pattern was not maintained in this study 4 4 the irrigation regime regulates pt plants can improve the pte of previously assimilated p the remobilization of internal pi from source to sink organs is an important process for improving plant pue and maintaining pi homeostasis within plants shenoy and kalagudi 2005 veneklaas et al 2012 during the reproductive stage plants remobilize and transport pi from vegetative source organs to seeds raboy et al 2001 in the present study p accumulations in the grains leaves and stems increased with increases in the p rate but pte and iep decreased with increases in the p rate within the same regime tables 4 5 and 6 these results suggest that at a lower p rate rice will translocate more p from the leaves and stem to the grains these sophisticated regulations of pi redistribution lead to maximum growth and optimal allocation of biomass to the reproductive organs abel et al 2002 both rice varieties translocated more p from vegetative source organs to grains under awd irrigation than under cf irrigation which indicated that the irrigation regime regulated the p distribution 4 5 phytohormones mediate growth regulation under awd and p treatments it has been reported that phytohormones can interact to confer drought tolerance and regulate organogenesis and seed development havlova et al 2008 pernisová et al 2009 yang et al 2003 in this study the zr contents in the leaves and roots of both varieties exhibited no differences between the awd and cf irrigations at t1 whereas the zr contents in the leaves and roots under awd irrigation were higher than those under cf irrigation at t2 tables 5 and 6 an increase in the ck level in the leaves under awd irrigation during the re watering period could contribute to a higher source activity which would lead to an increase in the grain filling of inferior spikelets zhang et al 2010 the aba contents in the leaves and roots under awd irrigation were higher than those under cf irrigation at t1 and t2 tables 5 and 6 rice plants increase their aba content under mild soil drying during grain filling which could increase the grain filling rate of inferior spikelets and the remobilization of pre stored assimilates in vegetative tissues to grains ad decrease stomatal conductance which would ultimately lead to increases in grain weight yang and zhang 2010 yang et al 2001 in the present research the iaa zr and ga contents in the leaves of the two varieties decreased under p starvation table 5 but the iaa contents in the roots of both varieties decreased with increases in the p rate table 6 suggesting that phytohormones mediate the growth regulation between underground and aboveground tissues 4 6 the ospht1 family maintains phosphate homeostasis under awd and p treatments the ospht1 family has approximately 13 members ospt1 2 4 6 and 8 have been reported to be involved in phosphate homeostasis in rice ai et al 2009 jia et al 2011 liu et al 2011 sun et al 2012 ye et al 2015 however the roles of many other members of the ospht1 family remain unclear in the present study we detected the expression levels of all ospht1 family members with the exception of ospt11 and ospt13 ospt11 and ospt13 were exclusively induced in the roots by inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi ospt1 8 was highly expressed in the leaves and roots whereas the expression of ospt9 10 and 12 was not detectable tables 9 10 11 and 12 at p45 the expression levels of most of the members of the ospht1 family increased whereas at p0 the expression levels of most of the members of the ospht1 family decreased compared with the expression levels at p90 these genes are expected to be well organized with a clear division of labor in pi uptake and translocation liu et al 2011 the expression levels of ospt2 in the roots of zhongjiazao17 and of ospt2 and 3 in the roots of lvhan1 increased at p0 which indicated that these genes may play an important role in increasing p absorption from the soil when the plants are under p starvation the expression levels of ospht1 family members differed between the cf and awd irrigations and between t1 and t2 of awd irrigation which suggests that the water condition is an important factor that affects p absorption and pt the expression levels of ospht1 family members in zhongjiazao17 and lvhan1 differed which indicated that different varieties may have different expression patterns for maintaining phosphate homeostasis 5 conclusion our study concluded that awd irrigation enables a paddy field to receive fewer irrigation events and less irrigation water which would result in reducing both water use and labor resources awd irrigation could achieve the goal of increasing the grain yield and pue of both rice varieties at p45 awd irrigation enhanced root growth which contributed to a higher grain yield and a higher resource use efficiency at lower p rates both rice varieties translocated more p from the vegetative tissues to the grains the irrigation regime phytohormones and some members of the ospht1 family participate in the regulation of p homeostasis and more studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms acknowledgements this work was supported by national key research and development
