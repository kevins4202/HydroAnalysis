15235,antibiotics are widely consumed and are ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems such as in agricultural and fishery lake catchments for prophylactic treatment however there are very few comprehensive studies reporting all seasonal occurrences spatiotemporal dynamics and risk assessments of antibiotics in agricultural lake catchments especially in cold regions during the winter season this study measured seasonality in the concentrations of 12 antibiotics belonging to seven different classes in the surface waters tributary rivers and lakes of the chagan lake catchment in northeast china all antibiotics were detected in most of the water samples across most seasons with concentrations varying for different compounds locations and seasons these levels were discussed in terms of the main sources at different sampling sites including agriculture fish farming municipal wastewater and others in general the highest concentrations of most compounds were observed during the freeze thaw periods the number of antibiotic resistance genes args correlated with compound lipophilicity and half life based on the ecological risks of antibiotics and the relative abundance of args a hierarchical control priority list hcpl of antibiotics was determined considering four levels critical high medium and low to further strengthen the control and effectively manage antibiotics we

confidential 1 introduction antibiotics are widely used in the treatment of human and animal diseases which have become a prominent emerging contaminant class in the world with the development of improved antibiotic production technologies the cost of antibiotics has decreased considerably making them easily accessible bielen et al 2017 kümmerer et al 2009a 2009b as a result antibiotics are widely used not only for disease treatment but also as feed additives to promote animal growth and disease prevention in the breeding industry particularly in livestock and fishery production blair et al 2015 kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 however owing to the incomplete metabolism of antibiotics by the animals a considerable amount of antibiotics end up in the environment and are frequently detected cha et al 2009 lyu et al 2020 tran et al 2018 antibiotic residues can cause ecotoxicity and harm ecological health wang et al 2017 williams nguyen et al 2016 for example β lactam antibiotics are reported to be highly toxic to algae gonzalez pleiter et al 2013 similarly some veterinary antibiotics can harm human health by entering the food chain huang et al 2022 schwab et al 2005 the extremely negative environmental effects of antibiotic contamination are the proliferation and spread of antibiotic resistance genes args bengtsson palme et al 2015 martinez et al 2015 singer et al 2014 van boeckel et al 2015 the spread and transmission of args in microorganisms can be vertical transmission between parents and offspring or horizontal transmission between different communities chow et al 2020 letchumanan et al 2015 it can also be associated with the emergence of super resistant bacteria that pose a threat to public health blair et al 2015 kim et al 2007 the primary sources of antibiotics in aquatic environments include i direct discharge of untreated rural domestic sewage kümmerer et al 2009a ii discharge of urban domestic sewage and medical wastewater after treatment by sewage treatment plants studies have reported incomplete degradation of antibiotics by conventional sewage treatment processes gulkowska et al 2008 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 ruan et al 2019 iii infiltration of antibiotics containing metabolic waste from livestock production and other solid wastes through soil lyu et al 2020 iv large scale drugs used in fisheries muziasari et al 2017 v release of sediments cheng et al 2014 vi migration from groundwater burke et al 2016 vii surface water runoff and viii atmospheric deposition barroso et al 2019 china is one of the major consumers of antibiotics zhang et al 2015 the main sources of veterinary antibiotics in china are livestock and fishery production which occur mainly in regions with intensive agricultural activities dinh et al 2017 the chagan lake catchment is a representative area located in the main grain producing region of northeast china the area is a major producer of rice livestock and fishery products and exhibits a high potential risk of antibiotic contamination additionally due to the location of the chagan lake catchment at 45 n latitude and intensive agricultural farming and breeding activities it is considerably affected by drastic seasonal changes in weather conditions and usually undergoes a four month frozen period liu et al 2021a 2021b prior studies on the spatiotemporal distribution of antibiotics in aquatic ecosystems have mostly focused on ice free or non ice bound periods liu et al 2019 tran et al 2019 wang et al 2017 owing to the natural conditions and different human activities such as hydrological regimes and drainage in irrigated areas the status and seasonal distribution pattern of contamination in ice bound water and related catchments are generally remarkably different than those of ice free systems zhang et al 2020 studies have shown that light and temperature are important factors affecting antibiotic degradation gruchlik et al 2018 during the frozen period the water temperature is very low 0 8 3 and the ice cover reduces the intake of light intensity together these factors may lead to the specific status and unique spatiotemporal distribution of antibiotic contaminants in aquatic ecosystems during frozen and melt periods to the best of our knowledge studies on the prevalence of antibiotics across seasons in receiving water bodies such as lakes and their related catchment rivers in a cold region especially during ice covered periods have not been reported previously thus in this study we characterised the seasonal dynamics of antibiotic contaminants focusing on the frozen period and assessed their potential risk levels at the catchment scale it is reported that the relative abundance of args increases under high antibiotic concentrations in aquatic environments huerta et al 2013 zheng et al 2018 however not all classes of antibiotics have the same concentration thresholds for the induction of arg production as this is related to their physical and chemical properties bengtsson palme et al 2016 for surface water antibiotic contamination is dynamic and migratory and the subsequent induction of antibiotic resistance by microbes is long lasting and far reaching czekalski et al 2015 hence it is important to explore the correlations between antibiotics and args considering the physical and chemical properties of antibiotics to fully understand the possible risks and linkages hundreds of antibiotics are commonly used in clinical medicine and the breeding industry larsson et al 2014 however the mechanisms of action toxicity and physicochemical properties differ for various antibiotics kümmerer et al 2009a 2009b tran et al 2019 this variation affects the degree of contamination ecotoxicity and induction of args in environmental media for different antibiotics antibiotics with low ecological toxicity easy degradation and a low risk of resistance gene induction could exist in the environment within acceptable limits whereas other antibiotics should be strictly controlled in the environment bengtsson palme et al 2016 sousa et al 2018 therefore the development of a priority control list for antibiotics has become a research focus for antibiotic contamination control bengtsson palme et al 2016 huang et al 2022 sousa et al 2018 however great variations in concentrations and classes of antibiotics can be expected for regions with different land uses for example most urban waters are polluted by human antibiotics whereas most agricultural areas are polluted by veterinary antibiotics in addition the difference in environmental media conditions also has an impact on the contamination status of antibiotics for example the half life of amoxicillin varies remarkably in water at different ph levels similarly the temperature is a major factor affecting the degradation of antibiotics in situ hirte et al 2016 le minh et al 2010 tran et al 2019 yang et al 2018 therefore more attention should be paid to time sharing and zoning analyses of the ecological risks of antibiotics and the development of an antibiotic priority control list thus this study aims to a explore the spatio seasonal dynamics of 12 target antibiotics and identify the main drivers of the diversification and distribution in the surface water in the chagan lake catchment b uncover particular driving mechanisms of antibiotic contamination during the cold freeze up period c analyse the relationship between args and the physical and chemical properties of antibiotics and identify the factors affecting the relative abundances d assess the ecological risk of antibiotics and their linkage with resistance gene contamination and e establish a hierarchical control priority list hcpl of antibiotics in the chagan lake catchment thereby providing a scientific basis for antibiotic control in cold semi arid aquatic ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 target antibiotics chemical reagents and solvents in this study 12 target antibiotics from seven different classes were investigated they were selected based on the results of args in a preliminary experiment and a survey of the chagan lake catchment i e commonly used antibiotics for humans and veterinary animals in the catchment the target antibiotics included the following 1 β lactams amoxicillin amx 2 quinolones ciprofloxacin cip norfloxacin nor enrofloxacin enr 3 macrolides erythromycin ery tylosin tyl tilmicosin til 4 tetracyclines tetracycline tet oxytetracycline oxy 5 chloramphenicols chloramphenicol cap 6 sulfonamides sulfadiazine sdz 7 glycopeptides vancomycin vcm the properties toxicity data and usage patterns of the 12 target antibiotics are listed in table s1 all the target antibiotic standards were purchased from the dr ehrenstorfer company germany with a purity grade 99 the external standard method was used in this study each target antibiotic standard sample had a configured gradient solution of 5 500 μg l using methanol or ultrapure water the other chemicals used in this study were of lc ms grade 2 2 study area and sample collection the chagan lake catchment including chagan lake and its surrounding catchment rivers or tributaries is located in the northeast of china with an annual average temperature of 4 5 an annual average rainfall of 415 4 mm 80 of summer precipitation and an annual evaporation of 1400 2100 mm liu et al 2019 the surface area of chagan lake is approximately 345 km2 and its water storage capacity is approximately 6 108 m3 liu et al 2020 the annual ice period can reach up to 130 days with an average ice thickness of 0 9 m song et al 2019 the water inflows into the lake mainly include four components i e the drainage of qianguo and of da an irrigation areas rainfall and groundwater recharge see table s2 for the inflow water amount in the lake and the corresponding irrigation areas liu et al 2021b chagan lake is one of the main fishing areas in northeast china with an annual output of 3 500 tons of fish irrigated areas in the catchment mainly include rice cultivation and extensive animal husbandry the detailed land use types in the lake catchment are presented in table s3 note that not all paddy fields and dry farmland in the chagan lake catchment are included in the two irrigated areas it is noteworthy that the hadashan hydrojunction is included in the qianguo irrigation area that is the amount of water was diverted from the second songhua river into chagan lake through the qianguo irrigation area for irrigation and ecological water replenishment the location of the hadashan hydro junction on the second songhua river is shown in fig s1 before entering the chagan lake catchment the second songhua river passes through two large cities changchun and jilin with populations of 9 067 and 4 047 million respectively he et al 2018 therefore the sources of antibiotic contamination in the chagan lake catchment are mainly surface runoff livestock breeding mainly from irrigation areas fishery production sediment release groundwater migration and urban domestic and medical wastewaters mainly from the hadashan hydro junction although antibiotic sources also include groundwater migration atmospheric subsidence and internal sediment release this study mainly focuses on the impact of pollution in irrigated areas on surface water considering the limited information available from other sources in addition compared with the da an irrigation area the qianguo irrigation area is more typical of antibiotic pollution therefore the catchment rivers in the qianguo irrigation area were selected as representative ones for our study therefore in this study the distribution of sampling sites in the chagan lake catchment was carried out in combination with inflow water sources and typical contamination sites in the chagan lake the sampling sites are shown in fig 1 samples were collected four times i e in may july and october 2020 and in january 2021 eight catchment rivers and seven lake samples were collected at a sampling depth of approximately 20 30 cm river catchment water samples were collected from the central part of the river all the collected samples were filled in 2 l polypropylene bottles in addition two 2 l samples were collected from each sampling site as parallel controls stored in cold storage at 4 c and transported to the laboratory it should be noted that during winter sampling january 2021 the ice cover had to be broken using an ice drill before sampling 2 3 chemical analysis one litre of the water sample was added to 0 5 g na2 edta the ph of the water sample was adjusted to 4 followed by filtering through a 0 45 μm glass fabric filter whatman uk to remove particles as antibiotics are mostly in the dissolved phase than other lipophilic emerging contaminants perfluorinated compounds polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons etc chen et al 2019 on comparing the mean values of concentrations in the dissolved and suspended solid phases we found that the antibiotic content in the suspended phase was not significant therefore this study only considered the distribution of antibiotics in the dissolved phase of surface water briefly the filtered samples 1 l were subjected to solid phase extraction spe using oasis hydrophile lipophilic balance hlb cartridges 6 cc 500 mg waters usa the cartridges were preconditioned with 10 ml of ethyl acetate and methanol mixed solution 1 1 v v 10 ml methanol and 10 ml of acidic water ph 4 filtered samples were passed through the hlb cartridges at a flow rate of 10 ml min followed by a rinse with 10 ml of 5 methanol in water the cartridges were then vacuum dried for 10 min followed by elution with methanol 10 ml the eluates were evaporated to near dryness at room temperature in a water bath under a gentle nitrogen stream the dried extracts were dissolved again in methanol 1 ml the final aliquots were transferred into 2 ml amber vials and stored at room temperature 20 25 until high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry hplc ms ms analysis ju et al 2019 instrumental analysis of antibiotics was performed according to the methods established in previous studies briefly antibiotics in the extracted solution were analysed using hplc ms ms agilent 1290 infinity hplc coupled to an agilent 6490 triple quadrupole ms ms system twenty microlitre of the extract was automatically injected and separated on a dionex c18 column 2 1 150 mm 3 μm particle size at an oven temperature of 25 c the flow rate was 0 25 ml min analyses were conducted in the positive electrospray ionisation mode for the target antibiotics tran et al 2019 table s4 lists the conditions of the electrospray ionisation mobile phase and gradient elution tables s5 and s6 list the mass spectrometry and ion selection parameters detailed information about the instrumental detection limits idls and instrumental quantification limits iqls of the 12 target antibiotics is summarised in table s7 three samples were collected at each sampling site and the sample concentrations were the average of the three measured values table s10 all samples were analysed in two groups of repeated trials an external standard method was used to quantify the concentrations of the 12 target antibiotics in water samples the sample determination method for the external standard experiment was the same as the pretreatment method for antibiotics in water samples including filtration na2 edta complexation acidification spe enrichment treatment and the correlation coefficients of standard curves were 99 8 the recovery rates identified before water sample pretreatment ranged from 80 to 105 with relative standard deviations rsds ranging from 5 2 to 10 3 through spe enrichment the detection limit of the water samples was determined to be 0 001 ng l the precision of the method as represented by the rsd ranged from 0 2 to 6 0 table s8 2 4 ecological risk assessment single chemical exposure effects are expressed as a risk quotient rq and the chemical mixture effects are expressed as a hazard index hi islam et al 2021 ecological risk was assessed using rq which has been widely used to evaluate the ecological risk of individual contaminants in aquatic environments tran et al 2019 wang et al 2017 the environmental risk of antibiotics to aquatic organisms i e algae crustaceans or fish was calculated as the ratio between the maximum measured environmental concentrations in water mec and predicted no effect concentration pnec for each contaminant as shown in eq 2 kötke et al 2019 the pnec value was obtained from the 50 effective or lethal concentration ec50 or lc50 of the pharmaceutical by dividing by a safety factor af 100 1000 as shown in eq 3 generally algae have lower ec50 or lc50 values tran et al 2019 therefore in this study the lowest ec50 or lc50 values for algae were used to assess the ecological risks caused by antibiotics the ec50 or lc50 values and af values were obtained from the environmental protection agency and other studies as shown in table s1 1 h i i 1 n r q i n 1 2 12 2 r q i m e c i p n e c i 3 p n e c i l c 50 o r e c 50 a f i 3 results and discussion 3 1 the occurrence and concentrations of antibiotics table s9 shows the concentration and detection frequency df of the antibiotics in the chagan lake catchment all 12 antibiotics were detected with a df ranging from 62 07 to 100 and showed different contamination levels in the study area the concentrations of the antibiotics varied significantly from below the method quantification limit mql to several thousand nanograms per litre amx and oxy had high pollution levels with average concentrations of 174 27 and 92 15 ng l respectively tyl and til had low contaminations compared to ery 1 45 ng l with average concentrations of 0 10 and 0 59 ng l respectively the main sources of antibiotics in the chagan lake catchment are livestock and fisheries breeding therefore veterinary antibiotics are the main source of antibiotic pollution in lake catchments for example nor cip and enr are quinolone antibiotics with similar antibacterial mechanisms but enr as a veterinary antibiotic has a much higher concentration in the lake catchment area than the others as breeding production is the main antibiotic consumer in the chagan lake catchment antibiotics with strong efficacy and low prices would be preferred nguyen et al 2013 for the macrolide antibiotics the concentration of ery 1 45 ng l was significantly higher than that of tyl 0 10 ng l and til 0 59 ng l which is consistent because the price of tyl and til in the veterinary drug market is approximately five times higher than that of ery similar patterns were observed between the consumption and environmental concentration patterns of tet and oxy this also explains why amx a common human antibiotic was frequently detected in this study area amx is a very low cost 0 04 usd pack 500 mg and broad spectrum antibiotic with diverse usage nga et al 2014 to analyse the antibiotic occurrence in detail the chagan lake catchment area was divided into two zones the lake and catchment rivers fig 2 in the catchment rivers amx enr oxy and cap showed high concentrations with average concentrations of 189 17 33 98 108 15 and 46 42 ng l respectively these results are generally higher than those reported in other areas of china but lower than those reported in some asian countries especially in areas of high farming and livestock production such as vietnam minh et al 2009 tran et al 2019 2018 some antibiotics have lower contamination levels than other areas in china and other countries and are commonly used for human disease treatment nor cip and ery or more expensive tyl and til guerra et al 2014 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 thus for catchment rivers tributaries antibiotic consumption during livestock production is the main pollution source the dispersion of most antibiotics was not significant except for sdz and cap fig 3 suggesting that most of the antibiotic contamination status in the lake was similar to that in the catchment rivers this is also reflected by the small difference in degree between the fitting line and the 45 line the concentration of cap in the lake 6 68 ng l was significantly lower than that in the catchment rivers 46 42 ng l even though the pollution source of cap mainly comes from livestock production and it is very difficult to degrade kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 in general it is easier to enrich catchment rivers than lakes with low flow rates however our data analysis demonstrated that cap was not detected in lakes in winter due to the ice covered period this led to significant differences in the analysis of the average multi seasonal concentrations the concentration of sdz in lake water was significantly higher than that in the catchment rivers 42 92 ng l the reason could be that sdz is widely used in fishery production and there were large scale fishery activities in chagan lake wang et al 2017 another reason is that the log p of sdz is 0 12 which makes it easier for the chemical to distribute to the aqueous phase of the water body and its half life is longer 10 h jacobsen et al 2004 therefore the sdz in the catchment rivers is transported with the inflow of water and accumulates in the lakes compared with other lakes in china and other countries it was found that the occurrence of antibiotics in chagan lake in this study similar to that of catchment rivers showed a highly stressed pattern by pollution sources in the livestock breeding industry der beek et al 2016 tran et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 3 2 spatial distribution of antibiotics in this study the main source of antibiotic pollution in the chagan lake catchment was the breeding industry in winter owing to the freezing effect the pollution sources of antibiotics in the lake catchment differ from those in the non freezing period zhang et al 2020 therefore to study the spatial distribution of antibiotics may spring july summer and september autumn were divided and defined as non freezing periods whereas january winter was defined as the freezing period the corresponding normalised heat map fig 4 showed that there was no obvious enrichment trend in the distribution of antibiotic concentrations for both the upstream and downstream sections of the catchment rivers as these were mainly affected by point sources whether in the lake or the catchment rivers 3 2 1 spatial distribution in non freezing periods as a hydro junction hadashan hydro junction s1 diverted water from the second songhua river into chagan lake for water supply resulting in high antibiotic contamination levels this indicates that the second songhua river not only supplies water to chagan lake but is also responsible for introducing a portion of the pollution into the lake catchment there were clear differences in predominant pollutant types between the chagan lake catchment and the second songhua river water supply for example oxy and ery were widely distributed throughout the chagan lake catchment whereas their concentrations at s1 were lower in contrast the concentrations of tet and vcm at s1 were significantly higher than those at other sampling sites in the chagan lake catchment the second songhua river flows through changchun the capital city of jilin province and jilin city the second largest city fig s2 therefore the sources of antibiotic contamination in the second songhua river are different from those in the chagan lake in addition to animal husbandry pollution the source of antibiotic pollution in the second songhua river is mainly urban human sanitary sewage and medical wastewater where antibiotics are often used by humans he et al 2018 2019 given that sewage treatment is generally less efficient in degrading antibiotics it is not surprising that various types of antibiotic contamination were found in s1 and other sampling sites in the changan lake catchment karthikeyan et al 2006 ruan et al 2019 both the jj and ct sampling sites were the two intakes of chagan lake compared with ct the contribution of jj to the antibiotic contamination of chagan lake was significantly lower one reason for this is that jj is the drainage outlet of the da an irrigation area and ct is the drainage outlet of the qianguo irrigation area the da an irrigation area is much smaller than the qianguo irrigation area and hence the contribution of antibiotics from the qianguo irrigation area to chagan lake was more significant under the background of similar farming and breeding modes table s2 second because the qianguo irrigation area contains a medium sized fishery production area s5 xinmiao lake the contribution of antibiotics to contamination in the qianguo irrigation area was exacerbated bighead carp is the main fish species in chagan lake fishery production and special attention is needed to prevent its red skin disease and saprolegniasis during the breeding process hawkes et al 1974 toranzo et al 2005 xi et al 2019 the primary antibiotics used in the treatment and prevention are oxy and sdz he et al 2016 sinigoj gacnik et al 2005 and there exist intensive fishery production activities at sites l1 and s5 resulting in a higher oxy concentration at the two sites however the concentrations of sdz at these two sampling sites showed different patterns of contamination status with l1 being higher this was mainly because site s5 was shallower than l1 resulting in higher water discharge rates the smaller log p value of sdz log p 0 12 indicated that sdz was more likely to be partitioned with water than oxy log p 0 56 therefore sdz at s5 had significant interactions making it easier to migrate thereby resulting in a lower concentration jacobsen et al 2004 this is also the reason why the s1 sampling site still had a higher sdz concentration although fishery production activities were absent the loading of sdz pollutants along the second songhua river enters the chagan lake catchment and accumulates at the hadashan hydro junction s1 3 2 2 spatial distribution in freezing periods owing to the influence of sampling methods and covid 19 impact the number of samples collected in the frozen period was less than that in the non frozen period however differences could still be observed in the distribution of antibiotics between the two periods the concentration of antibiotics in the hadashan hydro junction was found to be significantly lower than that at the other sampling sites in winter cap was not detected at any of the sampling sites in the lake during the winter indicating animal husbandry as its primary source discharges into the lake were further prevented by ice coverage during the winter in addition its behaviour was similar to that of tyl in addition to the antibiotics mentioned above the contamination levels of the remaining antibiotics in the lake were generally higher than those in the catchment rivers in winter as it was almost impossible for antibiotics to enter the water body under a frozen condition in winter zhang et al 2020 therefore the pollution was mainly attributed to the non degraded antibiotics in the water body and the re released antibiotics originally adsorbed and deposited in the sediment cheng et al 2014 li et al 2012 because of the low flow rate lake sediments absorbed more contaminants than catchment rivers during the non freezing season predicting that they would also be a prominent source of pollution during the freezing period liu et al 2018 xu et al 2014 3 3 seasonal dynamics of antibiotics fig 5 shows the seasonal dynamics of antibiotics in the catchment rivers and lakes for the catchment rivers during the non frozen period the concentrations of antibiotics in spring and summer were higher than those in autumn due to more intensive farming and animal husbandry the cultivated land type around the chagan lake catchment is mainly paddy fields irrigation areas which require repeated field soaking and drainage in the spring liu et al 2020 therefore a large amount of antibiotics accumulated in the soil during the winter is discharged into the water body increasing the concentration zhang et al 2020 during the rice growing process farmland irrigation and drainage are still needed and the irrigation areas around the chagan lake catchment do not stop farmland drainage until the rice matures in the autumn thereby leading to lower contamination levels of antibiotics in the autumn liu et al 2019 for lake water during the non frozen period the antibiotic concentrations in spring were significantly higher than those in summer and autumn which was due to 1 the contaminants from the atmosphere deposited into the lake during winter 2 the deposition of a large number of contaminants in the catchment rivers into the lake after snow melting by leaching of soil all these factors lead to a higher concentration of antibiotics in the lake in the spring than in other seasons sun et al 2019 contrary to the pollution status of the catchment rivers the concentration of antibiotics in the lake in summer was lower than that in autumn because the lake is not significantly affected by human activities due to its large water storage capacity i e the increase in water volume and rainfall into the lake more likely dilutes the pollution concentrations in summer than in autumn this result is similar to that of previous studies in other lakes tang et al 2015 based on the analysis of the seasonal distribution pattern of antibiotics in the chagan lake catchment the p values in the winter and the other three seasons were 0 05 this could justify the significantly higher concentration of antibiotics in the frozen period than in the other three seasons tang et al 2015 also found that the contamination levels of most antibiotics in chaohu lake were higher in the winter than in other seasons but under ice free conditions however the significant difference in the contamination levels of antibiotics between winter and other seasons in this study was due to the ice cover phenomenon based on the analysis of the lake catchment surrounding human activities and previous research the main reason is the freezing phenomenon zhang et al 2020 the ice thickness of chagan lake in the freezing period is as high as 0 9 m during the freezing process most contaminants are compressed into the water phase resulting in a lower concentration in the ice phase than in the water phase sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the average water depth of chagan lake is 2 m the water depth of catchment rivers is 1 5 2 m suggesting that nearly half of the water is condensed into ice reducing water storage but significantly increasing the concentration of contaminants in the water this leads to an increase in the concentration of antibiotics in the water during the freezing period and reduces microbial degradation photolysis and sediment adsorption in winter microbial degradation is weakened due to low temperatures burns et al 2018 since microbial degradation of antibiotics is one of the main ways to decrease their concentrations in water this prolongs the time it takes to degrade antibiotics in water cardinal et al 2016 sediment adsorption is another important method for removing antibiotics from water columns when the temperature decreases the morphology of the sediment changes from soft to hard which also weakens the adsorption effect of the sediment ao et al 2020 freezing greatly reduces the light penetration into the water body and the period of availability of light is also short in winter at high latitudes in cold regions which weakens photolysis huang et al 2019 thus freezing phenomena low temperatures and light availability lead to high antibiotic concentrations in water however it should be noted that not all the target antibiotics showed the highest concentrations in winter as shown in fig 6 cap and sdz were present at low concentrations in the lake during the winter cap levels were very stable tran et al 2019 because of decreased water storage freezing and the negligible inflow of water from the catchment rivers into the lake given that the contaminant source of cap is mainly the inflow water in the catchment rivers hence cap was not detected in the lake during winter however the main reason for low concentrations of sdz in the lake in winter was a cessation of sdz dosage in fishery production during the winter vcm concentration was also low due to its high lipophilic properties log p 4 73 i e it preferentially adsorbs to the sediment domenech et al 2009 additionally vcm is mostly used in animal husbandry and the spring snowmelt tends to enrich vcm in soil from animal husbandry metabolism and leach it into the water resulting in high aquatic concentrations of vcm in spring 3 4 correlation between antibiotics and resistance genes the relative abundance of the args at each sampling point is shown in fig 7 and table s11 the target antibiotics could explain more than 50 of all tested args which rose to 70 when multidrug args were excluded therefore exploring the distribution patterns of the target antibiotics and their corresponding args in this study can help to better understand the current status fate and transport of antibiotics in the chagan lake catchment the relative abundance of target args in the lake was higher than that in the catchment rivers the relative abundance of most args showed a positive correlation with exposure time and frequency due to the higher flow rates in catchment rivers the exposure time between microorganisms and antibiotics is short resulting in a lower relative abundance of args in contrast microbes in lakes with lower flow rates experience a longer exposure time to antibiotics especially after sustained and uninterrupted domestication liu et al 2019 thai et al 2018 yang et al 2018 table 1 shows the regression analysis between target antibiotics and their corresponding args r2 was negatively correlated with the half lives of antibiotics indicating that the longer the half life the weaker the correlation between the antibiotic concentration and the relative abundance of the corresponding args in water this may be because antibiotics with long half lives have profound and lasting effects on the microorganisms in water even occasional contamination events may cause long term effects on args hence more attention should be paid to the control of antibiotics with long half lives in water environment management k showed a strong exponential positive correlation with log p y 0 0005e1 9322x r2 0 9984 fig 8 the octanol water partition coefficient log p is used to characterise the lipophilicity of antibiotics where antibiotics with a larger log p are more likely to be distributed in the sediment phase than in the water phase the strong positive correlation between k and log p is due to the existence of the majority of the microorganisms in natural water bodies in the sediment so antibiotics with large log p values are more likely to affect microorganisms that produce args therefore the physical and chemical properties of antibiotics should be evaluated for their effectiveness 3 5 antibiotic ecological risk and priority control list in the chagan lake catchment 3 5 1 ecological risk in the chagan lake catchment the ecological risk entropies of the target antibiotics in the chagan lake catchment during four seasons are listed in table s12 amx tet oxy and sdz showed high ecological risk levels based on the mean risk quotient for each season nor ery tyl and vcm all had low risk levels the corresponding normalised heat map of the ecological risk distribution of the target antibiotics for each season is shown in fig 9 it can be seen that except for vcm in the catchment rivers and cap and sdz in the lake all other target antibiotics had the highest ecological risk in winter therefore more attention should be paid to the control of antibiotic concentrations during winter which has often been overlooked in terms of spatial distribution the total ecological risk of the lake was higher than that of the catchment rivers especially in spring this is mainly due to the melting of ice and snow from catchment rivers into chagan lake as well as the melting of the lake s upper ice sheet in particular the risk of sdz was significantly higher in spring than in other seasons including winter this phenomenon is also closely related to chagan lake fishery production the hi risk map of the 12 target antibiotics in the lake was intuitively characterised by spatial and seasonal distributions fig 10 ecological risk in spring mainly came from the drainage of irrigated areas after melting sampling points ct and jj and the usage of antibiotics in fishery production sampling point l1 in summer the pattern of antibiotic ecological risk was more clearly reflected at locations l1 and s5 which are two important fishery production areas in the lake catchment indicating that the lake ecological risk was seriously stressed by fishery production after the drainage of the irrigation area in autumn the ecological risk showed a downward trend especially for the ecological risk caused by irrigation the whole lake presented a high ecological risk in winter which was affected by higher concentrations of antibiotics in winter hence the ecological risk of the lake is significantly affected by the surrounding agricultural activities and fishery production in the lake catchment and is particularly influenced by the ice covered period in winter thus for ecological risk management and control time sharing and zoning should be carefully planned and performed 3 5 2 hierarchical priority control list of antibiotics in the chagan lake catchment the normalised heat map was based on combining ecological risk assessment and resistance gene data analysis fig 11 the negative influence of antibiotics for ecological environmental health is not only an ecological risk but also results in the generation of args which is the main negative impact with more severe and far reaching consequences bengtsson palme et al 2016 yang et al 2018 a normalised heat map did not show any obvious correlation between the ecological risk and the args of the antibiotics in the lake indicating that a single ecological risk cannot characterise antibiotic contamination according to the args the relative abundances of macrolides tetracycline and vancomycin were high suggesting that the microbial communities in the lake catchment were highly resistant to these antibiotics previous studies have found that the transfer of args takes place both vertically from parents to offspring and horizontally between different populations and communities in microorganisms liu et al 2018 yang et al 2018 these processes also enhance the formation of superbugs which pose critical threats to human and animal health ashbolt et al 2013 pruden et al 2006 antibiotics associated with a high relative abundance of args generally exhibit high lipophilicity these antibiotics did not have very high concentrations in the water but their relative abundance of args was much higher than that of other antibiotics for example the concentration of vcm 0 997 ng l in the chagan lake catchment was much lower than that of amx 164 905 ng l whereas the relative abundance of vcm resistance genes was three times higher than that of axm this indicates that the generation of args is not only completely affected by the concentration of antibiotic exposure but is also closely related to the physical and chemical properties of antibiotics half life and lipophilicity log p were also strongly correlated with the relative abundance of args recently among a large number of emerging contaminants the effective control of antibiotics has become a popular issue raising international concerns bengtsson palme et al 2016 huang et al 2022 yang et al 2018 however considering the large variety of antibiotics their ecotoxicities and potential threats to human health are also very different in most previous studies the priority control list of antibiotics was determined according to their toxicity bioaccumulation persistence and occurrence frequency in the environment huang et al 2022 sousa et al 2018 these studies listed four major classes of 18 antibiotics in the priority control list macrolides quinolones sulfonamides and tetracyclines huang et al 2022 liu et al 2018 however a one size fits all list does not necessarily apply to all the study areas for example in our study quinolones and sulfonamides showed low risks both in terms of ecological risk and relative abundance of args which is related to the antibiotic contamination sources in the chagan lake catchment i e the antibiotic contamination sources mostly used in veterinary activities we believe there is hardly any mention of the vcm in the priority control list which could be due to its low frequency of detection and low predicted pnec of ecological risk 370 8 ug l domenech et al 2009 however because of its long half life and strong lipophilicity it has a very strong effect on the corresponding production of args and is a class of antibiotics worthy of attention in environmental surveillance amx has a high ecological risk but the generation of microbial args is relatively low which is also related to the high ph in the chagan lake catchment amx has high antibacterial activity only under weakly acidic conditions hirte et al 2016 although amx has a low relative abundance of args in the study area its serious potential harm to the ecosystem in the chagan lake catchment cannot be ignored amx is extremely toxic to algae lützhøft et al 1999 these findings suggest that the development of a priority control list for antibiotics should not be a single method that ignores regional characteristics therefore this study integrated the ecological risk and relative abundance of args to establish an hcpl from critical high medium and low antibiotics in the chagan lake catchment tacconelli et al 2017 combining hi with the relative abundance of args the hcpl values were weighted by 50 at each station both hi and relative abundance of args were normalised the hcpl values in the chagan lake catchment area ranged from 0 46 to 0 01 which were categorised further as critical 1 00 0 20 high 0 20 0 10 medium 0 10 0 02 and low 0 02 therefore in the chagan lake catchment β lactam amx and macrolide ery tyl are of critical priority tetracycline tet oxy and vancomycin are of high priority sulfonamides sdz are of medium priority and quinolones cip nor enr and chloramphenicol cap are of low priority those with critical and high tiers should be controlled and prioritised and their use in animal husbandry and aquaculture should be considerably reduced in the future 4 conclusion and outlook in this study the sources occurrence fate and transport of 12 target antibiotics and their potential risks in the chagan lake catchment were explored across four seasons spring summer autumn and winter it was found that the lake and catchment had similar contamination status for most antibiotics all 12 target antibiotics were detected in the study area the highest concentrations of antibiotics occurred in winter mainly because of the slow degradation rate and dissipation of contaminants during the freezing process subsequently we also found that the relative abundance of args for macrolides tetracycline and vancomycin was higher than that of other classes of antibiotics the relative abundance of args was strongly correlated with the half life and lipophilicity of antibiotics therefore the physical and chemical properties of antibiotics should be considered in their control furthermore based on the relative abundance of args and ecological risks the hcpl in the chagan lake catchment area was established the critical priorities should be for β lactam amx and macrolide ery tyl antibiotics with high priorities for tetracycline antibiotics tet oxy and vancomycin medium priority for sulfonamides sdz and low priorities for quinolones cip nor enr and chloramphenicol cap it is recommended that the application and control of antibiotics be strengthened in winter and spring when ice and snow melt in the chagan lake catchment due to the current study limitations we only focused on antibiotics in surface water and the pollution loads were based on the main pollution sources in the chagan lake catchment further studies should explore sediments and other environmental media as well as other pollution sources such as atmospheric deposition sediment release and groundwater intrusion in addition a comprehensive study of args can also be considered in the future args in natural water can be analysed more comprehensively by combining the mixing effects of multiple contaminants including antibiotics moreover a comprehensive modelling approach at the catchment scale is necessary to explore the fate transport and potential risks of antibiotics to elucidate their future patterns influenced by climate and land use changes in the

15235,antibiotics are widely consumed and are ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems such as in agricultural and fishery lake catchments for prophylactic treatment however there are very few comprehensive studies reporting all seasonal occurrences spatiotemporal dynamics and risk assessments of antibiotics in agricultural lake catchments especially in cold regions during the winter season this study measured seasonality in the concentrations of 12 antibiotics belonging to seven different classes in the surface waters tributary rivers and lakes of the chagan lake catchment in northeast china all antibiotics were detected in most of the water samples across most seasons with concentrations varying for different compounds locations and seasons these levels were discussed in terms of the main sources at different sampling sites including agriculture fish farming municipal wastewater and others in general the highest concentrations of most compounds were observed during the freeze thaw periods the number of antibiotic resistance genes args correlated with compound lipophilicity and half life based on the ecological risks of antibiotics and the relative abundance of args a hierarchical control priority list hcpl of antibiotics was determined considering four levels critical high medium and low to further strengthen the control and effectively manage antibiotics we highly recommend the reduction and selective use of veterinary antibiotics in winter and spring during the freeze thaw periods in the chagan lake catchment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotics spatio seasonal dynamics freeze up period antibiotics resistance genes ecological risk assessment priority control list data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction antibiotics are widely used in the treatment of human and animal diseases which have become a prominent emerging contaminant class in the world with the development of improved antibiotic production technologies the cost of antibiotics has decreased considerably making them easily accessible bielen et al 2017 kümmerer et al 2009a 2009b as a result antibiotics are widely used not only for disease treatment but also as feed additives to promote animal growth and disease prevention in the breeding industry particularly in livestock and fishery production blair et al 2015 kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 however owing to the incomplete metabolism of antibiotics by the animals a considerable amount of antibiotics end up in the environment and are frequently detected cha et al 2009 lyu et al 2020 tran et al 2018 antibiotic residues can cause ecotoxicity and harm ecological health wang et al 2017 williams nguyen et al 2016 for example β lactam antibiotics are reported to be highly toxic to algae gonzalez pleiter et al 2013 similarly some veterinary antibiotics can harm human health by entering the food chain huang et al 2022 schwab et al 2005 the extremely negative environmental effects of antibiotic contamination are the proliferation and spread of antibiotic resistance genes args bengtsson palme et al 2015 martinez et al 2015 singer et al 2014 van boeckel et al 2015 the spread and transmission of args in microorganisms can be vertical transmission between parents and offspring or horizontal transmission between different communities chow et al 2020 letchumanan et al 2015 it can also be associated with the emergence of super resistant bacteria that pose a threat to public health blair et al 2015 kim et al 2007 the primary sources of antibiotics in aquatic environments include i direct discharge of untreated rural domestic sewage kümmerer et al 2009a ii discharge of urban domestic sewage and medical wastewater after treatment by sewage treatment plants studies have reported incomplete degradation of antibiotics by conventional sewage treatment processes gulkowska et al 2008 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 ruan et al 2019 iii infiltration of antibiotics containing metabolic waste from livestock production and other solid wastes through soil lyu et al 2020 iv large scale drugs used in fisheries muziasari et al 2017 v release of sediments cheng et al 2014 vi migration from groundwater burke et al 2016 vii surface water runoff and viii atmospheric deposition barroso et al 2019 china is one of the major consumers of antibiotics zhang et al 2015 the main sources of veterinary antibiotics in china are livestock and fishery production which occur mainly in regions with intensive agricultural activities dinh et al 2017 the chagan lake catchment is a representative area located in the main grain producing region of northeast china the area is a major producer of rice livestock and fishery products and exhibits a high potential risk of antibiotic contamination additionally due to the location of the chagan lake catchment at 45 n latitude and intensive agricultural farming and breeding activities it is considerably affected by drastic seasonal changes in weather conditions and usually undergoes a four month frozen period liu et al 2021a 2021b prior studies on the spatiotemporal distribution of antibiotics in aquatic ecosystems have mostly focused on ice free or non ice bound periods liu et al 2019 tran et al 2019 wang et al 2017 owing to the natural conditions and different human activities such as hydrological regimes and drainage in irrigated areas the status and seasonal distribution pattern of contamination in ice bound water and related catchments are generally remarkably different than those of ice free systems zhang et al 2020 studies have shown that light and temperature are important factors affecting antibiotic degradation gruchlik et al 2018 during the frozen period the water temperature is very low 0 8 3 and the ice cover reduces the intake of light intensity together these factors may lead to the specific status and unique spatiotemporal distribution of antibiotic contaminants in aquatic ecosystems during frozen and melt periods to the best of our knowledge studies on the prevalence of antibiotics across seasons in receiving water bodies such as lakes and their related catchment rivers in a cold region especially during ice covered periods have not been reported previously thus in this study we characterised the seasonal dynamics of antibiotic contaminants focusing on the frozen period and assessed their potential risk levels at the catchment scale it is reported that the relative abundance of args increases under high antibiotic concentrations in aquatic environments huerta et al 2013 zheng et al 2018 however not all classes of antibiotics have the same concentration thresholds for the induction of arg production as this is related to their physical and chemical properties bengtsson palme et al 2016 for surface water antibiotic contamination is dynamic and migratory and the subsequent induction of antibiotic resistance by microbes is long lasting and far reaching czekalski et al 2015 hence it is important to explore the correlations between antibiotics and args considering the physical and chemical properties of antibiotics to fully understand the possible risks and linkages hundreds of antibiotics are commonly used in clinical medicine and the breeding industry larsson et al 2014 however the mechanisms of action toxicity and physicochemical properties differ for various antibiotics kümmerer et al 2009a 2009b tran et al 2019 this variation affects the degree of contamination ecotoxicity and induction of args in environmental media for different antibiotics antibiotics with low ecological toxicity easy degradation and a low risk of resistance gene induction could exist in the environment within acceptable limits whereas other antibiotics should be strictly controlled in the environment bengtsson palme et al 2016 sousa et al 2018 therefore the development of a priority control list for antibiotics has become a research focus for antibiotic contamination control bengtsson palme et al 2016 huang et al 2022 sousa et al 2018 however great variations in concentrations and classes of antibiotics can be expected for regions with different land uses for example most urban waters are polluted by human antibiotics whereas most agricultural areas are polluted by veterinary antibiotics in addition the difference in environmental media conditions also has an impact on the contamination status of antibiotics for example the half life of amoxicillin varies remarkably in water at different ph levels similarly the temperature is a major factor affecting the degradation of antibiotics in situ hirte et al 2016 le minh et al 2010 tran et al 2019 yang et al 2018 therefore more attention should be paid to time sharing and zoning analyses of the ecological risks of antibiotics and the development of an antibiotic priority control list thus this study aims to a explore the spatio seasonal dynamics of 12 target antibiotics and identify the main drivers of the diversification and distribution in the surface water in the chagan lake catchment b uncover particular driving mechanisms of antibiotic contamination during the cold freeze up period c analyse the relationship between args and the physical and chemical properties of antibiotics and identify the factors affecting the relative abundances d assess the ecological risk of antibiotics and their linkage with resistance gene contamination and e establish a hierarchical control priority list hcpl of antibiotics in the chagan lake catchment thereby providing a scientific basis for antibiotic control in cold semi arid aquatic ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 target antibiotics chemical reagents and solvents in this study 12 target antibiotics from seven different classes were investigated they were selected based on the results of args in a preliminary experiment and a survey of the chagan lake catchment i e commonly used antibiotics for humans and veterinary animals in the catchment the target antibiotics included the following 1 β lactams amoxicillin amx 2 quinolones ciprofloxacin cip norfloxacin nor enrofloxacin enr 3 macrolides erythromycin ery tylosin tyl tilmicosin til 4 tetracyclines tetracycline tet oxytetracycline oxy 5 chloramphenicols chloramphenicol cap 6 sulfonamides sulfadiazine sdz 7 glycopeptides vancomycin vcm the properties toxicity data and usage patterns of the 12 target antibiotics are listed in table s1 all the target antibiotic standards were purchased from the dr ehrenstorfer company germany with a purity grade 99 the external standard method was used in this study each target antibiotic standard sample had a configured gradient solution of 5 500 μg l using methanol or ultrapure water the other chemicals used in this study were of lc ms grade 2 2 study area and sample collection the chagan lake catchment including chagan lake and its surrounding catchment rivers or tributaries is located in the northeast of china with an annual average temperature of 4 5 an annual average rainfall of 415 4 mm 80 of summer precipitation and an annual evaporation of 1400 2100 mm liu et al 2019 the surface area of chagan lake is approximately 345 km2 and its water storage capacity is approximately 6 108 m3 liu et al 2020 the annual ice period can reach up to 130 days with an average ice thickness of 0 9 m song et al 2019 the water inflows into the lake mainly include four components i e the drainage of qianguo and of da an irrigation areas rainfall and groundwater recharge see table s2 for the inflow water amount in the lake and the corresponding irrigation areas liu et al 2021b chagan lake is one of the main fishing areas in northeast china with an annual output of 3 500 tons of fish irrigated areas in the catchment mainly include rice cultivation and extensive animal husbandry the detailed land use types in the lake catchment are presented in table s3 note that not all paddy fields and dry farmland in the chagan lake catchment are included in the two irrigated areas it is noteworthy that the hadashan hydrojunction is included in the qianguo irrigation area that is the amount of water was diverted from the second songhua river into chagan lake through the qianguo irrigation area for irrigation and ecological water replenishment the location of the hadashan hydro junction on the second songhua river is shown in fig s1 before entering the chagan lake catchment the second songhua river passes through two large cities changchun and jilin with populations of 9 067 and 4 047 million respectively he et al 2018 therefore the sources of antibiotic contamination in the chagan lake catchment are mainly surface runoff livestock breeding mainly from irrigation areas fishery production sediment release groundwater migration and urban domestic and medical wastewaters mainly from the hadashan hydro junction although antibiotic sources also include groundwater migration atmospheric subsidence and internal sediment release this study mainly focuses on the impact of pollution in irrigated areas on surface water considering the limited information available from other sources in addition compared with the da an irrigation area the qianguo irrigation area is more typical of antibiotic pollution therefore the catchment rivers in the qianguo irrigation area were selected as representative ones for our study therefore in this study the distribution of sampling sites in the chagan lake catchment was carried out in combination with inflow water sources and typical contamination sites in the chagan lake the sampling sites are shown in fig 1 samples were collected four times i e in may july and october 2020 and in january 2021 eight catchment rivers and seven lake samples were collected at a sampling depth of approximately 20 30 cm river catchment water samples were collected from the central part of the river all the collected samples were filled in 2 l polypropylene bottles in addition two 2 l samples were collected from each sampling site as parallel controls stored in cold storage at 4 c and transported to the laboratory it should be noted that during winter sampling january 2021 the ice cover had to be broken using an ice drill before sampling 2 3 chemical analysis one litre of the water sample was added to 0 5 g na2 edta the ph of the water sample was adjusted to 4 followed by filtering through a 0 45 μm glass fabric filter whatman uk to remove particles as antibiotics are mostly in the dissolved phase than other lipophilic emerging contaminants perfluorinated compounds polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons etc chen et al 2019 on comparing the mean values of concentrations in the dissolved and suspended solid phases we found that the antibiotic content in the suspended phase was not significant therefore this study only considered the distribution of antibiotics in the dissolved phase of surface water briefly the filtered samples 1 l were subjected to solid phase extraction spe using oasis hydrophile lipophilic balance hlb cartridges 6 cc 500 mg waters usa the cartridges were preconditioned with 10 ml of ethyl acetate and methanol mixed solution 1 1 v v 10 ml methanol and 10 ml of acidic water ph 4 filtered samples were passed through the hlb cartridges at a flow rate of 10 ml min followed by a rinse with 10 ml of 5 methanol in water the cartridges were then vacuum dried for 10 min followed by elution with methanol 10 ml the eluates were evaporated to near dryness at room temperature in a water bath under a gentle nitrogen stream the dried extracts were dissolved again in methanol 1 ml the final aliquots were transferred into 2 ml amber vials and stored at room temperature 20 25 until high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry hplc ms ms analysis ju et al 2019 instrumental analysis of antibiotics was performed according to the methods established in previous studies briefly antibiotics in the extracted solution were analysed using hplc ms ms agilent 1290 infinity hplc coupled to an agilent 6490 triple quadrupole ms ms system twenty microlitre of the extract was automatically injected and separated on a dionex c18 column 2 1 150 mm 3 μm particle size at an oven temperature of 25 c the flow rate was 0 25 ml min analyses were conducted in the positive electrospray ionisation mode for the target antibiotics tran et al 2019 table s4 lists the conditions of the electrospray ionisation mobile phase and gradient elution tables s5 and s6 list the mass spectrometry and ion selection parameters detailed information about the instrumental detection limits idls and instrumental quantification limits iqls of the 12 target antibiotics is summarised in table s7 three samples were collected at each sampling site and the sample concentrations were the average of the three measured values table s10 all samples were analysed in two groups of repeated trials an external standard method was used to quantify the concentrations of the 12 target antibiotics in water samples the sample determination method for the external standard experiment was the same as the pretreatment method for antibiotics in water samples including filtration na2 edta complexation acidification spe enrichment treatment and the correlation coefficients of standard curves were 99 8 the recovery rates identified before water sample pretreatment ranged from 80 to 105 with relative standard deviations rsds ranging from 5 2 to 10 3 through spe enrichment the detection limit of the water samples was determined to be 0 001 ng l the precision of the method as represented by the rsd ranged from 0 2 to 6 0 table s8 2 4 ecological risk assessment single chemical exposure effects are expressed as a risk quotient rq and the chemical mixture effects are expressed as a hazard index hi islam et al 2021 ecological risk was assessed using rq which has been widely used to evaluate the ecological risk of individual contaminants in aquatic environments tran et al 2019 wang et al 2017 the environmental risk of antibiotics to aquatic organisms i e algae crustaceans or fish was calculated as the ratio between the maximum measured environmental concentrations in water mec and predicted no effect concentration pnec for each contaminant as shown in eq 2 kötke et al 2019 the pnec value was obtained from the 50 effective or lethal concentration ec50 or lc50 of the pharmaceutical by dividing by a safety factor af 100 1000 as shown in eq 3 generally algae have lower ec50 or lc50 values tran et al 2019 therefore in this study the lowest ec50 or lc50 values for algae were used to assess the ecological risks caused by antibiotics the ec50 or lc50 values and af values were obtained from the environmental protection agency and other studies as shown in table s1 1 h i i 1 n r q i n 1 2 12 2 r q i m e c i p n e c i 3 p n e c i l c 50 o r e c 50 a f i 3 results and discussion 3 1 the occurrence and concentrations of antibiotics table s9 shows the concentration and detection frequency df of the antibiotics in the chagan lake catchment all 12 antibiotics were detected with a df ranging from 62 07 to 100 and showed different contamination levels in the study area the concentrations of the antibiotics varied significantly from below the method quantification limit mql to several thousand nanograms per litre amx and oxy had high pollution levels with average concentrations of 174 27 and 92 15 ng l respectively tyl and til had low contaminations compared to ery 1 45 ng l with average concentrations of 0 10 and 0 59 ng l respectively the main sources of antibiotics in the chagan lake catchment are livestock and fisheries breeding therefore veterinary antibiotics are the main source of antibiotic pollution in lake catchments for example nor cip and enr are quinolone antibiotics with similar antibacterial mechanisms but enr as a veterinary antibiotic has a much higher concentration in the lake catchment area than the others as breeding production is the main antibiotic consumer in the chagan lake catchment antibiotics with strong efficacy and low prices would be preferred nguyen et al 2013 for the macrolide antibiotics the concentration of ery 1 45 ng l was significantly higher than that of tyl 0 10 ng l and til 0 59 ng l which is consistent because the price of tyl and til in the veterinary drug market is approximately five times higher than that of ery similar patterns were observed between the consumption and environmental concentration patterns of tet and oxy this also explains why amx a common human antibiotic was frequently detected in this study area amx is a very low cost 0 04 usd pack 500 mg and broad spectrum antibiotic with diverse usage nga et al 2014 to analyse the antibiotic occurrence in detail the chagan lake catchment area was divided into two zones the lake and catchment rivers fig 2 in the catchment rivers amx enr oxy and cap showed high concentrations with average concentrations of 189 17 33 98 108 15 and 46 42 ng l respectively these results are generally higher than those reported in other areas of china but lower than those reported in some asian countries especially in areas of high farming and livestock production such as vietnam minh et al 2009 tran et al 2019 2018 some antibiotics have lower contamination levels than other areas in china and other countries and are commonly used for human disease treatment nor cip and ery or more expensive tyl and til guerra et al 2014 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 thus for catchment rivers tributaries antibiotic consumption during livestock production is the main pollution source the dispersion of most antibiotics was not significant except for sdz and cap fig 3 suggesting that most of the antibiotic contamination status in the lake was similar to that in the catchment rivers this is also reflected by the small difference in degree between the fitting line and the 45 line the concentration of cap in the lake 6 68 ng l was significantly lower than that in the catchment rivers 46 42 ng l even though the pollution source of cap mainly comes from livestock production and it is very difficult to degrade kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 in general it is easier to enrich catchment rivers than lakes with low flow rates however our data analysis demonstrated that cap was not detected in lakes in winter due to the ice covered period this led to significant differences in the analysis of the average multi seasonal concentrations the concentration of sdz in lake water was significantly higher than that in the catchment rivers 42 92 ng l the reason could be that sdz is widely used in fishery production and there were large scale fishery activities in chagan lake wang et al 2017 another reason is that the log p of sdz is 0 12 which makes it easier for the chemical to distribute to the aqueous phase of the water body and its half life is longer 10 h jacobsen et al 2004 therefore the sdz in the catchment rivers is transported with the inflow of water and accumulates in the lakes compared with other lakes in china and other countries it was found that the occurrence of antibiotics in chagan lake in this study similar to that of catchment rivers showed a highly stressed pattern by pollution sources in the livestock breeding industry der beek et al 2016 tran et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 3 2 spatial distribution of antibiotics in this study the main source of antibiotic pollution in the chagan lake catchment was the breeding industry in winter owing to the freezing effect the pollution sources of antibiotics in the lake catchment differ from those in the non freezing period zhang et al 2020 therefore to study the spatial distribution of antibiotics may spring july summer and september autumn were divided and defined as non freezing periods whereas january winter was defined as the freezing period the corresponding normalised heat map fig 4 showed that there was no obvious enrichment trend in the distribution of antibiotic concentrations for both the upstream and downstream sections of the catchment rivers as these were mainly affected by point sources whether in the lake or the catchment rivers 3 2 1 spatial distribution in non freezing periods as a hydro junction hadashan hydro junction s1 diverted water from the second songhua river into chagan lake for water supply resulting in high antibiotic contamination levels this indicates that the second songhua river not only supplies water to chagan lake but is also responsible for introducing a portion of the pollution into the lake catchment there were clear differences in predominant pollutant types between the chagan lake catchment and the second songhua river water supply for example oxy and ery were widely distributed throughout the chagan lake catchment whereas their concentrations at s1 were lower in contrast the concentrations of tet and vcm at s1 were significantly higher than those at other sampling sites in the chagan lake catchment the second songhua river flows through changchun the capital city of jilin province and jilin city the second largest city fig s2 therefore the sources of antibiotic contamination in the second songhua river are different from those in the chagan lake in addition to animal husbandry pollution the source of antibiotic pollution in the second songhua river is mainly urban human sanitary sewage and medical wastewater where antibiotics are often used by humans he et al 2018 2019 given that sewage treatment is generally less efficient in degrading antibiotics it is not surprising that various types of antibiotic contamination were found in s1 and other sampling sites in the changan lake catchment karthikeyan et al 2006 ruan et al 2019 both the jj and ct sampling sites were the two intakes of chagan lake compared with ct the contribution of jj to the antibiotic contamination of chagan lake was significantly lower one reason for this is that jj is the drainage outlet of the da an irrigation area and ct is the drainage outlet of the qianguo irrigation area the da an irrigation area is much smaller than the qianguo irrigation area and hence the contribution of antibiotics from the qianguo irrigation area to chagan lake was more significant under the background of similar farming and breeding modes table s2 second because the qianguo irrigation area contains a medium sized fishery production area s5 xinmiao lake the contribution of antibiotics to contamination in the qianguo irrigation area was exacerbated bighead carp is the main fish species in chagan lake fishery production and special attention is needed to prevent its red skin disease and saprolegniasis during the breeding process hawkes et al 1974 toranzo et al 2005 xi et al 2019 the primary antibiotics used in the treatment and prevention are oxy and sdz he et al 2016 sinigoj gacnik et al 2005 and there exist intensive fishery production activities at sites l1 and s5 resulting in a higher oxy concentration at the two sites however the concentrations of sdz at these two sampling sites showed different patterns of contamination status with l1 being higher this was mainly because site s5 was shallower than l1 resulting in higher water discharge rates the smaller log p value of sdz log p 0 12 indicated that sdz was more likely to be partitioned with water than oxy log p 0 56 therefore sdz at s5 had significant interactions making it easier to migrate thereby resulting in a lower concentration jacobsen et al 2004 this is also the reason why the s1 sampling site still had a higher sdz concentration although fishery production activities were absent the loading of sdz pollutants along the second songhua river enters the chagan lake catchment and accumulates at the hadashan hydro junction s1 3 2 2 spatial distribution in freezing periods owing to the influence of sampling methods and covid 19 impact the number of samples collected in the frozen period was less than that in the non frozen period however differences could still be observed in the distribution of antibiotics between the two periods the concentration of antibiotics in the hadashan hydro junction was found to be significantly lower than that at the other sampling sites in winter cap was not detected at any of the sampling sites in the lake during the winter indicating animal husbandry as its primary source discharges into the lake were further prevented by ice coverage during the winter in addition its behaviour was similar to that of tyl in addition to the antibiotics mentioned above the contamination levels of the remaining antibiotics in the lake were generally higher than those in the catchment rivers in winter as it was almost impossible for antibiotics to enter the water body under a frozen condition in winter zhang et al 2020 therefore the pollution was mainly attributed to the non degraded antibiotics in the water body and the re released antibiotics originally adsorbed and deposited in the sediment cheng et al 2014 li et al 2012 because of the low flow rate lake sediments absorbed more contaminants than catchment rivers during the non freezing season predicting that they would also be a prominent source of pollution during the freezing period liu et al 2018 xu et al 2014 3 3 seasonal dynamics of antibiotics fig 5 shows the seasonal dynamics of antibiotics in the catchment rivers and lakes for the catchment rivers during the non frozen period the concentrations of antibiotics in spring and summer were higher than those in autumn due to more intensive farming and animal husbandry the cultivated land type around the chagan lake catchment is mainly paddy fields irrigation areas which require repeated field soaking and drainage in the spring liu et al 2020 therefore a large amount of antibiotics accumulated in the soil during the winter is discharged into the water body increasing the concentration zhang et al 2020 during the rice growing process farmland irrigation and drainage are still needed and the irrigation areas around the chagan lake catchment do not stop farmland drainage until the rice matures in the autumn thereby leading to lower contamination levels of antibiotics in the autumn liu et al 2019 for lake water during the non frozen period the antibiotic concentrations in spring were significantly higher than those in summer and autumn which was due to 1 the contaminants from the atmosphere deposited into the lake during winter 2 the deposition of a large number of contaminants in the catchment rivers into the lake after snow melting by leaching of soil all these factors lead to a higher concentration of antibiotics in the lake in the spring than in other seasons sun et al 2019 contrary to the pollution status of the catchment rivers the concentration of antibiotics in the lake in summer was lower than that in autumn because the lake is not significantly affected by human activities due to its large water storage capacity i e the increase in water volume and rainfall into the lake more likely dilutes the pollution concentrations in summer than in autumn this result is similar to that of previous studies in other lakes tang et al 2015 based on the analysis of the seasonal distribution pattern of antibiotics in the chagan lake catchment the p values in the winter and the other three seasons were 0 05 this could justify the significantly higher concentration of antibiotics in the frozen period than in the other three seasons tang et al 2015 also found that the contamination levels of most antibiotics in chaohu lake were higher in the winter than in other seasons but under ice free conditions however the significant difference in the contamination levels of antibiotics between winter and other seasons in this study was due to the ice cover phenomenon based on the analysis of the lake catchment surrounding human activities and previous research the main reason is the freezing phenomenon zhang et al 2020 the ice thickness of chagan lake in the freezing period is as high as 0 9 m during the freezing process most contaminants are compressed into the water phase resulting in a lower concentration in the ice phase than in the water phase sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the average water depth of chagan lake is 2 m the water depth of catchment rivers is 1 5 2 m suggesting that nearly half of the water is condensed into ice reducing water storage but significantly increasing the concentration of contaminants in the water this leads to an increase in the concentration of antibiotics in the water during the freezing period and reduces microbial degradation photolysis and sediment adsorption in winter microbial degradation is weakened due to low temperatures burns et al 2018 since microbial degradation of antibiotics is one of the main ways to decrease their concentrations in water this prolongs the time it takes to degrade antibiotics in water cardinal et al 2016 sediment adsorption is another important method for removing antibiotics from water columns when the temperature decreases the morphology of the sediment changes from soft to hard which also weakens the adsorption effect of the sediment ao et al 2020 freezing greatly reduces the light penetration into the water body and the period of availability of light is also short in winter at high latitudes in cold regions which weakens photolysis huang et al 2019 thus freezing phenomena low temperatures and light availability lead to high antibiotic concentrations in water however it should be noted that not all the target antibiotics showed the highest concentrations in winter as shown in fig 6 cap and sdz were present at low concentrations in the lake during the winter cap levels were very stable tran et al 2019 because of decreased water storage freezing and the negligible inflow of water from the catchment rivers into the lake given that the contaminant source of cap is mainly the inflow water in the catchment rivers hence cap was not detected in the lake during winter however the main reason for low concentrations of sdz in the lake in winter was a cessation of sdz dosage in fishery production during the winter vcm concentration was also low due to its high lipophilic properties log p 4 73 i e it preferentially adsorbs to the sediment domenech et al 2009 additionally vcm is mostly used in animal husbandry and the spring snowmelt tends to enrich vcm in soil from animal husbandry metabolism and leach it into the water resulting in high aquatic concentrations of vcm in spring 3 4 correlation between antibiotics and resistance genes the relative abundance of the args at each sampling point is shown in fig 7 and table s11 the target antibiotics could explain more than 50 of all tested args which rose to 70 when multidrug args were excluded therefore exploring the distribution patterns of the target antibiotics and their corresponding args in this study can help to better understand the current status fate and transport of antibiotics in the chagan lake catchment the relative abundance of target args in the lake was higher than that in the catchment rivers the relative abundance of most args showed a positive correlation with exposure time and frequency due to the higher flow rates in catchment rivers the exposure time between microorganisms and antibiotics is short resulting in a lower relative abundance of args in contrast microbes in lakes with lower flow rates experience a longer exposure time to antibiotics especially after sustained and uninterrupted domestication liu et al 2019 thai et al 2018 yang et al 2018 table 1 shows the regression analysis between target antibiotics and their corresponding args r2 was negatively correlated with the half lives of antibiotics indicating that the longer the half life the weaker the correlation between the antibiotic concentration and the relative abundance of the corresponding args in water this may be because antibiotics with long half lives have profound and lasting effects on the microorganisms in water even occasional contamination events may cause long term effects on args hence more attention should be paid to the control of antibiotics with long half lives in water environment management k showed a strong exponential positive correlation with log p y 0 0005e1 9322x r2 0 9984 fig 8 the octanol water partition coefficient log p is used to characterise the lipophilicity of antibiotics where antibiotics with a larger log p are more likely to be distributed in the sediment phase than in the water phase the strong positive correlation between k and log p is due to the existence of the majority of the microorganisms in natural water bodies in the sediment so antibiotics with large log p values are more likely to affect microorganisms that produce args therefore the physical and chemical properties of antibiotics should be evaluated for their effectiveness 3 5 antibiotic ecological risk and priority control list in the chagan lake catchment 3 5 1 ecological risk in the chagan lake catchment the ecological risk entropies of the target antibiotics in the chagan lake catchment during four seasons are listed in table s12 amx tet oxy and sdz showed high ecological risk levels based on the mean risk quotient for each season nor ery tyl and vcm all had low risk levels the corresponding normalised heat map of the ecological risk distribution of the target antibiotics for each season is shown in fig 9 it can be seen that except for vcm in the catchment rivers and cap and sdz in the lake all other target antibiotics had the highest ecological risk in winter therefore more attention should be paid to the control of antibiotic concentrations during winter which has often been overlooked in terms of spatial distribution the total ecological risk of the lake was higher than that of the catchment rivers especially in spring this is mainly due to the melting of ice and snow from catchment rivers into chagan lake as well as the melting of the lake s upper ice sheet in particular the risk of sdz was significantly higher in spring than in other seasons including winter this phenomenon is also closely related to chagan lake fishery production the hi risk map of the 12 target antibiotics in the lake was intuitively characterised by spatial and seasonal distributions fig 10 ecological risk in spring mainly came from the drainage of irrigated areas after melting sampling points ct and jj and the usage of antibiotics in fishery production sampling point l1 in summer the pattern of antibiotic ecological risk was more clearly reflected at locations l1 and s5 which are two important fishery production areas in the lake catchment indicating that the lake ecological risk was seriously stressed by fishery production after the drainage of the irrigation area in autumn the ecological risk showed a downward trend especially for the ecological risk caused by irrigation the whole lake presented a high ecological risk in winter which was affected by higher concentrations of antibiotics in winter hence the ecological risk of the lake is significantly affected by the surrounding agricultural activities and fishery production in the lake catchment and is particularly influenced by the ice covered period in winter thus for ecological risk management and control time sharing and zoning should be carefully planned and performed 3 5 2 hierarchical priority control list of antibiotics in the chagan lake catchment the normalised heat map was based on combining ecological risk assessment and resistance gene data analysis fig 11 the negative influence of antibiotics for ecological environmental health is not only an ecological risk but also results in the generation of args which is the main negative impact with more severe and far reaching consequences bengtsson palme et al 2016 yang et al 2018 a normalised heat map did not show any obvious correlation between the ecological risk and the args of the antibiotics in the lake indicating that a single ecological risk cannot characterise antibiotic contamination according to the args the relative abundances of macrolides tetracycline and vancomycin were high suggesting that the microbial communities in the lake catchment were highly resistant to these antibiotics previous studies have found that the transfer of args takes place both vertically from parents to offspring and horizontally between different populations and communities in microorganisms liu et al 2018 yang et al 2018 these processes also enhance the formation of superbugs which pose critical threats to human and animal health ashbolt et al 2013 pruden et al 2006 antibiotics associated with a high relative abundance of args generally exhibit high lipophilicity these antibiotics did not have very high concentrations in the water but their relative abundance of args was much higher than that of other antibiotics for example the concentration of vcm 0 997 ng l in the chagan lake catchment was much lower than that of amx 164 905 ng l whereas the relative abundance of vcm resistance genes was three times higher than that of axm this indicates that the generation of args is not only completely affected by the concentration of antibiotic exposure but is also closely related to the physical and chemical properties of antibiotics half life and lipophilicity log p were also strongly correlated with the relative abundance of args recently among a large number of emerging contaminants the effective control of antibiotics has become a popular issue raising international concerns bengtsson palme et al 2016 huang et al 2022 yang et al 2018 however considering the large variety of antibiotics their ecotoxicities and potential threats to human health are also very different in most previous studies the priority control list of antibiotics was determined according to their toxicity bioaccumulation persistence and occurrence frequency in the environment huang et al 2022 sousa et al 2018 these studies listed four major classes of 18 antibiotics in the priority control list macrolides quinolones sulfonamides and tetracyclines huang et al 2022 liu et al 2018 however a one size fits all list does not necessarily apply to all the study areas for example in our study quinolones and sulfonamides showed low risks both in terms of ecological risk and relative abundance of args which is related to the antibiotic contamination sources in the chagan lake catchment i e the antibiotic contamination sources mostly used in veterinary activities we believe there is hardly any mention of the vcm in the priority control list which could be due to its low frequency of detection and low predicted pnec of ecological risk 370 8 ug l domenech et al 2009 however because of its long half life and strong lipophilicity it has a very strong effect on the corresponding production of args and is a class of antibiotics worthy of attention in environmental surveillance amx has a high ecological risk but the generation of microbial args is relatively low which is also related to the high ph in the chagan lake catchment amx has high antibacterial activity only under weakly acidic conditions hirte et al 2016 although amx has a low relative abundance of args in the study area its serious potential harm to the ecosystem in the chagan lake catchment cannot be ignored amx is extremely toxic to algae lützhøft et al 1999 these findings suggest that the development of a priority control list for antibiotics should not be a single method that ignores regional characteristics therefore this study integrated the ecological risk and relative abundance of args to establish an hcpl from critical high medium and low antibiotics in the chagan lake catchment tacconelli et al 2017 combining hi with the relative abundance of args the hcpl values were weighted by 50 at each station both hi and relative abundance of args were normalised the hcpl values in the chagan lake catchment area ranged from 0 46 to 0 01 which were categorised further as critical 1 00 0 20 high 0 20 0 10 medium 0 10 0 02 and low 0 02 therefore in the chagan lake catchment β lactam amx and macrolide ery tyl are of critical priority tetracycline tet oxy and vancomycin are of high priority sulfonamides sdz are of medium priority and quinolones cip nor enr and chloramphenicol cap are of low priority those with critical and high tiers should be controlled and prioritised and their use in animal husbandry and aquaculture should be considerably reduced in the future 4 conclusion and outlook in this study the sources occurrence fate and transport of 12 target antibiotics and their potential risks in the chagan lake catchment were explored across four seasons spring summer autumn and winter it was found that the lake and catchment had similar contamination status for most antibiotics all 12 target antibiotics were detected in the study area the highest concentrations of antibiotics occurred in winter mainly because of the slow degradation rate and dissipation of contaminants during the freezing process subsequently we also found that the relative abundance of args for macrolides tetracycline and vancomycin was higher than that of other classes of antibiotics the relative abundance of args was strongly correlated with the half life and lipophilicity of antibiotics therefore the physical and chemical properties of antibiotics should be considered in their control furthermore based on the relative abundance of args and ecological risks the hcpl in the chagan lake catchment area was established the critical priorities should be for β lactam amx and macrolide ery tyl antibiotics with high priorities for tetracycline antibiotics tet oxy and vancomycin medium priority for sulfonamides sdz and low priorities for quinolones cip nor enr and chloramphenicol cap it is recommended that the application and control of antibiotics be strengthened in winter and spring when ice and snow melt in the chagan lake catchment due to the current study limitations we only focused on antibiotics in surface water and the pollution loads were based on the main pollution sources in the chagan lake catchment further studies should explore sediments and other environmental media as well as other pollution sources such as atmospheric deposition sediment release and groundwater intrusion in addition a comprehensive study of args can also be considered in the future args in natural water can be analysed more comprehensively by combining the mixing effects of multiple contaminants including antibiotics moreover a comprehensive modelling approach at the catchment scale is necessary to explore the fate transport and potential risks of antibiotics to elucidate their future patterns influenced by climate and land use changes in the

15236,oxidation pretreatments prior to ultrafiltration are hindered by the need for energy input and sludge disposal herein a simulated sunlight induced natural organic matter nom for peroxymonosulfate pms activation was used as pretreatment to alleviate ultrafiltration membrane fouling caused by nom itself in the songhua river water when light intensity was over 100 mw cm2 the pretreatment removed nom effectively characterized with uv254 dissolved organic carbon doc and maximum fluorescent intensity fmax and improved filtration flux at 200 mw cm2 light intensity and 0 5 mm pms 57 5 of uv254 and 18 5 of doc were removed and humic like fluorescent component was degraded by 84 94 while 60 for protein like substance membrane flux was increased by 94 and reversible and irreversible fouling resistances were reduced by 62 4 and 51 9 respectively both total fouling index tfi and hydraulic irreversible fouling index hifi were moderately correlated with the doc whereas they prominently correlated with the uv254 and the fmaxs of all fluorescence components which could be served as key indicators to predict and control membrane fouling mathematical modeling showed that the pretreatment alleviated the fouling in the membrane pores and cake layer the simulated sunlight induced nom 3nom and e aq could activate pms to form active species which enabled to oxidize high molecular weight mw substances and mineralize low mw compounds in nom as well as hinder their linking with inorganic cations thereby reducing organic and inorganic membrane fouling simultaneously

extensively used in drinking water purification to meet the requirements of high quality drinking water peter varbanets et al 2009 prézélus et al 2021 yu et al 2020 the principal advantages of ultrafiltration over traditional treatment technologies are the complete removal of pathogens stable water quality and small footprint wang et al 2020 nevertheless membrane fouling is a major obstacle to the efficient operation of the ultrafiltration process howe and clark 2002 fouling impacts negatively the permeable flux of the membrane and increases operation and maintenance costs which results in low efficiency and poor economy of ultrafiltration application wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 membrane fouling is unavoidable so pretreatments are usually taken to minimize its adverse effect on water treatment gao et al 2011 peters et al 2021 yu and graham 2015 oxidation pretreatments prior to ultrafiltration are widely applied for the removal of organic substances to resist organic membrane fouling cheng et al 2017b guo et al 2020 lin et al 2013 ma et al 2018 persulfate peroxydisulfate pds or peroxymonosulfate pms a common oxidant is susceptible to activation to generate multiple active

selectivity to oxidize various organic compounds tian et al 2022 yang et al 2015 the pretreatments with persulfate activation are frequently performed to mitigate membrane fouling and improve filtration flux cheng et al 2018 wan et al 2019 when pms is activated with fe2 so4 oxidation and fe3 coagulation together remove substantial organics resulting in increases in the quantity of the produced water and fouling reversibility cheng et al 2017a cheng et al 2017b ultraviolet activated persulfate pre oxidation achieves 58 of nom mineralization and retards 75 of irreversible fouling during ultrafiltration of surface water tian et al 2018 in other studies heat and sunlight 100 mw cm2 1 sun heat can activate pds to degrade organic matter and then achieve recovery of water flux and reduction of transmembrane pressure respectively guo et al 2020 guo et al 2021 despite demonstrating membrane fouling alleviation the need for sludge disposal such as ferric flocs and energy input hinder the deployment of these approaches in large scale applications the nom contains humic substance hs and dissolved organic matter dom both of which are photosensitizers pan et al 2018 wang et al

3dom 3nom chen et al 2009 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 of these intermediates e aq and 3hs 3dom 3nom can serve as activators to activate pms to produce more active species jia et al 2020 reported that activation of pms with irradiated humic acid by visible light degraded both humic acid itself and bisphenol a nie et al 2022 found that 3dom is capable of reacting with pms in a high rate constant approximately 4 108 m 1 s 1 to form so4 importantly nom has been identified as the main foulant that causes membrane fouling in the ultrafiltration treatment of drinking water especially for irreversible fouling howe and clark 2002 lee et al 2004 wu et al 2021 and solar energy is a green and sustainable resource hence it is imperative to investigate the feasibility of sunlight induced nom for pms activation to degrade nom itself and alleviate ultrafiltration membrane fouling this study investigated the simulated sunlight activated pms in nom contained songhua river water as a pretreatment for the ultrafiltration process the impacts of light intensity and pms dosage on nom removal and membrane fouling behavior were discussed the nom removal was determined by organic indicators of uv254 doc and fluorescent components the membrane fouling was evaluated by water flux and fouling reversibility the correlations of organic indicators with fouling indexes were established the mechanism of membrane fouling control was elucidated by analyzing mathematical modeling of membrane fouling mw distribution of nom formation of active species and membrane characterization 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals the surface water was collected from the songhua river in harbin china the raw water taken was pre filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane and stored at 4 c before experiments the main characteristics of the songhua river water were summarized in table s1 potassium peroxymonosulfate khso5 0 5khso4 0 5k2so4 pms

experimental procedures a schematic diagram of the experimental setup was shown in fig s1 the simulated sunlight induced pms activation was adopted to pretreat raw water before membrane filtration the pretreatment experiments were performed in the beaker at 25 c thermostatic water bath the dosages of pms were 0 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 mm respectively the volume of the reaction solution was 500 ml and the solution was stirred throughout the experiment a 300 w xenon lamp with a vis ref filter irradiating wavelength of 320 780 nm fig s2 was used to provide the simulated sunlight which was set above the beaker opening the light intensities were 100 150 200 and 250 mw cm2 on the surface of the reaction solution corresponding to 1 sun 1 5 sun 2 sun and 2 5 sun illumination respectively excess methanol and sodium thiosulfate were added immediately to quench the residual oxidants after collecting water samples methanol was used as a terminator for uv254 detection and sodium thiosulfate was used for other indicators the pretreatment experiments were repeated at least two times and the average values with standard deviations were given in figures the membrane filtration experiments were carried out in a dead end ultrafiltration system fig s1 which consisted of an ultrafiltration cup msc300 shanghai mosu china a data acquisition unit a computer linked to an electronic balance denver usa and a high pressure nitrogen cylinder the new membrane was cleaned by dipping into the methanol water mixture volume ratio in 1 9 for 12 h to remove the organic residue on the membrane surface and in the membrane pores the cleaned ultrafiltration membrane was placed in the ultrafiltration cup horizontally with the filtration layer facing the influent the filtration experiment was operated at a constant trans membrane pressure of 0 05 mpa and the effective filtration area was 38 5 cm2 the permeate flux was calculated with the weight data of the effluent recorded automatically by a data acquisition unit each group of the experiment included the filtration of a 300 ml water sample removal of reversible fouling and filtration of 200 ml milli q water the detailed procedures are described in text s1 the initial membrane flux j 0 measured by milli q water at 0 05 mpa was 132 5 l m2 h after filtration the ultrafiltration membranes were dried naturally for characterization 2 3 membrane fouling assessment the resistance in series model based on darcy law was used to analyze the resistance of membrane fouling the resistance equations were listed in text s1 the correlation of various organic indicators with membrane fouling was evaluated through the fouling index its detailed description was depicted in text s2 four typical mathematical models complete blocking standard blocking intermediate blocking and cake filtration were usually used to analyze the ultrafiltration data and determine the mechanism of membrane fouling the equations of the four models were shown in table s2 2 4 analytical methods the uv254 was determined with a uv vis spectrophotometer t6 persee beijing china the content of doc was measured by using a total organic carbon analyzer multi n c 3100 jena germany the fluorescence properties of water samples were characterized on a fluorescence spectrophotometer f7000 hitachi japan three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem was recorded at the excitation wavelengths of 200 450 nm in 5 nm intervals and emission wavelengths of 250 550 nm in 1 nm intervals raman scatter peaks were eliminated by subtracting the eem of milli q water from the eem of the water sample the parallel factor parafac analysis using matlab r2014a was performed to divide fluorescence peaks into several components stedmon and bro 2008 random assignment initial value test and split half analysis passed to prove that the parafac result was correct the concentration of each component was estimated by the f max derived from the parafac model

foulants were recorded by the energy dispersive x ray edx spectroscopy and attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir spectrum one perkinelmer usa respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 nom removal by pretreatment 3 1 1 removals of uv254 and doc the uv254 and doc content are typical indicators for characterizing nom in surface water fig 1 a d showed the removal results of uv254 and doc of the songhua river water under different light intensities and pms concentrations pms pre oxidation alone hardly removed uv254 and doc in raw water ultrafiltration alone exhibited slight removal for both uv254 and doc fig s3 which was in accordance with previous reports guo et al 2021 shao et al 2017 the slight removal was due to the interception of a small amount of organic matter by ultrafiltration membrane while most organics could pass through the membrane pores this part of the intercepted substance would lead to severe membrane fouling for the simulated sunlight induced pms pretreatment removal efficiencies of uv254 and doc were much improved with the increase in light intensity fig 1a and b the 100 mw cm2 intensity induced pms system revealed limited removals for both uv254 14 2 and doc 1 4 when light intensity was over 100 mw cm2 efficient removals of uv254 and doc were observed the removal efficiencies of uv254 were 40 8 57 5 and 62 9 at light intensity of 150 200 and 250 mw cm2 after 180 min of reaction respectively the removal rate of doc increased from 7 2 to 19 2 as light intensity increased from 150 to 250 mw cm2 rising light intensity might accelerate activation of pms and formation of active species and then enhance degradation of organic matter however enhancement degree of removal efficiencies for both uv254 and doc was insignificant as light intensity increased from 200 to 250 mw cm2 fig 1c and d displayed the effects of pms dosage on uv254 and doc removals direct simulated sunlight irradiation 200 mw cm2 had a slight uv254 removal 8 9 but no doc removal which indicated that simulated sunlight alone failed to remove the nom after 180 min irradiation significantly the removal efficiencies of both uv254 and doc were increased as increasing pms dosage the removal efficiencies of uv254 were 27 9 47 8 57 5 65 6 and 70 8 at pms dosages of 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 mm respectively the removal efficiency of doc increased from 2 1 to 22 3 when concentration of pms was increased from 0 1 to 0 9 mm in contrast the removal efficiency of uv254 exceeded that of doc which implied that the simulated sunlight induced pms activation first destroyed the structure of nom in raw water and then mineralized it into co2 hence a faster decrease of uv254 and a slower reduction of doc occurred supportively previous studies also reported that the pre oxidation was more likely to destroy the unsaturated bonds and aromatic structures of nom than mineralized it because the latter required more energy thus generally leading to the more removal of uv254 relative to doc guo et al 2020 guo et al 2021 tian et al 2018 nevertheless the removal efficiency of doc in our system was lower than that in previous systems this was likely because the induced nom used for pms activation was preferentially degraded while a small proportion of uv light in the simulated sunlight had less reactivity for pms activation nie et al 2022 3 1 2 removal of fluorescent organic matter according to the published literature tian et al 2016 wells et al 2022 xing et al 2018 nom mainly consists of humic like substance and protein like matter that can be reflected by fluorescence eem analysis thus the three dimensional fluorescence eem of sample was recorded to further discuss the characteristic variation of nom the fluorescent spectrum of raw water was shown in fig s4 and three typical components were identified with the parafac analysis all three fluorescent components displayed a bimodal structure with the main and secondary peaks fig s5 component 1 c1 displayed two maximum excitation wavelengths ex at 240 nm and 310 nm and a broad emission wavelength em in the range of 380 430 nm which was assigned to the marine or microbial humic like matter guo et al 2020 shao et al 2014 component 2 c2 ex em 270 360 460 470 nm represented the terrestrially derived humic like substance guo et al 2020 shao et al 2014 component 3 c3 ex em 225 280 310 320 nm was related to the protein like substance derived from biological generation in surface water guo et al 2020 shao et al 2014 the variations in the removal efficiency of fluorescent components were shown in fig 2 the pms oxidation alone could hardly remove the c1 c2 and c3 fig 2a interestingly the sunlight induced pms activation revealed apparent removals for both c1 and c2 components at a light intensity of 100 mw cm2 which implied that 1 sun illumination could display efficient removals for c1 and c2 this was slightly different from the removal results of uv254 and doc low removal of uv254 and no removal of doc at 100 mw cm2 indicating that c1 and c2 humic like substances were more susceptible to degradation in comparison with uv254 and doc similar results were also found in other pre oxidation systems guo et al 2020 guo et al 2021 tian et al 2018 a probable interpretation was that the groups with fluorescent components on humic like matters were preferentially destroyed degraded when light intensity was over 100 mw cm2 excellent removals of c1 and c2 components were found similar to removals of uv254 and doc as light intensity increased from 200 to 250 mw cm2 a slight enhancement of c1 and c2 removals was observed this further showed that more energy input did not remove more organics to some extent efficient removal of c3 was observed at light intensity over 100 mw cm2 the c3 component belonged to protein like substance which was sensitive to solar light the uv part in solar light spectra would destroy their internal structure resulting in denaturation additionally the active species in the solution could degrade protein like components considering that the vis ref filter provided a small amount of uv light irradiation 320 380 nm fig s2 active species might be responsible for removal of c3 as shown in fig 2b 200 mw cm2 2 sun irradiation alone showed the measurable removal of fluorescent components with increased pms dosage the pretreatment became more effective for removing c1 and c2 components most fluorescent matters were degraded within 180 min and removal efficiency gradually reached a plateau in the following reaction when pms was used at a higher dosage 0 5 0 9 mm the difference in removal efficiency was diminished at higher pms dosages in addition regardless of light intensity and pms dosage c2 was the most readily removed component followed by c1 which conformed to the previous conclusion that preferential removal of terrestrial organic substances over microbial matters chen et al 2017 when 0 1 mm pms was added the c3 component was obviously removed and increasing pms dosage clearly boosted c3 removal which supported that the removal of c3 was mainly attributed to the oxidation of active species the final removal efficiencies of c1 and c2 were over 87 and 99 at a pms dosage of 0 9 mm respectively and nearly 72 of c3 was degraded strangely c1 removal efficiency at 0 9 mm pms was lower than that at 0 7 mm pms which might be interpreted with the different initial f max values it is well known that humic like and protein like substances are closely related to membrane fouling which can adhere to the membrane surface or and block the membrane pores leading to a decrease in filtration flux cheng et al 2016 yu et al 2020 zularisam et al 2007 owing to effective removals of humic like and protein like matters it was reasonable to expect that sunlight induced pms pretreatment could mitigate membrane fouling during ultrafiltration treatment of surface water 3 2 membrane fouling control the flux variations during ultrafiltration of raw and pretreated water were presented in fig 3 a and b the membrane flux of the ultrafiltration process of raw water was improved in different levels by pretreatment with different light intensities and pms dosages which implied that sunlight induced pms activation could mitigate membrane fouling the filtration flux of raw water severely declined with a decrease of approximately 0 30 j j0 of the initial flux the final ultrafiltration flux rose from 0 35 to 0 63 with an increase of light intensity from 100 to 250 mw cm2 fig 3a the fluxes were improved by 17 66 94 and 110 respectively in comparison with raw water filtration implying that increase of light intensity alleviated membrane fouling which corresponded with the removal and mineralization results of organic matter fig 3b showed the effect of pms concentration on the flux of the ultrafiltration membrane when light intensity was 200 mw cm2 with the increase in pms content from 0 1 to 0 9 mm the fluxes of the ultrafiltration membrane were improved by 30 to 127 in general increasing the pms amount could improve the membrane flux better nevertheless ultrafiltration flux increased slowly when the pms dosage exceeded 0 5 mm it could be concluded that the simulated sunlight induced pms pretreatment had less effect on improving the membrane flux when pms dosage was greater than 0 5 mm this could be interpreted with the following two reasons on the one hand most of the organic matters which could be excited by the simulated sunlight to activate pms were removed with the addition of 0 5 mm pms fig 1 on the other hand a small amount of ultraviolet light around 320 380 nm in the sunlight spectrum fig s2 did not activate pms effectively nie et al 2022 the effect of pretreatment on the reversibility of membrane fouling during the ultrafiltration process was shown in fig 3c the reversible r r and irreversible r ir fouling resistances of filtration of raw water were 1 63 1012 and 0 52 1012 m 1 respectively sunlight induced pms pretreatments effectively decreased the r r and r ir excepting the system irradiated by 100 mw cm2 our 100 mw cm2 system had similar nom removal compared with the results by guo et al 2021 however it was inconsistent with controlling the fouling resistances resistances reduced in his system which might be ascribed to the difference in filtration condition with light intensity rising from 150 to 250 mw cm2 the r ir decreased from 0 36 1012 to 0 20 1012 m 1 which were 30 7 to 61 5 lower than that of filtration of raw water when the pms dosage increased from 0 1 to 0 9 mm the r ir decreased by 14 7 to 70 5 compared to raw water accordingly the r r reduced by 37 6 to 73 9 from 150 to 250 mw cm2 and 7 6 to 81 4 from 0 1 to 0 9 mm the decreases in fouling resistances were consistent with nom removals furthermore the proportions of r r to r ir decreased with the light intensity and pms dosage indicating that the contribution of sunlight induced pms pretreatment to alleviate reversible fouling was better than irreversible fouling from the actual needs of balancing water quality membrane flux fouling resistance and economy using 200 mw cm2 2 sun irradiation and adding 0 5 mm pms were the optimal conditions for removing organic substances and mitigating membrane fouling 3 3 membrane fouling prediction the nom contributed primarily to the membrane fouling during the ultrafiltration of surface water to better predict and control membrane fouling the correlations between various nom indicators uv254 doc and f max of fluorescent component and membrane fouling indices tfi and hifi were established as shown in fig 4 uv254 had strong positive correlations with both tfi and hifi and the r2 were 0 7949 p 0 0012 and 0 7875 p 0 0014 respectively fig 4a doc showed moderate positive correlations with tfi r2 0 5822 p 0 0168 and hifi r2 0 4738 p 0 0404 fig 4b uv254 had apparent influences on the total fouling and irreversible fouling of the ultrafiltration membrane while doc exhibited limited influences similar results were also found in sunlight 100 mw cm2 heat pds pretreatment system by guo et al 2021 furthermore cheng et al 2016 used pre ozonation for the songhua river water before ultrafiltration and found no significant correlations between doc and both fouling indices tfi and hifi but much rather the uv254 low dosage pre ozonation only transformed high mw components in nom into small mw fragments rather than into co2 and h2o which were more likely to pass through membrane pores resulting in an increase of doc in membrane effluent cheng et al 2016 in terms of control of ultrafiltration membrane fouling the effective removal of uv254 could be considered as a key indicator guo et al 2021 however to meet the quality of membrane effluent it is recommended to consider doc removal although removal of doc in our system was not as high as in other systems doc of ultrafiltration effluent was effectively controlled all the fmaxs of c1 c2 and c3 components were highly correlated with tfi r2 0 8987 0 8903 and 0 7903 respectively and hifi r2 0 9049 0 8027 and 0 8339 respectively fig 4c e by comparison both c1 and c2 had the best correlations with tfi indicating that humic like matter mainly contributed to the total membrane fouling moreover c1 showed a higher correlation with hifi compared to c2 based on the previous study lee et al 2015 for humic matter fluorescence peaks at longer emission wavelengths usually exhibited a more cohesive structure and higher mw hence c1 with a smaller mw was more likely to cause irreversible fouling than c2 the protein like substance c3 was also the main contaminant that caused irreversible membrane fouling however due to its very low content in songhua river water the contribution to irreversible membrane fouling was inferior to c1 in a word the uv254 and the fmaxs of c1 c2 and c3 components were key indicators to predict and control membrane fouling 3 4 mechanism of membrane fouling control 3 4 1 mathematical modeling for membrane fouling process the j j0 curves were fitted with the four classic filtration models to interpret the membrane fouling process and the results were displayed in table 1 the correlation coefficient r 2 of raw water filtration fitted by complete blocking standard blocking intermediate blocking and cake filtration models were 0 8603 0 9960 0 9448 and 0 9923 respectively indicating that there were multiple fouling mechanisms caused by raw water and standard blocking and cake filtration dominated membrane fouling the sunlight induced pms pretreatment changed the membrane fouling process with the increase of light intensity and pms dosage the correlation coefficient r 2 of both standard blocking and cake filtration models decreased slightly while it increased significantly for complete blocking from 0 8603 to 0 9634 and 0 9371 moreover the correlation coefficient r 2 of intermediate blocking did not change significantly the proportions of standard blocking and cake filtration in the membrane fouling were reduced but complete blocking increased these implied that the internal fouling of membrane pores and cake layer fouling were alleviated which was beneficial to reducing membrane fouling resistance and improving membrane flux the sunlight induced pms pretreatment could degrade high mw organics into low mw compounds and mineralize some low mw fractions to control standard blocking and cake filtration fouling xing et al 2018 which was supported by nom removal results and following hpsec chromatograms however some degraded low mw compounds were retained on the membrane pores which contributed to complete blocking xing et al 2018 3 4 2 nom mw variation and generation of active species the mw distributions of nom by pretreatment were detected with hpsec fig 5 a hpsec chromatogram of raw water contained two significant peaks peak a mw distributed in the range of 5 23 kda with a peak value at 8 2 kda and peak c in the range of 250 1100 da with a peak value at 650 da and one minor peak peak b in the range of 2 2 5 kda with a peak value at 3 1 kda according to the research by brezinski and gorczyca 2019 peak a and peak b belong to the humics and peak c was assigned to the low mw acids humics and or building blocks ultrafiltration alone removed the minor peak b of raw water while decreasing the intensity of peak a and peak c slightly the size of membrane pore 100 kda exceeded the size of nom in the songhua river water thus leading to the limited interception of pollutants by ultrafiltration alone compared with raw water mw distributions of water samples by the pretreatment and pretreatment ultrafiltration were changed peak a disappeared and a new and stronger peak d in the low mw range of 1 1 13 6 kda appeared with a peak value at 6 5 kda this was ascribed to the degradation of large mw humics into small ones the intensity of peak c was markedly decreased after the pretreatment indicating that some low mw substances were mineralized there was no difference in the intensity of peak c between pretreatment and pretreatment ultrafiltration while the intensity of peak d was decreased after pretreatment ultrafiltration this indicated that the probability of membrane interception was positively correlated with the concentration of organic substances guo et al 2020 and low concentration of low mw substances could directly pass through the membrane pores overall the pretreatment reduced low mw nom in ultrafiltration effluent effectively to explore the mechanism of nom removal active species derived from the photoinduced activation of pms in raw water were identified by esr with 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrolin n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp as spin trapping agents fig 5b and c fig 5b showed that adding pms into raw water generated very few 1o2 without illumination it is related to the reaction of nom in the river water with pms zhou et al 2017 the direct photolysis of pms can form 1o2 due to the dismutation reaction of so5 huie et al 1989 meanwhile the signals of oh were also observed fig 5c in the irradiated raw water system the 3nom generated by light induced nom can react with dissolved oxygen to produce 1o2 nie et al 2022 additionally all the oh so4 and 1o2 were found in the irradiated raw water pms system apparently these signals were significantly greater than the sums of the signals from the direct photolysis of pms the irradiated raw water and the raw water pms systems this result confirmed that the photo induced nom could trigger pms activation to yield a substantial amount of active species which were involved in the degradation of nom the humics with mw distribution of 5 23 kda in river water fig 5a contained abundant aromatic constituents phenolic groups and quinone groups jia et al 2020 which owned the electron donating and electron transferring capacity respectively aeschbacher et al 2011 roden et al 2010 under sunlight irradiation nom with aromatic constituents phenolic groups could be induced to form hydrated electrons e aq and excited state nom 3nom the hydrated electrons were transferred via the quinone groups of nom to activate pms resulting in the generation of so4 and oh meanwhile pms reacted with 3nom to form so4 or so5 while the latter was responsible for the generation of 1o2 jia et al 2020 nie et al 2022 3 4 3 ultrafiltration membrane characterization a series of characterizations were performed to prove the alleviation of membrane fouling the functional groups of the membrane surface were identified with ftir fig 6 the absorption peaks at 1075 and 1107 cm 1 corresponded to the aromatic ring vibrations in the polyethersulfone membrane guo et al 2020 wang et al 2015 the 1150 cm 1 and 1297 1322 cm 1 doublet resulted from the symmetric and antisymmetric o s o stretching vibrations of the sulfone group respectively guo et al 2020 wang et al 2015 three other strong absorption peaks around 915 1031 and 3380 cm 1 were found in the fouled membrane the broad peak around 3380 cm 1 was associated with the stretching vibration of o h bonds li et al 2016 the peaks at 915 and 1031 cm 1 were assigned to si o or c o c bonds which were likely to be the silicon precipitate or organic substances in the songhua river water gamage and chellam 2014 guo et al 2020 the fouling peak intensities decreased obviously with the pretreatment and the ftir spectrum of the membrane fouled by the pretreated water was more similar to that of the virgin membrane relative to the membrane fouled by raw water sunlight induced nom pms pretreatment could reduce the intercepted pollutants on the membrane surface fig 7 a c exhibited the surface morphology of virgin and fouled membranes the surface of the virgin membrane was clean and smooth and membrane pores were evenly distributed after filtration of raw water the membrane surface was covered with a dense and large nubby fouling layer which blocked membrane pores completely the membrane pores which were filtrated with pretreated water were still blocked completely nevertheless the size of the foulants slightly decreased and more gaps could be discerned on the fouling layer in the cross sectional images of the fouled membranes a fouling cake layer with a thickness of approximately 0 74 μm could be observed on the ultrafiltration membrane after filtration of raw water a thin fouling cake layer 0 35 μm appeared on the membrane surface when raw water was treated by the simulated sunlight pms pre oxidation further edx characterization detected fourteen elements on the fouled membranes including c o s na mg al si p n cl k ca mn and fe as shown in fig s6 variations of c o and n elements indicated that organic fouling occurred during the ultrafiltration process in addition inorganic precipitation also appeared on the membrane surface after the pretreatment the organic fouling and inorganic precipitation were obviously reduced previous studies had reported that metal cations like ca2 could bond humic acid molecules via a bridging effect to generate larger molecules that promoted the formation of membrane fouling li et al 2020 tian et al 2013 wang et al 2015 additionally k would induce the electrostatic shielding effect to compress humic acid molecules resulting in the aggravation of recalcitrant irreversible fouling li et al 2020 the hpsec results showed that humics was the main component of nom in the songhua river water the sunlight induced nom pms pretreatment could play the de complexation effect by destroying the structure of humics and inhibiting the linking of metal cations to humics hence reducing the deposition of metal cations on the membrane surface afm images showed the surface roughness and topography of membranes fig 7d the bright areas peaks and dark areas valleys on the surface of the virgin membrane were evenly distributed in contrast the size of bright and dark areas and the distribution of peaks and valleys of the used membranes had been changed significantly implying that foulants covered membrane surface obviously the fluctuation change of peaks and valleys on the membrane fouled by raw water exceeded that of the membrane fouled by pretreated water which further supported the size of the pollutants observed by the sem because of the interception of the large molecules of humic acid the metal cations linked humic acid and the inorganic precipitate membrane filtration of raw water exhibited a rough and uneven surface with a surface roughness of rq 52 8 nm which was higher than that of membrane fouled by pretreated water rq 26 4 nm and virgin membrane rq 12 2 nm after the destruction of high mw substances the mineralization of low mw fractions and the de complexation effect by sunlight induced nom pms pre oxidation less nom and inorganic components were retained on the membrane surface resulting in a very thin cake fouling layer and a low surface roughness the results verified that sunlight induced nom pms pretreatment not only controlled the organic fouling of the ultrafiltration membrane but also reduced its inorganic fouling remarkably 4 conclusions in summary the photo induced activation of pms in sunlit nom contained natural surface water was conducted as pretreatment before ultrafiltration to remove nom and control membrane fouling with increased light intensity 100 250 mw cm2 and pms dosage 0 1 0 9 mm the pretreatment enabled to remove nom in the songhua river water decrease membrane fouling and improve water flux effectively the conditions of 200 mw cm2 0 5 mm pms removed 57 5 18 5 84 94 and 60 for uv254 doc humic like substance and protein like component respectively furthermore the pretreatment improved water flux by 94 and reduced r r and r ir by 62 4 and 51 9 respectively the uv254 and the fmaxs of three fluorescence components could be used as key indexes to predict and control membrane fouling due to their significant correlations with tfi and hifi the pretreatment alleviated the dominant standard blocking and cake layer blocking the simulated sunlight induced nom 3nom and e aq were capable of activating pms to produce so4 oh and 1o2 they destroyed high mw organics mineralized low mw compounds and hindered organics linking with inorganic cations thereby reducing both organic and inorganic membrane fouling which showed a thin cake layer and a low surface roughness this study provides new insights for coupling solar energy and membrane filtration in water treatment it raises the question that the simulated sunlight resource consumes electric energy based on our research we will endeavor to further develop a decentralized potable water treatment device by using a sunlight focusing reactor in an actual environment instead of the simulated sunlight

15236,oxidation pretreatments prior to ultrafiltration are hindered by the need for energy input and sludge disposal herein a simulated sunlight induced natural organic matter nom for peroxymonosulfate pms activation was used as pretreatment to alleviate ultrafiltration membrane fouling caused by nom itself in the songhua river water when light intensity was over 100 mw cm2 the pretreatment removed nom effectively characterized with uv254 dissolved organic carbon doc and maximum fluorescent intensity fmax and improved filtration flux at 200 mw cm2 light intensity and 0 5 mm pms 57 5 of uv254 and 18 5 of doc were removed and humic like fluorescent component was degraded by 84 94 while 60 for protein like substance membrane flux was increased by 94 and reversible and irreversible fouling resistances were reduced by 62 4 and 51 9 respectively both total fouling index tfi and hydraulic irreversible fouling index hifi were moderately correlated with the doc whereas they prominently correlated with the uv254 and the fmaxs of all fluorescence components which could be served as key indicators to predict and control membrane fouling mathematical modeling showed that the pretreatment alleviated the fouling in the membrane pores and cake layer the simulated sunlight induced nom 3nom and e aq could activate pms to form active species which enabled to oxidize high molecular weight mw substances and mineralize low mw compounds in nom as well as hinder their linking with inorganic cations thereby reducing organic and inorganic membrane fouling simultaneously

sunlight ultrafiltration membrane fouling natural organic matter surface water treatment data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction ultrafiltration is extensively used in drinking water purification to meet the requirements of high quality drinking water peter varbanets et al 2009 prézélus et al 2021 yu et al 2020 the principal advantages of ultrafiltration over traditional treatment technologies are the complete removal of pathogens stable water quality and small footprint wang et al 2020 nevertheless membrane fouling is a major obstacle to the efficient operation of the ultrafiltration process howe and clark 2002 fouling impacts negatively the permeable flux of the membrane and increases operation and maintenance costs which results in low efficiency and poor economy of ultrafiltration application wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 membrane fouling is unavoidable so pretreatments are usually taken to minimize its adverse effect on water treatment gao et al 2011 peters et al 2021 yu and graham 2015 oxidation pretreatments prior to ultrafiltration are widely applied for the removal of organic substances to resist organic membrane fouling cheng et al 2017b guo et al 2020 lin et al 2013 ma et al 2018 persulfate peroxydisulfate pds or peroxymonosulfate pms a common oxidant is susceptible to activation to generate multiple active species including sulfate radicals so4 hydroxyl radicals oh or singlet oxygen 1o2 gao et al 2018 especially so4 and oh with high oxidation potentials 2 5 3 1 and 1 9 2 7 v respectively enable non selectivity to oxidize various organic compounds tian et al 2022 yang et al 2015 the pretreatments with persulfate activation are frequently performed to mitigate membrane fouling and improve filtration flux cheng et al 2018 wan et al 2019 when pms is activated with fe2 so4 oxidation and fe3 coagulation together remove substantial organics resulting in increases in the quantity of the produced water and fouling reversibility cheng et al 2017a cheng et al 2017b ultraviolet activated persulfate pre oxidation achieves 58 of nom mineralization and retards 75 of irreversible fouling during ultrafiltration of surface water tian et al 2018 in other studies heat and sunlight 100 mw cm2 1 sun heat can activate pds to degrade organic matter and then achieve recovery of water flux and reduction of transmembrane pressure respectively guo et al 2020 guo et al 2021 despite demonstrating membrane fouling alleviation the need for sludge disposal such as ferric flocs and energy input hinder the deployment of these approaches in large scale applications the nom contains humic substance hs and dissolved organic matter dom both of which are photosensitizers pan et al 2018 wang et al 2018 studies reported that direct photolysis of them in water leads to the generation of reactive intermediates including oh 1o2 hydrated electrons e aq and triplet excited state of hs dom nom 3hs 3dom 3nom chen et al 2009 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 of these intermediates e aq and 3hs 3dom 3nom can serve as activators to activate pms to produce more active species jia et al 2020 reported that activation of pms with irradiated humic acid by visible light degraded both humic acid itself and bisphenol a nie et al 2022 found that 3dom is capable of reacting with pms in a high rate constant approximately 4 108 m 1 s 1 to form so4 importantly nom has been identified as the main foulant that causes membrane fouling in the ultrafiltration treatment of drinking water especially for irreversible fouling howe and clark 2002 lee et al 2004 wu et al 2021 and solar energy is a green and sustainable resource hence it is imperative to investigate the feasibility of sunlight induced nom for pms activation to degrade nom itself and alleviate ultrafiltration membrane fouling this study investigated the simulated sunlight activated pms in nom contained songhua river water as a pretreatment for the ultrafiltration process the impacts of light intensity and pms dosage on nom removal and membrane fouling behavior were discussed the nom removal was determined by organic indicators of uv254 doc and fluorescent components the membrane fouling was evaluated by water flux and fouling reversibility the correlations of organic indicators with fouling indexes were established the mechanism of membrane fouling control was elucidated by analyzing mathematical modeling of membrane fouling mw distribution of nom formation of active species and membrane characterization 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals the surface water was collected from the songhua river in harbin china the raw water taken was pre filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane and stored at 4 c before experiments the main characteristics of the songhua river water were summarized in table s1 potassium peroxymonosulfate khso5 0 5khso4 0 5k2so4 pms was purchased from sigma aldrich usa the commercial flat sheet polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membranes with an mw cutoff of 100 kda were supplied by shanghai mosu science equipment co ltd 2 2 experimental procedures a schematic diagram of the experimental setup was shown in fig s1 the simulated sunlight induced pms activation was adopted to pretreat raw water before membrane filtration the pretreatment experiments were performed in the beaker at 25 c thermostatic water bath the dosages of pms were 0 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 mm respectively the volume of the reaction solution was 500 ml and the solution was stirred throughout the experiment a 300 w xenon lamp with a vis ref filter irradiating wavelength of 320 780 nm fig s2 was used to provide the simulated sunlight which was set above the beaker opening the light intensities were 100 150 200 and 250 mw cm2 on the surface of the reaction solution corresponding to 1 sun 1 5 sun 2 sun and 2 5 sun illumination respectively excess methanol and sodium thiosulfate were added immediately to quench the residual oxidants after collecting water samples methanol was used as a terminator for uv254 detection and sodium thiosulfate was used for other indicators the pretreatment experiments were repeated at least two times and the average values with standard deviations were given in figures the membrane filtration experiments were carried out in a dead end ultrafiltration system fig s1 which consisted of an ultrafiltration cup msc300 shanghai mosu china a data acquisition unit a computer linked to an electronic balance denver usa and a high pressure nitrogen cylinder the new membrane was cleaned by dipping into the methanol water mixture volume ratio in 1 9 for 12 h to remove the organic residue on the membrane surface and in the membrane pores the cleaned ultrafiltration membrane was placed in the ultrafiltration cup horizontally with the filtration layer facing the influent the filtration experiment was operated at a constant trans membrane pressure of 0 05 mpa and the effective filtration area was 38 5 cm2 the permeate flux was calculated with the weight data of the effluent recorded automatically by a data acquisition unit each group of the experiment included the filtration of a 300 ml water sample removal of reversible fouling and filtration of 200 ml milli q water the detailed procedures are described in text s1 the initial membrane flux j 0 measured by milli q water at 0 05 mpa was 132 5 l m2 h after filtration the ultrafiltration membranes were dried naturally for characterization 2 3 membrane fouling assessment the resistance in series model based on darcy law was used to analyze the resistance of membrane fouling the resistance equations were listed in text s1 the correlation of various organic indicators with membrane fouling was evaluated through the fouling index its detailed description was depicted in text s2 four typical mathematical models complete blocking standard blocking intermediate blocking and cake filtration were usually used to analyze the ultrafiltration data and determine the mechanism of membrane fouling the equations of the four models were shown in table s2 2 4 analytical methods the uv254 was determined with a uv vis spectrophotometer t6 persee beijing china the content of doc was measured by using a total organic carbon analyzer multi n c 3100 jena germany the fluorescence properties of water samples were characterized on a fluorescence spectrophotometer f7000 hitachi japan three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem was recorded at the excitation wavelengths of 200 450 nm in 5 nm intervals and emission wavelengths of 250 550 nm in 1 nm intervals raman scatter peaks were eliminated by subtracting the eem of milli q water from the eem of the water sample the parallel factor parafac analysis using matlab r2014a was performed to divide fluorescence peaks into several components stedmon and bro 2008 random assignment initial value test and split half analysis passed to prove that the parafac result was correct the concentration of each component was estimated by the f max derived from the parafac model the active species were examined using an electron spin resonance spectrometer esr bruker a200 the mw distribution of nom in water sample was detected by high performance size exclusion chromatography

electron microscope sem su8010 hitachi japan atomic force microscopy afm icon bruker was utilized to observe the surface roughness of the membrane the chemical composition and functional groups of foulants were recorded by the energy dispersive x ray edx spectroscopy and attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir spectrum one perkinelmer usa respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 nom removal by pretreatment 3 1 1 removals of uv254 and doc the uv254 and doc content are typical indicators for characterizing nom in surface water fig 1 a d showed the removal results of uv254 and doc of the songhua river water under different light intensities and pms concentrations pms pre oxidation alone hardly removed uv254 and doc in raw water ultrafiltration alone exhibited slight removal for both uv254 and doc fig s3 which was in accordance with previous reports guo et al 2021 shao et al 2017 the slight removal was due to the interception of a small amount of organic matter by ultrafiltration membrane while most organics could pass through the membrane pores this part of the intercepted substance would lead to severe membrane fouling for the simulated sunlight induced pms pretreatment removal efficiencies of uv254 and doc were much improved with the increase in light intensity fig 1a and b the 100 mw cm2 intensity induced pms system revealed limited removals for both uv254 14 2 and doc 1 4 when light intensity was over 100 mw cm2 efficient removals of uv254 and doc were observed the removal efficiencies of uv254 were 40 8 57 5 and 62 9 at light intensity of 150 200 and 250 mw cm2 after 180 min of reaction respectively the removal rate of doc increased from 7 2 to 19 2 as light intensity increased from 150 to 250 mw cm2 rising light intensity might accelerate activation of pms and formation of active species and then enhance degradation of organic matter however enhancement degree of removal efficiencies for both uv254 and doc was insignificant as light intensity increased from 200 to 250 mw cm2 fig 1c and d displayed the effects of pms dosage on uv254 and doc removals direct simulated sunlight irradiation 200 mw cm2 had a slight uv254 removal 8 9 but no doc removal which indicated that simulated sunlight alone failed to remove the nom after 180 min irradiation significantly the removal efficiencies of both uv254 and doc were increased as increasing pms dosage the removal efficiencies of uv254 were 27 9 47 8 57 5 65 6 and 70 8 at pms dosages of 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 mm respectively the removal efficiency of doc increased from 2 1 to 22 3 when concentration of pms was increased from 0 1 to 0 9 mm in contrast the removal efficiency of uv254 exceeded that of doc which implied that the simulated sunlight induced pms activation first destroyed the structure of nom in raw water and then mineralized it into co2 hence a faster decrease of uv254 and a slower reduction of doc occurred supportively previous studies also reported that the pre oxidation was more likely to destroy the unsaturated bonds and aromatic structures of nom than mineralized it because the latter required more energy thus generally leading to the more removal of uv254 relative to doc guo et al 2020 guo et al 2021 tian et al 2018 nevertheless the removal efficiency of doc in our system was lower than that in previous systems this was likely because the induced nom used for pms activation was preferentially degraded while a small proportion of uv light in the simulated sunlight had less reactivity for pms activation nie et al 2022 3 1 2 removal of fluorescent organic matter according to the published literature tian et al 2016 wells et al 2022 xing et al 2018 nom mainly consists of humic like substance and protein like matter that can be reflected by fluorescence eem analysis thus the three dimensional fluorescence eem of sample was recorded to further discuss the characteristic variation of nom the fluorescent spectrum of raw water was shown in fig s4 and three typical components were identified with the parafac analysis all three fluorescent components displayed a bimodal structure with the main and secondary peaks fig s5 component 1 c1 displayed two maximum excitation wavelengths ex at 240 nm and 310 nm and a broad emission wavelength em in the range of 380 430 nm which was assigned to the marine or microbial humic like matter guo et al 2020 shao et al 2014 component 2 c2 ex em 270 360 460 470 nm represented the terrestrially derived humic like substance guo et al 2020 shao et al 2014 component 3 c3 ex em 225 280 310 320 nm was related to the protein like substance derived from biological generation in surface water guo et al 2020 shao et al 2014 the variations in the removal efficiency of fluorescent components were shown in fig 2 the pms oxidation alone could hardly remove the c1 c2 and c3 fig 2a interestingly the sunlight induced pms activation revealed apparent removals for both c1 and c2 components at a light intensity of 100 mw cm2 which implied that 1 sun illumination could display efficient removals for c1 and c2 this was slightly different from the removal results of uv254 and doc low removal of uv254 and no removal of doc at 100 mw cm2 indicating that c1 and c2 humic like substances were more susceptible to degradation in comparison with uv254 and doc similar results were also found in other pre oxidation systems guo et al 2020 guo et al 2021 tian et al 2018 a probable interpretation was that the groups with fluorescent components on humic like matters were preferentially destroyed degraded when light intensity was over 100 mw cm2 excellent removals of c1 and c2 components were found similar to removals of uv254 and doc as light intensity increased from 200 to 250 mw cm2 a slight enhancement of c1 and c2 removals was observed this further showed that more energy input did not remove more organics to some extent efficient removal of c3 was observed at light intensity over 100 mw cm2 the c3 component belonged to protein like substance which was sensitive to solar light the uv part in solar light spectra would destroy their internal structure resulting in denaturation additionally the active species in the solution could degrade protein like components considering that the vis ref filter provided a small amount of uv light irradiation 320 380 nm fig s2 active species might be responsible for removal of c3 as shown in fig 2b 200 mw cm2 2 sun irradiation alone showed the measurable removal of fluorescent components with increased pms dosage the pretreatment became more effective for removing c1 and c2 components most fluorescent matters were degraded within 180 min and removal efficiency gradually reached a plateau in the following reaction when pms was used at a higher dosage 0 5 0 9 mm the difference in removal efficiency was diminished at higher pms dosages in addition regardless of light intensity and pms dosage c2 was the most readily removed component followed by c1 which conformed to the previous conclusion that preferential removal of terrestrial organic substances over microbial matters chen et al 2017 when 0 1 mm pms was added the c3 component was obviously removed and increasing pms dosage clearly boosted c3 removal which supported that the removal of c3 was mainly attributed to the oxidation of active species the final removal efficiencies of c1 and c2 were over 87 and 99 at a pms dosage of 0 9 mm respectively and nearly 72 of c3 was degraded strangely c1 removal efficiency at 0 9 mm pms was lower than that at 0 7 mm pms which might be interpreted with the different initial f max values it is well known that humic like and protein like substances are closely related to membrane fouling which can adhere to the membrane surface or and block the membrane pores leading to a decrease in filtration flux cheng et al 2016 yu et al 2020 zularisam et al 2007 owing to effective removals of humic like and protein like matters it was reasonable to expect that sunlight induced pms pretreatment could mitigate membrane fouling during ultrafiltration treatment of surface water 3 2 membrane fouling control the flux variations during ultrafiltration of raw and pretreated water were presented in fig 3 a and b the membrane flux of the ultrafiltration process of raw water was improved in different levels by pretreatment with different light intensities and pms dosages which implied that sunlight induced pms activation could mitigate membrane fouling the filtration flux of raw water severely declined with a decrease of approximately 0 30 j j0 of the initial flux the final ultrafiltration flux rose from 0 35 to 0 63 with an increase of light intensity from 100 to 250 mw cm2 fig 3a the fluxes were improved by 17 66 94 and 110 respectively in comparison with raw water filtration implying that increase of light intensity alleviated membrane fouling which corresponded with the removal and mineralization results of organic matter fig 3b showed the effect of pms concentration on the flux of the ultrafiltration membrane when light intensity was 200 mw cm2 with the increase in pms content from 0 1 to 0 9 mm the fluxes of the ultrafiltration membrane were improved by 30 to 127 in general increasing the pms amount could improve the membrane flux better nevertheless ultrafiltration flux increased slowly when the pms dosage exceeded 0 5 mm it could be concluded that the simulated sunlight induced pms pretreatment had less effect on improving the membrane flux when pms dosage was greater than 0 5 mm this could be interpreted with the following two reasons on the one hand most of the organic matters which could be excited by the simulated sunlight to activate pms were removed with the addition of 0 5 mm pms fig 1 on the other hand a small amount of ultraviolet light around 320 380 nm in the sunlight spectrum fig s2 did not activate pms effectively nie et al 2022 the effect of pretreatment on the reversibility of membrane fouling during the ultrafiltration process was shown in fig 3c the reversible r r and irreversible r ir fouling resistances of filtration of raw water were 1 63 1012 and 0 52 1012 m 1 respectively sunlight induced pms pretreatments effectively decreased the r r and r ir excepting the system irradiated by 100 mw cm2 our 100 mw cm2 system had similar nom removal compared with the results by guo et al 2021 however it was inconsistent with controlling the fouling resistances resistances reduced in his system which might be ascribed to the difference in filtration condition with light intensity rising from 150 to 250 mw cm2 the r ir decreased from 0 36 1012 to 0 20 1012 m 1 which were 30 7 to 61 5 lower than that of filtration of raw water when the pms dosage increased from 0 1 to 0 9 mm the r ir decreased by 14 7 to 70 5 compared to raw water accordingly the r r reduced by 37 6 to 73 9 from 150 to 250 mw cm2 and 7 6 to 81 4 from 0 1 to 0 9 mm the decreases in fouling resistances were consistent with nom removals furthermore the proportions of r r to r ir decreased with the light intensity and pms dosage indicating that the contribution of sunlight induced pms pretreatment to alleviate reversible fouling was better than irreversible fouling from the actual needs of balancing water quality membrane flux fouling resistance and economy using 200 mw cm2 2 sun irradiation and adding 0 5 mm pms were the optimal conditions for removing organic substances and mitigating membrane fouling 3 3 membrane fouling prediction the nom contributed primarily to the membrane fouling during the ultrafiltration of surface water to better predict and control membrane fouling the correlations between various nom indicators uv254 doc and f max of fluorescent component and membrane fouling indices tfi and hifi were established as shown in fig 4 uv254 had strong positive correlations with both tfi and hifi and the r2 were 0 7949 p 0 0012 and 0 7875 p 0 0014 respectively fig 4a doc showed moderate positive correlations with tfi r2 0 5822 p 0 0168 and hifi r2 0 4738 p 0 0404 fig 4b uv254 had apparent influences on the total fouling and irreversible fouling of the ultrafiltration membrane while doc exhibited limited influences similar results were also found in sunlight 100 mw cm2 heat pds pretreatment system by guo et al 2021 furthermore cheng et al 2016 used pre ozonation for the songhua river water before ultrafiltration and found no significant correlations between doc and both fouling indices tfi and hifi but much rather the uv254 low dosage pre ozonation only transformed high mw components in nom into small mw fragments rather than into co2 and h2o which were more likely to pass through membrane pores resulting in an increase of doc in membrane effluent cheng et al 2016 in terms of control of ultrafiltration membrane fouling the effective removal of uv254 could be considered as a key indicator guo et al 2021 however to meet the quality of membrane effluent it is recommended to consider doc removal although removal of doc in our system was not as high as in other systems doc of ultrafiltration effluent was effectively controlled all the fmaxs of c1 c2 and c3 components were highly correlated with tfi r2 0 8987 0 8903 and 0 7903 respectively and hifi r2 0 9049 0 8027 and 0 8339 respectively fig 4c e by comparison both c1 and c2 had the best correlations with tfi indicating that humic like matter mainly contributed to the total membrane fouling moreover c1 showed a higher correlation with hifi compared to c2 based on the previous study lee et al 2015 for humic matter fluorescence peaks at longer emission wavelengths usually exhibited a more cohesive structure and higher mw hence c1 with a smaller mw was more likely to cause irreversible fouling than c2 the protein like substance c3 was also the main contaminant that caused irreversible membrane fouling however due to its very low content in songhua river water the contribution to irreversible membrane fouling was inferior to c1 in a word the uv254 and the fmaxs of c1 c2 and c3 components were key indicators to predict and control membrane fouling 3 4 mechanism of membrane fouling control 3 4 1 mathematical modeling for membrane fouling process the j j0 curves were fitted with the four classic filtration models to interpret the membrane fouling process and the results were displayed in table 1 the correlation coefficient r 2 of raw water filtration fitted by complete blocking standard blocking intermediate blocking and cake filtration models were 0 8603 0 9960 0 9448 and 0 9923 respectively indicating that there were multiple fouling mechanisms caused by raw water and standard blocking and cake filtration dominated membrane fouling the sunlight induced pms pretreatment changed the membrane fouling process with the increase of light intensity and pms dosage the correlation coefficient r 2 of both standard blocking and cake filtration models decreased slightly while it increased significantly for complete blocking from 0 8603 to 0 9634 and 0 9371 moreover the correlation coefficient r 2 of intermediate blocking did not change significantly the proportions of standard blocking and cake filtration in the membrane fouling were reduced but complete blocking increased these implied that the internal fouling of membrane pores and cake layer fouling were alleviated which was beneficial to reducing membrane fouling resistance and improving membrane flux the sunlight induced pms pretreatment could degrade high mw organics into low mw compounds and mineralize some low mw fractions to control standard blocking and cake filtration fouling xing et al 2018 which was supported by nom removal results and following hpsec chromatograms however some degraded low mw compounds were retained on the membrane pores which contributed to complete blocking xing et al 2018 3 4 2 nom mw variation and generation of active species the mw distributions of nom by pretreatment were detected with hpsec fig 5 a hpsec chromatogram of raw water contained two significant peaks peak a mw distributed in the range of 5 23 kda with a peak value at 8 2 kda and peak c in the range of 250 1100 da with a peak value at 650 da and one minor peak peak b in the range of 2 2 5 kda with a peak value at 3 1 kda according to the research by brezinski and gorczyca 2019 peak a and peak b belong to the humics and peak c was assigned to the low mw acids humics and or building blocks ultrafiltration alone removed the minor peak b of raw water while decreasing the intensity of peak a and peak c slightly the size of membrane pore 100 kda exceeded the size of nom in the songhua river water thus leading to the limited interception of pollutants by ultrafiltration alone compared with raw water mw distributions of water samples by the pretreatment and pretreatment ultrafiltration were changed peak a disappeared and a new and stronger peak d in the low mw range of 1 1 13 6 kda appeared with a peak value at 6 5 kda this was ascribed to the degradation of large mw humics into small ones the intensity of peak c was markedly decreased after the pretreatment indicating that some low mw substances were mineralized there was no difference in the intensity of peak c between pretreatment and pretreatment ultrafiltration while the intensity of peak d was decreased after pretreatment ultrafiltration this indicated that the probability of membrane interception was positively correlated with the concentration of organic substances guo et al 2020 and low concentration of low mw substances could directly pass through the membrane pores overall the pretreatment reduced low mw nom in ultrafiltration effluent effectively to explore the mechanism of nom removal active species derived from the photoinduced activation of pms in raw water were identified by esr with 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrolin n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp as spin trapping agents fig 5b and c fig 5b showed that adding pms into raw water generated very few 1o2 without illumination it is related to the reaction of nom in the river water with pms zhou et al 2017 the direct photolysis of pms can form 1o2 due to the dismutation reaction of so5 huie et al 1989 meanwhile the signals of oh were also observed fig 5c in the irradiated raw water system the 3nom generated by light induced nom can react with dissolved oxygen to produce 1o2 nie et al 2022 additionally all the oh so4 and 1o2 were found in the irradiated raw water pms system apparently these signals were significantly greater than the sums of the signals from the direct photolysis of pms the irradiated raw water and the raw water pms systems this result confirmed that the photo induced nom could trigger pms activation to yield a substantial amount of active species which were involved in the degradation of nom the humics with mw distribution of 5 23 kda in river water fig 5a contained abundant aromatic constituents phenolic groups and quinone groups jia et al 2020 which owned the electron donating and electron transferring capacity respectively aeschbacher et al 2011 roden et al 2010 under sunlight irradiation nom with aromatic constituents phenolic groups could be induced to form hydrated electrons e aq and excited state nom 3nom the hydrated electrons were transferred via the quinone groups of nom to activate pms resulting in the generation of so4 and oh meanwhile pms reacted with 3nom to form so4 or so5 while the latter was responsible for the generation of 1o2 jia et al 2020 nie et al 2022 3 4 3 ultrafiltration membrane characterization a series of characterizations were performed to prove the alleviation of membrane fouling the functional groups of the membrane surface were identified with ftir fig 6 the absorption peaks at 1075 and 1107 cm 1 corresponded to the aromatic ring vibrations in the polyethersulfone membrane guo et al 2020 wang et al 2015 the 1150 cm 1 and 1297 1322 cm 1 doublet resulted from the symmetric and antisymmetric o s o stretching vibrations of the sulfone group respectively guo et al 2020 wang et al 2015 three other strong absorption peaks around 915 1031 and 3380 cm 1 were found in the fouled membrane the broad peak around 3380 cm 1 was associated with the stretching vibration of o h bonds li et al 2016 the peaks at 915 and 1031 cm 1 were assigned to si o or c o c bonds which were likely to be the silicon precipitate or organic substances in the songhua river water gamage and chellam 2014 guo et al 2020 the fouling peak intensities decreased obviously with the pretreatment and the ftir spectrum of the membrane fouled by the pretreated water was more similar to that of the virgin membrane relative to the membrane fouled by raw water sunlight induced nom pms pretreatment could reduce the intercepted pollutants on the membrane surface fig 7 a c exhibited the surface morphology of virgin and fouled membranes the surface of the virgin membrane was clean and smooth and membrane pores were evenly distributed after filtration of raw water the membrane surface was covered with a dense and large nubby fouling layer which blocked membrane pores completely the membrane pores which were filtrated with pretreated water were still blocked completely nevertheless the size of the foulants slightly decreased and more gaps could be discerned on the fouling layer in the cross sectional images of the fouled membranes a fouling cake layer with a thickness of approximately 0 74 μm could be observed on the ultrafiltration membrane after filtration of raw water a thin fouling cake layer 0 35 μm appeared on the membrane surface when raw water was treated by the simulated sunlight pms pre oxidation further edx characterization detected fourteen elements on the fouled membranes including c o s na mg al si p n cl k ca mn and fe as shown in fig s6 variations of c o and n elements indicated that organic fouling occurred during the ultrafiltration process in addition inorganic precipitation also appeared on the membrane surface after the pretreatment the organic fouling and inorganic precipitation were obviously reduced previous studies had reported that metal cations like ca2 could bond humic acid molecules via a bridging effect to generate larger molecules that promoted the formation of membrane fouling li et al 2020 tian et al 2013 wang et al 2015 additionally k would induce the electrostatic shielding effect to compress humic acid molecules resulting in the aggravation of recalcitrant irreversible fouling li et al 2020 the hpsec results showed that humics was the main component of nom in the songhua river water the sunlight induced nom pms pretreatment could play the de complexation effect by destroying the structure of humics and inhibiting the linking of metal cations to humics hence reducing the deposition of metal cations on the membrane surface afm images showed the surface roughness and topography of membranes fig 7d the bright areas peaks and dark areas valleys on the surface of the virgin membrane were evenly distributed in contrast the size of bright and dark areas and the distribution of peaks and valleys of the used membranes had been changed significantly implying that foulants covered membrane surface obviously the fluctuation change of peaks and valleys on the membrane fouled by raw water exceeded that of the membrane fouled by pretreated water which further supported the size of the pollutants observed by the sem because of the interception of the large molecules of humic acid the metal cations linked humic acid and the inorganic precipitate membrane filtration of raw water exhibited a rough and uneven surface with a surface roughness of rq 52 8 nm which was higher than that of membrane fouled by pretreated water rq 26 4 nm and virgin membrane rq 12 2 nm after the destruction of high mw substances the mineralization of low mw fractions and the de complexation effect by sunlight induced nom pms pre oxidation less nom and inorganic components were retained on the membrane surface resulting in a very thin cake fouling layer and a low surface roughness the results verified that sunlight induced nom pms pretreatment not only controlled the organic fouling of the ultrafiltration membrane but also reduced its inorganic fouling remarkably 4 conclusions in summary the photo induced activation of pms in sunlit nom contained natural surface water was conducted as pretreatment before ultrafiltration to remove nom and control membrane fouling with increased light intensity 100 250 mw cm2 and pms dosage 0 1 0 9 mm the pretreatment enabled to remove nom in the songhua river water decrease membrane fouling and improve water flux effectively the conditions of 200 mw cm2 0 5 mm pms removed 57 5 18 5 84 94 and 60 for uv254 doc humic like substance and protein like component respectively furthermore the pretreatment improved water flux by 94 and reduced r r and r ir by 62 4 and 51 9 respectively the uv254 and the fmaxs of three fluorescence components could be used as key indexes to predict and control membrane fouling due to their significant correlations with tfi and hifi the pretreatment alleviated the dominant standard blocking and cake layer blocking the simulated sunlight induced nom 3nom and e aq were capable of activating pms to produce so4 oh and 1o2 they destroyed high mw organics mineralized low mw compounds and hindered organics linking with inorganic cations thereby reducing both organic and inorganic membrane fouling which showed a thin cake layer and a low surface roughness this study provides new insights for coupling solar energy and membrane filtration in water treatment it raises the question that the simulated sunlight resource consumes electric energy based on our research we will endeavor to further develop a decentralized potable water treatment device by using a sunlight focusing reactor in an actual environment instead of the simulated sunlight

15237,effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtps has been regarded as one of the major contributors of nanoplastics nps in the environment improving the performance of rapid sand filter rsf systems in wwtps is thus in urgent need in this study granular limestone a low cost and abundant natural material was integrated into rsf systems to enhance np removal from water laboratory filtration columns packed with pure sand and limestone amended sand were applied to remove polystyrene nanospheres 100 nm from deionized water diw and artificial wastewater aww under different grain size and flow velocity conditions pure sand filter showed neglectable np removal from diw but much higher np removal from aww especially when fine sand was employed limestone amended rsf had a significant improvement in the removal of nps for all the tested conditions and the removal efficiency of nps became greater with increasing amount of limestone in columns the sensitivity of np immobilization to flow velocity changed significantly with different combinations of filter and background solutions coupled effects of physical straining electrostatic interaction cation screening and bridging and surface roughness controlled the retention behaviors of nps in the columns the higher removal efficiency of nps by limestone can be mainly attributed to its chemical composition as well as its surface heterogeneity and roughness results of this study demonstrate that limestone can offer extensive application potential for enhancing the performance of rsf systems in wwtps to remove nps from wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoplastics rapid sand filter quartz sand limestone particles roughness data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastic pollution is among the global environmental concerns and has attracted increasing research interest owing to the toxicity and extensive presence of plastics in the environment andrady 2017 he et al 2018 liu et al 2019 although wastewater treatment plants wwtps have shown good ability to remove plastic particles bayo et al 2020 liu et al 2021 xu et al 2021 they are still one of the main point sources of microplastics mps and nanoplastics nps released into the environment because of their ultrafine particle sizes mps and nps are more likely to bypass wwtps and discharged with treated effluent liu et al 2021 rajala et al 2020 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2019 in particular the quantity of mps and nps in the effluent may be seriously underestimated because of the limitations of detection and analytical techniques cheng et al 2021 enfrin et al 2019 koelmans et al 2016 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2021 although the fate of mps and nps in wwtps has gained increasing attention in depth knowledge of their removal process and mechanisms from wastewater is still lacking in comparison to mps nps have smaller sizes and thus could be more difficult to be removed from water while nps are potentially more hazardous to the ecosystems than mps gigault et al 2021 arenas et al 2022 pulido reyes et al 2022 therefore np targeted treatment technologies are in urgent need to minimize their discharge to the environment rapid sand filter rsf an important tertiary treatment commonly employed in wwtps is a unit that utilizes sand and other natural granular materials e g anthracite magnetite as filter media to remove the contaminants from water previous studies have demonstrated that rsf is a promising mp treatment technology with several advantages such as high efficiency and low operational and maintenance cost bayo et al 2020 ngo et al 2019 wang et al 2020 depending on specific treatment process and the characteristics of the filter media and plastic particles the efficiency of rsf may vary widely from 55 6 to 97 0 cheng et al 2021 talvitie et al 2017 hence good understanding of the governing removal mechanisms of rsf systems is necessary for the improvement of plastic particles especially np removal efficiency however research on the microscopic dynamics and governing removal mechanisms of nps in rsf is still in its infancy further investigations are therefore urgently needed to understand the interactions between nps and rsf integrating materials with high adsorption capacity has been proved to be a promising strategy to enhance the filtration efficiency of rsf systems to various contaminants ding et al 2014 dong et al 2016 it has been reported that sand filters amended with biochar zeolites and molecular sieves can increase their removal efficiency to plastic particles through stuck trapped and entangled mechanisms shen et al 2021 wang et al 2020 hsieh et al 2022 these studies have mainly focused on the removal of mps with relatively large sizes nevertheless there has been quite a few recent studies investigated the np filtration by improving the filter media in contrast to that of pristine sand in packed filtration columns the removal efficiency of nps from drinking water of aged sand increased from 43 to 77 which can be explained by the presence of biofilm on the aged sand surface pulido reyes et al 2022 with the presence of coagulant during sand filtration process arenas et al 2022 found that nps with mean diameters around 110 nm could be mostly removed 99 2 due to np surface charge reduction and aggregation the application of other materials such as magnetic and metal organic frameworks in np treatment has also attracted research attention recently singh et al 2021 tang et al 2021 wan et al 2022 despite all these efforts current research on np removal by the sand filtration system is still at the very early stages of development the efficiency of rsf systems to nps in wastewater and the governing mechanisms still need to be determined in addition cost effective and environmentally friendly filter media are in strong desire to enhance the real world applicability as well as the efficiency of rsf for np removal limestone is one of the most common low cost 500 rmb per ton materials for permeable reactive barriers which are naturally easily and locally available in large quantities raw and modified limestone particles have shown great adsorption ability to various contaminants including heavy metals phosphate fluoride dye antibiotic and microorganisms li et al 2019 lv et al 2018 mohan and dutta 2020 ramazanpour esfahani et al 2020 selim et al 2019 sun et al 2019b zhou et al 2017 considering the special chemical composition of granular limestone and its rougher and less negatively charged surface compared with sand it would be a good filter medium for removing nps from wastewater to the best of the authors knowledge however none of previous studies has investigated the removal of nps by granular limestone based filters the overarching goal of this study is to improve current understanding of the mechanisms controlling the removal of nps from wastewater by granular limestone amended sand filters a series of column experiments were conducted to evaluate np removal from deionized water diw and artificial wastewater aww by sand filters amended with granular limestone the specific objectives are as follows 1 compare np removal efficiencies of sand only and sand limestone filters 2 evaluate the performances of the filters at different flow velocities 3 determine the governing mechanisms of np removal by the filter media 2 materials and methods 2 1 quartz sand and granular limestone quartz sand was purchased from unimin corporation le sueur mn and sieved into two sizes i e 20 30 mesh 0 60 0 85 mm and 40 50 mesh 0 3 0 425 mm the granular limestone was obtained by crushing limestone rocks acquired from a surface outcrop in hengyang county china and the size of which ranged from 0 4 to 0 7 mm after being sifted by stainless steel sieves sand and granular limestone were washed sequentially by tap water and diw to remove impurities and then dried in an oven at 45 c zeta potentials of sand and granular limestone in diw and aww were measured by zetapals instrument brookhaven instruments corporation ny usa following the procedures introduced in previous studies li et al 2017 li et al 2019 surface morphologies of sand and limestone and the distribution of nps onto the filters after the column tests were observed with a scanning electron microscopy sem jeol jsm 6490 japan pore distribution and structure characteristics of sand and limestone packed columns were determined by micro x ray ct scanning hiscan xm the mineral composition of sand and limestone grains were analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd dmf japan the surface functional groups were characterized by a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir nexus870 specific surface area ssa values of the samples were measured through adsorption desorption of n2 at 77 k micrometrics asap 2020 2 2 nps fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles with the diameter of 100 nm were purchased from baseline chromtech research center tianjin china the stock solution 250 mg l 1 was obtained by adding 10 ml origin solution into 390 ml diw np work solutions at a concentration of 5 mg l 1 were prepared by diluting the stock solution using diw or aww the stock and working solutions were sonicated for 30 min before use the zeta potentials of the nps in diw and aww solutions were also determined using the zetapals the diameters of np particles in diw and aww solutions before and after breakthrough from the columns were measured by a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments u k 2 3 column experiments the rsf process was simulated and explored through column experiments a series of pure sand and sand limestone packed column experiments were carried out in both diw and aww table 1 the sand was wet packed into the acrylic columns 16 2 length and 2 5 cm inner diameter two stainless steel screens with pore size of 50 μm were used to seal each of the columns at the inlet and outlet the velocity of the upward flow was controlled by a peristaltic pump bt100 1f longer pump china as shown in fig s1 the sand limestone columns consisted of sand granular limestone and sand from the top to bottom e g limestone filter was sandwiched between two layers of sand the granular limestone with different amount was carefully packed into the middle of the columns to ensure the minimum mixture of sand and limestone effects of sand size 20 30 mesh and 40 50 mesh amount of limestone 17 5 g 35 g 52 5 g correspond to thickness of 2 5 cm 5 cm 7 5 cm in column respectively and the flow velocity 3 7 and 21 ml min 1 on the np removal were systematically investigated table 1 considering that rsf is a tertiary treatment in wwtps ngo et al 2019 sun et al 2019a aww ph 5 8 used in this study was prepared based on the parameters of secondary treated wastewater huang et al 2020 zheng et al 2019 and the main composition of aww is presented in table 2 it should be noted that only cl was considered as the main anion in the aww in this study the experimental investigation was performed to explore the fundamental mechanisms and evaluate the efficiency of np removal in the limestone amended rsf system to provide insights into potential applications the real wastewater chemistry is more complicated and would also make the mechanisms of np removal quite complex thus the composition of aww in this study was designed as a simplified surrogate which does not necessarily reflect the real world composition of wastewater prior to each experiment the column was equilibrated to the steady condition by flushing 10 pore volumes pvs of diw or aww 10 pvs of np suspension were subsequently injected into the columns followed by corresponding background solution for 2 pvs in selected columns diw was pumped into the columns after the filtration stage to examine the remobilization of the retained nps the effluent samples were collected by a fraction collector bs 100a puyang scientific research institute china and np concentrations were determined by a fluorescence spectrometer 970crt tianmei china at excitation emission wavelengths of 488 518 nm according to the manufacturer of nps the breakthrough curves of nps were obtained by plotting the normalized effluent concentration c c 0 versus pvs the removal efficiency was then calculated based on the mass recovery all of the experiments were performed in duplicate and average values are reported in addition the ph values of the influent and effluent were measured to provide more information for the clarification of removal mechanisms table s1 the sand and granular limestone near the inlet were collected after the column experiments to determine the distribution of nps on filter surface via sem 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of nps and porous media the sem results for quartz sand and granular limestone used in this study are shown in fig 1 and fig s2 s5 supporting information si which present obvious morphologic differences the ssa of limestone finer quartz and coarser quartz sand were 0 46 0 13 and 0 08 m2 g 1 respectively the ssa surface roughness and heterogeneity of limestone are significantly greater than those of sand which are critical factors in facilitating the retention of nanoparticles and colloids in porous media li et al 2019 rasmuson et al 2017 torkzaban and bradford 2016 the extensive irregular bumps and grooves would reasonably provoke different immobilization mechanisms of nps compared to the smooth surface x ct images of the column intersecting surface fig s6a s6c showed larger and more irregular pores of limestone filter than those of quartz sand filter reflecting the irregular shape of limestone grain based on x ct images the pore size distributions of different columns were analyzed following the method of chen et al 2022 and the results further confirmed that limestone filter had larger pores than the others fig s6d the porosities of sand limestone columns were larger than those of the pure sand columns and increased with increasing limestone amount table 1 as such the immobilization of nps in columns could be strongly influenced the chemical properties of quartz sand and limestone are presented in fig s7 the crystal composition of limestone included a high content of calcite and low contents of quartz and dolomite while quartz sand was mainly composed of quartz these are consistent with the results of previous studies dong et al 2017 lv et al 2018 sdiri et al 2010 the typical ftir sorption brands on limestone corresponded to carbonate ion in calcite and carboxyl and hydroxyl groups while the ftir peaks of quartz sand were different and si o si and si o vibration were clearly presented on quartz sand surfaces beddiaf et al 2017 beddiaf et al 2015 dong et al 2017 due to their different chemical compositions li et al 2019 lv et al 2018 limestone grains were less negatively charged than quartz sand in both diw and aww solutions compared with values in diw solutions the zeta potential of nps sand and limestone grains in aww solutions all became less negative mainly due to the compression of the electrical double layer that resulted from increased ionic strength table 3 the ph values of the effluent from sand limestone columns were higher than those from pure sand columns table s1 this can be attributed to the additional alkalinity supply due to the dissolution of limestone dong et al 2017 huang et al 2010 liu and koenig 2002 the hydrodynamic diameters of nps under different conditions are presented in table s2 the values were similar suggesting nps might be able to maintain good stability in diw and aww solutions this is consistent with the zeta potential results that there was electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged np particles table 3 3 2 np removal by sand packed columns 3 2 1 np removal in diw systems the np removal by pure sand filter in diw systems were firstly investigated as shown in fig 2 3 nearly all nps passed through the sand columns under all experimental conditions regardless the sand size and the flow velocities indicating that the application of quartz sand filter to remove nps from diw solution was not feasible the high breakthrough of nps could be mainly attributed to the strong electrostatic repulsion between np particles and quartz sand dong et al 2018 dong et al 2019 in addition the mechanical screening mode of sand filter apparently did not work due to the small size of the nps while it is the main removing mechanism for larger plastic particles such as mps shen et al 2021 wang et al 2020 3 2 2 np removal in aww systems as shown in table 1 the np removal capacities of sand packed columns with aww background solutions were remarkably higher than those with diw for all tested conditions the immobilization of nps significantly increased under aww background fig 2 and 4 specifically the np removal by sand filter in aww significantly increased to 91 42 96 79 when 40 50 mesh sand was employed while it ranged from 25 41 to 81 60 in coarse sand columns table 1 such obvious difference illustrated the significant influence of aww composition on the removal of nps previous studies have found that cations can affect the mobility of nano particles due to electrostatic screening and or bridging effect hofman caris et al 2022 liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 as shown in table 3 the zeta potentials of both quartz sand and nps became less negative in aww suggesting decreased electrostatic repulsion between nps and quartz sand and subsequently increased the immobilization of nps in the filtration column although the diameter ratio of nps to sand e g 0 0003 for 40 50 mesh sand is much smaller than the reported threshold values 0 0016 0 005 bradford et al 2005 shen et al 2008 it has been demonstrated that the threshold value could decrease significantly at higher is bradford et al 2007 shen et al 2008 therefore straining effect might be induced by higher is of aww and partially contribute to the enhanced np retention dong et al 2019 flow velocity is an important index that must be considered during the evaluation of treatment capacity of rsf system in general increase in flow velocity was unfavorable for both pure sand and sand limestone filters in diw or aww due to the decreased contact time between nps and the filter grains ding et al 2014 dong et al 2016 the influence of flow velocity on the np removal varied with sand grain size when flow velocity increased from 3 to 21 ml min 1 under aww conditions the removal proportion of nps by coarse sand filter decreased accordingly from 81 60 to 25 41 fig 4 while only slight decrease was triggered in fine sand columns fig 2 these results suggest that np removal by the sand columns was controlled by the coupling effects of grain size hydrochemical condition and flow velocity 3 3 np removal by sand limestone packed columns 3 3 1 np removal in diw systems a series of column experiments were carried out to investigate the np removal capacity of limestone filter in diw system as shown in fig 3 embedding limestone interlayer into sand columns significantly improved the removal of nps which increased with increasing limestone amount at the flow rate of 3 ml min 1 the removal efficiency increased dramatically from 1 55 to 85 04 in 40 50 mesh sand and from 2 54 to 77 98 in 20 30 mesh sand columns with limestone thickness in columns increasing from 0 to 5 0 cm fig 3a 3b when the limestone thickness in columns increased to 7 5 cm the removal efficiencies of nps in diw reached as high as 85 67 and 94 97 for 20 30 mesh and 40 50 mesh sand respectively ultrapure water is widely acknowledged to be unfavorable for nanoparticle immobilization in porous media results of np removal by sand limestone packed columns under diw conditions provide strong evidence of the promising potential of granular limestone in improving filtration performance of rsf to nps np retention decreased with increasing flow rate in sand limestone columns corresponding to the reduced removal efficiency fig 3b 3c moreover the variation tendency of removal efficiency was also influenced by the flow velocity fig 5 at flow rate of 3 ml min 1 the removal first increased sharply with the thickness of limestone increasing from 0 to 2 5 cm the increasing trend then slowed down with further increase in limestone amount when the flow rate was 21 ml min 1 statistically significant linear correlation between np removal efficiency and limestone thickness was observed fig 5 the effect of flow velocity could be partially attributed to the decreased contact time between the np particles and filter media in addition the increasing velocity would reduce the opportunity for np particles being trapped in the roughness area of the filter media surface similarly the influent flow also showed an inverse correlation with mp removal by aluminosilicate filter media shen et al 2021 it is worth noting that even at a fairly high flow velocity 21 ml min 1 the removal efficiency was promoted by 52 32 with only 7 5 cm limestone packed in the columns 16 2 cm 3 3 2 np removal in aww systems further investigations were conducted to explore the np removal efficiencies of sand limestone packed columns with aww as the background solution the results confirmed that limestone filter had better np fixation capacity than quartz sand in both diw and aww solutions table 1 as shown in fig 4 the np removal rate increased with increasing limestone thickness packed in the columns under different flow velocity conditions and the enhancement was more significant at a higher velocity at the flow rate of 21 ml min 1 increasing limestone thickness from 0 to 7 5 cm in 20 30 mesh sand columns provided the greatest improvement of np retention among all the tests under aww background resulting in a significant increase of 50 13 in np removal efficiency consistent with the aforementioned phenomena the removal efficiency of the limestone sand columns decreased with increasing flow rate to assess the remobilization of the retained nps the columns were further flushed by diw only small amount of nps released with the background solution being switched from aww to diw and the release was generally inhibited with the increasing limestone thickness in the columns figs 2 and 4 table 1 3 4 governing mechanisms the polystyrene nanosphere of 100 nm can be regarded as a colloid for colloids electrostatic interaction has been widely recognized as one of the main mechanisms controlling their retention behaviors in porous media dong et al 2019 jiang et al 2021 wu et al 2020a in this study the removal efficiency of nps in pure sand columns under diw conditions was quite low which could be partly attributed to the strong electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged np particles and negatively charged sand grains table 3 previous studies have shown that solution ph may play a crucial role in controlling the retention of nps in porous media and the mobility of nps increases with increasing ph dong et al 2021 wu et al 2020a in this study the ph values of effluent were higher than those of influent table s1 indicating ph increased within the column and thereby might facilitate the mobilization of nps these results suggest that ph effect together with electrostatic repulsion contributed to such low np removal by pure sand in the diw system the increased ph values of effluent were also observed with pure sand columns under aww conditions and the ph values of the effluent after passing through the column with limestone were even higher rising to 8 7 9 8 however remarkably high retention of nps was observed under these conditions the zeta potentials of nps sand and limestone grains all became less negative in aww solutions than those in diw solutions indicating aww was more favorable than diw for np retention in the columns addition of granular limestone promoted the np removal in the quartz sand columns which could also be partially attributed to the weaker electrostatic repulsion between limestone and np particles due to the less negative zeta potential of limestone than sand however the differences in zeta potential values were not drastic enough to explain such variations in retention behavior of nps especially with the increase in effluent ph values therefore there might be other immobilization mechanisms of np retention in the limestone sand columns cation screening and bridging effects can play an important role in facilitating colloid retention in porous media in this study monovalent ions e g na and k in aww could favor the immobilization of nano particles due to the electrostatic screening effect liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 and divalent cations e g ca2 and mg2 could enhance the retention via both electrostatic screening and bridging effect hofman caris et al 2022 liu et al 2014 wang et al 2018 wu et al 2020b for limestone the calcium ion carboxylic and hydroxyl groups on limestone surface could further significantly enhance the bridge effect to immobilize nps the retention behavior of nps exhibited obvious dependency on sand size under aww conditions the breakthrough curves of nps in 20 30 mesh sand columns showed the blocking effect indicating the decreasing deposition site for nps during the filtration process in current study sand column embedded with limestone can be seen as a layered system the textural interface of limestone quartz sand could also contribute to the deposition of np particles especially when they were carried by flow from coarser limestone to finer quartz sand bradford et al 2005 in addition straining may occur for much lower values of critical straining ratio at a high is bradford et al 2007 thus it could be involved in the enhanced np immobilization under aww condition particular in finer sand columns dong et al 2019 indicated that straining occurred when the ratio of the average diameter of nps to sand diameter was 0 0005 to further explore the removal mechanisms the sand and granular limestone samples were analyzed by sem after the column experiments morphologically controlled mechanisms have been demonstrated to be critical in the removal of mps from wastewater by filter media hsieh et al 2022 shen et al 2021 wang et al 2020 the sem images of this study visibly presented the distribution of nps on sand and limestone surfaces fig 1 fig s2 s5 individual np particles were found to adhere onto the smooth area of the media surface which could be mainly contributed to the electrostatic force and cation bridge mechanisms apart from the relatively smooth area more np particles were observed in the rough regions the potholes area on the filter surface could hamper the flow shear and thus be conducive to the immobilization of nps which occurred on both sand and limestone surface fig s2 s3 for the case of limestone filter according to the sem images obtained a large number of nps were trapped in the grooves and ravines and some particles seemed to be hidden in the larger grooves while others just stuck in them the matching location made it almost impossible for the stuck np particles to be released this may contribute to the significant decreased release of nps in sand limestone packed columns moreover there was extensive stepped roughness on limestone surface and the distribution of nps showed strong correlation with it fig 1e liang et al 2022 reported that np retention is mainly controlled by interactions on convex concave locations on collector surface in general the irregular shape and rough surface with dense grooves and dents of limestone make it more attractive than quartz sand to remove nps from wastewater 4 conclusions this study provides new information on np removal from diw and aww by sand and sand limestone filters it is the first systematical study on the removal performance and mechanisms of nps from wastewater by granular limestone fine sand filters showed higher np removal from aww than the coarse ones however they both exhibited negligible np removal from diw amending granular limestone into sand columns significantly improved the removal of nps under both diw and aww solutions and the removal efficiency increased with the increasing limestone thickness the sensitivity of np retention to flow velocity varied with changes in filter materials and background solutions electrostatic interaction cation screening and bridging and surface morphology were the main mechanisms controlling np retention in filtration columns through intensive microscopic examination via sem the excellent immobilization capacity of nps by granular limestone can be largely attributed to the trapped effect introduced by its surface heterogeneity and roughness results of this study highlight the great application prospect of limestone filters to enhance np removal efficiency of conventional rsf in wwtp systems even under high water flow conditions considering its natural characteristics e g low cost earth abundant easily accessible and locally available granular limestone is a promising np filter to advance rsf technology and worth developing it is however recognized that the aww used in this study could not be a complete surrogate of the real wastewater the composition of real world secondary treated wastewater is more complex consequently follow up studies on the effect of wastewater chemistry would be required to provide further confidence on limestone filter as a techno economically feasible solution to enhance the np removing capacity of wwtps coupled effect of interfering ions natural organic matter ph and coexistence of other pollutants should be determined in depth investigations focusing on different types of nps in real wastewater matrices are needed to further verify the potential of limestone as a low cost high efficiency porous filter it is also considerable to examine its performance and governed mechanisms in removal of nps from real natural

15237,effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtps has been regarded as one of the major contributors of nanoplastics nps in the environment improving the performance of rapid sand filter rsf systems in wwtps is thus in urgent need in this study granular limestone a low cost and abundant natural material was integrated into rsf systems to enhance np removal from water laboratory filtration columns packed with pure sand and limestone amended sand were applied to remove polystyrene nanospheres 100 nm from deionized water diw and artificial wastewater aww under different grain size and flow velocity conditions pure sand filter showed neglectable np removal from diw but much higher np removal from aww especially when fine sand was employed limestone amended rsf had a significant improvement in the removal of nps for all the tested conditions and the removal efficiency of nps became greater with increasing amount of limestone in columns the sensitivity of np immobilization to flow velocity changed significantly with different combinations of filter and background solutions coupled effects of physical straining electrostatic interaction cation screening and bridging and surface roughness controlled the retention behaviors of nps in the columns the higher removal efficiency of nps by limestone can be mainly attributed to its chemical composition as well as its surface heterogeneity and roughness results of this study demonstrate that limestone can offer extensive application potential for enhancing the performance of rsf systems in wwtps to remove nps from wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoplastics rapid sand filter quartz sand limestone particles roughness data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastic pollution is among the global environmental concerns and has attracted increasing research interest owing to the toxicity and extensive presence of plastics in the environment andrady 2017 he et al 2018 liu et al 2019 although wastewater treatment plants wwtps have shown good ability to remove plastic particles bayo et al 2020 liu et al 2021 xu et al 2021 they are still one of the main point sources of microplastics mps and nanoplastics nps released into the environment because of their ultrafine particle sizes mps and nps are more likely to bypass wwtps and discharged with treated effluent liu et al 2021 rajala et al 2020 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2019 in particular the quantity of mps and nps in the effluent may be seriously underestimated because of the limitations of detection and analytical techniques cheng et al 2021 enfrin et al 2019 koelmans et al 2016 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2021 although the fate of mps and nps in wwtps has gained increasing attention in depth knowledge of their removal process and mechanisms from wastewater is still lacking in comparison to mps nps have smaller sizes and thus could be more difficult to be removed from water while nps are potentially more hazardous to the ecosystems than mps gigault et al 2021 arenas et al 2022 pulido reyes et al 2022 therefore np targeted treatment technologies are in urgent need to minimize their discharge to the environment rapid sand filter rsf an important tertiary treatment commonly employed in wwtps is a unit that utilizes sand and other natural granular materials e g anthracite magnetite as filter media to remove the contaminants from water previous studies have demonstrated that rsf is a promising mp treatment technology with several advantages such as high efficiency and low operational and maintenance cost bayo et al 2020 ngo et al 2019 wang et al 2020 depending on specific treatment process and the characteristics of the filter media and plastic particles the efficiency of rsf may vary widely from 55 6 to 97 0 cheng et al 2021 talvitie et al 2017 hence good understanding of the governing removal mechanisms of rsf systems is necessary for the improvement of plastic particles especially np removal efficiency however research on the microscopic dynamics and governing removal mechanisms of nps in rsf is still in its infancy further investigations are therefore urgently needed to understand the interactions between nps and rsf integrating materials with high adsorption capacity has been proved to be a promising strategy to enhance the filtration efficiency of rsf systems to various contaminants ding et al 2014 dong et al 2016 it has been reported that sand filters amended with biochar zeolites and molecular sieves can increase their removal efficiency to plastic particles through stuck trapped and entangled mechanisms shen et al 2021 wang et al 2020 hsieh et al 2022 these studies have mainly focused on the removal of mps with relatively large sizes nevertheless there has been quite a few recent studies investigated the np filtration by improving the filter media in contrast to that of pristine sand in packed filtration columns the removal efficiency of nps from drinking water of aged sand increased from 43 to 77 which can be explained by the presence of biofilm on the aged sand surface pulido reyes et al 2022 with the presence of coagulant during sand filtration process arenas et al 2022 found that nps with mean diameters around 110 nm could be mostly removed 99 2 due to np surface charge reduction and aggregation the application of other materials such as magnetic and metal organic frameworks in np treatment has also attracted research attention recently singh et al 2021 tang et al 2021 wan et al 2022 despite all these efforts current research on np removal by the sand filtration system is still at the very early stages of development the efficiency of rsf systems to nps in wastewater and the governing mechanisms still need to be determined in addition cost effective and environmentally friendly filter media are in strong desire to enhance the real world applicability as well as the efficiency of rsf for np removal limestone is one of the most common low cost 500 rmb per ton materials for permeable reactive barriers which are naturally easily and locally available in large quantities raw and modified limestone particles have shown great adsorption ability to various contaminants including heavy metals phosphate fluoride dye antibiotic and microorganisms li et al 2019 lv et al 2018 mohan and dutta 2020 ramazanpour esfahani et al 2020 selim et al 2019 sun et al 2019b zhou et al 2017 considering the special chemical composition of granular limestone and its rougher and less negatively charged surface compared with sand it would be a good filter medium for removing nps from wastewater to the best of the authors knowledge however none of previous studies has investigated the removal of nps by granular limestone based filters the overarching goal of this study is to improve current understanding of the mechanisms controlling the removal of nps from wastewater by granular limestone amended sand filters a series of column experiments were conducted to evaluate np removal from deionized water diw and artificial wastewater aww by sand filters amended with granular limestone the specific objectives are as follows 1 compare np removal efficiencies of sand only and sand limestone filters 2 evaluate the performances of the filters at different flow velocities 3 determine the governing mechanisms of np removal by the filter media 2 materials and methods 2 1 quartz sand and granular limestone quartz sand was purchased from unimin corporation le sueur mn and sieved into two sizes i e 20 30 mesh 0 60 0 85 mm and 40 50 mesh 0 3 0 425 mm the granular limestone was obtained by crushing limestone rocks acquired from a surface outcrop in hengyang county china and the size of which ranged from 0 4 to 0 7 mm after being sifted by stainless steel sieves sand and granular limestone were washed sequentially by tap water and diw to remove impurities and then dried in an oven at 45 c zeta potentials of sand and granular limestone in diw and aww were measured by zetapals instrument brookhaven instruments corporation ny usa following the procedures introduced in previous studies li et al 2017 li et al 2019 surface morphologies of sand and limestone and the distribution of nps onto the filters after the column tests were observed with a scanning electron microscopy sem jeol jsm 6490 japan pore distribution and structure characteristics of sand and limestone packed columns were determined by micro x ray ct scanning hiscan xm the mineral composition of sand and limestone grains were analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd dmf japan the surface functional groups were characterized by a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir nexus870 specific surface area ssa values of the samples were measured through adsorption desorption of n2 at 77 k micrometrics asap 2020 2 2 nps fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles with the diameter of 100 nm were purchased from baseline chromtech research center tianjin china the stock solution 250 mg l 1 was obtained by adding 10 ml origin solution into 390 ml diw np work solutions at a concentration of 5 mg l 1 were prepared by diluting the stock solution using diw or aww the stock and working solutions were sonicated for 30 min before use the zeta potentials of the nps in diw and aww solutions were also determined using the zetapals the diameters of np particles in diw and aww solutions before and after breakthrough from the columns were measured by a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments u k 2 3 column experiments the rsf process was simulated and explored through column experiments a series of pure sand and sand limestone packed column experiments were carried out in both diw and aww table 1 the sand was wet packed into the acrylic columns 16 2 length and 2 5 cm inner diameter two stainless steel screens with pore size of 50 μm were used to seal each of the columns at the inlet and outlet the velocity of the upward flow was controlled by a peristaltic pump bt100 1f longer pump china as shown in fig s1 the sand limestone columns consisted of sand granular limestone and sand from the top to bottom e g limestone filter was sandwiched between two layers of sand the granular limestone with different amount was carefully packed into the middle of the columns to ensure the minimum mixture of sand and limestone effects of sand size 20 30 mesh and 40 50 mesh amount of limestone 17 5 g 35 g 52 5 g correspond to thickness of 2 5 cm 5 cm 7 5 cm in column respectively and the flow velocity 3 7 and 21 ml min 1 on the np removal were systematically investigated table 1 considering that rsf is a tertiary treatment in wwtps ngo et al 2019 sun et al 2019a aww ph 5 8 used in this study was prepared based on the parameters of secondary treated wastewater huang et al 2020 zheng et al 2019 and the main composition of aww is presented in table 2 it should be noted that only cl was considered as the main anion in the aww in this study the experimental investigation was performed to explore the fundamental mechanisms and evaluate the efficiency of np removal in the limestone amended rsf system to provide insights into potential applications the real wastewater chemistry is more complicated and would also make the mechanisms of np removal quite complex thus the composition of aww in this study was designed as a simplified surrogate which does not necessarily reflect the real world composition of wastewater prior to each experiment the column was equilibrated to the steady condition by flushing 10 pore volumes pvs of diw or aww 10 pvs of np suspension were subsequently injected into the columns followed by corresponding background solution for 2 pvs in selected columns diw was pumped into the columns after the filtration stage to examine the remobilization of the retained nps the effluent samples were collected by a fraction collector bs 100a puyang scientific research institute china and np concentrations were determined by a fluorescence spectrometer 970crt tianmei china at excitation emission wavelengths of 488 518 nm according to the manufacturer of nps the breakthrough curves of nps were obtained by plotting the normalized effluent concentration c c 0 versus pvs the removal efficiency was then calculated based on the mass recovery all of the experiments were performed in duplicate and average values are reported in addition the ph values of the influent and effluent were measured to provide more information for the clarification of removal mechanisms table s1 the sand and granular limestone near the inlet were collected after the column experiments to determine the distribution of nps on filter surface via sem 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of nps and porous media the sem results for quartz sand and granular limestone used in this study are shown in fig 1 and fig s2 s5 supporting information si which present obvious morphologic differences the ssa of limestone finer quartz and coarser quartz sand were 0 46 0 13 and 0 08 m2 g 1 respectively the ssa surface roughness and heterogeneity of limestone are significantly greater than those of sand which are critical factors in facilitating the retention of nanoparticles and colloids in porous media li et al 2019 rasmuson et al 2017 torkzaban and bradford 2016 the extensive irregular bumps and grooves would reasonably provoke different immobilization mechanisms of nps compared to the smooth surface x ct images of the column intersecting surface fig s6a s6c showed larger and more irregular pores of limestone filter than those of quartz sand filter reflecting the irregular shape of limestone grain based on x ct images the pore size distributions of different columns were analyzed following the method of chen et al 2022 and the results further confirmed that limestone filter had larger pores than the others fig s6d the porosities of sand limestone columns were larger than those of the pure sand columns and increased with increasing limestone amount table 1 as such the immobilization of nps in columns could be strongly influenced the chemical properties of quartz sand and limestone are presented in fig s7 the crystal composition of limestone included a high content of calcite and low contents of quartz and dolomite while quartz sand was mainly composed of quartz these are consistent with the results of previous studies dong et al 2017 lv et al 2018 sdiri et al 2010 the typical ftir sorption brands on limestone corresponded to carbonate ion in calcite and carboxyl and hydroxyl groups while the ftir peaks of quartz sand were different and si o si and si o vibration were clearly presented on quartz sand surfaces beddiaf et al 2017 beddiaf et al 2015 dong et al 2017 due to their different chemical compositions li et al 2019 lv et al 2018 limestone grains were less negatively charged than quartz sand in both diw and aww solutions compared with values in diw solutions the zeta potential of nps sand and limestone grains in aww solutions all became less negative mainly due to the compression of the electrical double layer that resulted from increased ionic strength table 3 the ph values of the effluent from sand limestone columns were higher than those from pure sand columns table s1 this can be attributed to the additional alkalinity supply due to the dissolution of limestone dong et al 2017 huang et al 2010 liu and koenig 2002 the hydrodynamic diameters of nps under different conditions are presented in table s2 the values were similar suggesting nps might be able to maintain good stability in diw and aww solutions this is consistent with the zeta potential results that there was electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged np particles table 3 3 2 np removal by sand packed columns 3 2 1 np removal in diw systems the np removal by pure sand filter in diw systems were firstly investigated as shown in fig 2 3 nearly all nps passed through the sand columns under all experimental conditions regardless the sand size and the flow velocities indicating that the application of quartz sand filter to remove nps from diw solution was not feasible the high breakthrough of nps could be mainly attributed to the strong electrostatic repulsion between np particles and quartz sand dong et al 2018 dong et al 2019 in addition the mechanical screening mode of sand filter apparently did not work due to the small size of the nps while it is the main removing mechanism for larger plastic particles such as mps shen et al 2021 wang et al 2020 3 2 2 np removal in aww systems as shown in table 1 the np removal capacities of sand packed columns with aww background solutions were remarkably higher than those with diw for all tested conditions the immobilization of nps significantly increased under aww background fig 2 and 4 specifically the np removal by sand filter in aww significantly increased to 91 42 96 79 when 40 50 mesh sand was employed while it ranged from 25 41 to 81 60 in coarse sand columns table 1 such obvious difference illustrated the significant influence of aww composition on the removal of nps previous studies have found that cations can affect the mobility of nano particles due to electrostatic screening and or bridging effect hofman caris et al 2022 liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 as shown in table 3 the zeta potentials of both quartz sand and nps became less negative in aww suggesting decreased electrostatic repulsion between nps and quartz sand and subsequently increased the immobilization of nps in the filtration column although the diameter ratio of nps to sand e g 0 0003 for 40 50 mesh sand is much smaller than the reported threshold values 0 0016 0 005 bradford et al 2005 shen et al 2008 it has been demonstrated that the threshold value could decrease significantly at higher is bradford et al 2007 shen et al 2008 therefore straining effect might be induced by higher is of aww and partially contribute to the enhanced np retention dong et al 2019 flow velocity is an important index that must be considered during the evaluation of treatment capacity of rsf system in general increase in flow velocity was unfavorable for both pure sand and sand limestone filters in diw or aww due to the decreased contact time between nps and the filter grains ding et al 2014 dong et al 2016 the influence of flow velocity on the np removal varied with sand grain size when flow velocity increased from 3 to 21 ml min 1 under aww conditions the removal proportion of nps by coarse sand filter decreased accordingly from 81 60 to 25 41 fig 4 while only slight decrease was triggered in fine sand columns fig 2 these results suggest that np removal by the sand columns was controlled by the coupling effects of grain size hydrochemical condition and flow velocity 3 3 np removal by sand limestone packed columns 3 3 1 np removal in diw systems a series of column experiments were carried out to investigate the np removal capacity of limestone filter in diw system as shown in fig 3 embedding limestone interlayer into sand columns significantly improved the removal of nps which increased with increasing limestone amount at the flow rate of 3 ml min 1 the removal efficiency increased dramatically from 1 55 to 85 04 in 40 50 mesh sand and from 2 54 to 77 98 in 20 30 mesh sand columns with limestone thickness in columns increasing from 0 to 5 0 cm fig 3a 3b when the limestone thickness in columns increased to 7 5 cm the removal efficiencies of nps in diw reached as high as 85 67 and 94 97 for 20 30 mesh and 40 50 mesh sand respectively ultrapure water is widely acknowledged to be unfavorable for nanoparticle immobilization in porous media results of np removal by sand limestone packed columns under diw conditions provide strong evidence of the promising potential of granular limestone in improving filtration performance of rsf to nps np retention decreased with increasing flow rate in sand limestone columns corresponding to the reduced removal efficiency fig 3b 3c moreover the variation tendency of removal efficiency was also influenced by the flow velocity fig 5 at flow rate of 3 ml min 1 the removal first increased sharply with the thickness of limestone increasing from 0 to 2 5 cm the increasing trend then slowed down with further increase in limestone amount when the flow rate was 21 ml min 1 statistically significant linear correlation between np removal efficiency and limestone thickness was observed fig 5 the effect of flow velocity could be partially attributed to the decreased contact time between the np particles and filter media in addition the increasing velocity would reduce the opportunity for np particles being trapped in the roughness area of the filter media surface similarly the influent flow also showed an inverse correlation with mp removal by aluminosilicate filter media shen et al 2021 it is worth noting that even at a fairly high flow velocity 21 ml min 1 the removal efficiency was promoted by 52 32 with only 7 5 cm limestone packed in the columns 16 2 cm 3 3 2 np removal in aww systems further investigations were conducted to explore the np removal efficiencies of sand limestone packed columns with aww as the background solution the results confirmed that limestone filter had better np fixation capacity than quartz sand in both diw and aww solutions table 1 as shown in fig 4 the np removal rate increased with increasing limestone thickness packed in the columns under different flow velocity conditions and the enhancement was more significant at a higher velocity at the flow rate of 21 ml min 1 increasing limestone thickness from 0 to 7 5 cm in 20 30 mesh sand columns provided the greatest improvement of np retention among all the tests under aww background resulting in a significant increase of 50 13 in np removal efficiency consistent with the aforementioned phenomena the removal efficiency of the limestone sand columns decreased with increasing flow rate to assess the remobilization of the retained nps the columns were further flushed by diw only small amount of nps released with the background solution being switched from aww to diw and the release was generally inhibited with the increasing limestone thickness in the columns figs 2 and 4 table 1 3 4 governing mechanisms the polystyrene nanosphere of 100 nm can be regarded as a colloid for colloids electrostatic interaction has been widely recognized as one of the main mechanisms controlling their retention behaviors in porous media dong et al 2019 jiang et al 2021 wu et al 2020a in this study the removal efficiency of nps in pure sand columns under diw conditions was quite low which could be partly attributed to the strong electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged np particles and negatively charged sand grains table 3 previous studies have shown that solution ph may play a crucial role in controlling the retention of nps in porous media and the mobility of nps increases with increasing ph dong et al 2021 wu et al 2020a in this study the ph values of effluent were higher than those of influent table s1 indicating ph increased within the column and thereby might facilitate the mobilization of nps these results suggest that ph effect together with electrostatic repulsion contributed to such low np removal by pure sand in the diw system the increased ph values of effluent were also observed with pure sand columns under aww conditions and the ph values of the effluent after passing through the column with limestone were even higher rising to 8 7 9 8 however remarkably high retention of nps was observed under these conditions the zeta potentials of nps sand and limestone grains all became less negative in aww solutions than those in diw solutions indicating aww was more favorable than diw for np retention in the columns addition of granular limestone promoted the np removal in the quartz sand columns which could also be partially attributed to the weaker electrostatic repulsion between limestone and np particles due to the less negative zeta potential of limestone than sand however the differences in zeta potential values were not drastic enough to explain such variations in retention behavior of nps especially with the increase in effluent ph values therefore there might be other immobilization mechanisms of np retention in the limestone sand columns cation screening and bridging effects can play an important role in facilitating colloid retention in porous media in this study monovalent ions e g na and k in aww could favor the immobilization of nano particles due to the electrostatic screening effect liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 and divalent cations e g ca2 and mg2 could enhance the retention via both electrostatic screening and bridging effect hofman caris et al 2022 liu et al 2014 wang et al 2018 wu et al 2020b for limestone the calcium ion carboxylic and hydroxyl groups on limestone surface could further significantly enhance the bridge effect to immobilize nps the retention behavior of nps exhibited obvious dependency on sand size under aww conditions the breakthrough curves of nps in 20 30 mesh sand columns showed the blocking effect indicating the decreasing deposition site for nps during the filtration process in current study sand column embedded with limestone can be seen as a layered system the textural interface of limestone quartz sand could also contribute to the deposition of np particles especially when they were carried by flow from coarser limestone to finer quartz sand bradford et al 2005 in addition straining may occur for much lower values of critical straining ratio at a high is bradford et al 2007 thus it could be involved in the enhanced np immobilization under aww condition particular in finer sand columns dong et al 2019 indicated that straining occurred when the ratio of the average diameter of nps to sand diameter was 0 0005 to further explore the removal mechanisms the sand and granular limestone samples were analyzed by sem after the column experiments morphologically controlled mechanisms have been demonstrated to be critical in the removal of mps from wastewater by filter media hsieh et al 2022 shen et al 2021 wang et al 2020 the sem images of this study visibly presented the distribution of nps on sand and limestone surfaces fig 1 fig s2 s5 individual np particles were found to adhere onto the smooth area of the media surface which could be mainly contributed to the electrostatic force and cation bridge mechanisms apart from the relatively smooth area more np particles were observed in the rough regions the potholes area on the filter surface could hamper the flow shear and thus be conducive to the immobilization of nps which occurred on both sand and limestone surface fig s2 s3 for the case of limestone filter according to the sem images obtained a large number of nps were trapped in the grooves and ravines and some particles seemed to be hidden in the larger grooves while others just stuck in them the matching location made it almost impossible for the stuck np particles to be released this may contribute to the significant decreased release of nps in sand limestone packed columns moreover there was extensive stepped roughness on limestone surface and the distribution of nps showed strong correlation with it fig 1e liang et al 2022 reported that np retention is mainly controlled by interactions on convex concave locations on collector surface in general the irregular shape and rough surface with dense grooves and dents of limestone make it more attractive than quartz sand to remove nps from wastewater 4 conclusions this study provides new information on np removal from diw and aww by sand and sand limestone filters it is the first systematical study on the removal performance and mechanisms of nps from wastewater by granular limestone fine sand filters showed higher np removal from aww than the coarse ones however they both exhibited negligible np removal from diw amending granular limestone into sand columns significantly improved the removal of nps under both diw and aww solutions and the removal efficiency increased with the increasing limestone thickness the sensitivity of np retention to flow velocity varied with changes in filter materials and background solutions electrostatic interaction cation screening and bridging and surface morphology were the main mechanisms controlling np retention in filtration columns through intensive microscopic examination via sem the excellent immobilization capacity of nps by granular limestone can be largely attributed to the trapped effect introduced by its surface heterogeneity and roughness results of this study highlight the great application prospect of limestone filters to enhance np removal efficiency of conventional rsf in wwtp systems even under high water flow conditions considering its natural characteristics e g low cost earth abundant easily accessible and locally available granular limestone is a promising np filter to advance rsf technology and worth developing it is however recognized that the aww used in this study could not be a complete surrogate of the real wastewater the composition of real world secondary treated wastewater is more complex consequently follow up studies on the effect of wastewater chemistry would be required to provide further confidence on limestone filter as a techno economically feasible solution to enhance the np removing capacity of wwtps coupled effect of interfering ions natural organic matter ph and coexistence of other pollutants should be determined in depth investigations focusing on different types of nps in real wastewater matrices are needed to further verify the potential of limestone as a low cost high efficiency porous filter it is also considerable to examine its performance and governed mechanisms in removal of nps from real natural

15238,conventional electrocatalytic degradation of pollutants involves either cathodic reduction or anodic oxidation process which caused the low energy utilization efficiency in this study we successfully couple the anodic activation of sulfates with the cathodic h2o2 production activation to boost the generation of sulfate radical so4 and hydroxyl radical oh for the efficient degradation of emerging contaminants the electrocatalysis reactor is composed of a modified graphite felt gf cathode in situ prepared by the carbonization of polyaniline pani electrodeposited on a gf substrate and a boron doped diamond bdd anode in the presence of sulfates the electrocatalysis system shows superior activities towards the degradation of pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps with the optimal performance of completely degrading the representative pollutant carbamazepine cbz 0 2 mg l 1 within 150 s radicals quenching experiments indicated that oh and so4 act as the main reactive oxygen species for cbz decomposition results from the electron paramagnetic resonance epr and chronoamperometry studies verified that the sulfate ions were oxidized to so4 radicals at the anode while the dissolve oxygen molecules were reduced to h2o2 molecules which were further activated to produce oh radicals at the cathode it was also found that during the catalytic reactions so4 radicals could spontaneously convert into peroxydisulfate pds which were subsequently reduced back to so4 at the cathodes the quasi steady state concentrations of oh and so4 were estimated to be 0 51 10 12 m and 0 56 10 12 m respectively this study provides insight into the synergistic generation of oh so4 from the integrated electrochemical anode oxidation of sulfate and cathode reduction of dissolved oxygen which indicates a potential practical approach to efficiently degrade the emerging organic water contaminants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfate oxidation persulfate

personal care products ppcps have been detected in natural environments and wastewater due to the abuse and large emission seriously threatening the ecosystem and human health chen et al 2018 liu et al 2021 yu et al 2021 the conventional activated sludge method cannot effectively degrade ppcps in wastewater resulting in the accumulation in aquatic environment myrsini et al 2016 electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops have been widely used to degrade the refractory organic compounds due to the generation of powerful and non selective oxidants in the reaction process shin et al 2019 generally eaops can be divided into the anodic oxidation and cathodic electro fenton for the anodic oxidation process indirect electrochemical oxidation involving hydroxyl radical oh formed at the metal oxide anodes sno2 pbo2 etc eq 1 is more efficient than the direct oxidation for the degradation of organic water contaminants kuang et al 2019 farhat et al 2015 1 h 2 o oh h e recently much effort has been focused on the anodic oxidation of sulfates to produce so4 which is thermodynamically more powerful than oh due to its longer lifetime so4 30 40 μs oh 1 μs and higher oxidizing potential e0 so4 so4 2 2 5 3 1 v e0 oh h2o 1 8 2 7 v liu et al 2019 the approach involves the in situ generation of so4 from the activation of sulfates the common components of wastewater and natural water indicating great potentials to the practical applications it was reported that electrochemical activation of sulfates to produce so4 eq 2 and the derived oh eq 3 can occur at the boron doped diamond bdd anode ganiyu and el din 2020 and the electrocatalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin was significantly enhanced in the presence of sulfate containing electrolyte compared with the nitrate containing electrolyte clearly indicating the contribution of so4 from the anodic reactions matzek et al 2018 2 s o 4 2 s o 4 e 3 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 oh h regarding the cathodic reactions the organic contaminants can be degraded through the direct electron transfer process another approach is to employ the electro fenton process to generate oh eqs 4 5 for the organic contaminant degradation haider et al 2019 kuang et al 2021 olvera vargas et al 2021 4 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 5 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 oh o h electrochemical generation of oh from cathode via electro fenton or so4 from anode via sulfate oxidation offers a greener and safer route for radical production however the current electrochemical production efficiency of oh and so4 from one side reaction is still relatively low a promising solution is to employ the full cell production of oh and so4 by coupling anodic sulfate activation and cathodic electro fenton however there are few reports regarding synergistic cathodic anodic electrocatalysis technology for pollutant degradation because of the mismatch between the anode and cathode working potentials the ferrous ions oxidized by anode and the h2o2 oxidized by the anode kuang et al 2021 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 although li et al li et al 2021 previously integrated the anodic oxidation reactions with the cathodic oxygen reduction reactions and reached an overall faradaic efficiency of 161 it is still a great challenge to develop the synergistic electrocatalysis technology recently metal free carbon based materials has become a promising green alternative to the transition metal based catalysts due to its great resistance to the acid and base abundance tunable electronic and physicochemical properties and less hazards gao et al 2020 therefore carbon based materials have been used in cathode electrocatalysts and exhibited excellent performance he et al 2020 peng et al 2021 yuan et al 2020 however most of carbon based catalysts are in powder form and need to be supported on the catalyst matrix by polymer binders which would decrease conductivity and active sites of electrodes in addition the adhesive electrode will become unstable after the long term operation and the catalyst may detach from the electrode reducing the catalytic activity of the electrode and causing secondary pollution therefore it is urgent to develop the stable non adherent electrode zhou et al 2019 as polyaniline pani showed great potentials in covalently binding with the anode materials and serving as the precursor for the carbon materials khan et al 2018 it is important to develop pani derived metal free catalyst in the electrocatalysis system in this study we report a synergistic electrocatalytic system by coupling the bdd anode with the graphite felt gf cathode modified from pani derived n doped carbon catalyst using na2so4 as the electrolyte the anode and cathode synergistically generate oh and so4 to degrade ppcps pollutants in wastewater more importantly we quantitatively measured the concentration of oh and so4 in the presence of the combined oh and so4 radicals the refractory pollutants were more efficiently degraded 2

titration method was found to detect both h2o2 and s2o8 2 robin 1980 thus it was used as to measure the combined concentration of h2o2 and s2o8 2 in the solution details in text s1 2 5 electrocatalytic degradation of ppcps pollutants to construct the electrocatalytic system bdd 2 3 cm2 and cpani gf electrodes were used as the anode and the cathode respectively during the degradation process oxygen was continuously purged into the solution to ensure the o2 saturated environment for the electrocatalytic degradation of representative ppcps pollutant carbamazepine cbz a single chamber electrolytic cell 100 ml was used with the na2so4 50 ml 0 1 m as the electrolyte and cbz 0 2 mg l 1 as the target pollutant the degradation of the mixed pollutants including indomethacin idm

scientific inc usa equipped with a diode array detector and a syncronis c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 μm thermo fisher during the pollutants degradation experiments the bdd electrode was used as an anode with area 2 3 cm2 the same area prepared modified gf cathode was used a cathode and pure o2 was supplied into the electrolyte solution at a constant flow rate to keep the solution saturated with o2 2 6 radicals capture experiments to comprehensively study the reactive species generated in the system radical capture experiments were conducted in the single chamber and double chamber electrolyzers respectively the single chamber system contained the na2so4 0 1 m 50 ml electrolyte with the operation current at 11 ma cm 2 a proton exchange membrane was used in the double chamber system to separate the two electrodes 0 1 m na2so4 the current density at 3 ma cm 2 oxygen was continuously purged into the solution to ensure the o2 saturated environment oh and so4 were measured by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy epr bruker bruker emxplus germany with dmpo as trapping agent 2 7 quantitative investigation of oh and so4 radicals the ba and nb were used as the radical probe to determine the steady state concentrations of so4 and oh respectively wang et al 2021 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical performances of the bdd electrode the electrochemical properties of bdd electrode were explored by cv fig s3 shows the cv curves obtained by scanning potential initially from 2 5 v to 3 0 v followed by a scan to negative potentials 2 5 v the cv curve in 0 1 m na2so4 electrolyte showed an intense and broad peak in the first scan at 2 4 v corresponding to the electro generation of pds eq 6 moreover the cv curve in 0 1 m nano3 showed a weaker oxidation peak at the similar potential the peak appearing before the intense oxygen evolution oer reaction peak was reported to be related to the water oxidation reaction to form oh eq 1 via the surface redox couple of bdd electrode it was reported that there was an indirect reaction process for generation of pds according to electrode surface radicals mediated reaction as presented in following equations hippauf et al 2014 irkham et al 2016 6 2 s o 4 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 e 7 bdd h 2 o bdd oh h e 8 bdd oh so 4 2 bdd s o 4 o h 9 bdd so 4 so 4 2 bdd s 2 o 8 2 e the h2o is first oxidized to form oh at the bdd electrode the formed oh has a weak interaction with bdd electrode surface so that eq 1 is formally written as eq 7 the bdd oh reacts with na2so4 in solution to form bdd so4 eq 8 the bdd so4 reacts with na2so4 in solution to form s2o8 2 eq 9 the sulfate radical based reaction eq 10 has been verified to be another pathway for pds production matzek et al 2018 shin et al 2020 10 s o 4 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 3 2 characterization of prepared gf cathode fig s4 and fig 1a showed the sem images of pristine gf fig s4a pani gf fig s4b cpani gf 700 fig s4c fig 1a the pristine gf showed a relatively smooth surface while the pani gf surface was covered by a polymeric layer indicating that the formation of pani after calcination pani was carbonized and some particles were generated on the surface of cpani gf 700 the electrodes calcined at different temperatures 800 c fig s4d and 600 c fig s4e also showed similar characteristics the electrodeposited materials on the gf surface were evaluated by xrd and the results were shown in fig 1b the pristine gf sample showed only a broad diffraction peak at 24 ascribed to the graphitic plane 002 the pani gf sample exhibited three diffraction peaks at around 24 20 7 and 25 2 corresponding to the graphitic 002 plane the 020 plane and 200 plane of pani indicating that the formation of polyaniline liu et al 2021 similar to pristine gf sample cpani gf t samples showed only a broad diffraction peak at 24 ascribed to graphitic plane 002 suggesting that pani was completely carbonized raman spectra were obtained to discern the structure and crystallization of the electrode surface by examining the bonding states of carbon atoms in these given carbon materials as shown in fig 1c the appearance of d band at 1330 cm 1 and g band at 1570 cm 1 standing for the disordered carbon and graphitic carbon respectively indicates the surface graphite feature of electrodes compared with pristine gf cpani gf t had higher id ig values and the value of id ig increased from 0 97 to 1 03 as the calcination temperature increased from 600 c to 700 c implying that more defects are introduced into the electrode surface which might be beneficial to the catalytic performance nevertheless with the further increase of calcination temperature the id ig value decreased from 1 03 to 0 99 indicating that rising annealed temperatures could promote the formation of intrinsic defects but also lead to the recombination of defects this phenomenon was due to the combination of isolated graphitic domains with each other thus reducing the content of edges defects gao et al 2020 miao et al 2022 mun et al 2019 ftir was used to explore the functional groups of the electrode surfaces as shown in fig 1d the pristine gf pani gf and cpani gf 700 showed similar absorption peaks at 1536 cm 1 and 1640 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of c n aromatic cc and c c respectively liu et al 2021 the pani gf presented characteristic peaks at 799 cm 1 aromatic ch out of plane deformation vibration of 1 4 disubstituted benzene ring and γ ch in linear pani backbone 1035 cm 1 co c 1140 cm 1 bnh q stretching 3200 cm 1 oh stretching vibration for oh 3400 cm 1 oh stretching vibration for cooh chen et al 2017 kuang et al 2019 liu et al 2021 the appearance of these functional groups may be due to the formation of polyaniline and other oxygen containing functional groups by electro polymerization nevertheless the characteristic peaks at 799 cm 1 1035 cm 1 and 1140 cm 1 were disappeared in the ftir spectra of cpani gf 700 notably there was a broad peak at 1340 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of cn after the carbonization of 700 c yin et al 2010 cpani gf 700 showed two broad peaks at 1340 cm 1 and 1536 cm 1 corresponding to the d band disordered graphite and g band graphite like indrawirawan et al 2015 indicating that the nitrogen doped carbon was successfully fabricated on the surface of the cpani gf 700 in contrast there was no an obvious peak at 1340 cm 1 after the carbonization of 600 c and 800 c as shown in fig s5 it indicated that carbonization of 700 c was more favorable for the doping of nitrogen species at the higher temperature the formed cn bonds were broken while the at lower temperature the reconstruction of the c and n atoms were not completed indrawirawan et al 2015 chen et al 2018 xps was used to explore the composition and chemical states of electrode surfaces the xps spectra fig s6a showed the pristine gf was mainly composed of c and o the distinct n1s peaks in the pani gf and cpani gf t samples originated from the nitrogen atoms in the polyaniline electrodeposited on the surface of gf and the carbonized polyaniline respectively the high resolution n1s spectra of pani gf fig s6b showed that four typical characteristic peaks located at 399 7 ev 400 5 ev 401 9 ev and 398 6 ev corresponding to benzoid amine nh amine nh imine species nh2 and quinoid imine n respectively chen et al 2018 gao et al 2020 mao et al 2021 fig s7 showed that after carbonization at different temperature a significant peak appeared at 284 5 ev c c attributed to graphitic sp2 c atoms indicating that polyaniline electropolymerized on the surface of gf was successfully carbonized the content of graphitized carbon exceeded 70 in addition two significant peaks appeared at 286 2 and 289 5 ev could be ascribed to cn and oxidized carbon respectively meanwhile the n1s spectra of cpani gf 600 fig 2c cpani gf 700 fig 2a and cpani gf 800 fig 2d can be fitted to four characteristic peaks located at 398 8 ev 400 5 ev 401 5 ev and 402 8 ev corresponding to pyridinic n pyrrolic n graphitic n and nitric oxide respectively chen et al 2018 gao et al 2020 mao et al 2021 after pani gf was carbonized the n content decreased from 8 4 pani gf to 5 52 cpani gf 800 with the increase of temperature table 1 which could be attributed to the breaking of c n bond at higher calcination temperature however increasing the calcination temperature cause the increase of graphitic n in the carbon network from 0 83 cpani gf 600 to 1 58 cpani gf 700 and eventually to 0 92 for cpani gf 800 it was reported that graphitic nitrogen atoms facilitated the electro generation of h2o2 while the pyridine nitrogen atoms served as the active catalytic sites to split h2o2 to generate oh jiang et al 2014 su et al 2019 wang et al 2015 the o2 reduction reaction potential is important parameter to evaluate the h2o2 generation efficiency jiao et al 2020 to explore the orr performance and h2o2 generation efficiency of pristine gf and cpani gf t cv experiments were carried in the presence of saturated n2 and o2 as shown in fig 3a under the n2 saturation condition the current generated by the cpani gf t electrodes were negligible indicating that nearly no reactions happen on the electrode surfaces however under the o2 saturation condition the reduction current for cpani gf t were obviously higher compared with n2 saturation condition in addition the cpani gf 700 showed the highest reduction current compared with cpani gf 600 and cpani gf 800 indicating that cpani gf 700 has the best catalytic o2 reduction performance as shown in fig 3b compared to pristine gf the cpani gf 700 showed also the higher reduction current implying that cpani gf 700 showed the better catalytic o2 reduction performance wang et al 2015 yue et al 2018 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was used to study the interfacial properties of electrode samples in the nyquist plots of fig s8a the smaller semicircle diameter means the smaller charge transfer resistance which is critical for electrocatalytic performance kong et al 2015 yan et al 2020 clearly it can be seen that the cpani gf 700 exhibited the smallest resistance indicating that the electrode carbonized at 700 is more favorable for the electron transfer moreover cpani gf 700 had the highest peak current which was 9 3 times higher than that of pristine gf in the cv curve of fe3 fe2 redox couple fig s8b it showed a remarkable increase in the electro active surface area yang et al 2017 3 3 synergistic generation of pds and h2o2 to confirm the anodic generation of pds and the cathodic production of h2o2 a double chamber reactor involving a bdd anode and a cpani gf 700 cathode separated by the proton exchange membrane was employed the mass transfer of pds h2o2 and the pollutant cbz between the two chambers was prohibited by membrane fig s9 the pds concentration in the anode chamber and the h2o2 concentration in cathode chamber were measured respectively at different sulfate concentration and current density as shown in fig s10a with the sulfate concentration increasing from 0 05 m to 0 2 m at the current density of 2 ma cm 2 the generated h2o2 increased from 0 4 mm to 1 5 mm along with the pds increasing from 0 65 mm to 1 6 mm within 90 min this could be because the higher na2so4 concentration results in the enhanced conductivity of the electrolyte and more precursor sulfates to form pds as shown in fig s10b at the constant na2so4 concentration 0 1 m initial increases in current density from 1 ma cm 2 to 3 ma cm 2 lead to a significant increase in h2o2 0 38 mm to 1 3 mm and pds 0 47 mm to 1 6 mm concentrations however increasing the current density beyond 3 ma cm 2 provides the decrease in both h2o2 and pds concentrations as the higher current density possibly favored the reduction of o2 to h2o instead of h2o2 at the cathode and the oxidation of h2o instead of sulfates to o2 at the anode zheng et al 2021 3 4 catalytic performance towards the degradation of emerging contaminants to investigate the performances of combined so4 and oh radicals towards the degradation of persistent organic pollutants the catalytic system was employed to treat the cbz contaminated prepared water samples to meet the potential practical applications a single chamber reactor was used fig s11 exhibited the degradation efficiency of cbz using bdd anode couples with different cathodes the degradation curves were fit assuming a pseudo first order model to determine the relevant kinetic parameters fig 4a and b apparently the rate constant k obs increased from 0 0046 to 0 0220 s 1 as the calcination temperature of electrode increased from 0 to 700 c however the further higher calcination temperature 800 c slightly decreased cbz degradation rate to be 0 0179 s 1 although the cpani gf 600 is of higher nitrogen content than cpani gf 700 its catalytic performance towards oxygen reduction and pollutant degradation are lower it might be due to the relatively low graphite n content which is conducive to electrocatalytic oxygen reduction to produce h2o2 haider et al 2019 wang et al 2015 interestingly the pristine gf cathode yielded a considerable cbz degradation efficiency fig 4a according to fig s12 the pristine gf is incapable of generating oh radicals because of lacking pyridine n thus the corresponding cbz degradation might be caused by the reactive species generated from the anodic reactions clearly indicating the advantage of the integrated catalytic system the bdd anode coupled cpani gf 700 cathode system was used for the subsequent studies to investigate the correlation between the catalytic performance and the interfacial electron transfer efficiency we performed the cbz degradation process at different applied current densities which are shown in fig s13 with the current density increased from 9 ma to 11 ma cm 2 the k obs of cbz degradation increased from 0 00539 s 1 to 0 0221 s 1 which is due to the enhanced electron transfer efficiency at higher current densities fig 4c and d however even higher current density significantly accelerated the oxygen evolution reactions at the anode and hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode resulting in the lower cbz degradation rate 0 0134 s 1 at 12 ma cm 2 the effect of ph value on the catalytic performance of the integrated system were also investigated in fig s14 at ph 1 the degradation kinetics was noticeably inhibited because the generated h2o2 was further reduced to h2o khataee et al 2013 with the ph ranging from 3 0 to 7 0 the catalytic performance showed no obvious changes as shown in fig s15 the degradation of mixed pollutants was also investigated the catalytic system is capable of efficiently degrading many common organic contaminants although the degradation rate for different pollutants is different the stability of catalytic system for representative pollutant cbz degradation was examined by 20 consecutive cbz degradation experiments at the highest current density applied 11 ma cm 2 it shows no obvious decline in the degradation efficiency after being reused for 20 times fig s16 indicating that the catalytic system was stable and reusable for electrochemical degradation of ppcps as shown in fig s17 and table 1 after 20 cycles of cyclic reaction the content of various n species did not change significantly before and after measurement indicating that the prepared electrode has superior stability 3 5 proposed pathway of cbz degradation ten main degradation byproducts were observed in bdd anode coupled with cpani 700 gf cathode table s2 fig s18 identification of products and their fragment ions was presented in table s1 3 6 potential electrocatalysis mechanism the correlation between the amount of the active nitrogen species in the catalysts determined from the xps data and the h2o generation decomposition process was investigated as shown in fig s19 the generated h2o2 increased from 0 32 mm for pristine gf 0 graphite n to 1 30 mm for cpani gf 700 1 58 graphite n indicating that graphite n could be the active sites for catalyzing the reduction of oxygen to h2o2 fig s19a to determine the active sites to decompose h2o2 for oh generation different electrodes with various pyridine n contents were immersed into the h2o2 aqueous solution 1 mm for 60 min then the residual h2o2 was measured respectively as shown in fig s19b the h2o2 content decreased from 0 98 mm for pristine gf 0 pyridine n to 0 12 mm for cpani gf 800 2 25 pyridine n implying that pyridine n could be the active sites of h2o2 activation the contributions of the electrolyte anode and cathode for the cbz degradation process were then systematically investigated firstly the electrocatalytic reactions were performed in the presence of nano3 naclo4 and na2so4 electrolytes respectively all the solutions were adjusted to be at 16 2 ms cm 1 to avoid the effect of the conductivity the cbz degradation kinetics were monitored in fig s20 with the corresponding reaction constants shown in fig 5a and b the k obs obtained from the na2so4 naclo4 and nano3 electrolytes were determined to be 0 0242 s 1 0 00835 s 1 and 0 0064 s 1 respectively which suggests that sulfates might be activated by the electrodes to generate additional so4 to degrade more cbz molecules secondly both perchlorate and nitrate ions are inert during anode oxidation process it clearly indicated that bdd anode activated sulfate to generate so4 the dependence of degradation of cbz on electrolytes by a bdd anode fig s21a and a cpani gf 700 cathode fig s21b has also been explored respectively as shown in fig s21a the cbz degradation efficiency reduced from complete degradation na2so4 electrolyte to only 60 2 nano3 electrolyte within 6 min by a bdd anode it may also be due to be that bdd anode can activate sulfate into so4 and cannot activate nano3 to form radicals in addition in nano3 and na2so4 electrolytes backgrounds the cbz still has a degradation efficiency of about 10 within 6 min when the radical quencher methanol was added this may be due to the direct electron transfer of cbz at the anode as shown in fig s21b the electrolytes had no obvious effect on the degradation of cbz by a cpani gf 700 cathode indicating that the cathode can not activate na2so4 to form radicals in addition adding the radical quencher methanol the cbz degradation efficiency is about zero indicating that cbz can not be degraded by direct electron transfer at the cathode as shown in fig s22 the effect of the electrode configuration on the cbz degradation reaction kinetics have been analyzed three different electrode configurations including pt anode cpani gf 700 cathode bdd anode pt cathode and bdd anode cpani gf 700 cathode were used to degraded to pollutant solution respectively the degradation kinetic constant of the synergistic system was 1 32 compared to 0 38 for bdd anode cpani gf 700 cathode and 0 41 for bdd anode pt cathode to confirm that the pds generated by bdd anode can be reduced at the cathode the cvs were conducted as shown in fig 5c for 0 1 m na2so4 electrolyte and electrolytes of 0 1 m na2so4 and 1 mm cbz there were no significant differences about the cv curves indicating that cbz was not directly reduced by getting electron at the cathode an irreversible reduction peak was observed for electrolytes 0 1 m na2so4 and 1 mm pds and electrolytes 0 1 m na2so4 1 mm pds and 1 mm cbz in addition there was stronger reduction peak current for electrolytes 0 1 m na2so4 1 mm pds and 1 mm cbz this indicated a direct pds electrochemical cathode activation for cbz degradation yao et al 2021 the chronoamperometry was conducted to explore the possible electrochemical reaction of the cathode as seen in fig 5d adding cbz 1 mm at 50 s did not cause obvious change in the current output in contrast the current output had significantly changed due to the addition of pds 1 mm at 100 s the above results further confirm that cbz was not directly reduced by getting electron at the cathode and pds can be directly activated by electrons from the cathode for cbz degradation the qualitative and quantitative analysis of reactive species was valuated by quenching experiments epr and radical probe experiments the quenching experiments were performed using methanol and tert butanol tba as the radical quenchers methanol has the similar reaction rate for so4 and oh k so4 1 0 107 m 1 s 1 k oh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 whereas tba lacking α hydrogen has the higher reactivity toward oh than so4 by a 3 orders of magnitude greater reaction rate constant k so4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 k oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 song et al 2018 2017 fig s23 exhibited the inhibition effects of methanol and tba on cbz degradation efficiency in the single chamber reactor the cbz degradation kinetics and the corresponding kinetics constants were shown in fig 6a and b in the presence of tba the cbz degradation was suppressed relative to that without alcohol the kinetic constant for cbz degradation was 0 0088 s 1 with the addition of 1 m tba and it further decreased to 0 0082 s 1 at 1 5 m of tba as compared to that of 0 0221 s 1 without alcohol the reduced degradation efficiency induced by tba indicated oh contributed to cbz degradation similarly the kinetic constant for cbz degradation was 0 00115 s 1 with the addition of 1 m methanol and it further reduced to 0 00092 s 1 at 1 5 m methanol the markedly decreased degradation efficiency in methanol compared to tba implied that so4 generated via sulfate activation process also made the contribution for the degradation of cbz to investigate the radical pathways in the bdd anode coupled cpani gf 700 cathode system the radicals produced in the double chamber and single chamber electrolyzer systems were further valuated by dmpo spin trap epr spectroscopy respectively for double chamber system as seen in fig 6c the epr spectrum of electrolyte around the anode exhibited four typical peaks with the intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 corresponding to the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh complex meanwhile so4 is also detectable due to the appearance of a specific signal of dmpo so4 complex around the anode shin et al 2019 2020 as mentioned above so4 may be derived from the oxidation of sulfate on the surface of bdd electrode oh may come from the oxidation of h2o on the surface of bdd electrode and the reaction of so4 with h2o the epr spectrum of electrolyte around cpani gf 700 cathode only exhibited dmpo oh complex characteristic peaks this could be that generated h2o2 is activated by pyridine n to form oh which is consistent with the xps results above for single chamber system as seen in fig 6d the same epr spectrum of electrolyte around the anode are noted with double chamber system however compared with double chamber system the epr spectrum of electrolyte around the cathode of single chamber system exhibited not only the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh complex but also characteristic peaks of dmpo so4 complex as mentioned above this could be because the pds produced at the anode is reduced at the cathode to form so4 the quasi steady state concentrations of oh and so4 in the electrocatalytic system is also investigated using nb and ba as radical probes as well known the nb mainly reacted with oh k oh nb 3 9 109 m 1s 1 but barely with so4 k so4 nb 1 106 m 1 the concentrations of ho in the system were determined using 0 2 μm nb as a probe the ba reacted with both oh k oh ba 4 2 109 m 1s 1 and so4 k so4 ba 12 109 m 1s 1 the concentrations of so4 in the system were determined using 0 2 μm nb and 0 2 μm ba as the probes the degradation of nb and ba in the presence of 1 5 m methanol were used to quantify the contribution of nonradical oxidation fig s24 exhibited the inhibition effects of methanol on nb and ba degradation efficiency the nb and ba degradation kinetics and the corresponding kinetics constants were shown in fig 6e and f the degradation of nb can be expressed by eqs 12 13 12 d nb dt k oh nb nb oh ss k meoh nb 13 ln nb n b 0 k oh nb oh ss t k meoh t k obs t where k oh nb is the reaction rate constant of oh with nb and taken as 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 thus the concentration of oh can be calculated using the following eq 14 14 oh ss k obs k meoh k nb oh 0 372 0 252 3 9 10 9 60 m 0 51 10 12 m the approach to determine the steady state concentrations of so4 in the system was similar to that of oh except that the probe compound was ba thus nb was added together with ba to calculate the contribution from oh the degradation of ba can be described by the eqs 15 16 15 d ba dt k oh ba ba oh ss k s o 4 ba ba oh ss k meoh ba 16 ln ba b a 0 k s o 4 ba s o 4 ss k oh ba oh ss k meoh t k obs t where k so4 ba is the reaction rate constant of so4 with ba and taken as 1 2 10 9 m 1 s 1 thus the concentration of so4 can be calculated using the following eq 17 17 s o 4 ss k obs k oh ba oh ss k meoh k s o 4 ba 0 0031 4 2 10 9 0 51 10 12 0 000325 1 2 10 9 0 56 10 12 m based on the above results the possible catalysis mechanism of bdd anode coupled cpani gf 700 cathode system was proposed below the bdd anode can oxidize so4 2 to generate so4 and bdd so4 to degrade pollutants two so4 can react to form pds and bdd so4 can reacts with so4 2 to form pds the pds was reduced by electrons at the cathode to form so4 meanwhile the bdd anode can oxidize h2o to generate oh and bdd oh to degrade pollutants bdd oh can also reacts with so4 2 to form so4 cathode graphite n promoted o2 two electron reduction to generate h2o2 which was activated by pyridine n to generate oh 4 conclusion in this work the gf electrode was in situ modified using pani derived n doped carbon catalyst without any binder the bdd anode coupled modified gf cathode system was constructed regarding the anodic reactions sulfate ions were oxidized to produce so4 and pds respectively then the as generated pds ions were reduced back to so4 radicals at the cathode as of the cathodic reactions dissolved oxygen molecules were reduced via a two electron process to produce h2o2 which was catalyzed by the graphitic n on the cathode followed by the in situ formation of oh radicals from the splitting of as prepared h2o2 catalyzed by the pyridinic n on the cathode the optimized system involving the bdd anode coupled cpani gf 700 cathode showed exhibited complete degradation efficiency of cbz within 150 s the synergistic electrocatalysis system indicates great

15238,conventional electrocatalytic degradation of pollutants involves either cathodic reduction or anodic oxidation process which caused the low energy utilization efficiency in this study we successfully couple the anodic activation of sulfates with the cathodic h2o2 production activation to boost the generation of sulfate radical so4 and hydroxyl radical oh for the efficient degradation of emerging contaminants the electrocatalysis reactor is composed of a modified graphite felt gf cathode in situ prepared by the carbonization of polyaniline pani electrodeposited on a gf substrate and a boron doped diamond bdd anode in the presence of sulfates the electrocatalysis system shows superior activities towards the degradation of pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps with the optimal performance of completely degrading the representative pollutant carbamazepine cbz 0 2 mg l 1 within 150 s radicals quenching experiments indicated that oh and so4 act as the main reactive oxygen species for cbz decomposition results from the electron paramagnetic resonance epr and chronoamperometry studies verified that the sulfate ions were oxidized to so4 radicals at the anode while the dissolve oxygen molecules were reduced to h2o2 molecules which were further activated to produce oh radicals at the cathode it was also found that during the catalytic reactions so4 radicals could spontaneously convert into peroxydisulfate pds which were subsequently reduced back to so4 at the cathodes the quasi steady state concentrations of oh and so4 were estimated to be 0 51 10 12 m and 0 56 10 12 m respectively this study provides insight into the synergistic generation of oh so4 from the integrated electrochemical anode oxidation of sulfate and cathode reduction of dissolved oxygen which indicates a potential practical approach to efficiently degrade the emerging organic water contaminants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfate oxidation persulfate

personal care products ppcps have been detected in natural environments and wastewater due to the abuse and large emission seriously threatening the ecosystem and human health chen et al 2018 liu et al 2021 yu et al 2021 the conventional activated sludge method cannot effectively degrade ppcps in wastewater resulting in the accumulation in aquatic environment myrsini et al 2016 electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops have been widely used to degrade the refractory organic compounds due to the generation of powerful and non selective oxidants in the reaction process shin et al 2019 generally eaops can be divided into the anodic oxidation and cathodic electro fenton for the anodic oxidation process indirect electrochemical oxidation involving hydroxyl radical oh formed at the metal oxide anodes sno2 pbo2 etc eq 1 is more efficient than the direct oxidation for the degradation of organic water contaminants kuang et al 2019 farhat et al 2015 1 h 2 o oh h e recently much effort has been focused on the anodic oxidation of sulfates to produce so4 which is thermodynamically more powerful than oh due to its longer lifetime so4 30 40 μs oh 1 μs and higher oxidizing

water indicating great potentials to the practical applications it was reported that electrochemical activation of sulfates to produce so4 eq 2 and the derived oh eq 3 can occur at the boron doped diamond bdd anode ganiyu and el din 2020 and the electrocatalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin was significantly enhanced in the presence of sulfate containing electrolyte compared with the nitrate containing electrolyte clearly indicating the contribution of so4 from the anodic reactions matzek et al 2018 2 s o 4 2 s o 4 e 3 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 oh h regarding the cathodic reactions the organic contaminants can be degraded through the direct electron transfer process another approach is to employ the electro fenton process to generate oh eqs 4 5 for the organic contaminant degradation haider et al 2019 kuang et al 2021 olvera vargas et al 2021 4 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 5 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 oh o h electrochemical generation of oh from cathode via electro fenton or so4 from anode via sulfate oxidation offers a greener and safer route for radical production however the current electrochemical production efficiency of oh and so4 from one side reaction is still relatively low a promising solution is to employ the full cell production of oh and so4 by coupling anodic sulfate activation and cathodic electro fenton however there are few reports regarding synergistic cathodic anodic electrocatalysis technology for pollutant degradation because of the mismatch between the anode and cathode working potentials the ferrous ions oxidized by anode and the h2o2 oxidized by the anode kuang et al 2021 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 although li et al li et al 2021 previously integrated the anodic oxidation reactions with the cathodic oxygen reduction reactions and reached an overall faradaic efficiency of 161 it is still a great challenge to develop the synergistic electrocatalysis technology recently metal free carbon based materials has become a promising green alternative to the transition metal based catalysts due to its great resistance to the acid and base abundance tunable electronic and physicochemical properties and less hazards gao et al 2020 therefore carbon based materials have been used in cathode electrocatalysts and exhibited excellent performance he et al 2020 peng et al 2021 yuan et al 2020 however most of carbon based catalysts are in powder form and need to be supported on the catalyst matrix by polymer binders which would decrease conductivity and active sites of electrodes in addition the adhesive electrode will become unstable after the long term operation and the catalyst may detach from the electrode reducing the catalytic activity of the electrode and causing secondary pollution therefore it is urgent to develop the stable non adherent electrode zhou et al 2019 as polyaniline pani showed great potentials in covalently binding with the anode materials and serving as the precursor for the carbon materials khan et al 2018 it is important to develop pani derived metal free catalyst in the electrocatalysis system in this study we report a synergistic electrocatalytic system by coupling the bdd anode with the graphite felt gf cathode modified from pani derived n doped carbon catalyst using na2so4 as the electrolyte the anode and cathode synergistically generate oh and so4 to degrade ppcps pollutants in wastewater more importantly we quantitatively measured the concentration of oh and so4 in the presence of the combined oh and so4 radicals the refractory pollutants were more efficiently degraded 2

electrocatalytic degradation of ppcps pollutants to construct the electrocatalytic system bdd 2 3 cm2 and cpani gf electrodes were used as the anode and the cathode respectively during the degradation process oxygen was continuously purged into the solution to ensure the o2 saturated environment for the electrocatalytic degradation of representative ppcps pollutant carbamazepine cbz a single chamber electrolytic cell 100 ml was used with the na2so4 50 ml 0 1 m as the electrolyte and cbz 0 2 mg l 1 as the target pollutant the degradation of the mixed pollutants including indomethacin idm

with area 2 3 cm2 the same area prepared modified gf cathode was used a cathode and pure o2 was supplied into the electrolyte solution at a constant flow rate to keep the solution saturated with o2 2 6 radicals capture experiments to comprehensively study the reactive species generated in the system radical capture experiments were conducted in the single chamber and double chamber electrolyzers respectively the single chamber system contained the na2so4 0 1 m 50 ml electrolyte with the operation current at 11 ma cm 2 a proton exchange membrane was used in the double chamber system to separate the two electrodes 0 1 m na2so4 the current density at 3 ma cm 2 oxygen was continuously purged into the solution to ensure the o2 saturated environment oh and so4 were measured by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy epr bruker bruker emxplus germany with dmpo as trapping agent 2 7 quantitative investigation of oh and so4 radicals the ba and nb were used as the radical probe to determine the steady state concentrations of so4 and oh respectively wang et al 2021 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical performances of the bdd electrode the electrochemical properties of bdd electrode were explored by cv fig s3 shows the cv curves obtained by scanning potential initially from 2 5 v to 3 0 v followed by a scan to negative potentials 2 5 v the cv curve in 0 1 m na2so4 electrolyte showed an intense and broad peak in the first scan at 2 4 v corresponding to the electro generation of pds eq 6 moreover the cv curve in 0 1 m nano3 showed a weaker oxidation peak at the similar potential the peak appearing before the intense oxygen evolution oer reaction peak was reported to be related to the water oxidation reaction to form oh eq 1 via the surface redox couple of bdd electrode it was reported that there was an indirect reaction process for generation of pds according to electrode surface radicals mediated reaction as presented in following equations hippauf et al 2014 irkham et al 2016 6 2 s o 4 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 e 7 bdd h 2 o bdd oh h e 8 bdd oh so 4 2 bdd s o 4 o h 9 bdd so 4 so 4 2 bdd s 2 o 8 2 e the h2o is first oxidized to form oh at the bdd electrode the formed oh has a weak interaction with bdd electrode surface so that eq 1 is formally written as eq 7 the bdd oh reacts with na2so4 in solution to form bdd so4 eq 8 the bdd so4 reacts with na2so4 in solution to form s2o8 2 eq 9 the sulfate radical based reaction eq 10 has been verified to be another pathway for pds production matzek et al 2018 shin et al 2020 10 s o 4 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 3 2 characterization of prepared gf cathode fig s4 and fig 1a showed the sem images of pristine gf fig s4a pani gf fig s4b cpani gf 700 fig s4c fig 1a the pristine gf showed a relatively smooth surface while the pani gf surface was covered by a polymeric layer indicating that the formation of pani after calcination pani was carbonized and some particles were generated on the surface of cpani gf 700 the electrodes calcined at different temperatures 800 c fig s4d and 600 c fig s4e also showed similar characteristics the electrodeposited materials on the gf surface were evaluated by xrd and the results were shown in fig 1b the pristine gf sample showed only a broad diffraction peak at 24 ascribed to the graphitic plane 002 the pani gf sample exhibited three diffraction peaks at around 24 20 7 and 25 2 corresponding to the graphitic 002 plane the 020 plane and 200 plane of pani indicating that the formation of polyaniline liu et al 2021 similar to pristine gf sample cpani gf t samples showed only a broad diffraction peak at 24 ascribed to graphitic plane 002 suggesting that pani was completely carbonized raman spectra were obtained to discern the structure and crystallization of the electrode surface by examining the bonding states of carbon atoms in these given carbon materials as shown in fig 1c the appearance of d band at 1330 cm 1 and g band at 1570 cm 1 standing for the disordered carbon and graphitic carbon respectively indicates the surface graphite feature of electrodes compared with pristine gf cpani gf t had higher id ig values and the value of id ig increased from 0 97 to 1 03 as the calcination temperature increased from 600 c to 700 c implying that more defects are introduced into the electrode surface which might be beneficial to the catalytic performance nevertheless with the further increase of calcination temperature the id ig value decreased from 1 03 to 0 99 indicating that rising annealed temperatures could promote the formation of intrinsic defects but also lead to the recombination of defects this phenomenon was due to the combination of isolated graphitic domains with each other thus reducing the content of edges defects gao et al 2020 miao et al 2022 mun et al 2019 ftir was used to explore the functional groups of the electrode surfaces as shown in fig 1d the pristine gf pani gf and cpani gf 700 showed similar absorption peaks at 1536 cm 1 and 1640 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of c n aromatic cc and c c respectively liu et al 2021 the pani gf presented characteristic peaks at 799 cm 1 aromatic ch out of plane deformation vibration of 1 4 disubstituted benzene ring and γ ch in linear pani backbone 1035 cm 1 co c 1140 cm 1 bnh q stretching 3200 cm 1 oh stretching vibration for oh 3400 cm 1 oh stretching vibration for cooh chen et al 2017 kuang et al 2019 liu et al 2021 the appearance of these functional groups may be due to the formation of polyaniline and other oxygen containing functional groups by electro polymerization nevertheless the characteristic peaks at 799 cm 1 1035 cm 1 and 1140 cm 1 were disappeared in the ftir spectra of cpani gf 700 notably there was a broad peak at 1340 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of cn after the carbonization of 700 c yin et al 2010 cpani gf 700 showed two broad peaks at 1340 cm 1 and 1536 cm 1 corresponding to the d band disordered graphite and g band graphite like indrawirawan et al 2015 indicating that the nitrogen doped carbon was successfully fabricated on the surface of the cpani gf 700 in contrast there was no an obvious peak at 1340 cm 1 after the carbonization of 600 c and 800 c as shown in fig s5 it indicated that carbonization of 700 c was more favorable for the doping of nitrogen species at the higher temperature the formed cn bonds were broken while the at lower temperature the reconstruction of the c and n atoms were not completed indrawirawan et al 2015 chen et al 2018 xps was used to explore the composition and chemical states of electrode surfaces the xps spectra fig s6a showed the pristine gf was mainly composed of c and o the distinct n1s peaks in the pani gf and cpani gf t samples originated from the nitrogen atoms in the polyaniline electrodeposited on the surface of gf and the carbonized polyaniline respectively the high resolution n1s spectra of pani gf fig s6b showed that four typical characteristic peaks located at 399 7 ev 400 5 ev 401 9 ev and 398 6 ev corresponding to benzoid amine nh amine nh imine species nh2 and quinoid imine n respectively chen et al 2018 gao et al 2020 mao et al 2021 fig s7 showed that after carbonization at different temperature a significant peak appeared at 284 5 ev c c attributed to graphitic sp2 c atoms indicating that polyaniline electropolymerized on the surface of gf was successfully carbonized the content of graphitized carbon exceeded 70 in addition two significant peaks appeared at 286 2 and 289 5 ev could be ascribed to cn and oxidized carbon respectively meanwhile the n1s spectra of cpani gf 600 fig 2c cpani gf 700 fig 2a and cpani gf 800 fig 2d can be fitted to four characteristic peaks located at 398 8 ev 400 5 ev 401 5 ev and 402 8 ev corresponding to pyridinic n pyrrolic n graphitic n and nitric oxide respectively chen et al 2018 gao et al 2020 mao et al 2021 after pani gf was carbonized the n content decreased from 8 4 pani gf to 5 52 cpani gf 800 with the increase of temperature table 1 which could be attributed to the breaking of c n bond at higher calcination temperature however increasing the calcination temperature cause the increase of graphitic n in the carbon network from 0 83 cpani gf 600 to 1 58 cpani gf 700 and eventually to 0 92 for cpani gf 800 it was reported that graphitic nitrogen atoms facilitated the electro generation of h2o2 while the pyridine nitrogen atoms served as the active catalytic sites to split h2o2 to generate oh jiang et al 2014 su et al 2019 wang et al 2015 the o2 reduction reaction potential is important parameter to evaluate the h2o2 generation efficiency jiao et al 2020 to explore the orr performance and h2o2 generation efficiency of pristine gf and cpani gf t cv experiments were carried in the presence of saturated n2 and o2 as shown in fig 3a under the n2 saturation condition the current generated by the cpani gf t electrodes were negligible indicating that nearly no reactions happen on the electrode surfaces however under the o2 saturation condition the reduction current for cpani gf t were obviously higher compared with n2 saturation condition in addition the cpani gf 700 showed the highest reduction current compared with cpani gf 600 and cpani gf 800 indicating that cpani gf 700 has the best catalytic o2 reduction performance as shown in fig 3b compared to pristine gf the cpani gf 700 showed also the higher reduction current implying that cpani gf 700 showed the better catalytic o2 reduction performance wang et al 2015 yue et al 2018 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was used to study the interfacial properties of electrode samples in the nyquist plots of fig s8a the smaller semicircle diameter means the smaller charge transfer resistance which is critical for electrocatalytic performance kong et al 2015 yan et al 2020 clearly it can be seen that the cpani gf 700 exhibited the smallest resistance indicating that the electrode carbonized at 700 is more favorable for the electron transfer moreover cpani gf 700 had the highest peak current which was 9 3 times higher than that of pristine gf in the cv curve of fe3 fe2 redox couple fig s8b it showed a remarkable increase in the electro active surface area yang et al 2017 3 3 synergistic generation of pds and h2o2 to confirm the anodic generation of pds and the cathodic production of h2o2 a double chamber reactor involving a bdd anode and a cpani gf 700 cathode separated by the proton exchange membrane was employed the mass transfer of pds h2o2 and the pollutant cbz between the two chambers was prohibited by membrane fig s9 the pds concentration in the anode chamber and the h2o2 concentration in cathode chamber were measured respectively at different sulfate concentration and current density as shown in fig s10a with the sulfate concentration increasing from 0 05 m to 0 2 m at the current density of 2 ma cm 2 the generated h2o2 increased from 0 4 mm to 1 5 mm along with the pds increasing from 0 65 mm to 1 6 mm within 90 min this could be because the higher na2so4 concentration results in the enhanced conductivity of the electrolyte and more precursor sulfates to form pds as shown in fig s10b at the constant na2so4 concentration 0 1 m initial increases in current density from 1 ma cm 2 to 3 ma cm 2 lead to a significant increase in h2o2 0 38 mm to 1 3 mm and pds 0 47 mm to 1 6 mm concentrations however increasing the current density beyond 3 ma cm 2 provides the decrease in both h2o2 and pds concentrations as the higher current density possibly favored the reduction of o2 to h2o instead of h2o2 at the cathode and the oxidation of h2o instead of sulfates to o2 at the anode zheng et al 2021 3 4 catalytic performance towards the degradation of emerging contaminants to investigate the performances of combined so4 and oh radicals towards the degradation of persistent organic pollutants the catalytic system was employed to treat the cbz contaminated prepared water samples to meet the potential practical applications a single chamber reactor was used fig s11 exhibited the degradation efficiency of cbz using bdd anode couples with different cathodes the degradation curves were fit assuming a pseudo first order model to determine the relevant kinetic parameters fig 4a and b apparently the rate constant k obs increased from 0 0046 to 0 0220 s 1 as the calcination temperature of electrode increased from 0 to 700 c however the further higher calcination temperature 800 c slightly decreased cbz degradation rate to be 0 0179 s 1 although the cpani gf 600 is of higher nitrogen content than cpani gf 700 its catalytic performance towards oxygen reduction and pollutant degradation are lower it might be due to the relatively low graphite n content which is conducive to electrocatalytic oxygen reduction to produce h2o2 haider et al 2019 wang et al 2015 interestingly the pristine gf cathode yielded a considerable cbz degradation efficiency fig 4a according to fig s12 the pristine gf is incapable of generating oh radicals because of lacking pyridine n thus the corresponding cbz degradation might be caused by the reactive species generated from the anodic reactions clearly indicating the advantage of the integrated catalytic system the bdd anode coupled cpani gf 700 cathode system was used for the subsequent studies to investigate the correlation between the catalytic performance and the interfacial electron transfer efficiency we performed the cbz degradation process at different applied current densities which are shown in fig s13 with the current density increased from 9 ma to 11 ma cm 2 the k obs of cbz degradation increased from 0 00539 s 1 to 0 0221 s 1 which is due to the enhanced electron transfer efficiency at higher current densities fig 4c and d however even higher current density significantly accelerated the oxygen evolution reactions at the anode and hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode resulting in the lower cbz degradation rate 0 0134 s 1 at 12 ma cm 2 the effect of ph value on the catalytic performance of the integrated system were also investigated in fig s14 at ph 1 the degradation kinetics was noticeably inhibited because the generated h2o2 was further reduced to h2o khataee et al 2013 with the ph ranging from 3 0 to 7 0 the catalytic performance showed no obvious changes as shown in fig s15 the degradation of mixed pollutants was also investigated the catalytic system is capable of efficiently degrading many common organic contaminants although the degradation rate for different pollutants is different the stability of catalytic system for representative pollutant cbz degradation was examined by 20 consecutive cbz degradation experiments at the highest current density applied 11 ma cm 2 it shows no obvious decline in the degradation efficiency after being reused for 20 times fig s16 indicating that the catalytic system was stable and reusable for electrochemical degradation of ppcps as shown in fig s17 and table 1 after 20 cycles of cyclic reaction the content of various n species did not change significantly before and after measurement indicating that the prepared electrode has superior stability 3 5 proposed pathway of cbz degradation ten main degradation byproducts were observed in bdd anode coupled with cpani 700 gf cathode table s2 fig s18 identification of products and their fragment ions was presented in table s1 3 6 potential electrocatalysis mechanism the correlation between the amount of the active nitrogen species in the catalysts determined from the xps data and the h2o generation decomposition process was investigated as shown in fig s19 the generated h2o2 increased from 0 32 mm for pristine gf 0 graphite n to 1 30 mm for cpani gf 700 1 58 graphite n indicating that graphite n could be the active sites for catalyzing the reduction of oxygen to h2o2 fig s19a to determine the active sites to decompose h2o2 for oh generation different electrodes with various pyridine n contents were immersed into the h2o2 aqueous solution 1 mm for 60 min then the residual h2o2 was measured respectively as shown in fig s19b the h2o2 content decreased from 0 98 mm for pristine gf 0 pyridine n to 0 12 mm for cpani gf 800 2 25 pyridine n implying that pyridine n could be the active sites of h2o2 activation the contributions of the electrolyte anode and cathode for the cbz degradation process were then systematically investigated firstly the electrocatalytic reactions were performed in the presence of nano3 naclo4 and na2so4 electrolytes respectively all the solutions were adjusted to be at 16 2 ms cm 1 to avoid the effect of the conductivity the cbz degradation kinetics were monitored in fig s20 with the corresponding reaction constants shown in fig 5a and b the k obs obtained from the na2so4 naclo4 and nano3 electrolytes were determined to be 0 0242 s 1 0 00835 s 1 and 0 0064 s 1 respectively which suggests that sulfates might be activated by the electrodes to generate additional so4 to degrade more cbz molecules secondly both perchlorate and nitrate ions are inert during anode oxidation process it clearly indicated that bdd anode activated sulfate to generate so4 the dependence of degradation of cbz on electrolytes by a bdd anode fig s21a and a cpani gf 700 cathode fig s21b has also been explored respectively as shown in fig s21a the cbz degradation efficiency reduced from complete degradation na2so4 electrolyte to only 60 2 nano3 electrolyte within 6 min by a bdd anode it may also be due to be that bdd anode can activate sulfate into so4 and cannot activate nano3 to form radicals in addition in nano3 and na2so4 electrolytes backgrounds the cbz still has a degradation efficiency of about 10 within 6 min when the radical quencher methanol was added this may be due to the direct electron transfer of cbz at the anode as shown in fig s21b the electrolytes had no obvious effect on the degradation of cbz by a cpani gf 700 cathode indicating that the cathode can not activate na2so4 to form radicals in addition adding the radical quencher methanol the cbz degradation efficiency is about zero indicating that cbz can not be degraded by direct electron transfer at the cathode as shown in fig s22 the effect of the electrode configuration on the cbz degradation reaction kinetics have been analyzed three different electrode configurations including pt anode cpani gf 700 cathode bdd anode pt cathode and bdd anode cpani gf 700 cathode were used to degraded to pollutant solution respectively the degradation kinetic constant of the synergistic system was 1 32 compared to 0 38 for bdd anode cpani gf 700 cathode and 0 41 for bdd anode pt cathode to confirm that the pds generated by bdd anode can be reduced at the cathode the cvs were conducted as shown in fig 5c for 0 1 m na2so4 electrolyte and electrolytes of 0 1 m na2so4 and 1 mm cbz there were no significant differences about the cv curves indicating that cbz was not directly reduced by getting electron at the cathode an irreversible reduction peak was observed for electrolytes 0 1 m na2so4 and 1 mm pds and electrolytes 0 1 m na2so4 1 mm pds and 1 mm cbz in addition there was stronger reduction peak current for electrolytes 0 1 m na2so4 1 mm pds and 1 mm cbz this indicated a direct pds electrochemical cathode activation for cbz degradation yao et al 2021 the chronoamperometry was conducted to explore the possible electrochemical reaction of the cathode as seen in fig 5d adding cbz 1 mm at 50 s did not cause obvious change in the current output in contrast the current output had significantly changed due to the addition of pds 1 mm at 100 s the above results further confirm that cbz was not directly reduced by getting electron at the cathode and pds can be directly activated by electrons from the cathode for cbz degradation the qualitative and quantitative analysis of reactive species was valuated by quenching experiments epr and radical probe experiments the quenching experiments were performed using methanol and tert butanol tba as the radical quenchers methanol has the similar reaction rate for so4 and oh k so4 1 0 107 m 1 s 1 k oh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 whereas tba lacking α hydrogen has the higher reactivity toward oh than so4 by a 3 orders of magnitude greater reaction rate constant k so4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 k oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 song et al 2018 2017 fig s23 exhibited the inhibition effects of methanol and tba on cbz degradation efficiency in the single chamber reactor the cbz degradation kinetics and the corresponding kinetics constants were shown in fig 6a and b in the presence of tba the cbz degradation was suppressed relative to that without alcohol the kinetic constant for cbz degradation was 0 0088 s 1 with the addition of 1 m tba and it further decreased to 0 0082 s 1 at 1 5 m of tba as compared to that of 0 0221 s 1 without alcohol the reduced degradation efficiency induced by tba indicated oh contributed to cbz degradation similarly the kinetic constant for cbz degradation was 0 00115 s 1 with the addition of 1 m methanol and it further reduced to 0 00092 s 1 at 1 5 m methanol the markedly decreased degradation efficiency in methanol compared to tba implied that so4 generated via sulfate activation process also made the contribution for the degradation of cbz to investigate the radical pathways in the bdd anode coupled cpani gf 700 cathode system the radicals produced in the double chamber and single chamber electrolyzer systems were further valuated by dmpo spin trap epr spectroscopy respectively for double chamber system as seen in fig 6c the epr spectrum of electrolyte around the anode exhibited four typical peaks with the intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 corresponding to the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh complex meanwhile so4 is also detectable due to the appearance of a specific signal of dmpo so4 complex around the anode shin et al 2019 2020 as mentioned above so4 may be derived from the oxidation of sulfate on the surface of bdd electrode oh may come from the oxidation of h2o on the surface of bdd electrode and the reaction of so4 with h2o the epr spectrum of electrolyte around cpani gf 700 cathode only exhibited dmpo oh complex characteristic peaks this could be that generated h2o2 is activated by pyridine n to form oh which is consistent with the xps results above for single chamber system as seen in fig 6d the same epr spectrum of electrolyte around the anode are noted with double chamber system however compared with double chamber system the epr spectrum of electrolyte around the cathode of single chamber system exhibited not only the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh complex but also characteristic peaks of dmpo so4 complex as mentioned above this could be because the pds produced at the anode is reduced at the cathode to form so4 the quasi steady state concentrations of oh and so4 in the electrocatalytic system is also investigated using nb and ba as radical probes as well known the nb mainly reacted with oh k oh nb 3 9 109 m 1s 1 but barely with so4 k so4 nb 1 106 m 1 the concentrations of ho in the system were determined using 0 2 μm nb as a probe the ba reacted with both oh k oh ba 4 2 109 m 1s 1 and so4 k so4 ba 12 109 m 1s 1 the concentrations of so4 in the system were determined using 0 2 μm nb and 0 2 μm ba as the probes the degradation of nb and ba in the presence of 1 5 m methanol were used to quantify the contribution of nonradical oxidation fig s24 exhibited the inhibition effects of methanol on nb and ba degradation efficiency the nb and ba degradation kinetics and the corresponding kinetics constants were shown in fig 6e and f the degradation of nb can be expressed by eqs 12 13 12 d nb dt k oh nb nb oh ss k meoh nb 13 ln nb n b 0 k oh nb oh ss t k meoh t k obs t where k oh nb is the reaction rate constant of oh with nb and taken as 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 thus the concentration of oh can be calculated using the following eq 14 14 oh ss k obs k meoh k nb oh 0 372 0 252 3 9 10 9 60 m 0 51 10 12 m the approach to determine the steady state concentrations of so4 in the system was similar to that of oh except that the probe compound was ba thus nb was added together with ba to calculate the contribution from oh the degradation of ba can be described by the eqs 15 16 15 d ba dt k oh ba ba oh ss k s o 4 ba ba oh ss k meoh ba 16 ln ba b a 0 k s o 4 ba s o 4 ss k oh ba oh ss k meoh t k obs t where k so4 ba is the reaction rate constant of so4 with ba and taken as 1 2 10 9 m 1 s 1 thus the concentration of so4 can be calculated using the following eq 17 17 s o 4 ss k obs k oh ba oh ss k meoh k s o 4 ba 0 0031 4 2 10 9 0 51 10 12 0 000325 1 2 10 9 0 56 10 12 m based on the above results the possible catalysis mechanism of bdd anode coupled cpani gf 700 cathode system was proposed below the bdd anode can oxidize so4 2 to generate so4 and bdd so4 to degrade pollutants two so4 can react to form pds and bdd so4 can reacts with so4 2 to form pds the pds was reduced by electrons at the cathode to form so4 meanwhile the bdd anode can oxidize h2o to generate oh and bdd oh to degrade pollutants bdd oh can also reacts with so4 2 to form so4 cathode graphite n promoted o2 two electron reduction to generate h2o2 which was activated by pyridine n to generate oh 4 conclusion in this work the gf electrode was in situ modified using pani derived n doped carbon catalyst without any binder the bdd anode coupled modified gf cathode system was constructed regarding the anodic reactions sulfate ions were oxidized to produce so4 and pds respectively then the as generated pds ions were reduced back to so4 radicals at the cathode as of the cathodic reactions dissolved oxygen molecules were reduced via a two electron process to produce h2o2 which was catalyzed by the graphitic n on the cathode followed by the in situ formation of oh radicals from the splitting of as prepared h2o2 catalyzed by the pyridinic n on the cathode the optimized system involving the bdd anode coupled cpani gf 700 cathode showed exhibited complete degradation efficiency of cbz within 150 s the synergistic electrocatalysis system indicates great

15239,hydrophobic gas permeable membranes gpms exhibit great potential in stripping or recovering ammonia from wastewater but they also suffer from severe fouling issues due to the complex water matrix since the related process is often operated under highly alkaline conditions ph 11 in this study we proposed a novel membrane stripping process by integrating a cation exchange membrane cem in alkali driven donnan dialysis prior to gpm for efficient and robust ammonia recovery from real biogas slurry during the conventional stripping for diluted biogas slurry the ammonia removal across gpm finally decreased by 15 over 6 consecutive batches likely due to the obvious deposition of inorganic species and penetration of organic compounds rejection of 90 only in contrast a constant ammonia removal of 80 and organic matter rejection of more than 99 as well as negligible fouling of both membranes were found for the proposed novel stripping process operated over 120 h our results demonstrated that additional divalent cations clearly aggravated the fouling of gpm in conventional stripping where only weak competition across cem was found in the cem gpm hybrid mode then for raw biogas slurry the new stripping achieved a stable ammonia removal up to 65 and no fouling occurrence was found superior to that in the control declined removal from 87 to 55 the antifouling mechanism by integrating cem prior to gpm involves size exclusion and charge repulsion towards varying foulants this work highlighted that the novel membrane stripping process of hybrid cem gpm significantly mitigated membrane fouling and can be regarded as a potential alternative for ammonia recovery from high strength complex streams graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ammonia recovery cation exchange membrane gas permeable membrane membrane fouling biogas slurry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction annually domestic wastewater comprises up to 20 million tons of ammonia accounting for one fifth of the total amount fixed via the haber bosch process bodirsky et al 2014 cruz et al 2019 most wastewater management strategies aim to remove the excess ammonia biologically at a shockingly high cost of 39 8 mj kg n a comparable value to the input for ammonia synthesis 43 7 mj kg nh3 n cruz et al 2019 munasinghe arachchige and nirmalakhandan 2020 thus recovering ammonia from wastewater is considered to be a more sustainable option for nitrogen management cruz et al 2019 tarpeh and chen 2021 verstraete et al 2009 zhang et al 2021 a series of ammonia recovery processes have been extensively reported including struvite precipitation huang et al 2017 wang et al 2017b ion exchange tarpeh et al 2017 zhou et al 2021 and air stripping ochs et al 2023 quan et al 2009 song et al 2021 however unaddressed concerns for these conventional physico chemical methodologies such as high operation cost low efficiency and possible secondary pollution have weakened their economic attractiveness chen et al 2021b cruz et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 alternatively gas permeable membranes gpms allow the selective ammonia transportation from wastewater and several gpm based processes such as membrane stripping contactors osmotic distillation and isothermal membrane distillation have received recent attention darestani et al 2017 in particular ammonium in feed was converted to ammonia given a high ph condition which then was transported across gpm under the concentration gradient and finally absorbed in acid referring to high purity ammonium salt as potential liquid fertilizer as shown in fig 1 a zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 the feed ph is essential in determining the ammonia mass transfer rate across gpm and satisfactory ammonia recovery often requires a high ph value even up to 11 noriega hevia et al 2020 under such a circumstance high usage of alkali and the problems of membrane fouling and material corrosion cannot be ignored lee et al 2021 liu et al 2022 studies have shown that inorganic impurities such as ca2 and mg2 in wastewater exhibit high scaling potential probably in the form of caco3 and mg oh 2 posing a great threat to gpm lee et al 2021 lou et al 2022 additionally it was confirmed that under long term operation gpm was susceptible to organic fouling due to direct contact with the wastewater dutta et al 2022 zarebska et al 2015 zarebska et al 2014 and the co occurrence of inorganic and organic compounds further deteriorated the gpm based process likely due to a denser fouling layer wu et al 2018 yan et al 2021 zarebska et al 2014 in fact the high complexity of feed water chemistry in terms of multivalent cations organic compounds alkalinity and a high fouling wetting propensity of gpm itself together resulted in the current bottleneck of the conventional stripping process against sustainable and robust ammonia recovery via gpm to this end solutions for improving wastewater characteristics by feed pretreatment or confined adjustment of ph level as well as updated membrane material have been proposed yet not satisfactory in foulant rejection and process efficacy thus far lee et al 2021 liu et al 2022 importantly gpm and feed streams under high ph conditions have never been decoupled whereas their direct contact over a long span determines the fouling occurrence and process deterioration we previously reported a hybrid ammonia recovery process in which the ammonia in the wastewater was enriched by a cem based donnan dialysis dd process before the ammonia was recovered by the gpm only process cem and gpm separated the system into a feed chamber a receiver alkali chamber and an acid chamber such that the feed and gpm were not in contact and the alkali was not directly dosed into the feed as shown in fig 1b chen et al 2021a in particular upon the usage of cem dd a concentration difference driven ion exchange membrane based process with no external energy needed was built chen et al 2020 ding et al 2021 across cem ammonium was first extracted from wastewater in the alkali driven dd with the exchange of driving cation from alkali receiving solution and after cem ammonia was formed in the receiver and then transported across the gpm achieving a recovery efficiency of more than 90 compared to existing electrically driven cem gpm hybrid processes such as electrochemical stripping es bioelectrochemcial striping bes and capacitive flow electrode membrane stripping fcdi etc this novel hybrid process has the advantage of high recovery efficiency and low energy consumption chen et al 2021a zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 the fouling resistance of the cem gpm hybrid process in ammonia recovery has yet to be reported fortunately the anti fouling potential of dd was mentioned previously to mitigate scaling issues in electrochemical processes rijnaarts et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2021 hence we hypothesized that the complex fouling issues that occurred in gpm in the ammonia recovery process can be largely solved by incorporating cem in the alkali driven dd process noticeably if confirmed such a hybrid membrane process of cem gpm possibly achieves concentration gradient driven ammonia recovery which could be fouling free without any further energy and chemical input than the common membrane stripping process to verify the above hypothesis we performed an ammonia recovery process over 120 h via gpm from a real stream biogas slurry with without cem incorporation alkali driven dd the impacts of divalent cations and organic compounds on the mass transfer of ammonia and impurities as well as on membrane fouling were systematically analysed and the anti fouling effect and the potential mechanism were finally summarized this work can shed light on robust and efficient ammonia recovery in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals the raw biogas slurry previously pretreated through a ceramic ultrafiltration system with a nominal pore size of 0 1 µm dijie china was collected from an agriculture company shunwo technology co ltd the characteristics of the pretreated biogas slurry are shown in table s1 the concentrations of total organic carbon toc and nh4 were 1339 55 and 5581 99 mg l 1 respectively the main inorganic coexisting cations were k and na the sum of which accounted for half of the quantity of nh4 162 and 310 mm respectively with extremely lower concentrations of ca2 and mg2 and the main inorganic coexisting anions were cl no3 and so4 2 both diluted by 5 fold and raw biogas slurry were used as the feed referring to medium and high strength wastewater respectively in particular to mimic streams of severe fouling propensity additional 100 mg l 1 ca2 and 60 mg l 1 mg2 2 5 mm each were added into the diluted biogas slurry since induced membrane scaling and fouling due to cation organic compound interplay especially at elevated ph conditions have been documented lee et al 2021 thus the as prepared diluted and raw biogas slurry enabled us to explore the impact of divalent cations and a high content of organic compounds in interfering with ammonia recovery performance all the chemicals including mgcl2 cacl2 naoh and h2so4 were of analytical grade polyvinylidene hydrophobic microporous gpm gvhp durapore merck millipore and cem of monovalent cation selectivity cso selemion were used as received 2 2 experiment operation the experimental setup is shown in fig s1 consistent with our previous studies chen et al 2021a the feed receiver and acid solution with an initial volume of 1 l was placed in each beaker atop a magnetic stirrer ms500 intllab and stirred at 400 rpm to maintain solution homogeneity during the experiment circulated by a peristaltic pump bt600 m chuangrui each solution flows counter currently across the membrane at a flow rate of 432 ml min 1 cross flow velocity of 20 cm s 1 chen et al 2020 all the experiments were conducted in batch mode in the conventional stripping process gpm only case or control in this work gpm separates the feed and acid solution at ph values of 13 and 1 adjusted by naoh and h2so4 respectively the proposed novel stripping is also concentration gradient driven with dd process integrated prior to the conventional stripping referred to cem gpm hybrid in later context gpm separates the receiver and acid solution initial concentration of 100 mm naoh and 50 mm h2so4 corresponding to ph 13 and 1 respectively which were periodically renewed once the corresponding ph value was below 12 and above 2 the time set for each batch was 10 and 20 h in the case of the diluted stream and 20 and 40 h in the case of the raw stream for the control and cem gpm hybrid process respectively according to a preliminary batch experiment fig s2 in each condition a new membrane coupon was used for a continuous run of 6 batches 2 3 mass transfer of inorganic and organic compounds the total ammonium nitrogen tan concentration of the feed receiver and acid solution was determined every 2 4 h using uv spectrophotometers uv 2600 shimadzu in addition the concentrations of other inorganic and organic compounds in each solution were also measured for the rejection performance of the two processes specifically the concentrations of ions for k na mg2 ca2 f cl so4 2 and no3 were determined by an ion chromatography system ics 90 dionex and that of the organic solute was determined by a total organic carbon toc analyser toc l shimadzu considering a potential transfer competition from cation impurities e g the concentration of k in biogas slurry is second to nh4 across cem we calculated the permselectivity between impurities and nh4 method s1 the migration time of monovalent divalent ions across the cem the retention rate of salt or organic impurities and ammonia removal recovery efficiency was also calculated in method s2 s4 2 4 membrane characterization both the gpm and cem were characterized prior to and after the experiments the membrane morphology and fouling compositions were examined by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectrometry sem eds su8010 hitachi the functional groups of the fouling layer were investigated using attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir ir prestige 21 shimadzu after soaking the fouled membranes in alkaline solution 0

edinburgh u k to identify the typical organic compounds adhered onto the membrane coupons the results were analysed according to the fluorescence regional integration fri method chen et al 2003 the membrane water contact angle was measured using a contact angle meter sdc 100 shengding characterization of the selective cem cso selemion was performed via electrical impedance spectroscopy method s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 ammonia recovery ammonia recovery performance in the case of dilute biogas slurry with without divalent cations by conventional gpm only referred to control and novel stripping cem gpm hybrid processes was compared as illustrated in fig 2 without divalent ions the decline in ammonia concentration in the feed chamber i e ammonia mass transfer rate was greater in conventional stripping fig 2a however this rate was observed to gradually decrease with the number of batches and the final concentration ratio of ammonia in batch 6 was up to 20 4 fold that in batch 1 final ratio 5 unexpectedly the ammonia recovery performance in each batch of the hybrid process was constant a further comparison in fig 2b shows that its ammonia removal was stable ca 80 over 6 batches while that in conventional stripping exhibited a clear decrease at batch 2 from 95 to 88 and then continued to decrease to a final value of 81 close to that in the proposed novel stripping then a further presence of divalent cations in biogas slurry seemed to weaken the ammonia recovery performance in both processes fig 2c and fig 2d in particular the ammonia removal in the hybrid process was consistently stabilized at 68 while that in the control gradually decreased to 73 which was inferior to those in fig 2b 80 and 81 respectively the reason for their sacrificed recovery performance of the two processes is likely as follows the divalent impurities ca2 mg2 may react with alkali in the single stripping process to produce scaling or coupled inorganic organic fouling which would block the pores of the gpm and thus reduce the ammonia diffusion efficiency on the other hand in the dd process divalent cations may compete with ammonium to migrate across the cem such that the ammonium migration rate was compromised inorganic scaling e g ca oh 2 mg oh 2 may also theoretically occur at the cem interface gence and ozbay 2006 mikhaylin and bazinet 2016 for further study on the possible interference effect of divalent cations refer to section 3 2 3 2 impurities retention 3 2 1 inorganic impurities in addition to ammonia the transfer of impurity cations across gpm and cem is illustrated in fig 3 first without divalent cations fig 3a shows that na and k migrate across the gpm which ideally allows only the passage of gas the observed unsatisfactory salt retention ca 98 calculated according to method s3 implied that partial wetting of the membrane occurred such that liquid permeation resulted in ion passage specifically the quantity of na migrated was greater than that of k ca 2 and 1 mmol respectively such a result could be mainly ascribed to the higher concentration of na in the feed solution an overall na concentration approximated 110 mm i e initial presence and further addition of naoh to adjust the feed ph ca 5 times that of k 20 mm second with the presence of divalent cations the transferred quantity of ammonia decreased from 48 mmol to 42 mmol while more impurity cations migrated across gpm 2 1 7 0 4 and 0 03 mmol for na k ca2 and mg2 respectively accordingly the salt retention of gpm was further reduced to 97 indicating obvious wetting herein gpm maintained the gas permeability since the ammonia transfer quantity still dominated 9 fold higher than that of impurities indicating that membrane wetting was localized and not on a large scale then in the hybrid process a more complex transfer phenomenon including impurity and driving cations as well as ammonium across cem was noticed fig 3b without divalent cations the quantity of k that migrated across cem 8 mmol was second only to nh4 48 mmol due to the high concentration of k 20 mm and its similar diffusion coefficient to that of nh4 1 96 10 9 m2 s and 1 98 10 9 m2 s respectively luo et al 2018 k posed the greatest competition against ammonium transfer our previous study showed that in dd driven by salt nacl it was difficult for cem to differentiate k and nh4 p n h 4 k 1 12 where the presence of k significantly reduced ammonium removal chen et al 2020 interestingly in the alkali driven case naoh superior ammonium removal 80 was found 4 fold that of k p n h 4 k of ca 0 5 note that na at a nonnegligible concentration 10 mm in the wastewater did not behave as a strong competing ion as k in fact na in the receiver served as the driving cation 100 mm and its amount transferred to the feed chamber approximated the total amount of ammonium and impurity cations that migrated to the receiver fig 3b then in the presence of divalent cations ca2 and mg2 transfer across the cem quantities of 0 92 mmol and 0 58 mmol respectively meanwhile the amount of k and nh4 transferred also decreased by 27 5 and 12 5 respectively with the value of p n h 4 k declining to 0 2 as did that of na by 10 coexisting cations in the wastewater will indeed compete with ammonium to transfer across the cem in the dd process particularly given the addition of divalent cations ca2 mg2 considerable occupation of the exchangeable sites of cem can be expected due to the stronger binding capability of these cations which can hardly be separated by cem or replaced by monovalent cations consequently inhibition of the transfer of ammonium and the driving ion na occurred herein a monovalent ion selective membrane cso selemion was used exhibiting an additional functional layer an additional semicircle at high frequencies as indicated by the eis results fig s3 compared to the standard cation membrane nonselective membrane cmx generally this additional layer of cso coupon was reported to be positively charged which can increase the transfer resistance of divalent cations across the membrane moreno et al 2018 further calculations revealed that the time for mg2 to migrate through the cso membrane was approximately 2650 times that of na jiang et al 2019 confirming the monovalent cation selectivity fig s4 although the slow transfer of divalent cations can occur other than being completely stopped chen et al 2021a no impurity cations were detected in the acid chamber of the hybrid process suggesting that no fouling or wetting occurred for gpm 3 2 2 organic impurities the distribution of organic compounds in the feed and receiver or acid solution was analysed to investigate the toc rejection performance in different systems as illustrated in fig 4 generally a better rejection of organic compounds was found given the presence of cem particularly without divalent cations more than 99 of organic impurities were retained in the feed solution in the case of diluted biogas slurry even when divalent cations were present excellent retention of organic impurities up to 95 retention was found for the hybrid process superior to that for the control decreased to 78 in the long term experiment of 120 h a robust performance for the denser cem to block the organic matter finally led to gpm free of fouling wetting the water contact angles of the gpm before and after the experiment were quite comparable 126 9 2 4 and 116 5 3 1 respectively as shown in table s2 in the control the averaged retention of organic impurities 86 6 and water contact angle of the gpm 61 5 0 5 after long term treatment of both feed solutions were much lower moreover the addition of divalent cations decreased toc retention by 12 for gpm serving as a membrane wetting trigger for detailed membrane fouling analysis refer to section 3 3 hence the above data highlighted an essential role of cem 3 3 membrane fouling the gpm after the 6th batch experiment was characterized by sem eds and ftir as shown in fig 5 and the saturation index values of potential minerals in the feed side using visual minteq software were analysed table s5 obviously given the presence of cem the gpm exhibited a similar morphology regarding its surface fig 5c1 e1 and cross sectional fig 5c2 e2 with reference to the pristine membrane fig 5a1 a2 regardless of the addition of divalent cations however in the control an obvious crystalline substance was found on gpm without divalent ions fig 5b1 then with divalent cations flake type crystals were found to cover the membrane surface fig 5d1 partially invading into the membrane cross section upper area as in fig 5d2 moreover as shown in table s3 the presence of ionic impurities was observed according to the eds results e g na and k in the surface and cross section of the gpm precisely the proportion of the elements c and f on the gpm surface decreased by more than 2 and 10 fold respectively with compositions from biogas slurry na 12 1 mg 4 7 k 12 3 ca 1 6 s 9 5 o 34 5 and cl 1 8 all detected on gpm the migration of impurity ions across the gpm indicated that the hydrophobic membrane had been wetted considering the impact of divalent cations it was further found that brucite mg oh 2 fluorite caf2 periclase mgo were potentially responsible for the scaling issue of the gpm calculated saturation index values were all positive table s5 nevertheless the gpm was negligibly fouled given the presence of cem as indicated by the nearly constant element information with respect to the pristine one e g c and f table s3 the ftir data in fig 5f implied that the organic adhesion onto gpm was likely weak such that no new absorption peaks were captured on gpm dealing with the diluted biogas slurry noticeably our results demonstrated that gpm indeed suffered from organic fouling when dealing with high strength ammonia wastewater for 120 h in the control fig 7b and s5 discussed in a later section thus the spectrum without new absorption peaks in fig 5f was likely due to the limited fouling potential arising from the current experimental conditions in this regard the addition of divalent cations exhibited an obvious impact in triggering membrane fouling the gpm used in the control showed new peaks at 1099 cm 1 1543 cm 1 1648 cm 1 and 3290 cm 1 which were associated with vibrations of co amine i and ii as well as nh stretching respectively such a result agreed with a previous report that the organic foulant observed on gpm in ammonia recovery was mainly protein and or polysaccharide lee et al 2021 zarebska et al 2015 the amphiphilic nature of these compounds allowed them to be adsorbed onto the hydrophobic surface of gpm gradually tuning the membrane hydrophilicity and accelerating membrane fouling wetting tijing et al 2015 a synergistic effect also indicated that divalent cations together with soluble organic matter finally bridged or aggregated into a dense fouling layer wu et al 2018 yan et al 2021 which likely coincides with the result in fig 5d again no new peak was found for gpm behind cem regardless of the presence of divalent cations fig 5f which was ascribed to the protective role of cem although the above results verified that the incorporated cem mitigated the fouling of gpm whether cem could exhibit a stable anti fouling property itself in such a hybrid system remains to be determined regarding the scaling concern the calculated result table s5 suggested that fluorite caf2 may be deposited on the cem to block the membrane voids or free volume yet it was not captured in the sem image as shown in fig 6 a c then the eds results table s4 indicated an increase in the contents of k mg and ca in the cem cross sectional area the migration of these cation impurities may interfere with ammonium transfer yet of limited impact in fouling the cem regarding organic fouling fig 6d shows new peaks at 1554 cm 1 and 1359 cm 1 corresponding to the vibration of amide ii hashim et al 2010 and new peaks at 679 cm 1 870 cm 1 and 1475 cm 1 corresponding to coh out of plane bending aromatic carbon and amide ii cn howe et al 2002 schwanninger et al 2004 in the absence and presence of divalent cations respectively probably caused by small amounts of humic and protein like organic matter attached to the membrane surface raguraj et al 2022 zarebska et al 2015 overall serious membrane fouling for gpm in the control occurred after 60 h of operation whereas in hybrid mode both the cem and the gpm had no significant fouling after 120 h of operation in other words a robust ammonia recovery was achieved in the proposed novel stripping process where dd contributes not only to enriching ammonium from complex feed but also to mitigating membrane fouling 3 4 robustness of ammonia recovery from raw biogas slurry the long term anti fouling efficacy of the proposed ammonia stripping process from raw biogas slurry was investigated fig 7 a constant ammonia removal of 65 was found whereas that for the control gradually decreased from 87 to 55 with time fig 7a 3d eem images of the organic foulants washed out of the membrane are shown in fig 7b d the organic foulants on gpm in the control were mainly microbial by product like peak i and humic acid like substances peak ii fig 7b zhang et al 2021 and those on cem in the hybrid process were only humic acid like fig 7c where no organic foulant signal was detected on gpm fig 7d obviously the foulant seemed to have the most on gpm in the control and the fewest in the hybrid mode sem eds results also showed clean and constant morphology of gpm and cem in their hybrid mode while flaky crystals were observed on the surface of gpm in the control fig s5 more impurities e g o na k mg ca cl were distributed on gpm in direct contact with the biogas slurry table s3 and a very high scaling potential of mg oh 2 is highlighted in table s5 the ftir spectrum also confirmed that both membranes in hybrid mode did not suffer from obvious fouling whereas new absorption peaks were found only for gpm in the control as shown in fig s6 in the range of 500 1500 cm 1 and 2900 3300 cm 1 corresponding to humic and protein like organic matter lee et al 2021 yan et al 2022 zarebska et al 2015 such a result agreed with the higher content of organic impurities for raw biogas slurry such that the membrane fouling was more severe compared to that in the diluted stream by 5 fold which was thus not further extended the ammonia removal of raw biogas slurry was lower than that of the diluted biogas slurry section 3 1 likely due to the higher propensity of organic fouling as mentioned above and insufficient driving force indeed the na nh4 ratio of the initial concentration decreased from 1 7 in the diluted case to 1 in the raw biogas slurry case considering the nonnegligible presence of cation impurities in this real stream e g k in table s1 the limited driving substances cannot afford rapid ammonia removal fortunately this could be simply improved by increasing the initial concentration of the driving substance as reported in our previous study chen et al 2020 overall our results highlighted the prospect of a novel membrane stripping process for sustainable and robust ammonia recovery from complex streams in long term operation 3 5 anti fouling mechanism fig 8 a shows a schematic drawing of the fouling of gpm that was in direct contact with the biogas slurry in the conventional stripping process the inorganic impurities accumulated near the gpm interface sem eds results in fig 5a e among which the scaling caused by ca2 mg2 and oh etc table s5 blocked the membrane pores resulting in a decreased ammonia flux previous studies reported that the continuously growing nuclei invaded the porous membrane and caused deformation of the pore structure inducing significant internal wetting of gpm rezaei et al 2018 moreover proteins and polysaccharides were thermodynamically favorable to adhere to the hydrophobic interface of gpm triggering the further accumulation of organic substances and accelerating membrane fouling wetting naidu et al 2014 tijing et al 2015 zarebska et al 2014 in addition the synergistic effect between multivalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 and organic substances resulted in denser foulant deposition fig 5d further sacrificing membrane permeability wu et al 2018 hence it is also reasonable that great loss of membrane hydrophobicity as indicated by the final low water contact angle of gpm less than 60 was found fig 8b highlights the role of cem as follows 1 cem served as a selective barrier to maximize ammonium transfer via donnan dialysis except that few impurity cations migrated and efficiently blocked organic and anionic species in the biogas slurry facilitating impurity free ammonia recovery conditions 2 cem separated the alkali solution from the complex feed stream largely preventing inorganic impurities such as ca2 and mg2 in the biogas slurry from contacting much alkali and depositing as insoluble salt or scaling indeed as a strong negatively charged film cem could repel most organic substances that often possess a negative charge wang et al 2017a and the size exclusion effect between the compact cem and varying foulant is also crucial under such a circumstance coupled organic inorganic fouling was expected to be inhibited to a large extent as verified by the well maintained membrane hydrophobicity 4 conclusion in this study we proposed delicately incorporating cems prior to gpm in a novel concentration gradient driven membrane stripping process to achieve desirable fouling free and robust ammonia recovery from biogas slurry the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the proposed stripping process showed excellent and stable ammonia removal recovery performance ammonia removal up to 80 and organic matter retention up to 99 and both cem and gpm did not suffer from significant fouling issues 2 a synergistic impact of organic inorganic compound was found to trigger the occurrence of gpm fouling wetting fortunately cem acted as a barrier to prevent cation impurities ca2 mg2

15239,hydrophobic gas permeable membranes gpms exhibit great potential in stripping or recovering ammonia from wastewater but they also suffer from severe fouling issues due to the complex water matrix since the related process is often operated under highly alkaline conditions ph 11 in this study we proposed a novel membrane stripping process by integrating a cation exchange membrane cem in alkali driven donnan dialysis prior to gpm for efficient and robust ammonia recovery from real biogas slurry during the conventional stripping for diluted biogas slurry the ammonia removal across gpm finally decreased by 15 over 6 consecutive batches likely due to the obvious deposition of inorganic species and penetration of organic compounds rejection of 90 only in contrast a constant ammonia removal of 80 and organic matter rejection of more than 99 as well as negligible fouling of both membranes were found for the proposed novel stripping process operated over 120 h our results demonstrated that additional divalent cations clearly aggravated the fouling of gpm in conventional stripping where only weak competition across cem was found in the cem gpm hybrid mode then for raw biogas slurry the new stripping achieved a stable ammonia removal up to 65 and no fouling occurrence was found superior to that in the control declined removal from 87 to 55 the antifouling mechanism by integrating cem prior to gpm involves size exclusion and charge repulsion towards varying foulants this work highlighted that the novel membrane stripping process of hybrid cem gpm significantly mitigated membrane fouling and can be regarded as a potential alternative for ammonia recovery from high strength complex streams graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ammonia recovery cation exchange membrane gas permeable membrane membrane fouling biogas slurry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction annually domestic wastewater comprises up to 20 million tons of ammonia accounting for one fifth of the total amount fixed via the haber bosch process bodirsky et al 2014 cruz et al 2019 most wastewater management strategies aim to remove the excess ammonia biologically at a shockingly high cost of 39 8 mj kg n a comparable value to the input for ammonia synthesis 43 7 mj kg nh3 n cruz et al 2019 munasinghe arachchige and nirmalakhandan 2020 thus recovering ammonia from wastewater is considered to be a more sustainable option for nitrogen management cruz et al 2019 tarpeh and chen 2021 verstraete et al 2009 zhang et al 2021 a series of ammonia recovery processes have been extensively reported including struvite precipitation huang et al 2017 wang et al 2017b ion exchange tarpeh et al 2017 zhou et al 2021 and air stripping ochs et al 2023 quan et al 2009 song et al 2021 however unaddressed concerns for these conventional physico chemical methodologies such as high operation cost low efficiency and possible secondary pollution have weakened their economic attractiveness chen et al 2021b cruz et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 alternatively gas permeable membranes gpms allow the selective ammonia transportation from wastewater and several gpm based processes such as membrane stripping contactors osmotic distillation and isothermal membrane distillation have received recent attention darestani et al 2017 in particular ammonium in feed was converted to ammonia given a high ph condition which then was transported across gpm under the concentration gradient and finally absorbed in acid referring to high purity ammonium salt as potential liquid fertilizer as shown in fig 1 a zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 the feed ph is essential in determining the ammonia mass transfer rate across gpm and satisfactory ammonia recovery often requires a high ph value even up to 11 noriega hevia et al 2020 under such a circumstance high usage of alkali and the problems of membrane fouling and material corrosion cannot be ignored lee et al 2021 liu et al 2022 studies have shown that inorganic impurities such as ca2 and mg2 in wastewater exhibit high scaling potential probably in the form of caco3 and mg oh 2 posing a great threat to gpm lee et al 2021 lou et al 2022 additionally it was confirmed that under long term operation gpm was susceptible to organic fouling due to direct contact with the wastewater dutta et al 2022 zarebska et al 2015 zarebska et al 2014 and the co occurrence of inorganic and organic compounds further deteriorated the gpm based process likely due to a denser fouling layer wu et al 2018 yan et al 2021 zarebska et al 2014 in fact the high complexity of feed water chemistry in terms of multivalent cations organic compounds alkalinity and a high fouling wetting propensity of gpm itself together resulted in the current bottleneck of the conventional stripping process against sustainable and robust ammonia recovery via gpm to this end solutions for improving wastewater characteristics by feed pretreatment or confined adjustment of ph level as well as updated membrane material have been proposed yet not satisfactory in foulant rejection and process efficacy thus far lee et al 2021 liu et al 2022 importantly gpm and feed streams under high ph conditions have never been decoupled whereas their direct contact over a long span determines the fouling occurrence and process deterioration we previously reported a hybrid ammonia recovery process in which the ammonia in the wastewater was enriched by a cem based donnan dialysis dd process before the ammonia was recovered by the gpm only process cem and gpm separated the system into a feed chamber a receiver alkali chamber and an acid chamber such that the feed and gpm were not in contact and the alkali was not directly dosed into the feed as shown in fig 1b chen et al 2021a in particular upon the usage of cem dd a concentration difference driven ion exchange membrane based process with no external energy needed was built chen et al 2020 ding et al 2021 across cem ammonium was first extracted from wastewater in the alkali driven dd with the exchange of driving cation from alkali receiving solution and after cem ammonia was formed in the receiver and then transported across the gpm achieving a recovery efficiency of more than 90 compared to existing electrically driven cem gpm hybrid processes such as electrochemical stripping es bioelectrochemcial striping bes and capacitive flow electrode membrane stripping fcdi etc this novel hybrid process has the advantage of high recovery efficiency and low energy consumption chen et al 2021a zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 the fouling resistance of the cem gpm hybrid process in ammonia recovery has yet to be reported fortunately the anti fouling potential of dd was mentioned previously to mitigate scaling issues in electrochemical processes rijnaarts et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2021 hence we hypothesized that the complex fouling issues that occurred in gpm in the ammonia recovery process can be largely solved by incorporating cem in the alkali driven dd process noticeably if confirmed such a hybrid membrane process of cem gpm possibly achieves concentration gradient driven ammonia recovery which could be fouling free without any further energy and chemical input than the common membrane stripping process to verify the above hypothesis we performed an ammonia recovery process over 120 h via gpm from a real stream biogas slurry with without cem incorporation alkali driven dd the impacts of divalent cations and organic compounds on the mass transfer of ammonia and impurities as well as on membrane fouling were systematically analysed and the anti fouling effect and the potential mechanism were finally summarized this work can shed light on robust and efficient ammonia recovery in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals the raw biogas slurry previously pretreated through a ceramic ultrafiltration system with a nominal pore size of 0 1 µm dijie china was collected from an agriculture company shunwo technology co ltd the characteristics of the pretreated biogas slurry are shown in table s1 the concentrations of total organic carbon toc and nh4 were 1339 55 and 5581 99 mg l 1 respectively the main inorganic coexisting cations were k and na the sum of which accounted for half of the quantity of nh4 162 and 310 mm respectively with extremely lower concentrations of ca2 and mg2 and the main inorganic coexisting anions were cl no3 and so4 2 both diluted by 5 fold and raw biogas slurry were used as the feed referring to medium and high strength wastewater respectively in particular to mimic streams of severe fouling propensity additional 100 mg l 1 ca2 and 60 mg l 1 mg2 2 5 mm each were added into the diluted biogas slurry since induced membrane scaling and fouling due to cation organic compound interplay especially at elevated ph conditions have been documented lee et al 2021 thus the as prepared diluted and raw biogas slurry enabled us to explore the impact of divalent cations and a high content of organic compounds in interfering with ammonia recovery performance all the chemicals including mgcl2 cacl2 naoh and h2so4 were of analytical grade polyvinylidene hydrophobic microporous gpm gvhp durapore merck millipore and cem of monovalent cation selectivity cso selemion were used as received 2 2 experiment operation the experimental setup is shown in fig s1 consistent with our previous studies chen et al 2021a the feed receiver and acid solution with an initial volume of 1 l was placed in each beaker atop a magnetic stirrer ms500 intllab and stirred at 400 rpm to maintain solution homogeneity during the experiment circulated by a peristaltic pump bt600 m chuangrui each solution flows counter currently across the membrane at a flow rate of 432 ml min 1 cross flow velocity of 20 cm s 1 chen et al 2020 all the experiments were conducted in batch mode in the conventional stripping process gpm only case or control in this work gpm separates the feed and acid solution at ph values of 13 and 1 adjusted by naoh and h2so4 respectively the proposed novel stripping is also concentration gradient driven with dd process integrated prior to the conventional stripping referred to cem gpm hybrid in later context gpm separates the receiver and acid solution initial concentration of 100 mm naoh and 50 mm h2so4 corresponding to ph 13 and 1 respectively which were periodically renewed once the corresponding ph value was below 12 and above 2 the time set for each batch was 10 and 20 h in the case of the diluted stream and 20 and 40 h in the case of the raw stream for the control and cem gpm hybrid process respectively according to a preliminary batch experiment fig s2 in each condition a new membrane coupon was used for a continuous run of 6 batches 2 3 mass transfer of inorganic and organic compounds the total ammonium nitrogen tan concentration of the feed receiver and acid solution was determined every 2 4 h using uv spectrophotometers uv 2600 shimadzu in addition the concentrations of other inorganic and organic compounds in each solution were also measured for the rejection performance of the two processes specifically the concentrations of ions for k na mg2 ca2 f cl so4 2 and no3 were determined by an ion chromatography system ics 90 dionex and that of the organic solute was determined by a total organic carbon toc analyser toc l shimadzu considering a potential transfer competition from cation impurities e g the concentration of k in biogas slurry is second to nh4 across cem we calculated the permselectivity between impurities and nh4 method s1 the migration time of monovalent divalent ions across the cem the retention rate of salt or organic impurities and ammonia removal recovery efficiency was also calculated in method s2 s4 2 4 membrane characterization both the gpm and cem were characterized prior to and after the experiments the membrane morphology and fouling compositions were examined by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectrometry sem eds su8010 hitachi the functional groups of the fouling layer were investigated using attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir ir prestige 21 shimadzu after soaking the fouled membranes in alkaline solution 0

edinburgh u k to identify the typical organic compounds adhered onto the membrane coupons the results were analysed according to the fluorescence regional integration fri method chen et al 2003 the membrane water contact angle was measured using a contact angle meter sdc 100 shengding characterization of the selective cem cso selemion was performed via electrical impedance spectroscopy method s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 ammonia recovery ammonia recovery performance in the case of dilute biogas slurry with without divalent cations by conventional gpm only referred to control and novel stripping cem gpm hybrid processes was compared as illustrated in fig 2 without divalent ions the decline in ammonia concentration in the feed chamber i e ammonia mass transfer rate was greater in conventional stripping fig 2a however this rate was observed to gradually decrease with the number of batches and the final concentration ratio of ammonia in batch 6 was up to 20 4 fold that in batch 1 final ratio 5 unexpectedly the ammonia recovery performance in each batch of the hybrid process was constant a further comparison in fig 2b shows that its ammonia removal was stable ca 80 over 6 batches while that in conventional stripping exhibited a clear decrease at batch 2 from 95 to 88 and then continued to decrease to a final value of 81 close to that in the proposed novel stripping then a further presence of divalent cations in biogas slurry seemed to weaken the ammonia recovery performance in both processes fig 2c and fig 2d in particular the ammonia removal in the hybrid process was consistently stabilized at 68 while that in the control gradually decreased to 73 which was inferior to those in fig 2b 80 and 81 respectively the reason for their sacrificed recovery performance of the two processes is likely as follows the divalent impurities ca2 mg2 may react with alkali in the single stripping process to produce scaling or coupled inorganic organic fouling which would block the pores of the gpm and thus reduce the ammonia diffusion efficiency on the other hand in the dd process divalent cations may compete with ammonium to migrate across the cem such that the ammonium migration rate was compromised inorganic scaling e g ca oh 2 mg oh 2 may also theoretically occur at the cem interface gence and ozbay 2006 mikhaylin and bazinet 2016 for further study on the possible interference effect of divalent cations refer to section 3 2 3 2 impurities retention 3 2 1 inorganic impurities in addition to ammonia the transfer of impurity cations across gpm and cem is illustrated in fig 3 first without divalent cations fig 3a shows that na and k migrate across the gpm which ideally allows only the passage of gas the observed unsatisfactory salt retention ca 98 calculated according to method s3 implied that partial wetting of the membrane occurred such that liquid permeation resulted in ion passage specifically the quantity of na migrated was greater than that of k ca 2 and 1 mmol respectively such a result could be mainly ascribed to the higher concentration of na in the feed solution an overall na concentration approximated 110 mm i e initial presence and further addition of naoh to adjust the feed ph ca 5 times that of k 20 mm second with the presence of divalent cations the transferred quantity of ammonia decreased from 48 mmol to 42 mmol while more impurity cations migrated across gpm 2 1 7 0 4 and 0 03 mmol for na k ca2 and mg2 respectively accordingly the salt retention of gpm was further reduced to 97 indicating obvious wetting herein gpm maintained the gas permeability since the ammonia transfer quantity still dominated 9 fold higher than that of impurities indicating that membrane wetting was localized and not on a large scale then in the hybrid process a more complex transfer phenomenon including impurity and driving cations as well as ammonium across cem was noticed fig 3b without divalent cations the quantity of k that migrated across cem 8 mmol was second only to nh4 48 mmol due to the high concentration of k 20 mm and its similar diffusion coefficient to that of nh4 1 96 10 9 m2 s and 1 98 10 9 m2 s respectively luo et al 2018 k posed the greatest competition against ammonium transfer our previous study showed that in dd driven by salt nacl it was difficult for cem to differentiate k and nh4 p n h 4 k 1 12 where the presence of k significantly reduced ammonium removal chen et al 2020 interestingly in the alkali driven case naoh superior ammonium removal 80 was found 4 fold that of k p n h 4 k of ca 0 5 note that na at a nonnegligible concentration 10 mm in the wastewater did not behave as a strong competing ion as k in fact na in the receiver served as the driving cation 100 mm and its amount transferred to the feed chamber approximated the total amount of ammonium and impurity cations that migrated to the receiver fig 3b then in the presence of divalent cations ca2 and mg2 transfer across the cem quantities of 0 92 mmol and 0 58 mmol respectively meanwhile the amount of k and nh4 transferred also decreased by 27 5 and 12 5 respectively with the value of p n h 4 k declining to 0 2 as did that of na by 10 coexisting cations in the wastewater will indeed compete with ammonium to transfer across the cem in the dd process particularly given the addition of divalent cations ca2 mg2 considerable occupation of the exchangeable sites of cem can be expected due to the stronger binding capability of these cations which can hardly be separated by cem or replaced by monovalent cations consequently inhibition of the transfer of ammonium and the driving ion na occurred herein a monovalent ion selective membrane cso selemion was used exhibiting an additional functional layer an additional semicircle at high frequencies as indicated by the eis results fig s3 compared to the standard cation membrane nonselective membrane cmx generally this additional layer of cso coupon was reported to be positively charged which can increase the transfer resistance of divalent cations across the membrane moreno et al 2018 further calculations revealed that the time for mg2 to migrate through the cso membrane was approximately 2650 times that of na jiang et al 2019 confirming the monovalent cation selectivity fig s4 although the slow transfer of divalent cations can occur other than being completely stopped chen et al 2021a no impurity cations were detected in the acid chamber of the hybrid process suggesting that no fouling or wetting occurred for gpm 3 2 2 organic impurities the distribution of organic compounds in the feed and receiver or acid solution was analysed to investigate the toc rejection performance in different systems as illustrated in fig 4 generally a better rejection of organic compounds was found given the presence of cem particularly without divalent cations more than 99 of organic impurities were retained in the feed solution in the case of diluted biogas slurry even when divalent cations were present excellent retention of organic impurities up to 95 retention was found for the hybrid process superior to that for the control decreased to 78 in the long term experiment of 120 h a robust performance for the denser cem to block the organic matter finally led to gpm free of fouling wetting the water contact angles of the gpm before and after the experiment were quite comparable 126 9 2 4 and 116 5 3 1 respectively as shown in table s2 in the control the averaged retention of organic impurities 86 6 and water contact angle of the gpm 61 5 0 5 after long term treatment of both feed solutions were much lower moreover the addition of divalent cations decreased toc retention by 12 for gpm serving as a membrane wetting trigger for detailed membrane fouling analysis refer to section 3 3 hence the above data highlighted an essential role of cem 3 3 membrane fouling the gpm after the 6th batch experiment was characterized by sem eds and ftir as shown in fig 5 and the saturation index values of potential minerals in the feed side using visual minteq software were analysed table s5 obviously given the presence of cem the gpm exhibited a similar morphology regarding its surface fig 5c1 e1 and cross sectional fig 5c2 e2 with reference to the pristine membrane fig 5a1 a2 regardless of the addition of divalent cations however in the control an obvious crystalline substance was found on gpm without divalent ions fig 5b1 then with divalent cations flake type crystals were found to cover the membrane surface fig 5d1 partially invading into the membrane cross section upper area as in fig 5d2 moreover as shown in table s3 the presence of ionic impurities was observed according to the eds results e g na and k in the surface and cross section of the gpm precisely the proportion of the elements c and f on the gpm surface decreased by more than 2 and 10 fold respectively with compositions from biogas slurry na 12 1 mg 4 7 k 12 3 ca 1 6 s 9 5 o 34 5 and cl 1 8 all detected on gpm the migration of impurity ions across the gpm indicated that the hydrophobic membrane had been wetted considering the impact of divalent cations it was further found that brucite mg oh 2 fluorite caf2 periclase mgo were potentially responsible for the scaling issue of the gpm calculated saturation index values were all positive table s5 nevertheless the gpm was negligibly fouled given the presence of cem as indicated by the nearly constant element information with respect to the pristine one e g c and f table s3 the ftir data in fig 5f implied that the organic adhesion onto gpm was likely weak such that no new absorption peaks were captured on gpm dealing with the diluted biogas slurry noticeably our results demonstrated that gpm indeed suffered from organic fouling when dealing with high strength ammonia wastewater for 120 h in the control fig 7b and s5 discussed in a later section thus the spectrum without new absorption peaks in fig 5f was likely due to the limited fouling potential arising from the current experimental conditions in this regard the addition of divalent cations exhibited an obvious impact in triggering membrane fouling the gpm used in the control showed new peaks at 1099 cm 1 1543 cm 1 1648 cm 1 and 3290 cm 1 which were associated with vibrations of co amine i and ii as well as nh stretching respectively such a result agreed with a previous report that the organic foulant observed on gpm in ammonia recovery was mainly protein and or polysaccharide lee et al 2021 zarebska et al 2015 the amphiphilic nature of these compounds allowed them to be adsorbed onto the hydrophobic surface of gpm gradually tuning the membrane hydrophilicity and accelerating membrane fouling wetting tijing et al 2015 a synergistic effect also indicated that divalent cations together with soluble organic matter finally bridged or aggregated into a dense fouling layer wu et al 2018 yan et al 2021 which likely coincides with the result in fig 5d again no new peak was found for gpm behind cem regardless of the presence of divalent cations fig 5f which was ascribed to the protective role of cem although the above results verified that the incorporated cem mitigated the fouling of gpm whether cem could exhibit a stable anti fouling property itself in such a hybrid system remains to be determined regarding the scaling concern the calculated result table s5 suggested that fluorite caf2 may be deposited on the cem to block the membrane voids or free volume yet it was not captured in the sem image as shown in fig 6 a c then the eds results table s4 indicated an increase in the contents of k mg and ca in the cem cross sectional area the migration of these cation impurities may interfere with ammonium transfer yet of limited impact in fouling the cem regarding organic fouling fig 6d shows new peaks at 1554 cm 1 and 1359 cm 1 corresponding to the vibration of amide ii hashim et al 2010 and new peaks at 679 cm 1 870 cm 1 and 1475 cm 1 corresponding to coh out of plane bending aromatic carbon and amide ii cn howe et al 2002 schwanninger et al 2004 in the absence and presence of divalent cations respectively probably caused by small amounts of humic and protein like organic matter attached to the membrane surface raguraj et al 2022 zarebska et al 2015 overall serious membrane fouling for gpm in the control occurred after 60 h of operation whereas in hybrid mode both the cem and the gpm had no significant fouling after 120 h of operation in other words a robust ammonia recovery was achieved in the proposed novel stripping process where dd contributes not only to enriching ammonium from complex feed but also to mitigating membrane fouling 3 4 robustness of ammonia recovery from raw biogas slurry the long term anti fouling efficacy of the proposed ammonia stripping process from raw biogas slurry was investigated fig 7 a constant ammonia removal of 65 was found whereas that for the control gradually decreased from 87 to 55 with time fig 7a 3d eem images of the organic foulants washed out of the membrane are shown in fig 7b d the organic foulants on gpm in the control were mainly microbial by product like peak i and humic acid like substances peak ii fig 7b zhang et al 2021 and those on cem in the hybrid process were only humic acid like fig 7c where no organic foulant signal was detected on gpm fig 7d obviously the foulant seemed to have the most on gpm in the control and the fewest in the hybrid mode sem eds results also showed clean and constant morphology of gpm and cem in their hybrid mode while flaky crystals were observed on the surface of gpm in the control fig s5 more impurities e g o na k mg ca cl were distributed on gpm in direct contact with the biogas slurry table s3 and a very high scaling potential of mg oh 2 is highlighted in table s5 the ftir spectrum also confirmed that both membranes in hybrid mode did not suffer from obvious fouling whereas new absorption peaks were found only for gpm in the control as shown in fig s6 in the range of 500 1500 cm 1 and 2900 3300 cm 1 corresponding to humic and protein like organic matter lee et al 2021 yan et al 2022 zarebska et al 2015 such a result agreed with the higher content of organic impurities for raw biogas slurry such that the membrane fouling was more severe compared to that in the diluted stream by 5 fold which was thus not further extended the ammonia removal of raw biogas slurry was lower than that of the diluted biogas slurry section 3 1 likely due to the higher propensity of organic fouling as mentioned above and insufficient driving force indeed the na nh4 ratio of the initial concentration decreased from 1 7 in the diluted case to 1 in the raw biogas slurry case considering the nonnegligible presence of cation impurities in this real stream e g k in table s1 the limited driving substances cannot afford rapid ammonia removal fortunately this could be simply improved by increasing the initial concentration of the driving substance as reported in our previous study chen et al 2020 overall our results highlighted the prospect of a novel membrane stripping process for sustainable and robust ammonia recovery from complex streams in long term operation 3 5 anti fouling mechanism fig 8 a shows a schematic drawing of the fouling of gpm that was in direct contact with the biogas slurry in the conventional stripping process the inorganic impurities accumulated near the gpm interface sem eds results in fig 5a e among which the scaling caused by ca2 mg2 and oh etc table s5 blocked the membrane pores resulting in a decreased ammonia flux previous studies reported that the continuously growing nuclei invaded the porous membrane and caused deformation of the pore structure inducing significant internal wetting of gpm rezaei et al 2018 moreover proteins and polysaccharides were thermodynamically favorable to adhere to the hydrophobic interface of gpm triggering the further accumulation of organic substances and accelerating membrane fouling wetting naidu et al 2014 tijing et al 2015 zarebska et al 2014 in addition the synergistic effect between multivalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 and organic substances resulted in denser foulant deposition fig 5d further sacrificing membrane permeability wu et al 2018 hence it is also reasonable that great loss of membrane hydrophobicity as indicated by the final low water contact angle of gpm less than 60 was found fig 8b highlights the role of cem as follows 1 cem served as a selective barrier to maximize ammonium transfer via donnan dialysis except that few impurity cations migrated and efficiently blocked organic and anionic species in the biogas slurry facilitating impurity free ammonia recovery conditions 2 cem separated the alkali solution from the complex feed stream largely preventing inorganic impurities such as ca2 and mg2 in the biogas slurry from contacting much alkali and depositing as insoluble salt or scaling indeed as a strong negatively charged film cem could repel most organic substances that often possess a negative charge wang et al 2017a and the size exclusion effect between the compact cem and varying foulant is also crucial under such a circumstance coupled organic inorganic fouling was expected to be inhibited to a large extent as verified by the well maintained membrane hydrophobicity 4 conclusion in this study we proposed delicately incorporating cems prior to gpm in a novel concentration gradient driven membrane stripping process to achieve desirable fouling free and robust ammonia recovery from biogas slurry the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the proposed stripping process showed excellent and stable ammonia removal recovery performance ammonia removal up to 80 and organic matter retention up to 99 and both cem and gpm did not suffer from significant fouling issues 2 a synergistic impact of organic inorganic compound was found to trigger the occurrence of gpm fouling wetting fortunately cem acted as a barrier to prevent cation impurities ca2 mg2
