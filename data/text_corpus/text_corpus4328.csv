21640,roll damping is one of the most important parameters in the assessment of the behavior of floating systems in waves but its prediction is still an open issue despite the greater improvements achieved with the advent of computational fluid dynamics the estimation of roll damping is still highly dependent on experiments a typical approach is to perform decay tests and use the damping coefficients as direct inputs in numerical simulations of motions in waves the present study shows that roll damping is significantly affected by the incident wave and proposes a hybrid approach to estimate roll damping coefficients in waves combining experimental results from model tests in waves with numerical simulations to illustrate the proposed procedure the experimental data of a typical ship shaped fpso in regular and irregular waves have been used these results have been compared with those from typical decay tests in calm water a time domain nonlinear potential model has also been used to benchmark the results of the hybrid approach it was found that the damping coefficients obtained from the hybrid approach provide a more realistic representation of the roll dynamics than those from typical decay tests keywords seakeeping decay tests rao irregular waves nonlinearities viscous damping 1 introduction the accurate prediction of roll motion is still an issue in the assessment of safety and operability of ships and offshore structures in waves due to the complexity in the estimation of roll damping indeed the relevance of roll damping has been recognized and addressed in many references that can be traced back to as far as the investigations of william froude 1861 falzarano et al 2015 bačkalov et al 2016 and manderbacka et al 2019 have provided a recent overview on the importance of roll damping and an extensive literature review of the various roll damping prediction methods for ship shaped structures in the context of the development of the second generation intact stability criteria sgisc proposed by the international maritime organization imo the need of accurate estimation of roll motion has regained attention as evidenced by the number of recent publications concerning this topic in the last stab 2018 and issw 2019 for instance ikeda 2018 presented a historical review of his prediction method and stressed the need for further developments using for instance cfd tools smith 2018 explored and compared various typical methods of calculation of roll damping values from roll decay empirical data oliva remola et al 2018 analyzed the influence of different experimental techniques for roll decay tests with a model of a trawler fishing vessel gu et al 2018 numerically investigated the scale effects on ship roll damping based on decay tests in calm water using rans equations wassermann et al 2018 hashimoto et al 2019 and costa de oliveira et al 2019 have also investigated and provided relevant remarks on ship roll damping and motions using cfd and or efd cichowicz and vassalos 2019 discussed the influence of decomposition of the hydrodynamic reaction moment the assumption of small amplitude motions and the coupling of roll to other modes of motion especially with sway gu et al 2019 further investigated several crucial factors that affect cfd simulations of roll damping such as boundary condition wall function and mesh size katayama et al 2019a proposed a rational short term prediction method considering nonlinearity in roll damping and restoring moments oliva remola and pérez rojas 2019 presented an approach for the assessment of uncertainty of roll decay tests and emphasized the difficulties in the determination of uncertainties associated to nonlinear damping coefficients smith 2019 presented an alternative approach for the analysis of roll decay experiments for high damping cases the sgisc aim at assessing the vulnerability of ships to several phenomena in waves such as parametric rolling and excessive acceleration whose occurrence and intensity strongly depend on the magnitude of roll damping in addition to the issues related to the sgisc roll damping is also a concern for offshore platforms naval hull forms and several other applications as reported in for instance van t veer and fathi 2011 fernandes et al 2018 gokce and kinaci 2018 mancini et al 2018 irkal et al 2019 jensen 2019 katayama et al 2019b kianejad et al 2019 kim et al 2019 yu et al 2019 asgari et al 2020 kianejad et al 2020 kim et al 2020 despite the great number of theoretical numerical and experimental works dedicated to the problem of roll damping there is still no standard methodology for its prediction due to the complexity of the different physical phenomena involved concurrently frictional resistance vortex formation wave making on the free surface lifting moments etc recent developments in computational fluid dynamics cfd tools have allowed significant improvement in the prediction of the physics of roll damping but in quantitative terms they are still a good promise for the future imo 2016 zhou et al 2015 have proposed a 3 d rans approach for calculating the roll damping of a ship under free decay experiments without forward speed although some good agreements with experiments are reported the quality of the numerical predictions depended on the availability of experimental data and the selected time step avalos and wanderley 2018 have used 2 d navier stokes equations to study the influence of bilge keels on the roll damping of fpso sections under forced roll oscillations neglecting the wave radiation effects their results showed that the generated vortices influenced the pressure distribution around the hull irkal et al 2016 2019 have proposed a cfd approach to estimate the roll damping of ship shaped floating systems with and without bilge keels based on simulations of roll decay tests it is reported that the effect of bilge keel thickness degrees of freedom and scaling on roll motion and damping was insignificant on the other side based on the herm technique the works of kianejad et al 2018 and kianejad et al 2019 show that care should be taken when extrapolating results from model scale to full scale due to possible scale effects kim et al 2020 performed experimental and numerical studies to estimate roll damping and hydrodynamic pressure on a 2 d rectangular structure in free roll decay they found that the cfd results compared well with the experimental validation based on pressure estimation from piv measurements from the literature review on cfd approaches to assess roll damping it can be concluded that most studies either neglect some important effects and or are restricted to decay tests or forced roll motions cfd approaches for the direct simulation of motions of intact free running ships in waves have gained increasing attention but the associated computational effort is still prohibitive and further validations with experimental data are required indeed according to imo report sdc 4 5 1 add 1 imo 2016 the most reliable source of information on roll damping is still scaled model tests that document recommends that for numerical simulations of roll motion the roll damping coefficients should be estimated with model tests using the procedures outlined in msc 1 circ 1200 imo 2006 namely free roll decays or forced roll motion regarding semi empirical approaches the well known ikeda s method as described in himeno 1981 is the most widely used semi empirical approach for the prediction of roll damping the method assumes that roll damping can be divided in components which are computed separately based on theoretical and experimental considerations kawahara et al 2012 further simplified ikeda s method by using regression formulas that only need the ship s main characteristics as input this approach is recommended by imo report sdc 4 5 1 add 1 imo 2016 and by ittc 2011 to predict roll damping in the absence of ship specific prototype or roll decay model test data nonetheless some works e g imo 2011a 2011b rudaković and bačkalov 2017 oliveira et al 2019 have shown that the simplified approach is not able to predict the experimental decay tests coefficients of some hull forms and loading conditions from the experimental perspective several authors have investigated methods and analysis techniques to estimate roll damping for instance wassermann et al 2016a compared the advantages and disadvantages of the decay motion and the harmonic excited roll motion herm ii tests the herm ii technique was identified as the most advantageous the work of smith 2018 showed that in theory the methods of calculation of roll damping coefficients from decay tests are equivalent but in practice they do produce different values of damping coefficients oliva remola et al 2018 reported that uncertainty associated with data recording and analyses dominate over differences between the techniques there are several other recent works that report experimental data but are generally related to validation of cfd studies and are based on decay tests and or harmonic oscillations in calm water mancini et al 2018 jensen 2019 kim et al 2019 2020 the above references evidence that roll damping studies are basically focused on decay and or forced excited roll conditions the damping coefficients obtained from those tests which are typically performed in calm water are assumed to be representative of the roll damping in waves this hypothesis however may not be reliable especially when moderate sea conditions are considered indeed based on model tests and 3d cfd simulations with two fpsos van t veer and fathi 2011 stated that free decay tests can suffer from memory effects and found that damping in waves could be higher than the damping in free decay in calm water hou and zou 2015 2016 have applied parameters identification techniques to identified roll damping and restoring coefficients from motions in regular and irregular waves but comparisons with roll decay coefficients were not done somayajula and falzarano 2017 applied an advanced system identification technique to obtain the roll damping coefficients of a research vessel from irregular waves based on the calibration of the roll rao curve they found that numerical roll simulations based on decay damping coefficients were less accurate than those from irregular waves more recently based on experimental and cfd studies with a bulk carrier ship kianejad et al 2020 concluded that the magnitude of hydrodynamic coefficients in regular beam sea conditions are different compared to the still water condition the present study further investigates the roll damping in regular and irregular waves based on model tests experiments with a typical fpso hull at three loading conditions first roll decay tests results are investigated using the typical approaches for the determination of roll damping coefficients then using a hybrid procedure that relies on experimental data and numerical simulations the roll damping coefficients for the fpso are estimated for the regular and irregular waves conditions initially a frequency domain numerical model of the uncouple roll motion has been used where the linearized damping coefficient was the calibration parameter the mean amplitude of the response and the area under the roll response spectrum were adopted as calibration criteria of the motions in regular and irregular waves respectively the damping coefficients corresponding to the calibrated roll response in waves are expected to provide more realistic predictions than those from decay tests 2 experimental data a ship shaped fpso unit typical of brazilian oil production platforms has been adopted as case study the model tests experiments were conducted at 1 70 scale at the ocean technology laboratory laboceano of the federal university of rio de janeiro brazil three representative operational loading conditions have been analyzed namely full intermediate and ballast the main characteristics of the fpso and the 3d perspective views of the hull at these loading conditions are shown in table 1 and fig 1 respectively for the three loading conditions the fpso was fitted with bilge keels of 1 00 m width that extended along 127 2 m on the parallel body on both sides the effect of bilge keels is widely recognized as the most important contribution to roll damping and may account up to 80 of the total damping kawahara et al 2012 fpsos are usually fitted with these devices often with much larger dimensions than ships the effect of bilge keels on roll damping has been largely explored numerical and experimentally in a number of works thiagarajan and braddock 2010 gu et al 2015 irkal et al 2016 2019 wassermann et al 2016b avalos and wanderley 2018 katayama et al 2019b for the model tests a simplified mooring system consisting of four horizontal lines each one composed of steel cable and a linear spring has been used to restrain the horizontal motions of the model the simplified mooring system mimics the horizontal stiffness of the full length spread mooring and riser systems fig 1 shows the mooring lines of the mooring system adopted in the model tests the anchor points of the mooring lines were located in the lateral walls of the basin above the water level the restoring characteristics of the mooring system in surge and sway directions have been experimentally measured through static offsets tests the static induced roll restoring moments of the mooring system in the model tests have been preliminarily computed together with the hull hydrostatic characteristics using the approach described for instance in huijs 2015 porciuncula et al 2017a 2017b the total equivalent hull mooring system static roll restoring moments for the three tested loading conditions are shown in fig 2 the slopes of the curves with mooring restoring effect at the origin provide the roll restoring coefficients for the decay motions simulations and for the linear frequency domain solutions for the responses in waves although the mooring effect in roll restoring is small it should be considered to reliably reproduce the roll resonant period for the time domain simulations in waves the mooring lines of the simplified system are explicitly numerically modelled however only restoring forces will be taken into account structural damping and drag forces induced by the mooring lines were neglected particularly because almost the whole length of the mooring lines stayed dry almost all the time even under the most severe wave condition decay tests in calm water have been performed for the three loading conditions for various initial roll angles 5 10 and 20 or 15 the initial condition for the decay tests was obtained by the application of a binary moment through an apparatus fig 3 that keeps the initial roll angle steady before releasing the ship to decay deck immersion or bottom emersion were not allowed since the roll decay angles were confined to the linear range of the restoring moment see fig 2 it can be represented by the product of a constant coefficient proportional to the respective initial metacentric height of each loading condition and the roll angle the tests in waves included regular irregular based on pierson moskowitz and jonswap theoretical spectra and transient waves clauss and bergmann 1986 clauss 1999 for several wave headings for the present work only beam waves i e 90 incidence will be analyzed table 2 displays the nominal period and heights of the specified incident waves for the tests for the jonswap waves irr js the peak enhancement factor γ has been also provided period t n denotes the roll natural period of the fpso for any given loading condition the extrapolation of model tests results to full scale condition was based on froude s similarity law although viscous related phenomena are typically the most affected by scale effects in the case of roll damping the only contribution strongly influenced by scale effects is the skin friction damping ittc 2011 according to ikeda himeno 1981 for small models the skin friction damping accounts for between 5 and 10 of the total damping but in full scale it may typically account for only 1 3 of the total roll damping therefore scale effects in roll damping can be usually neglected irkal et al 2016 jensen 2019 especially for hulls with bilge keels irkal et al 2016 further discussion on the scale effects on roll damping can be found in gu et al 2018 kianejad et al 2018 irkal et al 2019 kianejad et al 2019 3 calm water roll decay tests the roll decay motion of a ship in calm water can be expressed as a one degree of freedom equation given by 1 i 44 a 44 φ t b 44 φ φ t c 44 φ t 0 where φ t represents the instantaneous roll motion t is time i 44 is the mass inertia a 44 and c 44 denote added inertia and hydrostatic restoring coefficients respectively b 44 φ denotes the damping coefficient which can be considered dependent on roll amplitude in its canonical form eq 1 can be expressed as 2 φ p φ φ ω n 2 φ 0 where 3 ω n 2 m g g m i 44 a 44 4 p φ b 44 φ i 44 a 44 being m the mass g the gravity acceleration and g m the transversal metacentric height the damping moment can also be expressed in terms of linear and quadratic contributions 5 p φ φ p 1 φ p 2 φ φ for harmonic roll motion and assuming equivalent dissipated energy for both damping representations left and right hand sides in eq 5 an additional relationship between the coefficients p p 1 and p 2 can be established 6 p φ a p 1 p 2 16 3 t k φ a where the roll amplitude is φ a φ k φ k 1 2 φ k and φ k 1 denote two successive peaks in the roll decay motion and t k is the roll period the damping coefficients p or p 1 and p 2 are obtained from analyses of roll decay time records several techniques are available for these analyses spouge 1988 presents a detailed description and discussion on various methods for roll decay analyses fig 4 presents experimental time series of the roll decay tests of the fpso for its three loading conditions those decay tests correspond to the largest initial roll angle condition tested for each of the fpso s loading conditions the average measured damped roll natural periods were 14 8 s 14 4 s and 14 2 s for the full intermediate and ballast conditions respectively following the estimation of roll decay damping coefficients based on the logarithmic decrement method and the froude s energy method is presented 3 1 logarithmic decrement method when a 44 and c 44 are assumed time independent then eq 1 becomes linear and the solution is given by 7 φ t φ s e p t 2 cos ω d t β where ω d ω n 2 p 2 2 φ s φ 0 cos β β arctan p 2 ω d with the starting condition φ t 0 φ 0 and φ t 0 0 the peaks occur at t k π β ω d with k 0 1 2 so that the amplitude envelope is φ e n v φ s e p t 2 with successive peaks at 8 φ k φ s e p k π β 2 ω d the ratio of two successive peaks at the envelope is 9 φ k φ k 1 e p π 2 ω d so that 10 p 2 ω d π ln φ k φ k 1 the analyses of the decay tests based on the logarithmic decrement method are shown in graphical form in fig 5 the markers correspond to the peaks positive and negative of the experimental time series fig 4 and are based on eq 10 while the straight lines are the respective fitting curves based on eq 6 for the logarithmic method the successive peaks can be taken as only positive peaks or only negative peaks both choices have displayed very similar results in terms of fitting curves except for the ballast condition for which the experimental damping values show a larger dispersion among the decay cycles this behavior was confirmed in the two other repetitions of this decay condition a possible explanation may be related to the higher damping observed in this condition smith 2019 has also evidenced that decay analyses of such systems can display larger dispersion of the analysis points and may result in inaccurate estimation of damping coefficients to minimize the effect of dispersion on the decay coefficients in the logarithmic decrement method the fitting was performed using both the positive and negative peaks 3 2 froude s method this approach is based on the energy lost balance in each half cycle the energy dissipated by the damping term is equal to the variation of the potential energy work done by the restoring moment when the kinetic energy at the initial and final positions are zero assuming the linear plus quadratic damping form and linear restoring moment in the roll decay equation the energy balance gives 11 φ k φ k 1 φ p 1 φ p 2 φ φ d φ φ k φ k 1 ω n 2 φ d φ with d φ φ d t 12 0 t k 2 φ p 1 φ p 2 φ φ φ d t φ k φ k 1 ω n 2 φ d φ

function for δφ against φ a where p 1 and p 2 can be obtained by a regression procedure in this approach k refers to a positive peak while the successive k 1 peak refers to a negative one or vice versa fig 6 displays the plots corresponding to the analyses based on the froude energy method eq 16 for the roll decay series presented in fig 4 in general except for some points around 2 to 3 of mean roll angle the fitting of the parabolic function for roll decay data is quite satisfactory for the three loading conditions of the fpso even for the ballast condition which showed more dispersion than the other loading conditions when the logarithmic method was applied besides the roll natural period each decay test delivered a pair of damping coefficients linear and quadratic for the logarithmic method the y intercept and the slope of the fitting curves straight lines in fig 5 represent the damping coefficients p 1 and p 2 respectively eq 10 for the energy approach the linear coefficient of the parabolic regression function eq 16 provides p 1 while the quadratic term delivers p 2 the damping coefficients obtained from both methods and for the various initial angle conditions are summarized in tables 3 5 tables 3 5 evidence significant differences between the damping coefficients obtained from the logarithmic method and the froude s method in general for the three loading conditions the logarithmic method provided smaller values for p 1 and larger p 2 than the energy method spouge 1988 have arrived at similar conclusions from model tests and full scale roll decay tests with a fishing protection vessel more recently using a theoretical signal for the roll decay of a post panamax containership wassermann et al 2016a also reported the same findings for the linearized damping coefficient within each method significant differences are also observed associated to the initial roll angle condition and some tendencies can be identified if p 1 decreases with the increase of the initial decay angle p 2 increases as observed in the full condition conversely if p 1 increases with the increase of the initial decay angle p 2 decreases as in the intermediate and ballast conditions typically it is expected that p 2 is more relevant for the first decay cycles while p 1 for the smaller roll angles in the case of the fpso that behavior was only confirmed for the full loading condition the intermediate and ballast conditions showed an opposite tendency among the three loading conditions the ballast condition exhibits the largest coefficients p 1 and p 2 either from the logarithmic decrement of the energy method this fact is also evident in the decay time series fig 4 and the fitting curves of fig 5 this behavior may be related to the underwater hull aspect of the fpso in terms of half breadth to draught ratio which is 1 3 for the full condition 1 8 for the intermediate condition and 3 4 for the ballast condition similar findings are reported in wassermann et al 2016a when comparing the results of decay tests under ballast and full loading condition for a post panamax containership according to katayama et al 2019b the half breadth to draught ratio is relevant for the bilge keel component and deserves further investigation due to its complexity especially in shallow draught cases since the logarithmic decrement and the froude s energy method provide significant different damping coefficients their quality should be assessed based on their ability to rebuild the corresponding experimental decay time series so the numerical solution of the equation of the uncoupled roll decay motion with quadratic damping has been implemented using the damping coefficients shown in tables 3 5 the plots of the numerically rebuilt roll decay motions are shown in fig 7 for the sake of comparison the corresponding experimental time series have also been reproduced together despite the significant differences observed in the terms of damping coefficients between the two analysis methods the respective time series of the numerically reconstructed roll decays do not present such discrepancies for any of the loading conditions indeed for the full and intermediate conditions excellent agreement was obtained at large and small roll angles for the ballast condition the agreement is still satisfactory with a slightly better performance of the logarithmic method especially at large roll angles at small angles the coefficients obtained from both methods underpredicted the roll motions in summary the pair of coefficients that can reproduce the experimental decay series with the same level of accuracy is not unique thus the performance of roll damping coefficients p 1 and p 2 should be assessed in pairs and not as independent single values further discussion on the comparison of the performance of different roll decay analysis techniques can be found in spouge 1988 4 roll motions in waves the rigid body motions of ship in waves is typically described using six degrees of freedom 6 dof which can be described using the following dynamic equation 17 m s f f k f d i f f f r a d f s t f v i s f m o o r where m denotes the 6 6 structural mass matrix s x y z φ θ ψ t is the 6 1 vector of accelerations in the 6 dof i e surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw respectively the right hand side of eq 17 contains 6 1 vectors of forces and moments where f fk represents the incident wave or froude krylov excitation loads f diff are the diffraction loads f rad are the radiation forces moments f st are the hydrostatic restoring loads resulting from the combined actions of gravity and buoyancy forces moments f vis represents the viscous contributions on damping and f moor the forces induced by the mooring system the determination of the motions of a moored floating structure in response to waves may be a complex procedure and requires time domain analysis depending on how the above described forces moments are modelled especially when nonlinearities are included since the aim of the present study is to characterize the roll damping in waves for a relatively large number of tested conditions time domain analysis seem prohibitively time consuming to perform a systematic parametric study on the other hand a frequency domain solution of ship motions equations can provide a simple and fast tool to achieve that objective to perform frequency domain analysis the main requirement is to linearize the forces moments on the right hand side of eq 17 so that the equations of motion are typically expressed as 18 m a s b s c s f e x c t where a b and c are 6 6 matrices containing added mass damping and restoring coefficients respectively the damping coefficients include viscous damping contributions and the restoring coefficients incorporate the restoring effect of the mooring system f exc t represents the 6 1 vector of wave excitation froude krylov plus diffraction loads when port starboard symmetry of the ship and of the loading condition is assumed the set of anti symmetric motions sway roll and yaw become decoupled from the set of symmetric motions surge heave and pitch for the sake of simplicity for the analysis of roll motion in beam waves it is quite usual to decouple the roll equation from sway and yaw motions bulian and francescutto 2011 hou and zou 2015 2016 wassermann et al 2016a somayajula and falzarano 2017 so that the uncoupled roll equation can be described as 19 i 44 a 44 φ t b 44 φ φ t c 44 φ t m φ t where the term in the right hand side of eq 19 represents the wave excitation roll moment in the following sections 4 1 and 4 2 the analytical solution of frequency domain approach will be presented based on the uncouple 1 dof roll motion equation however in the numerical solution the full 6 dof system of the frequency domain will be solved viscous damping and mooring restoring effects will be only considered in the roll motion equation 4 1 frequency domain responses in regular waves in regular waves the roll exciting moment m φ is described by 20 m φ t f w 4 cos ω t α 4 f w4 and α4 are respectively the amplitude and phase of the wave excitation moment ω is the wave excitation frequency the solution of eq 19 can be expressed as lewis 1988 journée and massie 2001 21 φ ω f w 4 ω ω 2 i 44 a 44 ω i ω b 44 ω c 44 where φ and f w 4 are the complex amplitudes of the roll motion and the excitation moment i 1 the hydrodynamic potential coefficients and forces can be obtained using commercial software based on panel methods for instance wamit or ansys aqwa the response amplitude operator rao of the roll motion can be defined by 22 r a o φ ω φ a ω ζ a ω where ζ a ω is the amplitude of the incident wave and φ a is the amplitude of the response fig 8 presents the experimental rao values obtained from the regular wave tests of the fpso for the three loading conditions together with the numerical rao curve from the linear potential solution the experimental roll rao has been computed based on the amplitude of the first harmonic from the fourier series analyses of the time series of the measured roll motions and the incident wave elevations the potential roll rao curve has been obtained numerically neglecting viscous effects in eq 18 i e assuming that the roll damping coefficient comes only from radiation effects i e b 44 b 44r b 44r represents the roll radiation damping coefficient the vertical line in fig 8a b and 8c identifies the natural roll period of the full intermediate and ballast loading condition respectively the peak of the experimental roll rao of each loading condition is very close to the corresponding resonant period identified in the roll decay tests furthermore except for the periods close to the roll natural period the potential rao curves agreed well with the experimental values for the three loading conditions i e the viscous contributions seem to be negligible outside the resonance region the ratio of the roll radiation damping coefficient to the critical roll damping at the roll natural period for the full intermediate and ballast loading conditions are 2 2 1 4 and 0 7 respectively thus in terms of radiation damping the ballast condition is the less damped one it should be recalled that the decay tests which include viscous damping effects showed that the ballast condition was the most damped among the three loading conditions so a priori based on decay tests results viscous effects on the ballast condition are expected to be stronger than in the other loading conditions around the roll resonance period the radiation damping alone is not able to reproduce the actual responses experimental raos i e either viscous effects and or other nonlinearities should be taken into account in the numerical model indeed the linear damping coefficients obtained from decay tests tables 3 5 are significantly different from the potential damping values furthermore since the experimental raos around resonance for the same wave period and different wave heights display significant different values it can be concluded that either viscous damping or other nonlinearities are sensitive to wave height changes too since the maximum rolling amplitudes achieved during the tests in waves for all loading conditions did not exceeded 13 even for the waves of 10 5 m height see table 6 the effect of nonlinearities associated to the pure roll restoring moment is not expected to be significant see fig 2 the roll restoring moment has a strong linear behavior up to 17 of heel angle thus a priori viscous effects remain as the main cause of the differences in the rao associated to the wave height this hypothesis will be later discussed in the analyses of nonlinear time domain simulations 4 2 frequency domain responses in irregular waves the frequency domain responses in regular waves allow the application of the spectral approach to address the motions in irregular seas i e bhattacharyya 1978 faltinsen 1993 23 s φ ω r a o φ ω 2 s ζ ω where s ζ ω and s φ ω denote the power spectral densities of the incident sea wave spectrum and the roll response motion spectrum respectively the significant motion amplitude φ1 3 is given by 24 φ 1 3 2 m 0 φ where m 0φ is the zero order moment of the motion spectrum a numerical simulation of roll motion can be considered satisfactory if the significant roll amplitude and the corresponding motion spectrum of the numerical simulation and of the experimental roll are similar from eq 23 it is clear that to obtain an accurate prediction of the roll response for a given sea state its rao function should be reliable in the full range of frequencies of interest i e the roll rao curve should account for viscous damping effects the experimental spectra of incident wave and roll response have been obtained from a fast fourier transform of the corresponding measured time series then the significant amplitudes of the incident wave and of the roll response were obtained from the area under the respective spectra table 6 summarizes the dimensional absolute amplitudes of the experimental roll responses from the tests under regular and irregular waves tests table 6 evidences that the larger roll amplitudes in bold face occurred at the damped natural period measured in the roll decay tests especially for the wave heights of 3 5 and 7 0 m however for the highest wave amplitudes 10 5 m the maximum roll amplitudes in red bold face shifted slightly to periods higher than those observed in the decay tests this shift in the resonant period is typically observed in mechanical oscillators when the damping of the system is increased this behavior is further discussed in the analysis of roll damping coefficients in waves 5 the hybrid method for roll damping estimation in waves to quantify the roll damping in waves including viscous effects a hybrid method that combines experimental results from tests in waves and numerical predictions of ship motions in waves based on the frequency domain approach was adopted for a given test condition in waves the hybrid method can be summarized in the following steps 1 compute the response amplitude or response spectra from the experimental time series of the incident wave and the roll motion the amplitudes will be used to compute the rao values for the regular wave conditions the response spectra will be used for the irregular seas computations 2 in the numerical model of the roll motion equation the incident wave characteristics should be input based on the experimental values defined in step 1 3 the damping coefficient in the frequency domain numerical model for instance eq 19 includes the radiation as well as the viscous effects i e 25 b 44 b 44r b e where b 44r is the linear radiation damping coefficient computed from for instance wamit and b e represents the viscous damping contribution in waves which may be regarded as an external linearized roll damping coefficient if b 44 b 44r and b e are divided by i 44 a 44 ω n the corresponding coefficients p 44 p 44r and p e are obtained 4 the external linearized damping is iteratively varied starting for instance from b e 0 i e with only the potential damping until the numerical response matches the experimental one within a given tolerance in the 1 dof frequency domain approach the numerical response in regular waves is given by eq 21 and for irregular waves eqs 22 24 are necessary too the convergence criteria are based on the roll response amplitude for the regular wave tests and on the zero spectral moment of the roll response m 0φ for the irregular wave tests 5 the last iteration in step 4 provides the calibrated external damping coefficient this coefficient accounts for viscous effects in waves and should be added to the radiation damping to obtain the total roll damping coefficient eq 25 in waves for the given test condition fig 9 schematizes the calibration procedure of the roll responses in waves and the finding of the respective external roll damping coefficient for a given test condition in terms of mathematical model the calibrated roll damping coefficient is linear but it should be regarded as piece wise linear because although it is constant for each test condition it is allowed to change according to the incident wave characteristics i e wave height and or wave period for the irregular seas the external damping is assumed constant for a given significant wave height and the period domain of the corresponding sea spectrum once the roll damping coefficient for a given test condition is determined the time series of the test condition should be numerically reconstructed to verify the performance of the calibrated external damping coefficient this verification can be done by solving the linear model of the roll motion equation eq 18 in the time domain 5 1 time domain verifications although time domain simulations of ship motions in waves demand significant more computational effort than frequency domain solutions especially when nonlinearities are present and long duration stochastic sea conditions are considered they are usually regarded to provide more accurate motions predictions two approaches for the time domain simulations will be adopted first the linear model eq 18 will be solved to verify the quality of the calibrated linearized roll damping coefficient then a nonlinear model will be used to verify the suitability of the assumptions adopted for the frequency domain solutions and the eventual influence of nonlinearities the nonlinearities will be introduced in the roll damping by adding the quadratic damping term when roll decay damping coefficients are to be used and in the hydrostatic restoring and froude krylov loads in the six degrees of freedom the latter nonlinearities are introduced when the pressure integration is carried out over the instantaneous wetted hull due to wave passage and ship motions the time domain numerical model adopted here is based on the time response module of ansys aqwa former aqwa naut before the time domain simulations the hydrodynamic coefficients are computed in the hydrodynamic radiation diffraction module of aqwa former aqwa line which is based on linear potential flow theory and boundary element panel method for the time domain simulations ansys aqwa allows the inclusion of user defined external damping linear and quadratic terms as well as the modelling of the mooring system considering that the mooring lines were almost all the time out of water during the model tests only the restoring effects of the mooring system were taken into account in the six degrees of freedom i e structural damping and drag forces associated to the mooring lines were neglected 5 2 roll damping coefficients from regular waves fig 10 shows the external viscous roll damping coefficient obtained from the regular wave tests the curve of roll radiation damping coefficients has been also included for each loading condition the analyses of these results fig 10 should be done vis à vis fig 8 and table 6 based on that comparison two regimes of periods can be identified at each loading condition the regime or range of periods where the experimental roll rao is very close to the potential roll rao curve that only considers radiation damping viscous damping effects can be assumed negligible for the three loading conditions of the fpso that behavior is observed for the range of wave periods below 13 s fig 8 and where the roll amplitudes did not exceed 2 considering the wave height of 3 5 m table 6 in terms of external roll damping coefficients fig 10 these test conditions displayed large dispersion associated either to slightly larger or smaller experimental roll rao values relative to the potential roll rao for the periods in which the experimental rao was larger than the potential rao the calibration of the external viscous roll damping coefficient was numerically not possible assuming that only positive damping coefficients are expected so the viscous roll damping coefficient was taken as null i e roll damping is composed only of radiation damping effects conversely when the experimental rao was smaller calibration was possible but the obtained external damping coefficients were very large in practice excessively large roll damping values are not expected but based on mechanical vibrations theory rao 2019 make sense outside the resonance region the responses of a mechanical oscillator system to harmonic excitation like the ship in waves are almost insensitive to damping i e large damping values are required to induce small changes in motion amplitudes indeed journée and massie 2001 shows that for the periods below the resonance region motions are dominated by spring terms restoring terms while for the periods above the resonance region motions are dominated by inertia terms thus outside the resonance region the calibration of responses should be focused on the restoring or inertia terms however it should be recalled that roll motions in these range of periods are usually very small and in general are not of practical interest around the roll resonance the experimental roll raos are significantly far from the potential roll rao and large roll motions take place in this regime above 13 s viscous damping effects are very strong although the viscous roll damping coefficients are not excessively large they are much greater than the potential damping coefficients and exhibit a significant increase as wave height increases for instance at roll resonance the external damping coefficient for the largest wave height 10 5 m almost doubles the corresponding value for the smallest wave height 3 5 m for any of the tested loading conditions to better assess this behavior the total linearized roll damping coefficients have been calculated for all the test conditions close to the roll resonance period for each loading condition and plotted against the mean roll response amplitude fig 11 a linear regression line like that of the logarithmic decrement method have also been plotted together with the corresponding experimental roll decay tests the comparison of the regression line of the tests under regular waves with that of the decay tests in clam water evidence that the damping coefficients in regular waves are quite different from those of decay tests for the full and intermediate loading conditions for the ballast condition the results from wave tests and decay tests seem to be in better agreement in general the linearized roll damping coefficients in waves are larger than those obtained from decay tests at least for the range of experimentally measured roll responses moreover the larger the roll response i e the larger the height of the incident wave the larger the roll damping coefficient this behavior agrees with the shift in the roll resonant period observed in table 6 these findings are also in agreement with those preliminary discussed in van t veer and fathi 2011 and recently reported in kianejad et al 2020 more tests in waves with lower regular wave amplitudes would be necessary to obtain a more complete description of the roll damping coefficient in waves so that more accurate fitting lines can be traced furthermore it would be possible to extract coefficients p 1 and p 2 from regular waves tests for each loading condition to assess how the difference in the roll damping coefficients from decay tests and wave tests affect the roll response in waves time domain numerical simulations have been performed as described in section 5 1 the time domain numerical model was firstly configured to reproduce the tests in waves for the roll resonance period using the damping coefficients linear plus quadratic model from calm water roll decay tests tables 3 5 other nonlinearities were not allowed then a second round of numerical simulations was performed allowing only the inclusion of the roll damping coefficient calibrated from each teste condition in waves finally to verify the effect of nonlinearities in hydrostatics and froude krylov actions on the roll responses a third group of simulations was performed considering those nonlinearities figs 12 14 shows the numerical simulations of the roll motions for wave reg12 i e at the roll resonant period with a nominal wave height of 10 5 m for the full intermediate and ballast loading conditions of the fpso respectively together with the numerically simulated roll motions based on roll decay damping coefficients decay and those based on the calibrated roll damping from wave tests calib the respective experimental roll time series are also shown both the linear lin and nonlinear nonlin numerical simulations have been plotted figs 12 14 agree with the tendencies observed in fig 11 since roll damping coefficients from decay tests in calm water are smaller than those from tests in waves the corresponding numerical simulations are overpredicted relative to experimental roll amplitudes by about 40 15 and 70 for the full intermediate and ballast condition respectively the numerical simulations based on the linear model with the calibrated damping coefficient from the wave tests are in good agreement with the experimental responses despite some differences associated to the slightly changing roll amplitudes observed in the experiments the simulations based on the hydrostatic and froude krylov nonlinear model with calibrated linearized damping showed almost no differences in relation to the linear model the same behavior is observed for the simulations based on the roll damping coefficients from roll decay tests therefore the nonlinear effects associated to hydrostatic restoring and froude krylov loads can be considered negligible at the resonant period for the three loading conditions these results indicate that at least for the type of fpso hull under the environmental conditions analyzed here the linear numerical model in frequency and time domain with an adequate roll damping coefficient has shown to be more accurate than nonlinear models with a deficient estimation of the roll damping coefficient roll damping coefficients from decay tests seem to be not reliable for the tested conditions in waves table 5 summarizes the total radiation plus viscous roll damping coefficients in waves at the resonant roll period for the three loadings conditions of the fpso although a direct comparison of the roll damping coefficients in table 7 with those of tables 3 5 cannot be performed table 7 allows to evidence quantitatively the significant increase in the roll damping coefficients as the wave increases within each loading condition 5 3 roll damping coefficients from irregular waves the procedure outlined in the beginning of section 5 was applied to the irregular sea conditions described in table 2 fig 15 illustrates the power spectral densities psd of the experimental incident wave sw exp the experimental response sr exp and the numerical calibrated response spectra sr num corresponding to the wave irr js1 100 year extreme sea condition for campos basin brazil irr js2 1 year sea condition for campos basin brazil irr pm and trans for the full loading condition figs 16 and 17 present similar results for the intermediate and ballast conditions for the same corresponding sea states the calibration of the responses based on the frequency domain numerical model under irregular wave conditions was considered in general quite satisfactory showing very good matches between the numerical calibrated and the experimental spectra for most of the tested conditions indeed for wave irr js1 which is an extreme wave condition 7 8 m of significant wave height with peak period near the roll resonant periods of the fpso the comparison between the experimental response spectra and their corresponding numerical calibrated spectra were in excellent agreement for the three loading conditions some differences were observed in the roll response spectra for wave irr js2 whose peak period is relatively far from the fpso s roll natural periods but only for the period components around the resonant roll periods notice that the significant roll amplitudes for the three loading conditions under that sea state did not exceed 1 for the irr pm sea state whose peak period is also relatively near the fpso s roll resonant periods but with lower significant wave height 5 9 m than irr js1 the calibration of the viscous damping coefficients also returned quite successful results as evidenced by the experimental and numerical response spectra the transient wave trans which may be interpreted as a white noise wave spectrum was the tested wave with lowest significant height 2 2 m except for the full loading condition the experimental roll responses under the transient wave for the two other loading conditions were successfully calibrated with the numerical model the significant amplitudes of roll responses under the transient wave did not exceed 2 a summary of the total radiation plus viscous roll damping coefficients in irregular waves at the tested sea states for the three loading conditions are shown in table 8 for each test condition a single calibrated external damping coefficient was obtained significant differences were found among the roll damping coefficients at different sea states of the same loading condition so as observed for regular waves roll damping coefficients in irregular waves are also strongly affected by the incident wave characteristics in fact if the results from trans wave are obviated it can be easily concluded that the roll damping coefficients increases as the significant wave height increases for the three loading conditions for transient wave also regarded as broad band or white noise wave spectrum which is compounded of mild waves unexpected large roll damping values have been obtained greater than those for the extreme sea state irr js1 since the transient wave does not represent a realistic ocean wave and the roll responses for this wave are quite small below 2 of significant amplitude the roll damping coefficients from this type of wave may be limited in application and should be restricted to cases in which very small roll responses are expected the results from irregular waves can be further analyzed in terms of roll rao curves the rao curves can be easily obtained from the frequency domain numerical model once the calibrated roll damping coefficient is available from irregular wave tests figs 18 20 show the resultant rao curves obtained from each of the sea states tested at the full intermediate and ballast loading condition respectively the total roll damping ratio i e the actual roll damping expressed as percentage of the critical roll damping coefficient b c for the roll resonant period is displayed in the legend of the respective figures those roll rao curves evidence the range of wave periods in which the effect of the incident wave characteristics thus roll damping coefficients is stronger for the three loading conditions of the fpso this range of periods can be assumed between 12 s and 18 s moreover as already shown in the calibration of the response spectra under wave irr js2 around the roll resonant period the corresponding calibrated damping coefficient overestimated the responses i e underestimated the roll damping coefficient especially for full and ballast condition thus those roll rao curves based on irr js2 for the full and ballast condition should be disregarded at least between 12 s and 18 s it should be recalled that the calibration of the roll damping coefficients was done based on the frequency domain linear spectral model to verify the performance of those damping coefficients in time domain models numerical simulations have been performed using the numerical models described in section 5 1 the numerical models allow the simulation of four types of time domain numerical roll responses a first type calib lin was obtained using the linear model with the calibrated roll damping coefficient from the irregular wave tests the second type decay lin was obtained with the linear model similar but with the roll damping coefficients linear plus quadratic from decay tests the third and fourth types of the numerical responses calib nonlin and decay nonlin respectively were obtained using the nonlinear model in which nonlinearities in the hydrostatic restoring and froude krylov actions are considered the third type uses the calibrated roll damping coefficient from the tests in waves and the fourth type adopted the roll decay linear plus quadratic damping coefficients as an example fig 21 shows the four types of numerical roll simulations for the test condition under the wave irr js1 at the full loading condition together with the corresponding experimental response in all the numerical simulations 5 of the respective critical damping has been introduced as additional external damping to account for viscous contribution in the sway and yaw linear damping coefficients the effect of the viscous contributions in sway and yaw on roll simulations is later discussed although the differences among the time series are not so apparent in general the numerical roll simulations based on the roll damping coefficients from decay tests both with the linear and the nonlinear model decay lin and decay nonlin respectively overpredicted the experiments while the simulations based on the linear and nonlinear models with the calibrated roll damping coefficient calib lin and calib nonlin show a better agreement with the experimental responses for a better assessment on the quality of the roll damping coefficients for roll simulations under irregular wave conditions the power spectral densities of each numerical time series have been computed fig 22 shows the corresponding spectra of the time series shown in fig 21 the spectra of the numerical responses fig 22 further evidence that the simulations based on roll decay damping coefficients significantly overpredict the experimental roll responses on the other hand the spectra of the numerical simulations based on the calibrated roll damping coefficient show satisfactory agreement with the experimental spectra the simulations with the linear model seem better to quantify how close the numerical predictions are to the experimental response the significant amplitudes and mean periods of the roll responses have been computed from the response spectra table 9 displays these spectral parameters and more clearly show that the linear model based on the calibrated roll damping coefficient provided the best result relative to the experimental values furthermore it is evident that the effect of nonlinearities in the restoring and froude krylov loads on the significant response amplitudes can be considered negligible however those nonlinearities caused a slight decrease in the response mean periods which may be explained by a hardening effect in the restoring characteristics of the fpso i e the ship in waves becomes stiffer this latter effect is similar to the reported in ships subjected to parametric rolling in severe head seas neves and rodríguez 2007 and may deserve further investigation in future works in the time domain simulations of the tests in irregular waves other aspects have shown to be critical for the accuracy of the roll motions predictions such as the modelling of mooring lines and the introduction of external viscous damping in the sway and yaw motions if mooring lines are not considered in the numerical simulations yaw motions start to drift excessively after some time of the simulation inducing significant changes in the ship heading relative to the incident waves consequently significant wave excitation appears in all the six degrees of freedom of the ship if sway and yaw motions are rigidly constrained roll simulations substantially overpredict the motions if mooring lines are modelled and only potential radiation damping is considered in the degrees of freedom other than roll roll motions are underpredicted while sway and yaw motions are largely overpredicted a possible explanation to this behavior can be related to the energy transfer among the ship modes part of the energy that was supposed to be dissipated through roll is dissipated by sway and yaw to improve the accuracy of the roll predictions it was necessary to heuristically introduce viscous damping in the sway b 22v and yaw b 66v linear damping coefficients the amount of viscous damping was 5 of the respective critical damping coefficients these values brought the sway and yaw motions quite close to the respective experimental values and consequently improved the numerical time domain roll predictions see fig 22 fig 23 compares the spectra of the different simulated roll responses for the test condition analyzed in fig 22 in all of them the linear model with the calibrated roll damping coefficient has been used further investigation covering the above aspects and others such as the effect of slow drift forces should be performed as a next step however the implementation of those features in the time domain model would substantially increase the computational cost comparing the performance and the computational effort of the linear frequency domain spectral and the time domain approaches for the simulations of roll motions in irregular waves it was confirmed that the former approach is the best method in terms of cost benefit 5 4 regular vs irregular waves results to compare the roll damping coefficients from the irregular wave tests with those from regular waves at the roll resonance period the numerical rao curves associated to the calibrated roll damping coefficients have been used figs 24 26 present the numerical rao curves corresponding to the test conditions close to the roll resonant period of the full intermediate and ballast conditions respectively figs 24 26 evidence that the damping coefficients calibrated from the irregular waves analyses are in general in good agreement with the values predicted from regular waves the less damped conditions in irregular waves are associated to wave irr pm while in regular waves to wave reg16 period of 15 1 s and height of 3 5 m for the three loading conditions it should be noticed however that the less damped conditions in regular waves were in general close to those corresponding to wave reg10 i e the roll resonant waves of height 3 5 m the lower limits for the damping ratios were 6 7 7 3 and 9 2 for irr pm and 8 7 6 6 and 7 7 for reg10 corresponding to the full intermediate and ballast loading conditions respectively these results confirm that both under regular and irregular waves the lower wave heights displayed the lower roll damping coefficients on the other hand the highest damped conditions in irregular waves were associated to wave irr js1 the 100 year irregular wave while in regular waves to reg12 i e the roll resonant waves of height of 10 5 m coincidently the damping ratios for irr js1 were around 10 while for reg12 were around 13 for the three loading conditions since the significant wave height for irr js1 7 8 m is lower than the wave height for reg12 10 5 m the roll damping coefficients found for those wave conditions further reflect that the highest the wave height the highest the roll damping coefficient see also tables 7 and 8 6 conclusions the roll damping of a fpso unit has been analyzed based on experimental results from decay tests in calm water and seakeeping tests in regular and irregular seas the logarithmic decrement and the froude s energy methods using the linear plus quadratic model has been applied for the decay tests the results from both methods showed significant differences in the values of the damping coefficients however the time domain simulations of the decay tests based on those damping coefficients reproduced the experimental series satisfactorily independently of adopted method it is concluded that there is not a unique pair of roll damping coefficients p 1 and p 2 that can provide satisfactory results i e the performance of roll damping coefficients p 1 and p 2 should be assessed in pairs and not as independent single values for the seakeeping tests a hybrid numerical plus experimental iterative approach has been adopted to estimate the roll damping coefficients the hybrid approach iteratively simulates the roll response in waves of a given experimental condition using a linearized external viscous damping coefficient as parameter once the experimental and the numerically simulated roll response match a calibrated roll damping coefficient is obtained based on the calibrated roll damping coefficients frequency domain roll rao curves have been computed for each regular and irregular test condition the results of an extensive model test campaign of a ship shaped fpso have been used to investigate the roll damping coefficients in waves the hybrid approach based on frequency domain model with linearized roll damping has been successfully applied for mild as well as for extreme wave conditions the calibrated roll damping coefficients from the regular and irregular waves have evidenced that there is a strong effect of the incidence wave condition or the induced roll response on the value of the coefficient in fact around the roll resonance region the larger damping coefficients around 13 have been obtained for the more energetic sea conditions i e higher wave heights while the smaller roll damping coefficients around 8 were obtained for the milder waves this tendency is opposite to the observed in the decay test data a time domain numerical tool to reproduce the roll responses in waves has been also used to validate the frequency domain model of the hybrid approach linear and nonlinear hydrostatic and froude krylov models that used the roll damping coefficients from either decay tests or wave calibrated responses have been implemented the comparison of those numerical simulations with the experimental responses have evidenced that the roll behavior of the fpso in regular waves was basically linear for the three loading conditions for a given wave condition for the irregular wave conditions the frequency domain linear method based on the spectral approach was capable of reproducing the experimental roll response spectra even for the most energetic seas the time domain either linear or nonlinear model also displayed satisfactory results however a careful calibration of the mooring system and viscous effects associated to the horizontal modes were necessary therefore much more computational effort is required if compared to the frequency domain spectral approach moreover it was evidenced that at least for the investigated conditions of the fpso the calibrated linearized damping allowed the reliable reproduction of the roll dynamics of the vessel in waves the use of roll decay damping coefficients in the simulation of the motions of the fpso in waves overpredicted the roll responses and may unnecessarily penalize the design of the floating unit finally it can be concluded that for a realistic assessment of the roll behavior of the fpso in waves the correct modelling of the damping coefficient even using the linearized form is more important than the modelling of nonlinearities including the quadratic roll damping term credit authorship contribution statement claudio a rodríguez

21640,roll damping is one of the most important parameters in the assessment of the behavior of floating systems in waves but its prediction is still an open issue despite the greater improvements achieved with the advent of computational fluid dynamics the estimation of roll damping is still highly dependent on experiments a typical approach is to perform decay tests and use the damping coefficients as direct inputs in numerical simulations of motions in waves the present study shows that roll damping is significantly affected by the incident wave and proposes a hybrid approach to estimate roll damping coefficients in waves combining experimental results from model tests in waves with numerical simulations to illustrate the proposed procedure the experimental data of a typical ship shaped fpso in regular and irregular waves have been used these results have been compared with those from typical decay tests in calm water a time domain nonlinear potential model has also been used to benchmark the results of the hybrid approach it was found that the damping coefficients obtained from the hybrid approach provide a more realistic representation of the roll dynamics than those from typical decay tests keywords seakeeping decay tests rao irregular waves nonlinearities viscous damping 1 introduction the accurate prediction of roll motion is still an issue in the assessment of safety and operability of ships and offshore structures in waves due to the complexity in the estimation of roll damping indeed the relevance of roll damping has been recognized and addressed in many references that can be traced back to as far as the investigations of william froude 1861 falzarano et al 2015 bačkalov et al 2016 and manderbacka et al 2019 have provided a recent overview on the importance of roll damping and an extensive literature review of the various roll damping prediction methods for ship shaped structures in the context of the development of the second generation intact stability criteria sgisc proposed by the international maritime organization imo the need of accurate estimation of roll motion has regained attention as evidenced by the number of recent publications concerning this topic in the last stab 2018 and issw 2019 for instance ikeda 2018 presented a historical review of his prediction method and stressed the need for further developments using for instance cfd tools smith 2018 explored and compared various typical methods of calculation of roll damping values from roll decay empirical data oliva remola et al 2018 analyzed the influence of different experimental techniques for roll decay tests with a model of a trawler fishing vessel gu et al 2018 numerically investigated the scale effects on ship roll damping based on decay tests in calm water using rans equations wassermann et al 2018 hashimoto et al 2019 and costa de oliveira et al 2019 have also investigated and provided relevant remarks on ship roll damping and motions using cfd and or efd cichowicz and vassalos 2019 discussed the influence of decomposition of the hydrodynamic reaction moment the assumption of small amplitude motions and the coupling of roll to other modes of motion especially with sway gu et al 2019 further investigated several crucial factors that affect cfd simulations of roll damping such as boundary condition wall function and mesh size katayama et al 2019a proposed a rational short term prediction method considering nonlinearity in roll damping and restoring moments oliva remola and pérez rojas 2019 presented an approach for the assessment of uncertainty of roll decay tests and emphasized the difficulties in the determination of uncertainties associated to nonlinear damping coefficients smith 2019 presented an alternative approach for the analysis of roll decay experiments for high damping cases the sgisc aim at assessing the vulnerability of ships to several phenomena in waves such as parametric rolling and excessive acceleration whose occurrence and intensity strongly depend on the magnitude of roll damping in addition to the issues related to the sgisc roll damping is also a concern for offshore platforms naval hull forms and several other applications as reported in for instance van t veer and fathi 2011 fernandes et al 2018 gokce and kinaci 2018 mancini et al 2018 irkal et al 2019 jensen 2019 katayama et al 2019b kianejad et al 2019 kim et al 2019 yu et al 2019 asgari et al 2020 kianejad et al 2020 kim et al 2020 despite the great number of theoretical numerical and experimental works dedicated to the problem of roll damping there is still no standard methodology for its prediction due to the complexity of the different physical phenomena involved concurrently frictional resistance vortex formation wave making on the free surface lifting moments etc recent developments in computational fluid dynamics cfd tools have allowed significant improvement in the prediction of the physics of roll damping but in quantitative terms they are still a good promise for the future imo 2016 zhou et al 2015 have proposed a 3 d rans approach for calculating the roll damping of a ship under free decay experiments without forward speed although some good agreements with experiments are reported the quality of the numerical predictions depended on the availability of experimental data and the selected time step avalos and wanderley 2018 have used 2 d navier stokes equations to study the influence of bilge keels on the roll damping of fpso sections under forced roll oscillations neglecting the wave radiation effects their results showed that the generated vortices influenced the pressure distribution around the hull irkal et al 2016 2019 have proposed a cfd approach to estimate the roll damping of ship shaped floating systems with and without bilge keels based on simulations of roll decay tests it is reported that the effect of bilge keel thickness degrees of freedom and scaling on roll motion and damping was insignificant on the other side based on the herm technique the works of kianejad et al 2018 and kianejad et al 2019 show that care should be taken when extrapolating results from model scale to full scale due to possible scale effects kim et al 2020 performed experimental and numerical studies to estimate roll damping and hydrodynamic pressure on a 2 d rectangular structure in free roll decay they found that the cfd results compared well with the experimental validation based on pressure estimation from piv measurements from the literature review on cfd approaches to assess roll damping it can be concluded that most studies either neglect some important effects and or are restricted to decay tests or forced roll motions cfd approaches for the direct simulation of motions of intact free running ships in waves have gained increasing attention but the associated computational effort is still prohibitive and further validations with experimental data are required indeed according to imo report sdc 4 5 1 add 1 imo 2016 the most reliable source of information on roll damping is still scaled model tests that document recommends that for numerical simulations of roll motion the roll damping coefficients should be estimated with model tests using the procedures outlined in msc 1 circ 1200 imo 2006 namely free roll decays or forced roll motion regarding semi empirical approaches the well known ikeda s method as described in himeno 1981 is the most widely used semi empirical approach for the prediction of roll damping the method assumes that roll damping can be divided in components which are computed separately based on theoretical and experimental considerations kawahara et al 2012 further simplified ikeda s method by using regression formulas that only need the ship s main characteristics as input this approach is recommended by imo report sdc 4 5 1 add 1 imo 2016 and by ittc 2011 to predict roll damping in the absence of ship specific prototype or roll decay model test data nonetheless some works e g imo 2011a 2011b rudaković and bačkalov 2017 oliveira et al 2019 have shown that the simplified approach is not able to predict the experimental decay tests coefficients of some hull forms and loading conditions from the experimental perspective several authors have investigated methods and analysis techniques to estimate roll damping for instance wassermann et al 2016a compared the advantages and disadvantages of the decay motion and the harmonic excited roll motion herm ii tests the herm ii technique was identified as the most advantageous the work of smith 2018 showed that in theory the methods of calculation of roll damping coefficients from decay tests are equivalent but in practice they do produce different values of damping coefficients oliva remola et al 2018 reported that uncertainty associated with data recording and analyses dominate over differences between the techniques there are several other recent works that report experimental data but are generally related to validation of cfd studies and are based on decay tests and or harmonic oscillations in calm water mancini et al 2018 jensen 2019 kim et al 2019 2020 the above references evidence that roll damping studies are basically focused on decay and or forced excited roll conditions the damping coefficients obtained from those tests which are typically performed in calm water are assumed to be representative of the roll damping in waves this hypothesis however may not be reliable especially when moderate sea conditions are considered indeed based on model tests and 3d cfd simulations with two fpsos van t veer and fathi 2011 stated that free decay tests can suffer from memory effects and found that damping in waves could be higher than the damping in free decay in calm water hou and zou 2015 2016 have applied parameters identification techniques to identified roll damping and restoring coefficients from motions in regular and irregular waves but comparisons with roll decay coefficients were not done somayajula and falzarano 2017 applied an advanced system identification technique to obtain the roll damping coefficients of a research vessel from irregular waves based on the calibration of the roll rao curve they found that numerical roll simulations based on decay damping coefficients were less accurate than those from irregular waves more recently based on experimental and cfd studies with a bulk carrier ship kianejad et al 2020 concluded that the magnitude of hydrodynamic coefficients in regular beam sea conditions are different compared to the still water condition the present study further investigates the roll damping in regular and irregular waves based on model tests experiments with a typical fpso hull at three loading conditions first roll decay tests results are investigated using the typical approaches for the determination of roll damping coefficients then using a hybrid procedure that relies on experimental data and numerical simulations the roll damping coefficients for the fpso are estimated for the regular and irregular waves conditions initially a frequency domain numerical model of the uncouple roll motion has been used where the linearized damping coefficient was the calibration parameter the mean amplitude of the response and the area under the roll response spectrum were adopted as calibration criteria of the motions in regular and irregular waves respectively the damping coefficients corresponding to the calibrated roll response in waves are expected to provide more realistic predictions than those from decay tests 2 experimental data a ship shaped fpso unit typical of brazilian oil production platforms has been adopted as case study the model tests experiments were conducted at 1 70 scale at the ocean technology laboratory laboceano of the federal university of rio de janeiro brazil three representative operational loading conditions have been analyzed namely full intermediate and ballast the main characteristics of the fpso and the 3d perspective views of the hull at these loading conditions are shown in table 1 and fig 1 respectively for the three loading conditions the fpso was fitted with bilge keels of 1 00 m width that extended along 127 2 m on the parallel body on both sides the effect of bilge keels is widely recognized as the most important contribution to roll damping and may account up to 80 of the total damping kawahara et al 2012 fpsos are usually fitted with these devices often with much larger dimensions than ships the effect of bilge keels on roll damping has been largely explored numerical and experimentally in a number of works thiagarajan and braddock 2010 gu et al 2015 irkal et al 2016 2019 wassermann et al 2016b avalos and wanderley 2018 katayama et al 2019b for the model tests a simplified mooring system consisting of four horizontal lines each one composed of steel cable and a linear spring has been used to restrain the horizontal motions of the model the simplified mooring system mimics the horizontal stiffness of the full length spread mooring and riser systems fig 1 shows the mooring lines of the mooring system adopted in the model tests the anchor points of the mooring lines were located in the lateral walls of the basin above the water level the restoring characteristics of the mooring system in surge and sway directions have been experimentally measured through static offsets tests the static induced roll restoring moments of the mooring system in the model tests have been preliminarily computed together with the hull hydrostatic characteristics using the approach described for instance in huijs 2015 porciuncula et al 2017a 2017b the total equivalent hull mooring system static roll restoring moments for the three tested loading conditions are shown in fig 2 the slopes of the curves with mooring restoring effect at the origin provide the roll restoring coefficients for the decay motions simulations and for the linear frequency domain solutions for the responses in waves although the mooring effect in roll restoring is small it should be considered to reliably reproduce the roll resonant period for the time domain simulations in waves the mooring lines of the simplified system are explicitly numerically modelled however only restoring forces will be taken into account structural damping and drag forces induced by the mooring lines were neglected particularly because almost the whole length of the mooring lines stayed dry almost all the time even under the most severe wave condition decay tests in calm water have been performed for the three loading conditions for various initial roll angles 5 10 and 20 or 15 the initial condition for the decay tests was obtained by the application of a binary moment through an apparatus fig 3 that keeps the initial roll angle steady before releasing the ship to decay deck immersion or bottom emersion were not allowed since the roll decay angles were confined to the linear range of the restoring moment see fig 2 it can be represented by the product of a constant coefficient proportional to the respective initial metacentric height of each loading condition and the roll angle the tests in waves included regular irregular based on pierson moskowitz and jonswap theoretical spectra and transient waves clauss and bergmann 1986 clauss 1999 for several wave headings for the present work only beam waves i e 90 incidence will be analyzed table 2 displays the nominal period and heights of the specified incident waves for the tests for the jonswap waves irr js the peak enhancement factor γ has been also provided period t n denotes the roll natural period of the fpso for any given loading condition the extrapolation of model tests results to full scale condition was based on froude s similarity law although viscous related phenomena are typically the most affected by scale effects in the case of roll damping the only contribution strongly influenced by scale effects is the skin friction damping ittc 2011 according to ikeda himeno 1981 for small models the skin friction damping accounts for between 5 and 10 of the total damping but in full scale it may typically account for only 1 3 of the total roll damping therefore scale effects in roll damping can be usually neglected irkal et al 2016 jensen 2019 especially for hulls with bilge keels irkal et al 2016 further discussion on the scale effects on roll damping can be found in gu et al 2018 kianejad et al 2018 irkal et al 2019 kianejad et al 2019 3 calm water roll decay tests the roll decay motion of a ship in calm water can be expressed as a one degree of freedom equation given by 1 i 44 a 44 φ t b 44 φ φ t c 44 φ t 0 where φ t represents the instantaneous roll motion t is time i 44 is the mass inertia a 44 and c 44 denote added inertia and hydrostatic restoring coefficients respectively b 44 φ denotes the damping coefficient which can be considered dependent on roll amplitude in its canonical form eq 1 can be expressed as 2 φ p φ φ ω n 2 φ 0 where 3 ω n 2 m g g m i 44 a

roll period the damping coefficients p or p 1 and p 2 are obtained from analyses of roll decay time records several techniques are available for these analyses spouge 1988 presents a detailed description and discussion on various methods for roll decay analyses fig 4 presents experimental time series of the roll decay tests of the fpso for its three loading conditions those decay tests correspond to the largest initial roll angle condition tested for each of the fpso s loading conditions the average measured damped roll natural periods were 14 8 s 14 4 s and 14 2 s for the full intermediate and ballast conditions respectively following the estimation of roll decay damping coefficients based on the logarithmic decrement method and the froude s energy method is presented 3 1 logarithmic decrement method when a 44 and c 44 are assumed time independent then eq 1 becomes linear and the solution is given by 7 φ t φ s e p t 2 cos ω d t β where ω d ω n 2 p 2 2 φ s φ 0 cos β β

are shown in graphical form in fig 5 the markers correspond to the peaks positive and negative of the experimental time series fig 4 and are based on eq 10 while the straight lines are the respective fitting curves based on eq 6 for the logarithmic method the successive peaks can be taken as only positive peaks or only negative peaks both choices have displayed very similar results in terms of fitting curves except for the ballast condition for which the experimental damping values show a larger dispersion among the decay cycles this behavior was confirmed in the two other repetitions of this decay condition a possible explanation may be related to the higher damping observed in this condition smith 2019 has also evidenced that decay analyses of such systems can display larger dispersion of the analysis points and may result in inaccurate estimation of damping coefficients to minimize the effect of dispersion on the decay coefficients in the logarithmic decrement method the fitting was performed using both the positive and negative peaks 3 2 froude s method this approach is based on the energy lost balance in each half cycle the energy dissipated by the damping term is equal to the variation of the potential energy work done by the restoring moment when the kinetic energy at the initial and final positions are zero assuming the linear plus quadratic damping form and

versa fig 6 displays the plots corresponding to the analyses based on the froude energy method eq 16 for the roll decay series presented in fig 4 in general except for some points around 2 to 3 of mean roll angle the fitting of the parabolic function for roll decay data is quite satisfactory for the three loading conditions of the fpso even for the ballast condition which showed more dispersion than the other loading conditions when the logarithmic method was applied besides the roll natural period each decay test delivered a pair of damping coefficients linear and quadratic for the logarithmic method the y intercept and the slope of the fitting curves straight lines in fig 5 represent the damping coefficients p 1 and p 2 respectively eq 10 for the energy approach the linear coefficient of the parabolic regression function eq 16 provides p 1 while the quadratic term delivers p 2 the damping coefficients obtained from both methods and for the various initial angle conditions are summarized in tables 3 5 tables 3 5 evidence significant differences between the damping coefficients obtained from the logarithmic method and the froude s method in general for the three loading conditions the logarithmic method provided smaller values for p 1 and larger p 2 than the energy method spouge 1988 have arrived at similar conclusions from model tests and full scale roll decay tests with a fishing protection vessel more recently using a theoretical signal for the roll decay of a post panamax containership wassermann et al 2016a also reported the same findings for the linearized damping coefficient within each method significant differences are also observed associated to the initial roll angle condition and some tendencies can be identified if p 1 decreases with the increase of the initial decay angle p 2 increases as observed in the full condition conversely if p 1 increases with the increase of the initial decay angle p 2 decreases as in the intermediate and ballast conditions typically it is expected that p 2 is more relevant for the first decay cycles while p 1 for the smaller roll angles in the case of the fpso that behavior was only confirmed for the full loading condition the intermediate and ballast conditions showed an opposite tendency among the three loading conditions the ballast condition exhibits the largest coefficients p 1 and p 2 either from the logarithmic decrement of the energy method this fact is also evident in the decay time series fig 4 and the fitting curves of fig 5 this behavior may be related to the underwater hull aspect of the fpso in terms of half breadth to draught ratio which is 1 3 for the full condition 1 8 for the intermediate condition and 3 4 for the ballast condition similar findings are reported in wassermann et al 2016a when comparing the results of decay tests under ballast and full loading condition for a post panamax containership according to katayama et al 2019b the half breadth to draught ratio is relevant for the bilge keel component and deserves further investigation due to its complexity especially in shallow draught cases since the logarithmic decrement and the froude s energy method provide significant different damping coefficients their quality should be assessed based on their ability to rebuild the corresponding experimental decay time series so the numerical solution of the equation of the uncoupled roll decay motion with quadratic damping has been implemented using the damping coefficients shown in tables 3 5 the plots of the numerically rebuilt roll decay motions are shown in fig 7 for the sake of comparison the corresponding experimental time series have also been reproduced together despite the significant differences observed in the terms of damping coefficients between the two analysis methods the respective time series of the numerically reconstructed roll decays do not present such discrepancies for any of the loading conditions indeed for the full and intermediate conditions excellent agreement was obtained at large and small roll angles for the ballast condition the agreement is still satisfactory with a slightly better performance of the logarithmic method especially at large roll angles at small angles the coefficients obtained from both methods underpredicted the roll motions in summary the pair of coefficients that can reproduce the experimental decay series with the same level of accuracy is not unique thus the performance of roll damping coefficients p 1 and p 2 should be assessed in pairs and not as independent single values further discussion on the comparison of the performance of different roll decay analysis techniques can be found in spouge 1988 4 roll motions in waves the rigid body motions of ship in waves is typically described using six degrees of freedom 6 dof which can be described using the following dynamic equation 17 m s f f k f d i f f f r a d f s t f v i s f m o o r where m denotes the 6 6 structural mass matrix s x y z φ θ ψ t is the 6 1 vector of accelerations in the 6 dof i e surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw respectively the right hand side of eq 17 contains 6 1 vectors of forces and moments where f fk represents the incident wave or froude krylov excitation loads f diff are the diffraction loads f rad are the radiation forces moments f st are the hydrostatic restoring loads resulting from the combined actions of gravity and buoyancy forces moments f vis represents the viscous contributions on damping and f moor the forces induced by the mooring system the determination of the motions of a moored floating structure in response to waves may be a complex procedure and requires time domain analysis depending on how the above described forces moments are modelled especially when nonlinearities are included since the aim of the present study is to characterize the roll damping in waves for a relatively large number of tested conditions time domain analysis seem prohibitively time consuming to perform a systematic parametric study on the other hand a frequency domain solution of ship motions equations can provide a simple and fast tool to achieve that objective to perform frequency domain analysis the main requirement is to linearize the forces moments on the right hand side of eq 17 so that the equations of motion are typically expressed as 18 m a s b s c s f e x c t where a b and c are 6 6 matrices containing added mass damping and restoring coefficients respectively the damping coefficients include viscous damping contributions and the restoring coefficients incorporate the restoring effect of the mooring system f exc t represents the 6 1 vector of wave excitation froude krylov plus diffraction loads when port starboard symmetry of the ship and of the loading condition is assumed the set of anti symmetric motions sway roll and yaw become decoupled from the set of symmetric motions surge heave and pitch for the sake of simplicity for the analysis of roll motion in beam waves it is quite usual to decouple the roll equation from sway and yaw motions bulian and francescutto 2011 hou and zou 2015 2016 wassermann et al 2016a somayajula and falzarano 2017 so that the uncoupled roll equation can be described as 19 i 44 a 44 φ t b 44 φ φ t c 44 φ t m φ t where the term in the right hand side of eq 19 represents the wave excitation roll moment in the following sections 4 1 and 4 2 the analytical solution of frequency domain approach will be presented based on the uncouple 1 dof roll motion equation however in the numerical solution the full 6 dof system of the frequency domain will be solved viscous damping and mooring restoring effects will be only considered in the roll motion equation 4 1 frequency domain responses in regular waves in regular waves the roll exciting moment m φ is described by 20 m φ t f w 4 cos ω t α 4 f w4 and α4 are respectively the amplitude and phase of the wave excitation moment ω is the wave excitation frequency the solution of eq 19 can be expressed as lewis 1988 journée and massie 2001 21 φ ω f w 4 ω ω 2 i 44 a 44 ω i ω b 44 ω c 44 where φ and f w 4 are the complex amplitudes of the roll motion and the excitation moment i 1 the hydrodynamic potential coefficients and forces can be obtained using commercial software based on panel methods for instance wamit or ansys aqwa the response amplitude operator rao of the roll motion can be defined by 22 r a o φ ω φ a ω ζ a ω where ζ a ω is the amplitude of the incident wave and φ a is the amplitude of the response fig 8 presents the experimental rao values obtained from the regular wave tests of the fpso for the three loading conditions together with the numerical rao curve from the linear potential solution the experimental roll rao has been computed based on the amplitude of the first harmonic from the fourier series analyses of the time series of the measured roll motions and the incident wave elevations the potential roll rao curve has been obtained numerically neglecting viscous effects in eq 18 i e assuming that the roll damping coefficient comes only from radiation effects i e b 44 b 44r b 44r represents the roll radiation damping coefficient the vertical line in fig 8a b and 8c identifies the natural roll period of the full intermediate and ballast loading condition respectively the peak of the experimental roll rao of each loading condition is very close to the corresponding resonant period identified in the roll decay tests furthermore except for the periods close to the roll natural period the potential rao curves agreed well with the experimental values for the three loading conditions i e the viscous contributions seem to be negligible outside the resonance region the ratio of the roll radiation damping coefficient to the critical roll damping at the roll natural period for the full intermediate and ballast loading conditions are 2 2 1 4 and 0 7 respectively thus in terms of radiation damping the ballast condition is the less damped one it should be recalled that the decay tests which include viscous damping effects showed that the ballast condition was the most damped among the three loading conditions so a priori based on decay tests results viscous effects on the ballast condition are expected to be stronger than in the other loading conditions around the roll resonance period the radiation damping alone is not able to reproduce the actual responses experimental raos i e either viscous effects and or other nonlinearities should be taken into account in the numerical model indeed the linear damping coefficients obtained from decay tests tables 3 5 are significantly different from the potential damping values furthermore since the experimental raos around resonance for the same wave period and different wave heights display significant different values it can be concluded that either viscous damping or other nonlinearities are sensitive to wave height changes too since the maximum rolling amplitudes achieved during the tests in waves for all loading conditions did not exceeded 13 even for the waves of 10 5 m height see table 6 the effect of nonlinearities associated to the pure roll restoring moment is not expected to be significant see fig 2 the roll restoring moment has a strong linear behavior up to 17 of heel angle thus a priori viscous effects remain as the main cause of the differences in the rao associated to the wave height this hypothesis will be later discussed in the analyses of nonlinear time domain simulations 4 2 frequency domain responses in irregular waves the frequency domain responses in regular waves allow the application of the spectral approach to address the motions in irregular seas i e bhattacharyya 1978 faltinsen 1993 23 s φ ω r a o φ ω 2 s ζ ω where s ζ ω and s φ ω denote the power spectral densities of the incident sea wave spectrum and the roll response motion spectrum respectively the significant motion amplitude φ1 3 is given by 24 φ 1 3 2 m 0 φ where m 0φ is the zero order moment of the motion spectrum a numerical simulation of roll motion can be considered satisfactory if the significant roll amplitude and the corresponding motion spectrum of the numerical simulation and of the experimental roll are similar from eq 23 it is clear that to obtain an accurate prediction of the roll response for a given sea state its rao function should be reliable in the full range of frequencies of interest i e the roll rao curve should account for viscous damping effects the experimental spectra of incident wave and roll response have been obtained from a fast fourier transform of the corresponding measured time series then the significant amplitudes of the incident wave and of the roll response were obtained from the area under the respective spectra table 6 summarizes the dimensional absolute amplitudes of the experimental roll responses from the tests under regular and irregular waves tests table 6 evidences that the larger roll amplitudes in bold face occurred at the damped natural period measured in the roll decay tests especially for the wave heights of 3 5 and 7 0 m however for the highest wave amplitudes 10 5 m the maximum roll amplitudes in red bold face shifted slightly to periods higher than those observed in the decay tests this shift in the resonant period is typically observed in mechanical oscillators when the damping of the system is increased this behavior is further discussed in the analysis of roll damping coefficients in waves 5 the hybrid method for roll damping estimation in waves to quantify the roll damping in waves including viscous effects a hybrid method that combines experimental results from tests in waves and numerical predictions of ship motions in waves based on the frequency domain approach was adopted for a given test condition in waves the hybrid method can be summarized in the following steps 1 compute the response amplitude or response spectra from the experimental time series of the incident wave and the roll motion the amplitudes will be used to compute the rao values for the regular wave conditions the response spectra will be used for the irregular seas computations 2 in the numerical model of the roll motion equation the incident wave characteristics should be input based on the experimental values defined in step 1 3 the damping coefficient in the frequency domain numerical model for instance eq 19 includes the radiation as well as the viscous effects i e 25 b 44 b 44r b e where b 44r is the linear radiation damping coefficient computed from for instance wamit and b e represents the viscous damping contribution in waves which may be regarded as an external linearized roll damping coefficient if b 44 b 44r and b e are divided by i 44 a 44 ω n the corresponding coefficients p 44 p 44r and p e are obtained 4 the external linearized damping is iteratively varied starting for instance from b e 0 i e with only the potential damping until the numerical response matches the experimental one within a given tolerance in the 1 dof frequency domain approach the numerical response in regular waves is given by eq 21 and for irregular waves eqs 22 24 are necessary too the convergence criteria are based on the roll response amplitude for the regular wave tests and on the zero spectral moment of the roll response m 0φ for the irregular wave tests 5 the last iteration in step 4 provides the calibrated external damping coefficient this coefficient accounts for viscous effects in waves and should be added to the radiation damping to obtain the total roll damping coefficient eq 25 in waves for the given test condition fig 9 schematizes the calibration procedure of the roll responses in waves and the finding of the respective external roll damping coefficient for a given test condition in terms of mathematical model the calibrated roll damping coefficient is linear but it should be regarded as piece wise linear because although it is constant for each test condition it is allowed to change according to the incident wave characteristics i e wave height and or wave period for the irregular seas the external damping is assumed constant for a given significant wave height and the period domain of the corresponding sea spectrum once the roll damping coefficient for a given test condition is determined the time series of the test condition should be numerically reconstructed to verify the performance of the calibrated external damping coefficient this verification can be done by solving the linear model of the roll motion equation eq 18 in the time domain 5 1 time domain verifications although time domain simulations of ship motions in waves demand significant more computational effort than frequency domain solutions especially when nonlinearities are present and long duration stochastic sea conditions are considered they are usually regarded to provide more accurate motions predictions two approaches for the time domain simulations will be adopted first the linear model eq 18 will be solved to verify the quality of the calibrated linearized roll damping coefficient then a nonlinear model will be used to verify the suitability of the assumptions adopted for the frequency domain solutions and the eventual influence of nonlinearities the nonlinearities will be introduced in the roll damping by adding the quadratic damping term when roll decay damping coefficients are to be used and in the hydrostatic restoring and froude krylov loads in the six degrees of freedom the latter nonlinearities are introduced when the pressure integration is carried out over the instantaneous wetted hull due to wave passage and ship motions the time domain numerical model adopted here is based on the time response module of ansys aqwa former aqwa naut before the time domain simulations the hydrodynamic coefficients are computed in the hydrodynamic radiation diffraction module of aqwa former aqwa line which is based on linear potential flow theory and boundary element panel method for the time domain simulations ansys aqwa allows the inclusion of user defined external damping linear and quadratic terms as well as the modelling of the mooring system considering that the mooring lines were almost all the time out of water during the model tests only the restoring effects of the mooring system were taken into account in the six degrees of freedom i e structural damping and drag forces associated to the mooring lines were neglected 5 2 roll damping coefficients from regular waves fig 10 shows the external viscous roll damping coefficient obtained from the regular wave tests the curve of roll radiation damping coefficients has been also included for each loading condition the analyses of these results fig 10 should be done vis à vis fig 8 and table 6 based on that comparison two regimes of periods can be identified at each loading condition the regime or range of periods where the experimental roll rao is very close to the potential roll rao curve that only considers radiation damping viscous damping effects can be assumed negligible for the three loading conditions of the fpso that behavior is observed for the range of wave periods below 13 s fig 8 and where the roll amplitudes did not exceed 2 considering the wave height of 3 5 m table 6 in terms of external roll damping coefficients fig 10 these test conditions displayed large dispersion associated either to slightly larger or smaller experimental roll rao values relative to the potential roll rao for the periods in which the experimental rao was larger than the potential rao the calibration of the external viscous roll damping coefficient was numerically not possible assuming that only positive damping coefficients are expected so the viscous roll damping coefficient was taken as null i e roll damping is composed only of radiation damping effects conversely when the experimental rao was smaller calibration was possible but the obtained external damping coefficients were very large in practice excessively large roll damping values are not expected but based on mechanical vibrations theory rao 2019 make sense outside the resonance region the responses of a mechanical oscillator system to harmonic excitation like the ship in waves are almost insensitive to damping i e large damping values are required to induce small changes in motion amplitudes indeed journée and massie 2001 shows that for the periods below the resonance region motions are dominated by spring terms restoring terms while for the periods above the resonance region motions are dominated by inertia terms thus outside the resonance region the calibration of responses should be focused on the restoring or inertia terms however it should be recalled that roll motions in these range of periods are usually very small and in general are not of practical interest around the roll resonance the experimental roll raos are significantly far from the potential roll rao and large roll motions take place in this regime above 13 s viscous damping effects are very strong although the viscous roll damping coefficients are not excessively large they are much greater than the potential damping coefficients and exhibit a significant increase as wave height increases for instance at roll resonance the external damping coefficient for the largest wave height 10 5 m almost doubles the corresponding value for the smallest wave height 3 5 m for any of the tested loading conditions to better assess this behavior the total linearized roll damping coefficients have been calculated for all the test conditions close to the roll resonance period for each loading condition and plotted against the mean roll response amplitude fig 11 a linear regression line like that of the logarithmic decrement method have also been plotted together with the corresponding experimental roll decay tests the comparison of the regression line of the tests under regular waves with that of the decay tests in clam water evidence that the damping coefficients in regular waves are quite different from those of decay tests for the full and intermediate loading conditions for the ballast condition the results from wave tests and decay tests seem to be in better agreement in general the linearized roll damping coefficients in waves are larger than those obtained from decay tests at least for the range of experimentally measured roll responses moreover the larger the roll response i e the larger the height of the incident wave the larger the roll damping coefficient this behavior agrees with the shift in the roll resonant period observed in table 6 these findings are also in agreement with those preliminary discussed in van t veer and fathi 2011 and recently reported in kianejad et al 2020 more tests in waves with lower regular wave amplitudes would be necessary to obtain a more complete description of the roll damping coefficient in waves so that more accurate fitting lines can be traced furthermore it would be possible to extract coefficients p 1 and p 2 from regular waves tests for each loading condition to assess how the difference in the roll damping coefficients from decay tests and wave tests affect the roll response in waves time domain numerical simulations have been performed as described in section 5 1 the time domain numerical model was firstly configured to reproduce the tests in waves for the roll resonance period using the damping coefficients linear plus quadratic model from calm water roll decay tests tables 3 5 other nonlinearities were not allowed then a second round of numerical simulations was performed allowing only the inclusion of the roll damping coefficient calibrated from each teste condition in waves finally to verify the effect of nonlinearities in hydrostatics and froude krylov actions on the roll responses a third group of simulations was performed considering those nonlinearities figs 12 14 shows the numerical simulations of the roll motions for wave reg12 i e at the roll resonant period with a nominal wave height of 10 5 m for the full intermediate and ballast loading conditions of the fpso respectively together with the numerically simulated roll motions based on roll decay damping coefficients decay and those based on the calibrated roll damping from wave tests calib the respective experimental roll time series are also shown both the linear lin and nonlinear nonlin numerical simulations have been plotted figs 12 14 agree with the tendencies observed in fig 11 since roll damping coefficients from decay tests in calm water are smaller than those from tests in waves the corresponding numerical simulations are overpredicted relative to experimental roll amplitudes by about 40 15 and 70 for the full intermediate and ballast condition respectively the numerical simulations based on the linear model with the calibrated damping coefficient from the wave tests are in good agreement with the experimental responses despite some differences associated to the slightly changing roll amplitudes observed in the experiments the simulations based on the hydrostatic and froude krylov nonlinear model with calibrated linearized damping showed almost no differences in relation to the linear model the same behavior is observed for the simulations based on the roll damping coefficients from roll decay tests therefore the nonlinear effects associated to hydrostatic restoring and froude krylov loads can be considered negligible at the resonant period for the three loading conditions these results indicate that at least for the type of fpso hull under the environmental conditions analyzed here the linear numerical model in frequency and time domain with an adequate roll damping coefficient has shown to be more accurate than nonlinear models with a deficient estimation of the roll damping coefficient roll damping coefficients from decay tests seem to be not reliable for the tested conditions in waves table 5 summarizes the total radiation plus viscous roll damping coefficients in waves at the resonant roll period for the three loadings conditions of the fpso although a direct comparison of the roll damping coefficients in table 7 with those of tables 3 5 cannot be performed table 7 allows to evidence quantitatively the significant increase in the roll damping coefficients as the wave increases within each loading condition 5 3 roll damping coefficients from irregular waves the procedure outlined in the beginning of section 5 was applied to the irregular sea conditions described in table 2 fig 15 illustrates the power spectral densities psd of the experimental incident wave sw exp the experimental response sr exp and the numerical calibrated response spectra sr num corresponding to the wave irr js1 100 year extreme sea condition for campos basin brazil irr js2 1 year sea condition for campos basin brazil irr pm and trans for the full loading condition figs 16 and 17 present similar results for the intermediate and ballast conditions for the same corresponding sea states the calibration of the responses based on the frequency domain numerical model under irregular wave conditions was considered in general quite satisfactory showing very good matches between the numerical calibrated and the experimental spectra for most of the tested conditions indeed for wave irr js1 which is an extreme wave condition 7 8 m of significant wave height with peak period near the roll resonant periods of the fpso the comparison between the experimental response spectra and their corresponding numerical calibrated spectra were in excellent agreement for the three loading conditions some differences were observed in the roll response spectra for wave irr js2 whose peak period is relatively far from the fpso s roll natural periods but only for the period components around the resonant roll periods notice that the significant roll amplitudes for the three loading conditions under that sea state did not exceed 1 for the irr pm sea state whose peak period is also relatively near the fpso s roll resonant periods but with lower significant wave height 5 9 m than irr js1 the calibration of the viscous damping coefficients also returned quite successful results as evidenced by the experimental and numerical response spectra the transient wave trans which may be interpreted as a white noise wave spectrum was the tested wave with lowest significant height 2 2 m except for the full loading condition the experimental roll responses under the transient wave for the two other loading conditions were successfully calibrated with the numerical model the significant amplitudes of roll responses under the transient wave did not exceed 2 a summary of the total radiation plus viscous roll damping coefficients in irregular waves at the tested sea states for the three loading conditions are shown in table 8 for each test condition a single calibrated external damping coefficient was obtained significant differences were found among the roll damping coefficients at different sea states of the same loading condition so as observed for regular waves roll damping coefficients in irregular waves are also strongly affected by the incident wave characteristics in fact if the results from trans wave are obviated it can be easily concluded that the roll damping coefficients increases as the significant wave height increases for the three loading conditions for transient wave also regarded as broad band or white noise wave spectrum which is compounded of mild waves unexpected large roll damping values have been obtained greater than those for the extreme sea state irr js1 since the transient wave does not represent a realistic ocean wave and the roll responses for this wave are quite small below 2 of significant amplitude the roll damping coefficients from this type of wave may be limited in application and should be restricted to cases in which very small roll responses are expected the results from irregular waves can be further analyzed in terms of roll rao curves the rao curves can be easily obtained from the frequency domain numerical model once the calibrated roll damping coefficient is available from irregular wave tests figs 18 20 show the resultant rao curves obtained from each of the sea states tested at the full intermediate and ballast loading condition respectively the total roll damping ratio i e the actual roll damping expressed as percentage of the critical roll damping coefficient b c for the roll resonant period is displayed in the legend of the respective figures those roll rao curves evidence the range of wave periods in which the effect of the incident wave characteristics thus roll damping coefficients is stronger for the three loading conditions of the fpso this range of periods can be assumed between 12 s and 18 s moreover as already shown in the calibration of the response spectra under wave irr js2 around the roll resonant period the corresponding calibrated damping coefficient overestimated the responses i e underestimated the roll damping coefficient especially for full and ballast condition thus those roll rao curves based on irr js2 for the full and ballast condition should be disregarded at least between 12 s and 18 s it should be recalled that the calibration of the roll damping coefficients was done based on the frequency domain linear spectral model to verify the performance of those damping coefficients in time domain models numerical simulations have been performed using the numerical models described in section 5 1 the numerical models allow the simulation of four types of time domain numerical roll responses a first type calib lin was obtained using the linear model with the calibrated roll damping coefficient from the irregular wave tests the second type decay lin was obtained with the linear model similar but with the roll damping coefficients linear plus quadratic from decay tests the third and fourth types of the numerical responses calib nonlin and decay nonlin respectively were obtained using the nonlinear model in which nonlinearities in the hydrostatic restoring and froude krylov actions are considered the third type uses the calibrated roll damping coefficient from the tests in waves and the fourth type adopted the roll decay linear plus quadratic damping coefficients as an example fig 21 shows the four types of numerical roll simulations for the test condition under the wave irr js1 at the full loading condition together with the corresponding experimental response in all the numerical simulations 5 of the respective critical damping has been introduced as additional external damping to account for viscous contribution in the sway and yaw linear damping coefficients the effect of the viscous contributions in sway and yaw on roll simulations is later discussed although the differences among the time series are not so apparent in general the numerical roll simulations based on the roll damping coefficients from decay tests both with the linear and the nonlinear model decay lin and decay nonlin respectively overpredicted the experiments while the simulations based on the linear and nonlinear models with the calibrated roll damping coefficient calib lin and calib nonlin show a better agreement with the experimental responses for a better assessment on the quality of the roll damping coefficients for roll simulations under irregular wave conditions the power spectral densities of each numerical time series have been computed fig 22 shows the corresponding spectra of the time series shown in fig 21 the spectra of the numerical responses fig 22 further evidence that the simulations based on roll decay damping coefficients significantly overpredict the experimental roll responses on the other hand the spectra of the numerical simulations based on the calibrated roll damping coefficient show satisfactory agreement with the experimental spectra the simulations with the linear model seem better to quantify how close the numerical predictions are to the experimental response the significant amplitudes and mean periods of the roll responses have been computed from the response spectra table 9 displays these spectral parameters and more clearly show that the linear model based on the calibrated roll damping coefficient provided the best result relative to the experimental values furthermore it is evident that the effect of nonlinearities in the restoring and froude krylov loads on the significant response amplitudes can be considered negligible however those nonlinearities caused a slight decrease in the response mean periods which may be explained by a hardening effect in the restoring characteristics of the fpso i e the ship in waves becomes stiffer this latter effect is similar to the reported in ships subjected to parametric rolling in severe head seas neves and rodríguez 2007 and may deserve further investigation in future works in the time domain simulations of the tests in irregular waves other aspects have shown to be critical for the accuracy of the roll motions predictions such as the modelling of mooring lines and the introduction of external viscous damping in the sway and yaw motions if mooring lines are not considered in the numerical simulations yaw motions start to drift excessively after some time of the simulation inducing significant changes in the ship heading relative to the incident waves consequently significant wave excitation appears in all the six degrees of freedom of the ship if sway and yaw motions are rigidly constrained roll simulations substantially overpredict the motions if mooring lines are modelled and only potential radiation damping is considered in the degrees of freedom other than roll roll motions are underpredicted while sway and yaw motions are largely overpredicted a possible explanation to this behavior can be related to the energy transfer among the ship modes part of the energy that was supposed to be dissipated through roll is dissipated by sway and yaw to improve the accuracy of the roll predictions it was necessary to heuristically introduce viscous damping in the sway b 22v and yaw b 66v linear damping coefficients the amount of viscous damping was 5 of the respective critical damping coefficients these values brought the sway and yaw motions quite close to the respective experimental values and consequently improved the numerical time domain roll predictions see fig 22 fig 23 compares the spectra of the different simulated roll responses for the test condition analyzed in fig 22 in all of them the linear model with the calibrated roll damping coefficient has been used further investigation covering the above aspects and others such as the effect of slow drift forces should be performed as a next step however the implementation of those features in the time domain model would substantially increase the computational cost comparing the performance and the computational effort of the linear frequency domain spectral and the time domain approaches for the simulations of roll motions in irregular waves it was confirmed that the former approach is the best method in terms of cost benefit 5 4 regular vs irregular waves results to compare the roll damping coefficients from the irregular wave tests with those from regular waves at the roll resonance period the numerical rao curves associated to the calibrated roll damping coefficients have been used figs 24 26 present the numerical rao curves corresponding to the test conditions close to the roll resonant period of the full intermediate and ballast conditions respectively figs 24 26 evidence that the damping coefficients calibrated from the irregular waves analyses are in general in good agreement with the values predicted from regular waves the less damped conditions in irregular waves are associated to wave irr pm while in regular waves to wave reg16 period of 15 1 s and height of 3 5 m for the three loading conditions it should be noticed however that the less damped conditions in regular waves were in general close to those corresponding to wave reg10 i e the roll resonant waves of height 3 5 m the lower limits for the damping ratios were 6 7 7 3 and 9 2 for irr pm and 8 7 6 6 and 7 7 for reg10 corresponding to the full intermediate and ballast loading conditions respectively these results confirm that both under regular and irregular waves the lower wave heights displayed the lower roll damping coefficients on the other hand the highest damped conditions in irregular waves were associated to wave irr js1 the 100 year irregular wave while in regular waves to reg12 i e the roll resonant waves of height of 10 5 m coincidently the damping ratios for irr js1 were around 10 while for reg12 were around 13 for the three loading conditions since the significant wave height for irr js1 7 8 m is lower than the wave height for reg12 10 5 m the roll damping coefficients found for those wave conditions further reflect that the highest the wave height the highest the roll damping coefficient see also tables 7 and 8 6 conclusions the roll damping of a fpso unit has been analyzed based on experimental results from decay tests in calm water and seakeeping tests in regular and irregular seas the logarithmic decrement and the froude s energy methods using the linear plus quadratic model has been applied for the decay tests the results from both methods showed significant differences in the values of the damping coefficients however the time domain simulations of the decay tests based on those damping coefficients reproduced the experimental series satisfactorily independently of adopted method it is concluded that there is not a unique pair of roll damping coefficients p 1 and p 2 that can provide satisfactory results i e the performance of roll damping coefficients p 1 and p 2 should be assessed in pairs and not as independent single values for the seakeeping tests a hybrid numerical plus experimental iterative approach has been adopted to estimate the roll damping coefficients the hybrid approach iteratively simulates the roll response in waves of a given experimental condition using a linearized external viscous damping coefficient as parameter once the experimental and the numerically simulated roll response match a calibrated roll damping coefficient is obtained based on the calibrated roll damping coefficients frequency domain roll rao curves have been computed for each regular and irregular test condition the results of an extensive model test campaign of a ship shaped fpso have been used to investigate the roll damping coefficients in waves the hybrid approach based on frequency domain model with linearized roll damping has been successfully applied for mild as well as for extreme wave conditions the calibrated roll damping coefficients from the regular and irregular waves have evidenced that there is a strong effect of the incidence wave condition or the induced roll response on the value of the coefficient in fact around the roll resonance region the larger damping coefficients around 13 have been obtained for the more energetic sea conditions i e higher wave heights while the smaller roll damping coefficients around 8 were obtained for the milder waves this tendency is opposite to the observed in the decay test data a time domain numerical tool to reproduce the roll responses in waves has been also used to validate the frequency domain model of the hybrid approach linear and nonlinear hydrostatic and froude krylov models that used the roll damping coefficients from either decay tests or wave calibrated responses have been implemented the comparison of those numerical simulations with the experimental responses have evidenced that the roll behavior of the fpso in regular waves was basically linear for the three loading conditions for a given wave condition for the irregular wave conditions the frequency domain linear method based on the spectral approach was capable of reproducing the experimental roll response spectra even for the most energetic seas the time domain either linear or nonlinear model also displayed satisfactory results however a careful calibration of the mooring system and viscous effects associated to the horizontal modes were necessary therefore much more computational effort is required if compared to the frequency domain spectral approach moreover it was evidenced that at least for the investigated conditions of the fpso the calibrated linearized damping allowed the reliable reproduction of the roll dynamics of the vessel in waves the use of roll decay damping coefficients in the simulation of the motions of the fpso in waves overpredicted the roll responses and may unnecessarily penalize the design of the floating unit finally it can be concluded that for a realistic assessment of the roll behavior of the fpso in waves the correct modelling of the damping coefficient even using the linearized form is more important than the modelling of nonlinearities including the quadratic roll damping term credit authorship contribution statement claudio a rodríguez

21641,based on the bionics study of trailing edge serrations of certain birds a vortex induced vibration viv suppression device for marine risers was developed with double bird wing shaped streamers a water flow simulation experiment was performed on a bare cylinder model as well as cylinder models with different trailing edge profiles and varying streamer lengths and the model wake flow field was measured using particle image velocimetry by comparing the corresponding wake streamline diagrams and vorticity the following points were determined the double streamer structure can reduce the velocity of the flow field on both sides of the cylinder in the water flow and the vortex behind the cylinder the trailing edge profiles of the streamers can affect the viv when using trailing edge serrated streamers the effect of making the vortex generation lag is more obvious when the streamer length is approximately four times the cylinder diameter the vortex suppression effect is improved therefore the bird wing shaped viv suppression device for risers can operate effectively keywords marine riser vortex induced vibration suppression trailing edge serrations piv 1 introduction with the continuous exploration and production of deep water oil and gas improved adaptability of underwater drilling equipment to deep water working conditions is required the marine riser which constitutes essential equipment in deep water drilling has become one of the most vulnerable and weakest marine drilling components the vortex induced vibration viv caused by currents is a key factor leading to the fatigue failure of cylindrical structures such as marine risers brekke 2001 numerous experts and scholars have studied and designed various methods and devices for suppressing the viv of submerged cylindrical structures such as risers and carried out relevant indoor and field experiments computer simulations and mathematical model analysis at present the passive control method is primarily used internationally for changing the flow field of underwater working cylinders such as risers zdravkovich 1981 made a detailed summary of relevant aspects earlier the viv of underwater working cylinders has been suppressed by adding certain structures such as fairings taggart and tognarelli 2008 helical strakes armstrong 2004 splitter plates assi et al 2014 control rods korkischko and meneghini 2012 directly changing the cylinder appearance such as wave wall cylinder and spherical projection assi and bearman 2018 or applying viscoelastic materials de lima et al 2018 according to the structure of our design and research and combining with some studies of similar structures we mainly conduct a brief analysis from the following four aspects which is worth considering and using for reference 1 among the available studies the research and application of helical strakes and fairings are more abundant helical strakes will lead to higher resistance and adversely affect the riser strength although they are highly effective for inhibiting viv schaudt et al 2008 sha et al 2013 several scholars have carried out substantial research design and improvements on fairings splitter plates and other devices such as changing the shape of the fairings or adjusting the length or materials of the splitter plates 2 various scholars have studied the fixed double spoiler structure schaudt et al 2008 described a new viv suppression device namely the aims dual fin flow splitter adfs and compared it with traditional suppression systems by means of a wind tunnel experiment the adfs was found to exhibit very strong viv suppression qualities which were lower than both the strakes and 2d aspect ratio fairings however the structure of this device is relatively complex through experiments assi and bearman 2009 found that double fixed parallel plate structures rotating around the cylinder could effectively suppress the viv of the cylinder model in the water flow 3 certain other scholars have studied the flexible spoiler structure streamer structure and the effect of the structure length on the viv suppression kwon et al 2002 designed a drag reduction device that uses three ribbons attached 120 apart to vertical pipes and by means of circulating water channel experiments demonstrated that the attached ribbons can be used to reduce the drag force on vertical pipes for various incoming flow directions liang and wang 2017 proposed a viv suppression device that simulates the fishtail structure and conducted a wind tunnel experiment to explore the relationship between the flexible fishtail length and suppression efficiency xu et al 2017 studied the control of the viv of a circular cylinder with flexible splitter plates using wind tunnel experiments it was found that after installing the flexible splitter plates the resonance zone range was more backward and larger the influence of the flexible splitter plates of different lengths also varied in terms of the cylinder vibration 4 other scholars have studied the effect of perforated shroud on the flow around a circular cylinder allen and henning 2004 designed a partial shroud with perforations and verified its effectiveness in suppressing the viv of the riser in the water flow wei et al 2017 studied the effect of porous media on the flow of a circular cylinder by means of wind tunnel experiments analysis of particle image velocimetry piv technology demonstrated that the porous media can effectively reduce the vortex shedding frequency reduce the velocity in wake zone weaken the shear layer instability and increase the vortex formation length the above experiments verify the effectiveness of the double spoiler structure flexible spoiler structure and perforated shroud in the viv suppression of underwater cylindrical structures some of them are more complicated in structure or do not give a more detailed design moreover the existing viv suppression in practical application can not meet the engineering needs well therefore in order to get a more effective viv suppression device it is necessary to combine the above research and the advantages of structural design to do further research based on the previous studies this work refers to the bionic study of the aerodynamic characteristics and spoiler flow field of the trailing edge serrations of certain owl wings and designs a new device for marine risers to achieve better viv suppression effect including double bird wing shaped streamers double spoilers and porous covers water flow simulation experimental equipment was set up to test the model of the viv suppression device by applying piv measurement technology 2 design of bird wing shaped suppression device for viv of risers 2 1 design basis long eared and other nocturnal owls have a silent flight capability the trailing edges of their wings become serrated when gliding as illustrated in fig 1 which can affect the aerodynamic characteristics and spoiler flow field thus the flight noise will have a very low combined effect on small feather clusters liao 2013 several scholars have demonstrated by means of experiments and numerical studies that the presence of trailing edge serrations fundamentally affects the development of the trailing edge air foil and reduces the wake noise serrations change the wake structure and the wake vortex shedding frequency thereby reducing the vortex intensity oerlemans et al 2009 yang et al 2017 related research has been applied to engine fan blades and other noise reduction technologies for air foil the stress of the cylinder in different directions varies substantially owing to the distribution of varying pressure around the flow field resulting in viv of the cylinder the vortex development and discharge can affect the flow field pressure distribution chen et al 2017 therefore the viv of the cylinder in the flow can be effectively suppressed by suppressing the formation and development of vortices 2 2 detailed structure for the characteristics of the viv of underwater working cylinders such as risers relevant viv suppression devices can be designed and studied forming the basis of the fluid dynamics characteristics of the trailing edge serrations combining the existing research on viv suppression devices with a double spoiler structure schaudt et al 2008 assi and bearman 2009 the streamer structure kwon et al 2002 liang and wang 2017 xu et al 2017 perforated shroud allen and henning 2004 a viv suppression device with double bird wing shaped streamers was designed li et al 2019 as illustrated in fig 2 this new viv suppression device is mainly composed of a bushing square escutcheon two spoilers and two bird wing shaped streamers two identical semi circular bushings are fastened to one riser with buoyancy blocks by a bolt connection two identical square escutcheons are connected using two fixed length metal rods mandrels out of the bushing one end of the spoiler connects to the two square escutcheons by means of the metal rod mentioned above while the other end connects to the bird wing shaped streamer the bushings are made of light alloy others are made of synthetic plastic or rubber in particular the streamer is made of a flexible material such as rubber but cannot be too flexible so that it can deform under the impact of water flow without curling the bird wing shape in this streamer is trailing edge serrated shape and the single serration s outline is nearly circular arc like fig 1 the length and width of the streamer and the serration on it and the type of the outline of serration are important characteristic parameters that needs to be studied which can influence the working performance according to some previous studies the square escutcheons and spoilers are free to rotate relative to the bushing and can be rotated 180 around the metal rod as illustrated in fig 3 when the current flows at an angle with the spoiler the current will generate an impact on the spoiler causing the spoiler and wing shaped streamer to drive the square escutcheon until the spoiler and bird wing shaped streamer arrive downstream in the current direction reaching a steady state balance at this time the streamer will slightly deform to different degrees depending on the size of the incoming flow when sea current flows through a riser equipped with this device the square escutcheon can disperse the flow owing to the spoiler separation effect the vortex behind the riser cannot be fully developed and the destruction effect of the continuously floating bird wing shaped streamer can suppress the vortex formation and development in summary under the joint effect of the rotatable square escutcheon rotatable spoilers and bird wing shaped streamers the vortex behind the riser cannot be fully developed thereby achieving viv suppression the device can be installed and arranged on the riser string as required 3 experimental scheme device and parameters 3 1 experimental principle and scheme the flow around a cylinder is a classic problem when the fluid flows through the cylinder its flow field of one cross section is as fig 4 the location of the separation point and the distribution of other regions are related to the reynolds number zdravkovich 1997 due to the speed difference between the shear and accelerated flow regions and the wake region the vortices on both sides of the cylinder alternately generate and shed periodically resulting in different and alternating pressures field around the two sides thereby causing the cylinder to vibrate the vortex patterns and flow regime will change with the reynolds number when the reynolds number is small no vortex is generated the vorticity is a physical quantity that characterises the rotational motion of a fluid micelle which is generally used to measure the vortex size and direction therefore it is possible to evaluate the influence of the cylinder on the fluid in the study of viv by measuring and comparing the velocity in the shear and acceleration flow regions and wake regions and near wall vorticity of the fluid at one moment further the effects of different viv suppression structures can be evaluated in this way in order to verify the effectiveness of double flexible streamer structure in the above design scheme and study the viv suppression characteristics of the double bird wing shaped streamer structure a water flow simulation experiment was designed piv technology was used to measure the flow field on both sides and rear of the measuring model and obtained the velocity field and fluid streamlines the streamline diagram can intuitively see the generation of vortices at a certain moment even judge the flow regime therefore by comparing the flow field stability the velocity field and the vortex size in the model wake the influence of different structures on the vortex generation and development can be evaluated the experiment mainly verified the effectiveness of the double bird wing shaped streamers and preliminarily explored the effects of the trailing edge shape particularly the shape of the serrated edge like a bird s wing and the streamer length on the vortex 3 2 experimental device and parameters the experimental device is illustrated in fig 5 a and its structures schematic is fig 5 b the water circulation was driven by the variable frequency water pump in this device while the stability of the water flow was controlled by steady flow plates and a laminar flow tower according to relevant working condition data the current velocity was taken as 0 8 m s sheng et al 2016 the riser diameter with this device is approximately 0 6 m and the experimental model diameter was 0 01 m according to the froude similarity criterion the simulated experimental water flow rate was taken as 0 1 m s the cylinder model with double bird wing shaped streamers used in the experiment is illustrated in fig 6 a and the length of the spoilers on it is half the diameter of the cylinder the size of the spoilers is not the main content of this experiment and it is mainly set for experimental effect combining with the main purpose of the experiment described in section 3 1 the spoilers and the cylindrical model were made as a whole and some unnecessary details were omitted because of the main function of spoilers and rotatable square escutcheon described in section 2 2 several cylinder models with streamers are connected by a larger rigid core to form a smooth cylindrical surface as shown in fig 5 b the length of the whole cylindrical model is greater than the depth of the fluid and the target model which will be projected with laser is located a short distance below the liquid level so that the measurement is less disturbed by the equipment the material of the streamer is pvc and the thickness is 0 23 mm which is adapt to the experimental environment as described in section 2 2 through referencing to certain related research gu 2012 xu et al 2017 the width and length of the streamers are based on the designed structure and model size in fig 6 b on the streamer models the serration s outline types contain perfect circle and right angled isosceles triangle considering the experimental comparison effect the types set to straight single or triple arc or angle compared fig 1 triple angle is closest to bird wing shaped obviously table 1 shows the length parameters where l1 to l5 are the lengths of the different streamers and d is the cylinder model diameter 4 experimental results and discussion 4 1 analysis of influence of streamer trailing edge shape firstly a water flow simulation experiment and piv measurements were carried out on the naked cylinder and the cylinder model with two different trailing edge shape streamers with a length of twice the model diameter and the wake streamline is illustrated in fig 7 moreover fig 8 and fig 9 displays the corresponding velocity and vorticity diagrams in sequence obtained by analysing the original data using tecplot fig 9 presents the trends chart of the vorticity along the x axis within 26 mm around the centreline of the cylindrical section along the flow and 85 mm behind the centreline which is perpendicular to the flow direction based on considering the vorticity distribution range several unusable data caused by the experimental equipment and measurement errors were eliminated the grey circle in the different locations represents the cylindrical section of the model owing to changing the model the wake section area of each capture is different it can be found from figs 8 10 that the vortex shedding mode approximates the 2p mode gabbai and benaroya 2005 because of the obviously stronger vortex on one side the separation point in a is on the back of the cylinder but the others are not in addition the positions of the areas with the highest velocity in the six pictures are different by comparing a with the five other images in fig 7 it is found that following installation of the double streamer structure the vortex generation behind the cylinder model is effectively suppressed large vortex appears approximately in the wake region in picture a and some turbulence eddies in the wake region of the others in fig 7 are small the size of the velocity on one side shear and accelerated flow region in fig 8 a is bigger than that of the others in fig 8 at the same time the sizes of the velocity in wake regions are all very small comparing the corresponding vorticity diagrams in fig 9 it can be observed that the ability to adhere to the walls of the vorticity is changed following installation of the double streamer structure and the near wall vorticity of the cylinder model is reduced the vortices are mainly concentrated on the outside of the two streamers and almost no near wall exists behind the cylinder in the final five vorticity maps in fig 9 compared to the four other diagrams the wake region with an obvious vorticity contrast is shorter in b as illustrated in fig 10 in the trend line of the bare cylinder the vorticity value near the cylinder is larger which is obviously different from the other five trend lines behind 55 mm the vorticity in b is generally the smallest apart from a overall the vorticity in the experiment of the single angle shaped streamers is generally smaller than that of the others in fig 10 therefore it can be concluded that the double streamer structure can effectively suppress the vortex generation and development behind the cylinder through its influence on the flow field distribution as described fig 4 and it is predicted that it can effectively suppress the viv of the cylinder in the water flow the trailing edge serrations can affect the flow field around the cylinder and delay the generation of vortices under this experimental condition the influence of the arc or angle of the serrations is not obvious and the single angle type has an improved suppression effect on the vortex 4 2 analysis of influence of streamer length in order to study the effect of the streamer length on the viv suppression effect of the double bird wing streamer structure cylinder models with triple arc bird wing shaped streamers with different lengths l1 to l5 were measured the wake streamline diagrams are presented in fig 11 and the corresponding velocity and vorticity diagrams are provided in fig 12 and fig 13 in sequence obtained after data processing the measurement result of l2 is illustrated in the picture f of figs 7 9 similarly the trends chart of the vorticity along the x axis is presented in fig 14 comparing the five streamline diagrams it is found that the eddies in turbulence near the wall of the cylinder model in fig 11 c are the smallest the size of the velocity on one side shear and accelerated flow region in fig 12 a length label l1 is obviously the largest followed by fig 12 d length label l5 but in length label l2 l3 l4 there is little difference about it both are small and the sizes of the velocity in wake regions are all very small in figs 8 and 12 in the five corresponding vorticity diagrams the vorticity around the cylinder model is smaller in fig 13 c moreover in fig 14 the vorticity value when the length is l4 is smaller overall and the change is reduced thus when the length of the bird wing shaped streamer is approximately four times the cylinder diameter the vortex suppression effect is improved 4 3 further discussion on the working effect of this viv suppression device based on the analysis of the previous experimental results and the study of relevant literature in section 1 and section 2 the working principle of the bird wing shaped suppression device can be further summarized as shown in fig 15 according to the viv principle as described in section 3 1 the basic method to suppress viv is to reduce the pressure gradient of flow field around the cylinder so it is an effective method to reduce accelerated flow region velocity and wake region vortex as shown in fig 4 the structure of double flexible streamers and double spoilers can reduce the velocity in accelerated flow region but the cause of this phenomenon remains to be studied and this structure can isolate high and low velocity regions and reduce the generation of big vortex in the flow field and due to the limitation of the rotation angle of the spoilers the separation point will not fall on the rear wall of the cylinder and it caused a lag in vortex generation perhaps the limited deformation of the flexible streamer also played a role in dissipating the energy that caused the flow field to become unstable the square escutcheon increases the surface roughness can effectively trigger the transition of the boundary layer zdravkovich 1997 thereby effectively inhibiting the generation of large eddies trailing edge serration bird wing shaped increases the vortex formation length and breaks up the vortex both of these structures located in the upstream and downstream respectively generate small scale turbulence with small eddies through small scale structures avoid the generation and shedding of large eddies near the cylinder in general these four structures wrap the cylinder in the water flow reducing the generation and shedding of surrounding vortices but the streamers cannot be too long otherwise they will come together and affect the work effect which can be predicted and the length of the separation plate should ensure that the streamer cannot be attached to the cylinder when working of course this also needs further research 5 conclusions 1 the implementation of the double streamer structure can effectively reduce the velocity of the flow field on both sides of the cylinder in the water flow and reduce the vortex behind the cylinder 2 the shape of the streamer trailing edge can affect the flow field around the cylinder and the trailing edge serration streamer can delay vortex generation 3 when the streamer length is approximately four times the cylinder diameter the vortex suppression effect is improved the specific dimensions and material of the streamer also require further precise laboratory simulation experiments field engineering tests and others further research in summary the bird wing shaped suppression device for the viv of risers can operate very effectively the bird wing shaped structure and double flexible streamer structure can be used not only in marine drilling risers but also in marine production risers marine pipelines and other slender underwater flexible devices which are susceptible to viv in work the influence of the two structures on the viv suppression can be studied in further detail and the design of the relevant suppression device can be optimised credit authorship contribution statement zifeng li conceptualization supervision guangming song writing review editing yanling chen data

streamer structure kwon et al 2002 liang and wang 2017 xu et al 2017 perforated shroud allen and henning 2004 a viv suppression device with double bird wing shaped streamers was designed li et al 2019 as illustrated in fig 2 this new viv suppression device is mainly composed of a bushing square escutcheon two spoilers and two bird wing shaped streamers two identical semi circular bushings are fastened to one riser with buoyancy blocks by a bolt connection two identical square escutcheons are connected using two fixed length metal rods mandrels out of the bushing one end of the spoiler connects to the two square escutcheons by means of the metal rod mentioned above while the other end connects to the bird wing shaped streamer the bushings are made of light alloy others are made of synthetic plastic or rubber in particular the streamer is made of a flexible material such as rubber but cannot be too flexible so that it can deform under the impact of water flow without curling the bird wing shape in this streamer is trailing edge serrated shape and the single serration s outline is nearly circular arc like fig 1 the length and width of the streamer and the serration on it and the type of the outline of serration are important characteristic parameters that needs to be studied which can influence the working performance according to some previous studies the square escutcheons and spoilers are free to rotate relative to the bushing and can be rotated 180 around the metal rod as illustrated in fig 3 when the current flows at an angle with the spoiler the current will generate an impact on the spoiler causing the spoiler and wing shaped streamer to drive the square escutcheon until the spoiler and bird wing shaped streamer arrive downstream in the current direction reaching a steady state balance at this time the streamer will slightly deform to different degrees depending on the size of the incoming flow when sea current flows through a riser equipped with this device the square escutcheon can disperse the flow owing to the spoiler separation effect the vortex behind the riser cannot be fully developed and the destruction effect of the continuously floating bird wing shaped streamer can suppress the vortex formation and development in summary under the joint effect of the rotatable square escutcheon rotatable spoilers and bird wing shaped streamers the vortex behind the riser cannot be fully developed thereby achieving viv suppression the device can be installed and arranged on the riser string as required 3 experimental scheme device and parameters 3 1 experimental principle and scheme the flow around a cylinder is a classic problem when the fluid flows through the cylinder its flow field of one cross section is as fig 4 the location of the separation point and the distribution of other regions are related to the reynolds number zdravkovich 1997 due to the speed difference between the shear and accelerated flow regions and the wake region the vortices on both sides of the cylinder alternately generate and shed periodically resulting in different and alternating pressures field around the two sides thereby causing the cylinder to vibrate the vortex patterns and flow regime will change with the reynolds number when the reynolds number is small no vortex is generated the vorticity is a physical quantity that characterises the rotational motion of a fluid micelle which is generally used to measure the vortex size and direction therefore it is possible to evaluate the influence of the cylinder on the fluid in the study of viv by measuring and comparing the velocity in the shear and acceleration flow regions and wake regions and near wall vorticity of the fluid at one moment further the effects of different viv suppression structures can be evaluated in this way in order to verify the effectiveness of double flexible streamer structure in the above design scheme and study the viv suppression characteristics of the double bird wing shaped streamer structure a water flow simulation experiment was designed piv technology was used to measure the flow field on both sides and rear of the measuring model and obtained the velocity field and fluid streamlines the streamline diagram can intuitively see the generation of vortices at a certain moment even judge the flow regime therefore by comparing the flow field stability the velocity field and the vortex size in the model wake the influence of different structures on the vortex generation and development can be evaluated the experiment mainly verified the effectiveness of the double bird wing shaped streamers and preliminarily explored the effects of the trailing edge shape particularly the shape of the serrated edge like a bird s wing and the streamer length on the vortex 3 2 experimental device and parameters the experimental device is illustrated in fig 5 a and its structures schematic is fig 5 b the water circulation was driven by the variable frequency water pump in this device while the stability of the water flow was controlled by steady flow plates and a laminar flow tower according to relevant working condition data the current velocity was taken as 0 8 m s sheng et al 2016 the riser diameter with this device is approximately 0 6 m and the experimental model diameter was 0 01 m according to the froude similarity criterion the simulated experimental water flow rate was taken as 0 1 m s the cylinder model with double bird wing shaped streamers used in the experiment is illustrated in fig 6 a and the length of the spoilers on it is half the diameter of the cylinder the size of the spoilers is not the main content of this experiment and it is mainly set for experimental effect combining with the main purpose of the experiment described in section 3 1 the spoilers and the cylindrical model were made as a whole and some unnecessary details were omitted because of the main function of spoilers and rotatable square escutcheon described in section 2 2 several cylinder models with streamers are connected by a larger rigid core to form a smooth cylindrical surface as shown in fig 5 b the length of the whole cylindrical model is greater than the depth of the fluid and the target model which will be projected with laser is located a short distance below the liquid level so that the measurement is less disturbed by the equipment the material of the streamer is pvc and the thickness is 0 23 mm which is adapt to the experimental environment as described in section 2 2 through referencing to certain related research gu 2012 xu et al 2017 the width and length of the streamers are based on the designed structure and model size in fig 6 b on the streamer models the serration s outline types contain perfect circle and right angled isosceles triangle considering the experimental comparison effect the types set to straight single or triple arc or angle compared fig 1 triple angle is closest to bird wing shaped obviously table 1 shows the length parameters where l1 to l5 are the lengths of the different streamers and d is the cylinder model diameter 4 experimental results and discussion 4 1 analysis of influence of streamer trailing edge shape firstly a water flow simulation experiment and piv measurements were carried out on the naked cylinder and the cylinder model with two different trailing edge shape streamers with a length of twice the model diameter and the wake streamline is illustrated in fig 7 moreover fig 8 and fig 9 displays the corresponding velocity and vorticity diagrams in sequence obtained by analysing the original data using tecplot fig 9 presents the trends chart of the vorticity along the x axis within 26 mm around the centreline of the cylindrical section along the flow and 85 mm behind the centreline which is perpendicular to the flow direction based on considering the vorticity distribution range several unusable data caused by the experimental equipment and measurement errors were eliminated the grey circle in the different locations represents the cylindrical section of the model owing to changing the model the wake section area of each capture is different it can be found from figs 8 10 that the vortex shedding mode approximates the 2p mode gabbai and benaroya 2005 because of the obviously stronger vortex on one side the separation point in a is on the back of the cylinder but the others are not in addition the positions of the areas with the highest velocity in the six pictures are different by comparing a with the five other images in fig 7 it is found that following installation of the double streamer structure the vortex generation behind the cylinder model is effectively suppressed large vortex appears approximately in the wake region in picture a and some turbulence eddies in the wake region of the others in fig 7 are small the size of the velocity on one side shear and accelerated flow region in fig 8 a is bigger than that of the others in fig 8 at the same time the sizes of the velocity in wake regions are all very small comparing the corresponding vorticity diagrams in fig 9 it can be observed that the ability to adhere to the walls of the vorticity is changed following installation of the double streamer structure and the near wall vorticity of the cylinder model is reduced the vortices are mainly concentrated on the outside of the two streamers and almost no near wall exists behind the cylinder in the final five vorticity maps in fig 9 compared to the four other diagrams the wake region with an obvious vorticity contrast is shorter in b as illustrated in fig 10 in the trend line of the bare cylinder the vorticity value near the cylinder is larger which is obviously different from the other five trend lines behind 55 mm the vorticity in b is generally the smallest apart from a overall the vorticity in the experiment of the single angle shaped streamers is generally smaller than that of the others in fig 10 therefore it can be concluded that the double streamer structure can effectively suppress the vortex generation and development behind the cylinder through its influence on the flow field distribution as described fig 4 and it is predicted that it can effectively suppress the viv of the cylinder in the water flow the trailing edge serrations can affect the flow field around the cylinder and delay the generation of vortices under this experimental condition the influence of the arc or angle of the serrations is not obvious and the single angle type has an improved suppression effect on the vortex 4 2 analysis of influence of streamer length in order to study the effect of the streamer length on the viv suppression effect of the double bird wing streamer structure cylinder models with triple arc bird wing shaped streamers with different lengths l1 to l5 were measured the wake streamline diagrams are presented in fig 11 and the corresponding velocity and vorticity diagrams are provided in fig 12 and fig 13 in sequence obtained after data processing the measurement result of l2 is illustrated in the picture f of figs 7 9 similarly the trends chart of the vorticity along the x axis is presented in fig 14 comparing the five streamline diagrams it is found that the eddies in turbulence near the wall of the cylinder model in fig 11 c are the smallest the size of the velocity on one side shear and accelerated flow region in fig 12 a length label l1 is obviously the largest followed by fig 12 d length label l5 but in length label l2 l3 l4 there is little difference about it both are small and the sizes of the velocity in wake regions are all very small in figs 8 and 12 in the five corresponding vorticity diagrams the vorticity around the cylinder model is smaller in fig 13 c moreover in fig 14 the vorticity value when the length is l4 is smaller overall and the change is reduced thus when the length of the bird wing shaped streamer is approximately four times the cylinder diameter the vortex suppression effect is improved 4 3 further discussion on the working effect of this viv suppression device based on the analysis of the previous experimental results and the study of relevant literature in section 1 and section 2 the working principle of the bird wing shaped suppression device can be further summarized as shown in fig 15 according to the viv principle as described in section 3 1 the basic method to suppress viv is to reduce the pressure gradient of flow field around the cylinder so it is an effective method to reduce accelerated flow region velocity and wake region vortex as shown in fig 4 the structure of double flexible streamers and double spoilers can reduce the velocity in accelerated flow region but the cause of this phenomenon remains to be studied and this structure can isolate high and low velocity regions and reduce the generation of big vortex in the flow field and due to the limitation of the rotation angle of the spoilers the separation point will not fall on the rear wall of the cylinder and it caused a lag in vortex generation perhaps the limited deformation of the flexible streamer also played a role in dissipating the energy that caused the flow field to become unstable the square escutcheon increases the surface roughness can effectively trigger the transition of the boundary layer zdravkovich 1997 thereby effectively inhibiting the generation of large eddies trailing edge serration bird wing shaped increases the vortex formation length and breaks up the vortex both of these structures located in the upstream and downstream respectively generate small scale turbulence with small eddies through small scale structures avoid the generation and shedding of large eddies near the cylinder in general these four structures wrap the cylinder in the water flow reducing the generation and shedding of surrounding vortices but the streamers cannot be too long otherwise they will come together and affect the work effect which can be predicted and the length of the separation plate should ensure that the streamer cannot be attached to the cylinder when working of course this also needs further research 5 conclusions 1 the implementation of the double streamer structure can effectively reduce the velocity of the flow field on both sides of the cylinder in the water flow and reduce the vortex behind the cylinder 2 the shape of the streamer trailing edge can affect the flow field around the cylinder and the trailing edge serration streamer can delay vortex generation 3 when the streamer length is approximately four times the cylinder diameter the vortex suppression effect is improved the specific dimensions and material of the streamer also require further precise laboratory simulation experiments field engineering tests and others further research in summary the bird wing shaped suppression device for the viv of risers can operate very effectively the bird wing shaped structure and double flexible streamer structure can be used not only in marine drilling risers but also in marine production risers marine pipelines and other slender underwater flexible devices which are susceptible to viv in work the influence of the two structures on the viv suppression can be studied in further detail and the design of the relevant suppression device can be optimised credit authorship contribution statement zifeng li conceptualization supervision guangming song writing review editing yanling chen data

21642,the influences of the keulgan carpenter number kc and froude number fr on the secondary load cycle slc on a bottom mounted circular cylinder are comprehensively investigated using computational fluid dynamics simulations by openfoam the volume of fluid method is used to simulate the wave surface and the shear stress transportation k ω turbulence model is adopted for turbulence modelling the sensitivity of the inline force to grid refinement is checked and the numerical simulation accuracy is validated by the experimental results the development of slc is found to be closely related to the downstream vortex shedding which induces the reduction of the wall pressure and thus the inline force the studied ranges of kc and fr are 11 01 20 26 and 0 167 0 534 respectively it reveals that kc and fr significantly affect the magnitude of slc and the 3rd and 4th order harmonic components dominate the slc keywords circular cylinder wave force secondary load cycle openfoam keulgan carpenter number froude number 1 introduction cylindrical structures are the most common structural types in ocean engineering such as the foundation of the wind turbines and support structure for the tension leg platform the secondary load cycle slc may appear when a steep crest passes a fixed vertical circular cylinder which is an additional longitudinal short duration loading prior to the minimum wave force as was firstly identified by grue 1993 the slc consists of higher order harmonic forces which may excite the structural resonance and further cause damages to structures thus the slc issue has attracted wide attentions and a large amount of experimental studies have been conducted to investigate its influencing factors chaplin and yemm 1997 experimentally studied the slc magnitude f c of a fixed vertical cylinder under focused waves with different wave steepness h l where h and l are the wave height and wave length respectively their results showed that f c was dependent on h l grue and huseby 2002 pointed out that the froude number fr η max ω g d where η max is the maximum wave surface elevation at the position of the cylinder obtained in the numerical wave tank without the cylinder ω is the incident wave frequency and d is the cylinder diameter is also an influencing factor for the presence of slc li et al 2014 conducted an experimental study on the action of multi directional focused waves on a single vertical cylinder and the critical fr fr cr for the presence of the slc was found to be 0 4 which was similar to the result from grue and huseby 2002 riise et al 2018 found that the keulgan carpenter number kc v max t d where v max is the maximum inline velocity of the water particle and t is the wave period also has significant effects on the slc in their study the kc 10 and it is difficult to fully explain its effect on slc in such a narrow range hong et al 2015 found that the slc tends to be more remarkable with increasing the submerged depth due to the complexity of the marine environment there are still some inconsistencies in effects of the influencing parameters on slc compared with the experimental method the computational fluid dynamic cfd methods have some superiorities in revealing the mechanism of slc of vertical cylinders because more flow details around the structure can be obtained some empirical formulas were proposed in fan et al 2018 to quantify the magnitude duration period and occurrence time of slc by kd kh and h h m where h is water depth chang et al 2019 simulated the slc under focused waves and pointed out that the slc may occur at about 0 2 0 25 trough to trough period after the main peak of the horizontal wave force it is worth noting that no turbulence closure was introduced in the aforementioned numerical simulation studies which may lead to low prediction accuracy of slc recently liu et al 2019 numerically simulated the inline forces of the cylinder under focused waves by adopting the shear stress transportation sst k ω turbulence model the numerical results agreed well with the experimental data and the slc was found to be dependent on fr and h l paulsen et al 2014 numerically studied the slc of bottom mounted cylinders under regular waves conditions and they found that both kr and h h max may act upon the slc where k is the wave number r the radius of the cylinder and h max is the limiting wave height for a regular wave at a given water depth in addition the downstream vortex was observed in the slc cases however the detailed relationship between the downstream vortex and the slc was not unveiled it is worth noting that the vortical structures in the impulsively started flow and oscillatory flow were numerically simulated using the two dimensional 2 d cylinder model by koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 in which the lagrangian type numerical scheme was applied to study the early stage of the downstream vortex development of an impulsively started cylinder they found the decrease and increase of drag force is induced by the interaction between the primary and secondary vorticities wu et al 2019 proposed the eulerian viscous vorticity equation method to numerically simulated the incompressible unsteady viscous flow around the cylinder under the action of oscillatory flow they found the vorticity is attached to the cylinder at lower kc numbers and separations may occur at larger kc numbers kristiansen and faltinsen 2017 numerically simulated the flow fields near the cylinder by a 2 d navier stokes large eddy simulation les solver with the cross flow principle and they deduced that the flow separation incurs a local rear run up to the authors knowledge the previous studies on the slc behaviors of a bottom mounted vertical cylinder mainly focused on low kc numbers kc 10 and the related conclusions may be inappropriate for the practical engineering structures with higher kc numbers kc 10 to this end this paper attempts to systematically investigate the influences of kc and fr numbers on the slc characteristics of a bottom mounted circular cylinder in the ranges of 11 01 kc 20 26 and 0 167 fr 0 534 based on three dimensional 3 d cfd simulations the remainder of the paper is organized as follows the numerical methodology is introduced in section 2 in section 3 the mesh convergence analysis is presented the simulation accuracy is validated through comparisons with the experimental results detailed analyses of the causes of the slc the relationship between the magnitude of slc and the vortex size are given in section 4 in section 5 the effects of kc and fr on slc are comprehensively investigated and the fft analysis is performed to quantify the ratios of the 3rd and 4th order harmonic components to the fundamental frequency component finally the conclusions of the paper are given in section 6 2 methodology 2 1 governing equations of fluid the navier stokes equations are applied to describe the viscous fluid flow considering an incompressible fluid the governing equations include the continuity equation and the momentum conservation equations in a eulerian frame the governing equations can be formulated as 1a u i x i 0 1b ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j where t and x i denote the time and i th cartesian coordinates u i and u i denote the time averaged and fluctuating flow velocity components respectively p denotes the time averaged pressure ρ and μ are the air density and dynamic viscosity ρ u i u j are the six unknown reynolds stresses which need to be modeled or solved using the turbulence models to close the equation system among various turbulence models the sst k ω turbulence model is currently most widely used to simulate the wave forces on marine structures choi et al 2015 brown et al 2016 jose et al 2017 and is adopted in the present study the governing equations are solved by the open source cfd toolbox openfoam 3 0 x the first order implicit scheme euler is used

1996 ferziger and peric 1999 is used for laplacian terms the velocity equation is solved by the preconditioned bi conjugate gradient pbigg solver miki and morse 1985 the pressure equation is solved by the generalized geometric algebraic multi grid gamg method brannick et al 2006 the pressure implicit method for pressure linked equations pimple algorithm weller et al 1998 is used for the solution of pressure velocity coupling all the detailed schemes and methods can be found in the openfoam foundation 2011a 2011b 2 2 free surface tracking the volume of fluid vof hirt and nichols 1981 scheme is adopted to simulate the two phase flow and capture the free surface and the volume ratio relation between two phases and transport equation can be presented as 2a q 1 2 α q 1 q 1 2 2b α q t u i α q 0 where α q is the volume fraction representing the volume fraction coefficient of the fluid which can be evaluated as 3 α q α q 1 0 1 α q 0 w a t e r i n t e r f a c e a i r 2 3 wave generation the open source package waves2foam jacobsen et al 2012 jensen et al 2014 which was developed from the default solver interfoam is used to generate waves such as stokes wave cnoidal wave boussinesq solitary wave and irregular wave etc the generation and the elimination of waves are simulated by setting parameters of relaxation zone the relaxation algorithm is formulated as 4 φ c φ c o m p u t e d 1 c φ t arg e t where φ is either u or α and the weighting factor c is defined as 5 c x 1 exp x 3 5 1 exp 1 1 where x 0 1 is a local coordinate normally the length of the relaxation zones is set to be one to two times of wave length more details are provided in waves2foam manual 2017 3 numerical setups and validation two cases with same h l and kη max as those in the experiments conducted by grue and huseby 2002 are numerically simulated the numerical wave tanks are built and shown in fig 1 jacobsen et al 2012 and liu et al 2019 suggested l 2l as the lengths of the wave generation and absorption zones for the application of the waves2foam solver where l is the wavelength so the 2l are adopted for the length of the generation absorption zones respectively and the working zone is l a bottom mounted vertical cylinder is located in the center of the working zone and its diameter d is 0 06m for all cases in this study the widths of the wave tanks are 1 2m and 0 5m for the numerical simulation and experiment respectively correspondingly the blockage ratios are 5 and 12 respectively therefore the sizes of the numerical wave tank in this study are reliable the depths h of the still water in the two cases are both 0 6m and the detailed parameters are listed in table 1 where t is the wave period re is the maximum reynolds numbers re ρv max d μ where ρ and μ are the water density and dynamic viscosity respectively the 2 d numerical models are used to simulate the waves elevations and the mesh sizes are x l 120 and z h 40 in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively the time dependent free surface elevations by the numerical simulation and experiment are shown in fig 2 the numerical and experimental results meet well which verifies the wave generation accuracy of the waves2foam solver the three dimensional 3 d global mesh around the cylinder is shown in fig 3 a the local mesh around the cylinder in the x y plane is shown in fig 3 b where n c n l and n y are the numbers of cells around the cylinder body fitted cell layers and y axis grids respectively in addition the sst k ω turbulence model put forward by menter 1993 is used in the present study the simulation need to avoid the buffer layer while determining the y which in other words is to guarantee either y 5 viscous sublayer or 300 y 30 logarithmic sublayer and y were kept inside this region 300 y 30 for all the simulations in the present study the maximum dimensionless wall distance y u y υ where u is the friction velocity y is the wall spacing υ is the dynamic viscosity of the first layer grids is lower than 100 3 1 numerical simulation of the inline force on a bottom mounted vertical cylinder a grid independence study of the 3 d numerical model is carried out and table 2 lists the grid parameters in order to ensure the accuracy of calculation the maximum courant number is less than 0 25 all the simulations are computed in parallel on a node with 4 intel r xeon 6148 cpu the aforementioned waves2foam solver is applied to calculate the inline forces where the results with different grid numbers are shown in fig 4 and experimental data by grue and huseby 2002 are also shown for comparisons generally the results by using the three meshes are fairly close especially for the medium and fine meshes so the medium mesh is adopted in consideration of both simulation accuracy and computation time besides the numerical and experimental results show fairly satisfactory agreements by which the numerical simulation accuracy can be verified 4 characteristics of slc 4 1 the mechanism of slc as shown in fig 5 the slc is not observed in the numerical inline force of case 1 the inline force by morison formulation is also offered which can be calculated by 6 f h t z 1 2 c d ρ d u x t z u x t z c m ρ π d 2 4 d u x t z d t where f h is the wave force acting on unit body length ρ is the water density u x is the horizontal water particle velocity c d c m are the empirical drag and inertial coefficients which are set as 1 0 and 2 0 respectively the numerical result shows satisfactory agreements with those of morison three typical times in case 1 are selected as marked as a b and c in fig 5 and their flow fields and the pressure contour lines on the side wall of the cylinder are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 the velocity streamlines are at a horizontal plane z 0 45m perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder the downstream vortices that found in the slc case which was numerically simulated by paulsen et al 2014 are not observed in case 1 in addition the pressure contour lines are the sloping lines without visible changes as shown in fig 8 a the distinct slc can be observed in the numerical inline force of case 2 compared with case 1 the numerical result shows larger deviation from the morison result fig 8 b is one local zoomed part of fig 8 a where t h is the duration of slc and the dimensionless parameter t h t h t is 0 106 for case 2 to some extent f c represents the peak variation of the inline force due to slc f c and f c f p were respectively used to quantify the magnitude of slc by chaplin and yemm 1997 and grue and huseby 2002 where f p is the peak to peak value of the total inline wave force f c is normalized as 7 f c f c k ρ g π r 2 f c and f c f p for case 2 are 0 003 and 0 012 respectively in order to explore the effect of the downstream vortices on slc six typical times in case 2 are selected to analyze the development process of slc as marked as a0 a1 a b c c1 in fig 8 a their velocity streamlines fig 9 are monitored at six times to demonstrate the evolution process of the downstream vortices the velocity streamlines are at a horizontal plane z 0 45m perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder compared with the case 1 the downstream vortices and the changed pressure on the side wall surface are observed for case 2 the flow fields with different z axis coordinates at time a are shown in fig 10 the downstream vortices become larger when the water depth gets closer to the free surface in addition the second invariant q is applied to calculate the vortex intensity to further study the underlying mechanism causing the slc phenomenon according to hunt et al 1988 the vortex structures in the flow field can be identified by the second invariant q 8 q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 where s 1 2 u i x j u i x i and ω 1 2 u i x j u i x i are the symmetric and antisymmetric components of the velocity gradient tensor u respectively q represents the local balance between the shear strain rate and vorticity magnitude and higher q means a higher vortex intensity this q criterion is more appropriate than the vorticity criterion for extracting the vortex structures especially in the near wall region where the flow shear effect is prominent for case 2 when q 150 three typical instantaneous time a b and c iso surfaces are shown in fig 11 the downstream vortex mainly appeared behind the cylinder and the size of the vortical structures gets larger gradually it indicates that the vortical structure shows higher vortex intensity with the development of slc in addition the vortical structures appears as an inverted cone its works on the wall pressure become more significant with decreasing depths the pressure contour lines on the side wall surface fig 12 are also monitored at six times to demonstrate the effects of the downstream vortices on the wall pressure compared with case 1 the wall pressure shows visible changes near the position of the downstream vortices and influences of the vortical structures on the wall pressure becomes more significant with decreasing submerged depths the pressure distributions around the cylinder at 3 typical instants are shown in fig 13 where θ 0 and 180 represent the downstream and upstream sides of the cylinder respectively both the vortical structures shown in fig 9 and the pressure distributions show symmetry along the wave direction the pressures show visible changes when θ ranges from 30 to 30 where are in the positions of the downstream vortices the influences of vortical structures on the pressures are not distinct at z 0 25 and 0 15m due to the smaller downstream vortices in addition chaplin and yemm 1997 experimentally monitored the pressure distributions around the cylinder during the slc stages they found that the changes in wall pressure were most pronounced at instant m4 corresponding to time c in our study similar results are also observed in fig 13 the influence process of the downstream vortices on the inline forces can be explained as follows 1 from time a0 to time a the downstream vortices are almost invisible at time a0 but appeared at time a according to the pressure contour lines on side wall surface the pressure shows visible change near the position of the downstream vortices slight deviation between the simulated and morison results can be noticed 2 from time a to time b the downstream vortices become larger and the influences on the side wall pressure are more notable the inline force continues to decrease with the rising of vortex size and the numerical result is slightly upward during this stage the differences between numerical result and morison formulation result tends to be remarkable 3 from time b to time c the downstream vortices have the greatest effect on the side wall pressure at time c the difference between numerical result and formulation result are very large 4 from time c to time c1 the downstream vortices gradually decrease and disappear at time c1 and the corresponding pressure changed regions also disappeared the deviation from the morison formulation result becomes smaller according to the relationships between the development of slc and the vortex processes it can be inferred that the downstream vortices leads to the decrease of wall pressures which is the main cause of slc chaplin and yemm 1997 and grue and huseby 2002 respectively found that h l and kη max have great effects on the occurrence of slc in the present study for similar h l and kη max of case 1 and case 2 slc is observed in case 2 but not in case 1 it indicates that besides the h l and kη max other parameters may also have great effects on slc according to table 1 the kc and fr of case 1 and case 2 are different and their actions on slc need further investigations fig 14 shows the spectra ratio of the inline forces where the frequencies are normalized by the incident wave frequency f t s n and s 1 are the amplitude spectra of higher harmonic and fundamental forces the results show that the higher harmonic components r n s n s 1 in case 2 make more contributions to the inline forces than those of case 1 4 2 the slc with different magnitudes in order to study the slc with different magnitudes five more cases are built the detailed parameters are listed in table 3 where the kc ranges from 11 01 to 20 26 and fr ranges from 0 236 to 0 374 the inline forces of cases 2 7 are shown in fig 15 it can be clearly seen that the slc of cases 3 7 are more obviously seen than those of case 2 the dimensionless parameter t h t h t was used to quantify the duration of the slc in cases 3 7 t h are 0 169 0 164 0 145 0 144 0 142 respectively the results by liu et al 2019 are within a range of 0 161 0 173 the maximum result by grue 1993 is 0 150 overall the results are comparable and the differences may be caused by the different wave types in addition f c and f c f p are shown in fig 16 the maximum f c and f c f p in cases 2 7 are 2 02 and 8 36 respectively considering the downstream vortex is the main cause of the slc the velocity streamlines and the pressure contour lines of cases 3 5 7 are also shown in fig 17 and fig 18 respectively the f c f p increase with the increase of the vortex size and the vortex pair becomes asymmetry in addition the changed pressure on the side wall becomes more distinct with larger downstream vortices kristiansen and faltinsen 2017 and riise et al 2018 found the frequency of the slc was greater than 3f tt where f tt is the frequency calculated by the trough to trough period of local wave for the present numerical results the fft analysis was also performed to calculate r n as shown in fig 19 it is notable that r 3 and r 4 becomes larger with increasing f c f p 5 the influences of kc and fr numbers on slc to explore the effects of kc and fr on slc 12 more simulation cases have been performed and the related parameters are listed in table 4f the fr ranges from 0 167 to 0 534 which is similar to the range studied by liu et al 2019 the re ranges from 1 49 104 to 3 44 104 the inline forces of all cases are shown in fig 20 the slc is not distinct in case 8 12 16 and 17 and for the cases with slc t h varies from 0 126 to 0 185 which are consistent with grue 1993 and liu et al 2019 the fft analyses are also performed to calculate the r 3 and r 4 which the results are listed in table 4 both r 3 and r 4 increase with increasing the f c f p in the cases with the same kc number it may indicate that the 3rd and 4th order components are very important for the slc the relationship between the f c f p and fr are plotted in fig 21 together with the numerical liu et al 2019 and experimental results grue and huseby 2002 the range of the f c f p in this study is 0 017 0 129 which is consistent with the simulated values 0 024 0 126 and experiments data 0 018 0 155 although the ranges of f c f p match well the values of fr are significantly inconsistent in those three studies in addition f c f p may make a several times difference when fr is very close and similar f c f p could be induced by the incoming waves with different fr the relationship between f c f p and fr does not present any obvious regular patterns therefore it is difficult to investigate f c f p only by fr the results of f c and f c f p with different kc and fr are shown in fig 22 the slc appears when fr 0 167 and become most pronounced when fr is about 0 22 f c and f c f p subsequently get smaller with increasing the fr grue and huseby 2002 found the critical fr fr cr for the presence of the slc is 0 4 chang et al 2019 found the fr cr 0 34 and become most pronounced when fr 0 62 in their research the kc numbers are less than 6 53 and 10 28 respectively it indicates that fr cr of the slc decreases with increasing kc as shown in fig 22 the values of the f c and f c f p are not only related to fr but also associated with kc the general trend is that the range of the fr for the presence of slc becomes narrower with increasing kc and f c and f c f p are the largest when kc 11 in addition riise et al 2018 speculated that the flow velocity is an important factor for the appearance of slc where the speed of the travelling edge of the undisturbed wave was used to approximate the flow velocity in order to further study the conjecture that proposed by riise et al 2018 the relationships between f c and re f c f p and re are shown in fig 23 with increasing kc the critical re for the presence of slc is also increasing it is worth noting that although the re are close among cases 2 3 5 and 7 the flow fields are quite different furthermore the slc phenomena slc magnitudes and vortex sizes do not become more notably with increasing re therefore different with the previous viewpoint re may be not the only governing parameter for the changing of the flow fields and the downstream vortex is also influenced by other parameters due to the narrow range of re that involved in this paper further work should be done to comprehensively evaluate the influence of re on the slc 6 concluding remarks the actions of the regular waves on a fixed vertical cylinder is numerically simulated in this paper based on

21642,the influences of the keulgan carpenter number kc and froude number fr on the secondary load cycle slc on a bottom mounted circular cylinder are comprehensively investigated using computational fluid dynamics simulations by openfoam the volume of fluid method is used to simulate the wave surface and the shear stress transportation k ω turbulence model is adopted for turbulence modelling the sensitivity of the inline force to grid refinement is checked and the numerical simulation accuracy is validated by the experimental results the development of slc is found to be closely related to the downstream vortex shedding which induces the reduction of the wall pressure and thus the inline force the studied ranges of kc and fr are 11 01 20 26 and 0 167 0 534 respectively it reveals that kc and fr significantly affect the magnitude of slc and the 3rd and 4th order harmonic components dominate the slc keywords circular cylinder wave force secondary load cycle openfoam keulgan carpenter number froude number 1 introduction cylindrical structures are the most common structural types in ocean engineering such as the foundation of the wind turbines and support structure for the tension leg platform the secondary load cycle slc may appear when a steep crest passes a fixed vertical circular cylinder which is an additional longitudinal short duration loading prior to the minimum wave force as was firstly identified by grue 1993 the slc consists of higher order harmonic forces which may excite the structural resonance and further cause damages to structures thus the slc issue has attracted wide attentions and a large amount of experimental studies have been conducted to investigate its influencing factors chaplin and yemm 1997 experimentally studied the slc magnitude f c of a fixed vertical cylinder under focused waves with different wave steepness h l where h and l are the wave height and wave length respectively their results showed that f c was dependent on h l grue and huseby 2002 pointed out that the froude number fr η max ω g d where η max is the maximum wave surface elevation at the position of the cylinder obtained in the numerical wave tank without the cylinder ω is the incident wave frequency and d is the cylinder diameter is also an influencing factor for the presence of slc li et al 2014 conducted an experimental study on the action of multi directional focused waves on a single vertical cylinder and the critical fr fr cr for the presence of the slc was found to be 0 4 which was similar to the result from grue and huseby 2002 riise et al 2018 found that the keulgan carpenter number kc v max t d where v max is the maximum inline velocity of the water particle and t is the wave period also has significant effects on the slc in their study the kc 10 and it is difficult to fully explain its effect on slc in such a narrow range hong et al 2015 found that the slc tends to be more remarkable with increasing the submerged depth due to the complexity of the marine environment there are still some inconsistencies in effects of the influencing parameters on slc compared with the experimental method the computational fluid dynamic cfd methods have some superiorities in revealing the mechanism of slc of vertical cylinders because more flow details around the structure can be obtained some empirical formulas were proposed in fan et al 2018 to quantify the magnitude duration period and occurrence time of slc by kd kh and h h m where h is water depth chang et al 2019 simulated the slc under focused waves and pointed out that the slc may occur at about 0 2 0 25 trough to trough period after the main peak of the horizontal wave force it is worth noting that no turbulence closure was introduced in the aforementioned numerical simulation studies which may lead to low prediction accuracy of slc recently liu et al 2019 numerically simulated the inline forces of the cylinder under focused waves by adopting the shear stress transportation sst k ω turbulence model the numerical results agreed well with the experimental data and the slc was found to be dependent on fr and h l paulsen et al 2014 numerically studied the slc of bottom mounted cylinders under regular waves conditions and they found that both kr and h h max may act upon the slc where k is the wave number r the radius of the cylinder and h max is the limiting wave height for a regular wave at a given water depth in addition the downstream vortex was observed in the slc cases however the detailed relationship between the downstream vortex and the slc was not unveiled it is worth noting that the vortical structures in the impulsively started flow and oscillatory flow were numerically simulated using the two dimensional 2 d cylinder model by koumoutsakos and leonard 1995 in which the lagrangian type numerical scheme was applied to study the early stage of the downstream vortex development of an impulsively started cylinder they found the decrease and increase of drag force is induced by the interaction between the primary and secondary vorticities wu et al 2019 proposed the eulerian viscous vorticity equation method to numerically simulated the incompressible unsteady viscous flow around the cylinder under the action of oscillatory flow they found the vorticity is attached to the cylinder at lower kc numbers and separations may occur at larger kc numbers kristiansen and faltinsen 2017 numerically simulated the flow fields near the cylinder by a 2 d navier stokes large eddy simulation les solver with the cross flow principle and they deduced that the flow separation incurs a local rear run up to the authors knowledge the previous studies on the slc behaviors of a bottom mounted vertical cylinder mainly focused on low kc numbers kc 10 and the related conclusions may be inappropriate for the practical engineering structures with higher kc numbers kc 10 to this end this paper attempts to systematically investigate the influences of kc and fr numbers on the slc characteristics of a bottom mounted circular cylinder in the ranges of 11 01 kc 20 26 and 0 167 fr 0 534 based on three dimensional 3 d cfd simulations the remainder of the paper is organized as follows the numerical methodology is introduced in section 2 in section 3 the mesh convergence analysis is presented the simulation accuracy is validated through comparisons with the experimental results detailed analyses of the causes of the slc the relationship between the magnitude of slc and the vortex size are given in section 4 in section 5 the effects of kc and fr on slc are comprehensively investigated and the fft analysis is performed to quantify the ratios of the 3rd and 4th order harmonic components to the fundamental frequency component finally the conclusions of the paper are given in section 6 2 methodology 2 1 governing equations of fluid the navier stokes equations are applied to describe the viscous fluid flow considering an incompressible fluid the governing equations include the continuity equation and the momentum conservation equations in a eulerian frame the governing equations can be formulated as 1a u i x i 0 1b ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j where t and x i denote the time and i th cartesian coordinates u i and u i denote the time averaged and fluctuating flow velocity components respectively p denotes the time averaged pressure ρ and μ are the air density and dynamic viscosity ρ u i u j are the six unknown reynolds stresses which need to be modeled or solved using the turbulence models to close the equation system among various turbulence models the sst k ω turbulence model is currently most widely used to simulate the wave forces on marine structures choi et al 2015 brown et al 2016 jose et al 2017 and is adopted in the present study the governing equations are solved by the open source cfd toolbox openfoam 3 0 x the first order implicit scheme euler is used for time discretization and the gauss linear scheme is used for gradient terms the gauss linearupwind gauss scheme is used for the divergence term of k and ω the gauss linear corrected scheme jasak 1996 ferziger and peric 1999 is used for laplacian terms the velocity equation is solved by the preconditioned bi conjugate gradient pbigg solver miki and morse 1985 the pressure equation is solved by the generalized geometric algebraic multi grid gamg method brannick et al 2006 the pressure implicit method for pressure linked equations pimple algorithm weller et al 1998 is used for the solution of pressure velocity coupling all the detailed schemes and methods can be found in the openfoam foundation 2011a 2011b 2 2 free surface tracking the volume of fluid vof hirt and nichols 1981 scheme is adopted to simulate the two phase flow and capture the free surface and the volume ratio relation between two phases and transport equation can be presented as 2a q 1 2 α q 1 q 1 2 2b α q t u i α q 0 where α q is the volume fraction representing the volume fraction coefficient of the fluid which can be evaluated as 3 α q α q 1 0 1 α q 0 w a t e r i n t e r f a c e a i r 2 3 wave generation the open source package waves2foam jacobsen et al 2012 jensen et al 2014 which was developed from the default solver interfoam is used to generate waves such as stokes wave cnoidal wave boussinesq solitary wave and irregular wave etc the generation and the elimination of waves are simulated by setting parameters of relaxation zone the relaxation algorithm is formulated as 4 φ c φ c o m p u t e d 1 c φ t arg e t where φ is either u or α and the weighting factor c is defined as 5 c x 1 exp x 3 5 1 exp 1 1 where x 0 1 is a local coordinate normally the length of the relaxation zones is set to be one to two times of wave length more details are provided in waves2foam manual 2017 3 numerical setups and validation two cases with same h l and kη max as those in the experiments conducted by grue and huseby 2002 are numerically simulated the numerical wave tanks are built and shown in fig 1 jacobsen et al 2012 and liu et al 2019 suggested l 2l as the lengths of the wave generation and absorption zones for the application of the waves2foam solver where l is the wavelength so the 2l are adopted for the length of the generation absorption zones respectively and the working zone is l a bottom mounted vertical cylinder is located in the center of the working zone and its diameter d is 0 06m for all cases in this study the widths of the wave tanks are 1 2m and 0 5m for the numerical simulation and experiment respectively correspondingly the blockage ratios are 5 and 12 respectively therefore the sizes of the numerical wave tank in this study are reliable the depths h of the still water in the two cases are both 0 6m and the detailed parameters are listed in table 1 where t is the wave period re is the maximum reynolds numbers re ρv max d μ where ρ and μ are the water density and dynamic viscosity respectively the 2 d numerical models are used to simulate the waves elevations and the mesh sizes are x l 120 and z h 40 in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively the time dependent free surface elevations by the numerical simulation and experiment are shown in fig 2 the numerical and experimental results meet well which verifies the wave generation accuracy of the waves2foam solver the three dimensional 3 d global mesh around the cylinder is shown in fig 3 a the local mesh around the cylinder in the x y plane is shown in fig 3 b where n c n l and n y are the numbers of cells around the cylinder body fitted cell layers and y axis grids respectively in addition the sst k ω turbulence model put forward by menter 1993 is used in the present study the simulation need to avoid the buffer layer while determining the y which in other words is to guarantee either y 5 viscous sublayer or 300 y 30 logarithmic sublayer and y were kept inside this region 300 y 30 for all the simulations in the present study the maximum dimensionless wall distance y u y υ where u is the friction velocity y is the wall spacing υ is the dynamic viscosity of the first layer grids is lower than 100 3 1 numerical simulation of the inline force on a bottom mounted vertical cylinder a grid independence study of the 3 d numerical model is carried out and table 2 lists the grid parameters in order to ensure the accuracy of calculation the maximum courant number is less than 0 25 all the simulations are computed in parallel on a node with 4 intel r xeon 6148 cpu the aforementioned waves2foam solver is applied to calculate the inline forces where the results with different grid numbers are shown in fig 4 and experimental data by grue and huseby 2002 are also shown for comparisons generally the results by using the three meshes are fairly close especially for the medium and fine meshes so the medium mesh is adopted in consideration of both simulation accuracy and computation time besides the numerical and experimental results show fairly satisfactory agreements by which the numerical simulation accuracy can be verified 4 characteristics of slc 4 1 the mechanism of slc as shown in fig 5 the slc is not observed in the numerical inline force of case 1 the inline force by morison formulation is also offered which can be calculated by 6 f h t z 1 2 c d ρ d u x t z u x t z c m ρ π d 2 4 d u x t z d t where f h is the wave force acting on unit body length ρ is the water density u x is the horizontal water particle velocity c d c m are the empirical drag and inertial coefficients which are set as 1 0 and 2 0 respectively the numerical result shows satisfactory agreements with those of morison three typical times in case 1 are selected as marked as a b and c in fig 5 and their flow fields and the pressure contour lines on the side wall of the cylinder are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 the velocity streamlines are at a horizontal plane z 0 45m perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder the downstream vortices that found in the slc case which was numerically simulated by paulsen et al 2014 are not observed in case 1 in addition the pressure contour lines are the sloping lines without visible changes as shown in fig 8 a the distinct slc can be observed in the numerical inline force of case 2 compared with case 1 the numerical result shows larger deviation from the morison result fig 8 b is one local zoomed part of fig 8 a where t h is the duration of slc and the dimensionless parameter t h t h t is 0 106 for case 2 to some extent f c represents the peak variation of the inline force due to slc f c and f c f p were respectively used to quantify the magnitude of slc by chaplin and yemm 1997 and grue and huseby 2002 where f p is the peak to peak value of the total inline wave force f c is normalized as 7 f c f c k ρ g π r 2 f c and f c f p for case 2 are 0 003 and 0 012 respectively in order to explore the effect of the downstream vortices on slc six typical times in case 2 are selected to analyze the development process of slc as marked as a0 a1 a b c c1 in fig 8 a their velocity streamlines fig 9 are monitored at six times to demonstrate the evolution process of the downstream vortices the velocity streamlines are at a horizontal plane z 0 45m perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder compared with the case 1 the downstream vortices and the changed pressure on the side wall surface are observed for case 2 the flow fields with different z axis coordinates at time a are shown in fig 10 the downstream vortices become larger when the water depth gets closer to the free surface in addition the second invariant q is applied to calculate the vortex intensity to further study the underlying mechanism causing the slc phenomenon according to hunt et al 1988 the vortex structures in the flow field can be identified by the second invariant q 8 q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 where s 1 2 u i x j u i x i and ω 1 2 u i x j u i x i are the symmetric and antisymmetric components of the velocity gradient tensor u respectively q represents the local balance between the shear strain rate and vorticity magnitude and higher q means a higher vortex intensity this q criterion is more appropriate than the vorticity criterion for extracting the vortex structures especially in the near wall region where the flow shear effect is prominent for case 2 when q 150 three typical instantaneous time a b and c iso surfaces are shown in fig 11 the downstream vortex mainly appeared behind the cylinder and the size of the vortical structures gets larger gradually it indicates that the vortical structure shows higher vortex intensity with the development of slc in addition the vortical structures appears as an inverted cone its works on the wall pressure become more significant with decreasing depths the pressure contour lines on the side wall surface fig 12 are also monitored at six times to demonstrate the effects of the downstream vortices on the wall pressure compared with case 1 the wall pressure shows visible changes near the position of the downstream vortices and influences of the vortical structures on the wall pressure becomes more significant with decreasing submerged depths the pressure distributions around the cylinder at 3 typical instants are shown in fig 13 where θ 0 and 180 represent the downstream and upstream sides of the cylinder respectively both the vortical structures shown in fig 9 and the pressure distributions show symmetry along the wave direction the pressures show visible changes when θ ranges from 30 to 30 where are in the positions of the downstream vortices the influences of vortical structures on the pressures are not distinct at z 0 25 and 0 15m due to the smaller downstream vortices in addition chaplin and yemm 1997 experimentally monitored the pressure distributions around the cylinder during the slc stages they found that the changes in wall pressure were most pronounced at instant m4 corresponding to time c in our study similar results are also observed in fig 13 the influence process of the downstream vortices on the inline forces can be explained as follows 1 from time a0 to time a the downstream vortices are almost invisible at time a0 but appeared at time a according to the pressure contour lines on side wall surface the pressure shows visible change near the position of the downstream vortices slight deviation between the simulated and morison results can be noticed 2 from time a to time b the downstream vortices become larger and the influences on the side wall pressure are more notable the inline force continues to decrease with the rising of vortex size and the numerical result is slightly upward during this stage the differences between numerical result and morison formulation result tends to be remarkable 3 from time b to time c the downstream vortices have the greatest effect on the side wall pressure at time c the difference between numerical result and formulation result are very large 4 from time c to time c1 the downstream vortices gradually decrease and disappear at time c1 and the corresponding pressure changed regions also disappeared the deviation from the morison formulation result becomes smaller according to the relationships between the development of slc and the vortex processes it can be inferred that the downstream vortices leads to the decrease of wall pressures which is the main cause of slc chaplin and yemm 1997 and grue and huseby 2002 respectively found that h l and kη max have great effects on the occurrence of slc in the present study for similar h l and kη max of case 1 and case 2 slc is observed in case 2 but not in case 1 it indicates that besides the h l and kη max other parameters may also have great effects on slc according to table 1 the kc and fr of case 1 and case 2 are different and their actions on slc need further investigations fig 14 shows the spectra ratio of the inline forces where the frequencies are normalized by the incident wave frequency f t s n and s 1 are the amplitude spectra of higher harmonic and fundamental forces the results show that the higher harmonic components r n s n s 1 in case 2 make more contributions to the inline forces than those of case 1 4 2 the slc with different magnitudes in order to study the slc with different magnitudes five more cases are built the detailed parameters are listed in table 3 where the kc ranges from 11 01 to 20 26 and fr ranges from 0 236 to 0 374 the inline forces of cases 2 7 are shown in fig 15 it can be clearly seen that the slc of cases 3 7 are more obviously seen than those of case 2 the dimensionless parameter t h t h t was used to quantify the duration of the slc in cases 3 7 t h are 0 169 0 164 0 145 0 144 0 142 respectively the results by liu et al 2019 are within a range of 0 161 0 173 the maximum result by grue 1993 is 0 150 overall the results are comparable and the differences may be caused by the different wave types in addition f c and f c f p are shown in fig 16 the maximum f c and f c f p in cases 2 7 are 2 02 and 8 36 respectively considering the downstream vortex is the main cause of the slc the velocity streamlines and the pressure contour lines of cases 3 5 7 are also shown in fig 17 and fig 18 respectively the f c f p increase with the increase of the vortex size and the vortex pair becomes asymmetry in addition the changed pressure on the side wall becomes more distinct with larger downstream vortices kristiansen and faltinsen 2017 and riise et al 2018 found the frequency of the slc was greater than 3f tt where f tt is the frequency calculated by the trough to trough period of local wave for the present numerical results the fft analysis was also performed to calculate r n as shown in fig 19 it is notable that r 3 and r 4 becomes larger with increasing f c f p 5 the influences of kc and fr numbers on slc to explore the effects of kc and fr on slc 12 more simulation cases have been performed and the related parameters are listed in table 4f the fr ranges from 0 167 to 0 534 which is similar to the range studied by liu et al 2019 the re ranges from 1 49 104 to 3 44 104 the inline forces of all cases are shown in fig 20 the slc is not distinct in case 8 12 16 and 17 and for the cases with slc t h varies from 0 126 to 0 185 which are consistent with grue 1993 and liu et al 2019 the fft analyses are also performed to calculate the r 3 and r 4 which the results are listed in table 4 both r 3 and r 4 increase with increasing the f c f p in the cases with the same kc number it may indicate that the 3rd and 4th order components are very important for the slc the relationship between the f c f p and fr are plotted in fig 21 together with the numerical liu et al 2019 and experimental results grue and huseby 2002 the range of the f c f p in this study is 0 017 0 129 which is consistent with the simulated values 0 024 0 126 and experiments data 0 018 0 155 although the ranges of f c f p match well the values of fr are significantly inconsistent in those three studies in addition f c f p may make a several times difference when fr is very close and similar f c f p could be induced by the incoming waves with different fr the relationship between f c f p and fr does not present any obvious regular patterns therefore it is difficult to investigate f c f p only by fr the results of f c and f c f p with different kc and fr are shown in fig 22 the slc appears when fr 0 167 and become most pronounced when fr is about 0 22 f c and f c f p subsequently get smaller with increasing the fr grue and huseby 2002 found the critical fr fr cr for the presence of the slc is 0 4 chang et al 2019 found the fr cr 0 34 and become most pronounced when fr 0 62 in their research the kc numbers are less than 6 53 and 10 28 respectively it indicates that fr cr of the slc decreases with increasing kc as shown in fig 22 the values of the f c and f c f p are not only related to fr but also associated with kc the general trend is that the range of the fr for the presence of slc becomes narrower with

21643,to control the wake flow around a wall mounted cube a passive control method is proposed by drilling a horizontal hole from the front surface to rear surfaces of the cube the controlled and uncontrolled wakes are measured by using particle image velocimetry piv the cube model has a side length of d 70 mm and the diameter of horizontal control hole hch is d 10 mm reynolds number based on side length of cube is r e d 11 550 furthermore to study the positional effect of the hch three kinds of holes with different heights h are used the time averaged statistical characteristics show that the jet generated from the hch reduces the scale of the arch type vortex turbulence intensity reynolds shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy in the wake and enhances the recovery of streamwise velocity among three hchs the hch of h 35 mm has the optimal control effectiveness the analysis of vortex dynamics indicates that the hch jet effectively suppresses the periodic flow structures and accelerates the wake vortex shedding meanwhile the hch jet exhibits different effect on the spanwise vortex at its different heights the pod analysis implies that under the influence of the hch the alternant spanwise vortices are suppressed but symmetric vortices are relatively enhanced keywords passive flow control wall mounted cube wake vortex dynamics piv pod 1 introduction flow around a finite length wall mounted cylinder is a common phenomenon in our daily life and some structures like buildings automobiles offshore structures etc can be simplified to such cylinder on the other hand due to the influence of free end and bottom wall the flow around such cylinder exhibits strongly three dimensional complexity a large number of studies kawamura et al 1984 okamoto and sunabashiri 1992 sakamoto and arie 1983 sumner et al 2004 2017 wang and zhou 2009 indicate that the wake of the wall mounted finite length cylinder is closely related to the aspect ratio of ar h d here h and d represent the cylinder height and the cross sectional characteristic width respectively according to the study of sakamoto and arie 1983 there is a critical aspect ratio arcr when ar arcr the alternating karman vortex exists in most span of the cylinder except near the free end where the kármán vortex is affected by the downwash flow when ar arcr the spanwise vortex in wake changes from alternating kármán vortex to the symmetrical arrangement and the free end downwash flow dominates the near wake at the same time arcr varies according to the wall boundary layer thickness δ and the turbulence intensity of incoming flow and its value is about 2 6 kawamura et al 1984 in general most of the previous research is conducted for the wall mounted cylinder with ar arcr and some corresponding physical models are proposed etzold and fiedler 1976 kawamura et al 1984 wang and zhou 2009 but study for the small ar cylinder especially the wall mounted short square cylinder is very few the cube is a typical short square cylinder of ar 1 due to its small ar the cube wake is greatly influenced by the free end and wall boundary layer castro and robins 1977 conducted a comprehensive study of the wall mounted cube and found that the relation between the boundary layer thickness δ and the horseshoe vortex which enhances the mixing in the cube near wake in addition the flow separation on the cube free end is related to the turbulence level of incoming flow larousse et al 1991 using oil film visualization and surface pressure measurement investigated the flow structure around the cube and proposed a physical model including horseshoe vortex cube side face spanwise vortices free end transverse vortex and the arch type vortex according to hearst et al 2016 the distribution of the reverse bubble around the cube is associated with the boundary layer thickness and the momentum recovery in the wake has a strong correlation with the turbulence intensity of incoming flow on the other hand the flow structure behind cube is highly unstable but little research has been focused on its dynamics for reducing the flow drag and wind noise and controlling diffusion of pollutants many flow control methods of cylinder wake are developed although they are different control approaches their basic idea is to change the flow structure around the cylinder lim and lee 2003 and he et al 2014 delay the surface separation by changing the surface shape of cylinder ogunremi and sumner 2015 and qu et al 2017 respectively use the splitter plate placed in the near wake and the synthetic jet injected from cylinder rear surface to change the development process of the wake vortex however it should be pointed out most of the current research about the flow control is focused on the conditions of infinite length cylinder or wall mounted finite length cylinder with large ar but there are few studies for the short wall mounted cylinder which highlights the present study furthermore most of the above control methods need to modify the model shape obviously or additionally supply energy so their application is limited recently rinoshika proposed a passive control technique in which a horizontal or inclined hole drilling between two surfaces of cylinder is applied to generate suction and blowing around a short circular cylinder rinoshika et al 2017 2018 rinoshika and rinoshika 2018 2019 as a result of rinoshika et al 2017 the inclined control hole effectively suppresses the separation on the free end of cylinder and accelerate the dominate frequency of vortex shedding from the cylinder surface rinoshika and rinoshika 2018 indicates that the jet generated by the horizontal control hole can destroy the wake vortex into smaller scale vortex thereby reducing the recirculation zone and the turbulence intensity on the other hand through comparison between inclined and horizontal control hole rinoshika et al 2018 found that inclined hole increases the areas of high reynolds shear stress and high turbulent kinetic energy tke in wake therefore its control effect is lower than horizontal hole overall these flow control methods are practical for short cylinder because they don t need to supply energy additionally and change the model shape obviously it should be noted that due to the mechanism of cube wake is different from the short circular cylinder wake above control methods have different effectiveness for controlling the cube wake thus motivating the present work in order to control the separation region and vortices of a cube wake a horizontal control hole hch from the front surface to the rear surface of the cube is adopted to induce jet flow the flow structures of a cube wake and the effect of the hch are experimentally studied based on piv measurement in addition the influence of hch position is also considered the time averaged flow field mean vorticity reynolds shear stresses turbulent kinetic energy and the phase averaged flow structures are discussed finally the pod analysis is applied to clarify the dominate flow structures of the hch cube wakes 2 experimental set up and conditions the experiment was conducted in an open water tunnel in beijing university of aeronautics and astronautics china the size of its test section is 700 mm 600 mm 3000 mm height width length and the water depth in this experiment is set as 580 mm the sketch of this experimental set up is given in fig 1 a a cube model having the height h and side length d of 70 mm as shown in fig 1 b is mounted on the central line of the bottom wall at the downstream of 580 mm from the entrance of test section the origin of the coordinate system is set at the center of bottom edge of the cube rear surface the axes x y z are along the streamwise transverse and spanwise or wall normal directions respectively in order to control the cube wake a horizontal controlling hole hch with the diameter of d 10 mm is horizontally drilled from the front surface to the rear surface of the cube for investigating the position effect of the hch on the three dimensional wake three kinds of holes at the spanwise height of h 20 35 and 50 mm h h 0 29 0 5 and 0 71 are used which are respectively close to free end mid span and bottom wall correspondingly the cubes with three holes are referred as the hch20 hch35 and hch50 cubes respectively in addition a standard cube without hch is also used in this experiment for a comparison purpose the blockage ratio of model in the present work is ψ s m s t 0 014 here the s m is the streamwise sectional area of the model and the s t is the sectional area of useful test section and the water depth is more than 8 times cube height therefore it may say that there is no effect of the side wall and free surface of water tunnel on our experimental results fig 1 c illustrates the piv measurement planes the time resolved piv measurement is performed in the x y planes of z 20 35 50 mm and x z plane of y 0 mm a continuous laser with output power of 8w and wavelength of 532 nm is used to illuminate the measurement plane the tracing particles are hollow glass beads with diameter of d p 5 20 μ m and density of ρ p 1 05 g cm a high speed cmos camera with the spatial resolution of 2016 1300 pixels for x y plane or 2016 950 pixels for x z plane is used to capture the particle images which corresponds to view field of 1 8 x d 3 1 1 5 y d 1 5 and 0 z d 1 8 this measurement range includes both the entire region of flow separation and the development of the wake vortex the recording frame rate is 100 fps and the exposure time is 2 ms there are at least 10000 snapshots are recorded for each experimental case to ensure the accuracy of analysis according to previous studies wang and zhou 2009 hearst et al 2016 and our experimental results the strouhal number of square cylinder wake distributes in the range of st 0 11 0 13 the sampling number 10000 sampling time is more than 100s including about 30 cycles of wake vortex and sampling frequency 100hz can satisfy the requirements of data statistical analysis in the piv processing the multi pass iterative lucas kanade milk algorithm is used to analyze the particle images and to obtain the velocity vector fields piv interrogation window size is set as 32 32 pixels with a 50 overlap in this experiment the free stream velocity is set at u 158 mm s the corresponding reynolds number based on the cube side length d is re d u d ν 11550 here ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid this reynolds number is within the range of previous square cylinder wakes wang and zhou 2009 rinoshika and watanabe 2010 hearst et al 2016 in order to evaluate the boundary layer of bottom wall piv is also used to measure its mean streamwise velocity and turbulent intensity profiles fig 2 shows that at the location of the cube the undisturbed boundary layer thickness δ is 17 4 mm δ d 0 25 and the free stream turbulence intensity is less than 1 the measured shape factor h is 1 97 which indicates the turbulent flow regime in the boundary layer relevant properties of the boundary layer are summarized in table 1 3 experimental results and discussion 3 1 statistical characteristics of flow field time averaged streamlines and contours of time averaged streamwise velocity u u in x z plane of y 0 mm for standard cube and hch cubes are shown in fig 3 the area of negative streamwise velocity is surrounded by a white line of u u 0 which represents the reverse zone for the standard cube shown in fig 3 a the flow separated from the leading edge of free end and deflects upward across the free end then the flow descends into the wake causing a strong downwash flow this separated flow wraps the entire free end and near wake at the same time due to the shear flow and the reversed flow a mean small transverse vortex and a large transverse vortex appear above the free end and behind the cube respectively the center of small vortex is located at x d z d 0 26 1 25 and the center of large vortex is located at x d z d 0 75 1 14 the distance from the cube to reattachment point on the bottom wall is usually defined as the recirculation length pattenden et al 2005 in the standard cube wake the reattachment point is at x d 2 12 these results are similar to reports of hussein and martinuzzi 1996 sumner et al 2017 about wall mounted finite length square cylinder however the flow field is different with the short circular cylinder case rinoshika et al 2018 which is characterized by two independent reverse zones above the free end and in near wake respectively difference between two cylinders is mainly due to increased bluffness of the square cylinder fig 3 b d shows the time averaged streamwise velocity and streamlines for the hch cubes in the x z plane of y 0 mm because of blowing from the hch a region of positive streamwise velocity appears near the hch outlets of each hch cubes especially in fig 3 d of hch50 cube where the outlet of hole is near the large transverse vortex the jet penetrates the reverse zone and divides it into a small zone above the free end and in a large zone the reattachment points of the hch20 hch35 and hch50 cases are located at x d 2 22 2 21 and 2 17 respectively and the recirculation lengths are all slightly longer than that of standard cube case this phenomenon is caused by the hch jet which obstructs the reversing flow and blows the wake structure more downstream in addition the hch jet also has influence on the position of the large vortex in the near wake and foci are located at x d z d 0 82 1 09 0 93 1 06 0 86 1 01 in hch20 hch35 and hch50 cases respectively the reverse zones of all hch cubes are smaller than that of the standard cube fig 4 shows the time averaged streamwise velocity and streamlines in the x y planes of z 20 35 and 50 mm while the regions surrounded by white lines in the figure represent the reverse zone as shown in fig 4 a c the flow fields around standard cube are symmetric along the centerline y d 0 two significant shear flows are generated from the front edge of two cube side surfaces the reverse zone also begins with same location and then wraps the entire cube combining with the data of fig 3 a it can be imagined that the separation bubble of cube starts with edges of the front surface and wraps entire cube downstream there are two symmetrical small spanwise vortices near the cube side surface and two symmetrical large spanwise vortices behind the cube due to the downwash flow the length of reverse zone decreases as the spanwise height z increases comparing with the standard cube the flow fields around hch cubes shown in fig 4 d l have some significant changes because of the blowing flow a small regions of positive streamwise velocity appear behind the hch outlets fig 4 f h and j and the absolute values of negative streamwise velocity within reverse zone at all spanwise heights are reduced it can be found that the blowing flow interacts with the recirculating flow and deflect upwards fig 3 b d which results in positive blowing velocity also appears in the x y plane higher than the horizontal hole as shown in fig 4 e and g here a pair of small counter rotating vortices appears which rotating direction is opposite to the large spanwise vortices and suppresses the symmetrical large spanwise vortices according to the works of tanaka and murata 1999 and wang and zhou 2009 the dominate flow structure in a finite length square cylinder wake is an arch type vortex the large spanwise vortex pair in the x y plane fig 4 is the cross section of the legs of arch type vortex and the large transverse vortex in the x z plane fig 3 is the beam as shown in fig 5 a an arch type structure can be clearly identified through connecting the centers of mean wake vortices fig 5 plots the center locations of arch type structure by connecting the vortices foci appearing in different planes figs 3 and 4 in the case of the standard cube the arch type vortex is close to the cube and its size is the largest among the cubes as shown in fig 5 b and c because of the free end downwash flow and bottom wall boundary layer the mean arch type vortex bends upstream near middle spanwise height of cube similar to c shape as indicated in fig 5 b and c the mean arch type vortex influenced by hch jet locates further downstream and its size is relatively reduced in addition their projection on the x z plane is not a c shape but exhibits a tendency that more downstream as spanwise height z fig 6 exhibits the root mean square of streamwise velocity fluctuation u r m s u and time averaged vorticity ω y d u at x z plane of y d 0 for standard cube shown in fig 6 a a shear layer generated from the leading edge of the free end where the ω y d u and the u r m s u reach a significant level above the free end surface which position is the same as the free end vortex shown in fig 3 in the range of about x d 1 2 an accumulation of high u r m s u appears behind the cube which is the location of the large vortex structure in wake in addition on the bottom wall in front of the cubes x d 1 1 6 there are also an accumulation of vorticity and u r m s u due to the horseshoe vortex in the front of cube due to the hch jet fig 6 b d a high u r m s u region and a pair of shear flows appear behind the hch outlet and the larger high u r m s u area caused by large transverse vortex is significantly weakened such reduction in fig 6 c with hch35 cube is most obvious and its u r m s u maximum is reduced from 0 25 of standard cube to 0 21 in the x y planes of the standard cube as shown in fig 7 a c a pair of separation of shear layer are generated symmetrically from the leading edge of two side surfaces of cube and two pairs of high u r m s u accumulations appear outside cube side surfaces and in near wake respectively due to the hch jet intensive turbulence intensity and vorticity appear near the hch outlets shown in fig 7 f h and j at the same time due to the upward deflection of jet the area influenced by hch jet still exist in fig 7 e and g compared with the standard cube of fig 7 a c the intensity and size of the u r m s u accumulation in near wake are significantly reduced by all hch in all spanwise heights and the effectiveness of hch35 is most obvious on the other hand since hch jet blows the large spanwise vortices downstream the contour of ω z d u in hch cases is slightly longer than that of the standard cube the distribution of the mean reynolds shear stress u w u 2 for the standard cube in the x z plane of z d 0 is shown in fig 8 a a large region of negative reynolds shear stress is observed on the free end and the near wake in which upper boundary is the free end shear layer the reynolds shear stress in reverse zone approaches to zero fig 8 b d exhibit the distributions of u w u 2 around hch20 hch35 and hch50 cubes respectively in these cases small regions of positive u w u 2 appear behind all hch outlets and the scale and magnitudes of the accumulation of negative u w u 2 on near wake are slightly reduced among them the suppression of the reynolds shear stress is most obvious under hch50 condition and the maximum decreases from 0 027 of the standard cube to 0 024 fig 9 shows comparison of the reynolds shear stress u v u 2 between the standard cube and the hch cubes in the x y planes of different heights the distributions of u v u 2 in these plots are antisymmetric about the centerline of y d 0 and approximately equal to zero within the reverse zone which are similar to the experiment results of the finite length square cylinder ar 7 reported by wang and zhou 2009 and the short wall mounted cylinder ar 1 reported by rinoshika et al 2017 in the standard cube of fig 9 a c the absolute values of maximum magnitude of u v u 2 are 0 050 0 048 and 0 056 in spanwise height of z 20 35 and 50 mm respectively due to the influence of the hchs the distributions of u v u 2 are obviously different from the standard cube case the concentration of u v u 2 become small and its absolute peak values decrease it indicates that the hch jet suppresses the turbulent fluctuation caused by the separation flow and reduces the reynolds shear stress in the wake among three hch cubes the hch35 cube has optimum efficiency in which absolute peak values of u v u 2 is 0 036 0 037 and 0 034 at spanwise heights of z 20 35 and 50 mm respectively it should be noted that a pair of small antisymmetric concentrations of u v u 2 appear behind hch outlets in reverse zone due to hch jet such as fig 9 e and f it is also found that the suppression effect of hch on the reynolds shear stress u v u 2 in the x y plane is stronger than u w u 2 in the x z plane it indicates the hch jet influences spanwise vortices more than transverse vortices in addition increasing u v u 2 inside reverse zone and decreasing u v u 2 outside reverse zone can reduce drag acting on the cube kim et al 2006 figs 10 13 show distributions of the turbulent kinetic energy tke around cube in different planes in the present study the t k e 0 75 u 2 u 2 w 2 u 2 in the x z planes and t k e 0 75 u 2 u 2 v 2 u 2 in the x y planes are used to analysis the vortical structures and turbulent features lim and lee 2003 fig 10 shows the distributions of tke for different cubes in the x z plane of y 0 mm an evident region of large tke with peak value of 0 082 is observed behind the standard cube fig 10 a in the hch cube cases of fig 10 b d the region of large tke in wake is evidently reduced by hch jet and their peak value are 0 071 0 072 and 0 073 for hch20 hch35 and hch50 respectively however because of the interaction between jet and reverse flow an intensive concentration of tke appears behind each hch outlets as increasing the height of the hch the tke concentration behind the hch outlet decrease as shown in fig 10 b d indicating that the interaction between jet and wake becomes weaker this tendency was also reported in rinoshika and rinoshika 2018 figs 11 13 show the distributions of tke in the x y plane at the different heights where hchs evidently suppress the tke in wake in the standard cube case the distribution of high tke concentrate at height of z 20 mm fig 11 a is symmetrically distributed at both sides of the wake it is obviously different from the x y planes of z 35 and 50 mm figs 12 a and fig 13 a in which their high tke concentrates near the centerline it indicates that the development of spanwise vortices at height of z 20 mm is different from that at other two heights which is mainly due to the boundary layer of bottom wall wang and zhou 2009 in the case of the hch a high concentration of tke are observed near hch outlets and in the rear reverse region as shown in figs 11 b fig 12 c and fig 13 d on the other hand the high concentrations of tke appearing in standard cube are suppressed at three spanwise heights by the hchs and their peak values are summarized in table 2 the decrease of tke may result in the reduction of the drag force acted on the cube lim and lee 2003 it can be found from table 2 that the suppression of tke by the hch jets in the x y plane is more obvious than that in x z plane this phenomenon is similar to reynolds shear stress discussed above and indicates that the hch jet mainly influence the development of spanwise vortices in the x y planes the hch35 suppress the tke by more than 20 at all spanwise heights which is larger than other two hch cubes therefore based on the results of reynolds shear stress and tke the vortex dynamics of the hch35 cube wake in the x y plane will be discussed in the following sections 3 2 wake vortex dynamics 3 2 1 power spectrum analysis the spectral distributions of the streamwise velocity for the standard cube and the hch35 cube are shown in fig 14 the velocity measurement points are selected at x d 1 5 and their transverse position is at the position of the maximum u r m s u as shown in fig 7 fig 14 a c is the standard cube case from high to low span height and fig 14 d f is the hch35 cube case in the same order fig 14 d f the spectra of the standard cube as shown in fig 14 a c exhibit significant frequency peaks the spectrum at the heights of z 35 and 50 mm is the single peak pattern fig 14 a and b and their strouhal numbers of peak are st 0 103 and 0 098 respectively at the height of z 20 mm where is closer to the bottom wall the spectrum has a relatively weaker secondary peak in addition to a main peak and their strouhal numbers is st 0 096 and 0 107 respectively fig 14 c these results indicate the existence of periodic vortex motion in cube wake and the dimensionless frequency is also close to previous studies of the finite square cylinder by hearst et al 2016 wang et al 2009 2017 and vinuesa et al 2015 it is worth noting that the main peak frequency slightly decreases with z increases this phenomenon also occurs in the study of rinoshika and rinoshika 2018 about a short wall mounted circular cylinder and may be influenced by the downwash flow wang and zhou 2009 pointed out that due to the influence of the free end downwash flow and the bottom wall boundary layer the mode of vortex shedding near the two ends of the cylinder is more unstable so the peak energy in fig 14 a and c is lower than that in the mid span position of fig 14 b a second peak appearing in fig 14 c may well be also caused by the unstable shedding of the vortices fig 14 d f is the spectrum of the hch35 cube wake and show a significant different from the standard cube spectra in these plots are not the single peak pattern but become the double peak or multi peak pattern due to the hch jet suppresses the development of spanwise vortex the peak energy decreases in all spanwise height at z 50 and 35 mm shown in fig 14 d and e there is a strouhal number of peak higher than the standard cube case at each height respectively he et al 2014 and rinoshika et al 2018 indicate that the horizontal jet could shorten the scale of the vortex formation causing the vortex shedding frequency increases in addition the reduction of spanwise vortices scale also contributes to the drag reduce because of without direct effect of the hch35 jet the first two peak frequency at z 20 mm fig 14 f is same as standard cube case in which st of peak are still 0 096 and 0 107 but corresponding energy decreases it is worth noting that a third peak with st 0 048 appears in fig 14 f evidently indicating that the wake structure near the bottom wall is more complicated due to the boundary layer wang and zhou 2009 revealed that the symmetrical vortices with longer evolving length and lower frequency have a higher probability in this region at the same time ogunremi and sumner 2015 indicated that the main frequency of a square cylinder wake separated by a splitter plate was reduced from st 1 03 without plate to 0 048 the following discussion of phase averaged flow field section 3 2 2 will illustrate that the effect of the hch jet is like the splitter plate to some extent therefore this third peak of st 0 048 may be caused by the combined effect of the boundary layer and the hch35 jet 3 2 2 phase averaged vortical structures to better understand the evolution of wake structure and the horizontal jet figs 15 17 show the phase averaged wake at different spanwise heights where the first row of each figure represents the standard cube and the second row is the hch35 cube since the development process of spanwise vortices alternate along the centerline of y d 0 only the averaged wake of φ 0 π are shown here the phase averaged wake is obtained based on the cross correlation method as follows the correlation coefficients are first calculated between all frames with a base frame at a certain phase and then the frames corresponding to the correlation peaks are selected finally these selected frames are averaged to produce the averaged flow field at a certain phase angle the coefficient λ c i proposed by zhou et al 1999 is used to identify the spanwise vortices pseudo color in plots λ c i is the imaginary part of the complex eigenvalue of the velocity gradient tensor d u but in present study λ c i is computed from the 2d truncated velocity gradient tensor d 2 given in equation 1 due to the limitation of 2d piv measurement the rotation sense of λ c i depends on the sign of the local vorticity in addition streamlines are also superposed on plots for displaying flow motion at different phase angle 1 d 2 u x u y v x v y first row of fig 15 shows the phase averaged flow field of standard cube at height of z 20 mm at the phase angle of φ 0 a small vortex structure with the negative sign has just formed in the upper part of plot y d 0 and a positive large vortex structure is fully developed in the lower part y d 0 as φ increasing the upper vortex develops the size increases and the foci of vortex moves downstream and the lower vortex is compressed gradually and disintegrated at φ 0 75π subsequently at φ π a new small vortex appears in the lower part and the cycle of the spanwise vortices shedding enters the second half it is worth noting that in the plots of φ 0 0 75π a part of negative vorticity separated from the upper main vortex structure moves downstream and its transverse position is about y d 1 which is the vortex structure generated in the previous cycle and shedding from the shear layer for the hch35 cube case in fig 15 second row the development of the spanwise vortex is similar to the standard cube case since there is not direct effect of the hch35 jet at this height similar to the time averaged flow field of fig 4 the foci of spanwise vortex in the hch35 cube wake is further downstream than that in the standard case due to the blowing effect of the hch35 on the other hand it can be found that the vortices shed from the shear layer is closer to the centerline than that without the hch35 jet its transverse position is about y d 1 fig 16 shows the comparison of phase averaged flow field between the standard cube and hch35 cube in the x y plane of z 35 mm and the flow patterns of two cubes are quite different for the standard cube shown in the first row of fig 16 the reverse flow from the upper shear layer can contact the lower shear flow and wrap the entire cube rear surface when φ 0 5π 0 75π which pattern doesn t occur at z 20 mm of fig 15 for the hch35 cube case in fig 16 second row a pair of symmetrical vorticity occurs behind the hch35 outlet and its sign is opposite to the large spanwise vortex on each side due to the pushing or compressing effect of the jet the scale of large vortex at lower side is smaller than that of the standards cube this phenomenon confirms the explanation in section 3 2 1 regarding the occurrence of higher frequency of peak in fig 14 e it implies that the hch35 jet reduces the formation size of the spanwise vortex and thus increases the shedding frequency on the other hand in the spectrum of fig 14 e a lower peak frequency also appears because the hch35 jet obstructs the reversing of flow for instance in the φ 0 5π of fig 16 first row the reversing flow from upper shear layer can reach the lower shear layer and wrap the entire rear surface of cube but in φ 0 5π of fig 16 second row the reversing flow is obstructed by the hch35 jet this effect is similar to the splitter plate placed in the square cylinder wake ogunremi and sumner 2015 splitting the interaction between spanwise vortices of two sides will lengthen the formation of the vortex and thus delay the vortex shedding however it should be pointed out the interaction between the hch35 jet and the cube wake is unstable and the vortex shedding may be influenced by the pushing effect and the obstructing effect simultaneously therefore the spectrum of fig 14 e has spectral characteristics of wider peak band weaker peak energy and two peaks as shown in fig 17 first row the phase averaged development of spanwise vortex for standard cube at z 50 mm is similar to that in figs 15 and 16 but in fig 17 second row due to the curly hch35 jet flowing along positive spanwise direction a pair of small vortices appears behind hch35 outlet when φ 0 0 5π due to the induction effect of the small negative vortex the large positive vortex in the lower side of plots is closer to the centerline y d 0 and they connect to each other thereafter as the large negative vortex on the upper side growing the large positive concentration of vorticity is cut off and convects to downstream therefore the vortex shedding is accelerated due to the inducing effect of the small vortex pair and results in higher peak frequency in the spectrum of fig 14 d it should be pointed out the unstable interaction between the wake and the horizontal jet causes the weak peak energy and multiple peaks shown in fig 14 d 3 3 pod analysis the proper orthogonal decomposition pod provides an advanced method for the mode decomposition of the turbulent flow in terms of the energy content and can extract the important coherent structures efficiently berkooz et al 1993 especially for analyzing the periodic evolution of vortices such as wakes and jet the pod has become an effective tool perrin et al 2006 wang et al 2014 this work employs the snapshot pod to extract the dominate structures in the highly three dimensional and complicated cube wakes the main idea of the pod method is to decompose the velocity signal into two independent parts the coefficient varied with time and the pod modes orthogonal in space berkooz et al 1993 chatterjee 2000 rowley and dawson 2017 the pod modes are constructed with the eigenvectors of the velocity fluctuation autocovariance matrix and are ranked by their energy content then the large scale coherent structures can be extracted by the first few pod modes which carry most of the energy on the other hand some pod modes having low energy representing unordered flow structures and noise can be ignored in the present study the snapshot pod method rowley and dawson 2017 sirovich 1987 based on the streamwise and transverse velocity fluctuations is applied fig 18 shows the energy ratio of each pod mode decomposed from the wakes of the standard and the hch35 cubes according to the previous literatures he et al 2014 kawai et al 2012 qu et al 2017 wang et al 2014 the first two pod modes which are referred to as mode1 and 2 is related to the large scale vortex shedding and the third mode mode3 is related to the symmetrical vortex shedding while other modes are unordered flow structures for the standard cube case in fig 18 the pod mode1 3 account for a relatively large amount of energy in the x y planes of all heights and the subsequent modes account for less than 3 and decrease rapidly in the case of hch35 cube fig 18 the hch jet has different effects on the pod modes at different heights in fig 18 a and b the energy of mode1 3 decreases and the energy of higher order modes increase it indicates that the relatively periodic flow structures are destroyed and the unordered flow structures increase due to the hch jet however it should be pointed out that the decrease of mode1 3 are different for example at z 20 mm fig 18 a the energy of mode1 is reduced from 21 36 of standard cube to 15 43 of hch35 cube reduced by 5 93 but mode3 is only reduced from 8 7 to 6 53 reduced by 2 17 the pod mode at z 35 mm of fig 18 b also has same tendency indicating the hch35 jet suppress the alternant vortex structures more than the symmetrical structures at z 50 mm as shown in fig 18 c the hch35 jet suppresses mode1 and 2 but enhances mode3 indicating the alternant vortex is suppressed and the symmetric vortex structure is enhanced it is found that the pod modes of standard cube case at all heights are similar in fig 18 pod mode1 3 of hch35 cube at z 20 and 35 mm are only weakened but have no other characteristic due to the limited influence of the hch jet so figs 19 21 21 show the decomposed pod mode1 3 of the standard cube and hch35 cube in the x y plane of z 50 mm for mode1 and 2 of the standard cube wake a and b in figs 19 and 20 their distributions have the typical characteristics of the alternating asymmetric vortex he et al 2014 wang et al 2014 i e the pod mode of the streamwise velocity is antisymmetric along the centerline y d 0 and that of the transverse velocity is symmetrical where mode2 is 1 4 period earlier than mode1 mode1 and 2 have undergone some significant changes influenced by the hch35 jet fig 19 c and d fig 20 c and d here the velocity fluctuation becomes irregular such as the negative velocity in figs 19 d and 20 d at the same time the size and intensity are also weakened as shown in fig 20 c these results illustrate the hch35 jet suppresses the large scale vortex structure the mode3 shown in fig 21 is significantly different from mode1 and mode2 for the standard cube fig 21 a and b the distributions of the streamwise velocity and the transverse velocity are symmetric and antisymmetric along y d 0 respectively which is opposite to mode1 and 2 indicating mode3 represents an ordered symmetric vortex structure it is worth noting that the distribution of mode3 is not as regular and smooth as mode1 and 2 because the mode3 occupies less energy and is not the dominant mode in wake fig 21 c and d is the mode3 effected by hch35 jet and its distribution is more concentrated and regular than that of the standard cube this indicates that the jet enhances the mode3 3 4 physical model of the instantaneous wake structure based on discussion above and referring to the physical model of a wall mounted cube wake proposed by larousse et al 1991 the model of instantaneous wake structure of the standard cube and the hch35 cube are proposed and sketched in fig 22 it should be noted that the flow structure in the figure is only schematic and does not follow the actual size and position the model of standard cube wake fig 22 a is characterized by a large alternating arch type vortex for the hch35 cube wake fig 22 b in addition to the large arch type vortex there is also a flow structure behind the cube rear face generated by hch35 jet the arch type vortex in the standard cube wake fig 22 a is formed by interconnecting the spanwise vortices with the transverse vortex different from the schematic representation proposed by larousse et al 1991 which based on the time averaged data the arch type vortex in fig 22 a is asymmetrical distribution along the symmetry plane y d 0 this means the shedding of spanwise vortices or the development of arch type vortex is alternating due to the low ar and the influence of the boundary layer the cube wake is completely dominated by the free end downwash flow and without the upwash flow appearing in the square cylinder wake with ar arcr reported by sakamoto and arie 1983 tanaka and murata 1999 and zhu et al 2017 in addition the pod mode1 3 of the standard cube wake account for about 45 of the total pod energy but that of a finite length square cylinder with ar 3 5 is about 56 wang et al 2014 therefore the organized flow structure symmetric and asymmetric vortices in the cube wake is relatively weaker than higher cylinders due to the influence of the hch35 jet fig 22 b the arch type vortex becomes smaller and farther downstream than that of the standard cube in addition the flow in the reverse zone is quite different from the standard cube due to the hch35 jet after entering the wake the jet deflects upwards and eventually submerges near the cube free end therefore the jet has no direct effect on the height of z 20 mm at z 35 mm the jet plays the pushing and obstructing effect due to the direct injection of streamwise momentum at z 50 mm a pair of small vortices are formed due to the curly hch35 jet and the jet plays the inducing effect for the spanwise vortices due to the hch35 jet plays different effect at different heights the spectra in fig 14 the phase averaged flow field in fig 15 17 and pod modes of fig 18 vary with spanwise height overall the development of the wake vortex is significantly influenced by the hch35 jet resulting in vortices with alternating arranges tend to decrease and symmetrical structures relatively increase at the same time the organized flow structure is relatively weakened and the irregular structure is relatively enhanced as discussed in section 3 3 4 conclusions the comparison between the standard cube and hch cube is investigated experimentally based on piv the following conclusions are drawn 1 due to the influence of the hchs the arch type vortex becomes smaller and moves to downstream the large region of u r m s u in wake is obviously suppressed by the hch and a small region of high u r m s u appears near the hch outlet due to the interaction between the jet and reverse flow the distributions of the reynolds shear stress and tke show that the hch can effectively suppress the development of vortices especially for spanwise vortices in x y planes the hch35 cube exhibits the optimum control character 2 due to the hch35 jet the spectrum at different heights are no longer the single peak pattern appearing in the standard cube wake but higher peak frequency occurs and the peak energy is significantly reduced these phenomena mean that the organized flow structure becomes weaken by the jet and the development of wake vortices are accelerated at heights of z 35 and 50 mm 3 phase averaged results indicate that the development process of the spanwise vortex in near wake is alternating pattern and the hch35 jet deflects upwards after entering wake and eventually submerge in the reverse zone at the height of z 35 mm the hch35 jet interacts directly with the reverse flow and acts as pushing and obstructing effect at z 50 mm a pair of small symmetric vortices appear due to the jet curls which induces the large spanwise vortices and accelerate its shedding 4 the pod analysis indicates the vortices with alternating arrangement are obviously suppressed by the hch the vortices with symmetric arrangement is slightly weakened at height of z 20 and 35 mm and obviously enhanced at z 50 mm credit authorship contribution statement jiawei li

21643,to control the wake flow around a wall mounted cube a passive control method is proposed by drilling a horizontal hole from the front surface to rear surfaces of the cube the controlled and uncontrolled wakes are measured by using particle image velocimetry piv the cube model has a side length of d 70 mm and the diameter of horizontal control hole hch is d 10 mm reynolds number based on side length of cube is r e d 11 550 furthermore to study the positional effect of the hch three kinds of holes with different heights h are used the time averaged statistical characteristics show that the jet generated from the hch reduces the scale of the arch type vortex turbulence intensity reynolds shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy in the wake and enhances the recovery of streamwise velocity among three hchs the hch of h 35 mm has the optimal control effectiveness the analysis of vortex dynamics indicates that the hch jet effectively suppresses the periodic flow structures and accelerates the wake vortex shedding meanwhile the hch jet exhibits different effect on the spanwise vortex at its different heights the pod analysis implies that under the influence of the hch the alternant spanwise vortices are suppressed but symmetric vortices are relatively enhanced keywords passive flow control wall mounted cube wake vortex dynamics piv pod 1 introduction flow around a finite length wall mounted cylinder is a common phenomenon in our daily life and some structures like buildings automobiles offshore structures etc can be simplified to such cylinder on the other hand due to the influence of free end and bottom wall the flow around such cylinder exhibits strongly three dimensional complexity a large number of studies kawamura et al 1984 okamoto and sunabashiri 1992 sakamoto and arie 1983 sumner et al 2004 2017 wang and zhou 2009 indicate that the wake of the wall mounted finite length cylinder is closely related to the aspect ratio of ar h d here h and d represent the cylinder height and the cross sectional characteristic width respectively according to the study of sakamoto and arie 1983 there is a critical aspect ratio arcr when ar arcr the alternating karman vortex exists in most span of the cylinder except near the free end where the kármán vortex is affected by the downwash flow when ar arcr the spanwise vortex in wake changes from alternating kármán vortex to the symmetrical arrangement and the free end downwash flow dominates the near wake at the same time arcr varies according to the wall boundary layer thickness δ and the turbulence intensity of incoming flow and its value is about 2 6 kawamura et al 1984 in general most of the previous research is conducted for the wall mounted cylinder with ar arcr and some corresponding physical models are proposed etzold and fiedler 1976 kawamura et al 1984 wang and zhou 2009 but study for the small ar cylinder especially the wall mounted short square cylinder is very few the cube is a typical short square cylinder of ar 1 due to its small ar the cube wake is greatly influenced by the free end and wall boundary layer castro and robins 1977 conducted a comprehensive study of the wall mounted cube and found that the relation between the boundary layer thickness δ and the horseshoe vortex which enhances the mixing in the cube near wake in addition the flow separation on the cube free end is related to the turbulence level of incoming flow larousse et al 1991 using oil film visualization and surface pressure measurement investigated the flow structure around the cube and proposed a physical model including horseshoe vortex cube side face spanwise vortices free end transverse vortex and the arch type vortex according to hearst et al 2016 the distribution of the reverse bubble around the cube is associated with the boundary layer thickness and the momentum recovery in the wake has a strong correlation with the turbulence intensity of incoming flow on the other hand the flow structure behind cube is highly unstable but little research has been focused on its dynamics for reducing the flow drag and wind noise and controlling diffusion of pollutants many flow control methods of cylinder wake are developed although they are different control approaches their basic idea is to change the flow structure around the cylinder lim and lee 2003 and he et al 2014 delay the surface separation by changing the surface shape of cylinder ogunremi and sumner 2015 and qu et al 2017 respectively use the splitter plate placed in the near wake and the synthetic jet injected from cylinder rear surface to change the development process of the wake vortex however it should be pointed out most of the current research about the flow control is focused on the conditions of infinite length cylinder or wall mounted finite length cylinder with large ar but there are few studies for the short wall mounted cylinder which highlights the present study furthermore most of the above control methods need to modify the model shape obviously or additionally supply energy so their application is limited recently rinoshika proposed a passive control technique in which a horizontal or inclined hole drilling between two surfaces of cylinder is applied to generate suction and blowing around a short circular cylinder rinoshika et al 2017 2018 rinoshika and rinoshika 2018 2019 as a result of rinoshika et al 2017 the inclined control hole effectively suppresses the separation on the free end of cylinder and accelerate the dominate frequency of vortex shedding from the cylinder surface rinoshika and rinoshika 2018 indicates that the jet generated by the horizontal control hole can destroy the wake vortex into smaller scale vortex thereby reducing the recirculation zone and the turbulence intensity on the other hand through comparison between inclined and horizontal control hole rinoshika et al 2018 found that inclined hole increases the areas of high reynolds shear stress and high turbulent kinetic energy tke in wake therefore its control effect is lower than horizontal hole overall these flow control methods are practical for short cylinder because they don t need to supply energy additionally and change the model shape obviously it should be noted that due to the mechanism of cube wake is different from the short circular cylinder wake above control methods have different effectiveness for controlling the cube wake thus motivating the present work in order to control the separation region and vortices of a cube wake a horizontal control hole hch from the front surface to the rear surface of the cube is adopted to induce jet flow the flow structures of a cube wake and the effect of the hch are experimentally studied based on piv measurement in addition the influence of hch position is also considered the time averaged flow field mean vorticity reynolds shear stresses turbulent kinetic energy and the phase averaged flow structures are discussed finally the pod analysis is applied to clarify the dominate flow structures of the hch cube wakes 2 experimental set up and conditions the experiment was conducted in an open water tunnel in beijing university of aeronautics and astronautics china the size of its test section is 700 mm 600 mm 3000 mm height width length and the water depth in this experiment is set as 580 mm the sketch of this experimental set up is given in fig 1 a a cube model having the height h and side length d of 70 mm as shown in fig 1 b is mounted on the central line of the bottom wall at the downstream of 580 mm from the entrance of test section the origin of the coordinate system is set at the center of bottom edge of the cube rear surface the axes x y z are along the streamwise transverse and spanwise or wall normal directions respectively in order to control the cube wake a horizontal controlling hole hch with the diameter of d 10 mm is horizontally drilled from the front surface to the rear surface of the cube for investigating the position effect of the hch on the three dimensional wake three kinds of holes at the spanwise height of h 20 35 and 50 mm h h 0 29 0 5 and 0 71 are used which are respectively close to free end mid span and bottom wall correspondingly the cubes with three holes are referred as the hch20 hch35 and hch50 cubes respectively in addition a standard cube without hch is also used in this experiment for a comparison purpose the blockage ratio of model in the present work is ψ s m s t 0 014 here the s m is the streamwise sectional area of the model and the s t is the sectional area of useful test section and the water depth is more than 8 times cube height therefore it may say that there is no effect of the side wall and free surface of water tunnel on our experimental results fig 1 c illustrates the piv measurement planes the time resolved piv measurement is performed in the x y planes of z 20 35 50 mm and x z plane of y 0 mm a continuous laser with output power of 8w and wavelength of 532 nm is used to illuminate the measurement plane the tracing particles are hollow glass beads with diameter of d p 5 20 μ m and density of ρ p 1 05 g cm a high speed cmos camera with the spatial resolution of 2016 1300 pixels for x y plane or 2016 950 pixels for x z plane is used to capture the particle images which corresponds to view field of 1 8 x d 3 1 1 5 y d 1 5 and 0 z d 1 8 this measurement range includes both the entire region of flow separation and the development of the wake vortex the recording frame rate is 100 fps and the exposure time is 2 ms there are at least 10000 snapshots are recorded for each experimental case to ensure the accuracy of analysis according to previous studies wang and zhou 2009 hearst et al 2016 and our experimental results the strouhal number of square cylinder wake distributes in the range of st 0 11 0 13 the sampling number 10000 sampling time is more than 100s including about 30 cycles of wake vortex and sampling frequency 100hz can satisfy the requirements of data statistical analysis in the piv processing the multi pass iterative lucas kanade milk algorithm is used to analyze the particle images and to obtain the velocity vector fields piv interrogation window size is set as 32 32 pixels with a 50 overlap in this experiment the free stream velocity is set at u 158 mm s the corresponding reynolds number based on the cube side length d is re d u d ν 11550 here ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid this reynolds number is within the range of previous square cylinder wakes wang and zhou 2009 rinoshika and watanabe 2010 hearst et al 2016 in order to evaluate the boundary layer of bottom wall piv is also used to measure its mean streamwise velocity and turbulent intensity profiles fig 2 shows that at the location of the cube the undisturbed boundary layer thickness δ is 17 4 mm δ d 0 25 and the free stream turbulence intensity is less than 1 the measured shape factor h is 1 97 which indicates the turbulent flow regime in the boundary layer relevant properties of the boundary layer are summarized in table 1 3 experimental results and discussion 3 1 statistical characteristics of flow field time averaged streamlines and contours of time averaged streamwise velocity u u in x z plane of y 0 mm for standard cube and hch cubes are shown in fig 3 the area of negative streamwise velocity is surrounded by a white line of u u 0 which represents the reverse zone for the standard cube shown in fig 3 a the flow separated from the leading edge of free end and deflects upward across the free end then the flow descends into the wake causing a strong downwash flow this separated flow wraps the entire free end and near wake at the same time due to the shear flow and the reversed flow a mean small transverse vortex and a large transverse vortex appear above the free end and behind the cube respectively the center of small vortex is located at x d z d 0 26 1 25 and the center of large vortex is located at x d z d 0 75 1 14 the distance from the cube to reattachment point on the bottom wall is usually defined as the recirculation length pattenden et al 2005 in the standard cube wake the reattachment point is at x d 2 12 these results are similar to reports of hussein and martinuzzi 1996 sumner et al 2017 about wall mounted finite length square cylinder however the flow field is different with the short circular cylinder case rinoshika et al 2018 which is characterized by two independent reverse zones above the free end and in near wake respectively difference between two cylinders is mainly due to increased bluffness of the square cylinder fig 3 b d shows the time averaged streamwise velocity and streamlines for the hch cubes in the x z plane of y 0 mm because of blowing from the hch a region of positive streamwise velocity appears near the hch outlets of each hch cubes especially in fig 3 d of hch50 cube where the outlet of hole is near the large transverse vortex the jet penetrates the reverse zone and divides it into a small zone above the free end and in a large zone the reattachment points of the hch20 hch35 and hch50 cases are located at x d 2 22 2 21 and 2 17 respectively and the recirculation lengths are all slightly longer than that of standard cube case this phenomenon is caused by the hch jet which obstructs the reversing flow and blows the wake structure more downstream in addition the hch jet also has influence on the position of the large vortex in the near wake and foci are located at x d z d 0 82 1 09 0 93 1 06 0 86 1 01 in hch20 hch35 and hch50 cases respectively the reverse zones of all hch cubes are smaller than that of the standard cube fig 4 shows the time averaged streamwise velocity and streamlines in the x y planes of z 20 35 and 50 mm while the regions surrounded by white lines in the figure represent the reverse zone as shown in fig 4 a c the flow fields around standard cube are symmetric along the centerline y d 0 two significant shear flows are generated from the front edge of two cube side surfaces the reverse zone also begins with same location and then wraps the entire cube combining with the data of fig 3 a it can be imagined that the separation bubble of cube starts with edges of the front surface and wraps entire cube downstream there are two symmetrical small spanwise vortices near the cube side surface and two symmetrical large spanwise vortices behind the cube due to the downwash flow the length of reverse zone decreases as the spanwise height z increases comparing with the standard cube the flow fields around hch cubes shown in fig 4 d l have some significant changes because of the blowing flow a small regions of positive streamwise velocity appear behind the hch outlets fig 4 f h and j and the absolute values of negative streamwise velocity within reverse zone at all spanwise heights are reduced it can be found that the blowing flow interacts with the recirculating flow and deflect upwards fig 3 b d which results in positive blowing velocity also appears in the x y plane higher than the horizontal hole as shown in fig 4 e and g here a pair of small counter rotating vortices appears which rotating direction is opposite to the large spanwise vortices and suppresses the symmetrical large spanwise vortices according to the works of tanaka and murata 1999 and wang and zhou 2009 the dominate flow structure in a finite length square cylinder wake is an arch type vortex the large spanwise vortex pair in the x y plane fig 4 is the cross section of the legs of arch type vortex and the large transverse vortex in the x z plane fig 3 is the beam as shown in fig 5 a an arch type structure can be clearly identified through connecting the centers of mean wake vortices fig 5 plots the center locations of arch type structure by connecting the vortices foci appearing in different planes figs 3 and 4 in the case of the standard cube the arch type vortex is close to the cube and its size is the largest among the cubes as shown in fig 5 b and c because of the free end downwash flow and bottom wall boundary layer the mean arch type vortex bends upstream near middle spanwise height of cube similar to c shape as indicated in fig 5 b and c the mean arch type vortex influenced by hch jet locates further downstream and its size is relatively reduced in addition their projection on the x z plane is not a c shape but exhibits a tendency that more downstream as spanwise height z fig 6 exhibits the root mean square of streamwise velocity fluctuation u r m s u and time averaged vorticity ω y d u at x z plane of y d 0 for standard cube shown in fig 6 a a shear layer generated from the leading edge of the free end where the ω y d u and the u r m s u reach a significant level above the free end surface which position is the same as the free end vortex shown in fig 3 in the range of about x d 1 2 an accumulation of high u r m s u appears behind the cube which is the location of the large vortex structure in wake in addition on the bottom wall in front of the cubes x d 1 1 6 there are also an accumulation of vorticity and u r m s u due to the horseshoe vortex in the front of cube due to the hch jet fig 6 b d a high u r m s u region and a pair of shear flows appear behind the hch outlet and the larger high u r m s u area caused by large transverse vortex is significantly weakened such reduction in fig 6 c with hch35 cube is most obvious and its u r m s u maximum is reduced from 0 25 of standard cube to 0 21 in the x y planes of the standard cube as shown in fig 7 a c a pair of separation of shear layer are generated symmetrically from the leading edge of two side surfaces of cube and two pairs of high u r m s u accumulations appear outside cube side surfaces and in near wake respectively due to the hch jet intensive turbulence intensity and vorticity appear near the hch outlets shown in fig 7 f h and j at the same time due to the upward deflection of jet the area influenced by hch jet still exist in fig 7 e and g compared with the standard cube of fig 7 a c the intensity and size of the u r m s u accumulation in near wake are significantly reduced by all hch in all spanwise heights and the effectiveness of hch35 is most obvious on the other hand since hch jet blows the large spanwise vortices downstream the contour of ω z d u in hch cases is slightly longer than that of the standard cube the distribution of the mean reynolds shear stress u w u 2 for the standard cube in the x z plane of z d 0 is shown in fig 8 a a large region of negative reynolds shear stress is observed on the free end and the near wake in which upper boundary is the free end shear layer the reynolds shear stress in reverse zone approaches to zero fig 8 b d exhibit the distributions of u w u 2 around hch20 hch35 and hch50 cubes respectively in these cases small regions of positive u w u 2 appear behind all hch outlets and the scale and magnitudes of the accumulation of negative u w u 2 on near wake are slightly reduced among them the suppression of the reynolds shear stress is most obvious under hch50 condition and the maximum decreases from 0 027 of the standard cube to 0 024 fig 9 shows comparison of the reynolds shear stress u v u 2 between the standard cube and the hch cubes in the x y planes of different heights the distributions of u v u 2 in these plots are antisymmetric about the centerline of y d 0 and approximately equal to zero within the reverse zone which are similar to the experiment results of the finite length square cylinder ar 7 reported by wang and zhou 2009 and the short wall mounted cylinder ar 1 reported by rinoshika et al 2017 in the standard cube of fig 9 a c the absolute values of maximum magnitude of u v u 2 are 0 050 0 048 and 0 056 in spanwise height of z 20 35 and 50 mm respectively due to the influence of the hchs the distributions of u v u 2 are obviously different from the standard cube case the concentration of u v u 2 become small and its absolute peak values decrease it indicates that the hch jet suppresses the turbulent fluctuation caused by the separation flow and reduces the reynolds shear stress in the wake among three hch cubes the hch35 cube has optimum efficiency in which absolute peak values of u v u 2 is 0 036 0 037 and 0 034 at spanwise heights of z 20 35 and 50 mm respectively it should be noted that a pair of small antisymmetric concentrations of u v u 2 appear behind hch outlets in reverse zone due to hch jet such as fig 9 e and f it is also found that the suppression effect of hch on the reynolds shear stress u v u 2 in the x y plane is stronger than u w u 2 in the x z plane it indicates the hch jet influences spanwise vortices more than transverse vortices in addition increasing u v u 2 inside reverse zone and decreasing u v u 2 outside reverse zone can reduce drag acting on the cube kim et al 2006 figs 10 13 show distributions of the turbulent kinetic energy tke around cube in different planes in the present study the t k e 0 75 u 2 u 2 w 2 u 2 in the x z planes and t k e 0 75 u 2 u 2 v 2 u 2 in the x y planes are used to analysis the vortical structures and turbulent features lim and lee 2003 fig 10 shows the distributions of tke for different cubes in the x z plane of y 0 mm an evident region of large tke with peak value of 0 082 is observed behind the standard cube fig 10 a in the hch cube cases of fig 10 b d the region of large tke in wake is evidently reduced by hch jet and their peak value are 0 071 0 072 and 0 073 for hch20 hch35 and hch50 respectively however because of the interaction between jet and reverse flow an intensive concentration of tke appears behind each hch outlets as increasing the height of the hch the tke concentration behind the hch outlet decrease as shown in fig 10 b d indicating that the interaction between jet and wake becomes weaker this tendency was also reported in rinoshika and rinoshika 2018 figs 11 13 show the distributions of tke in the x y plane at the different heights where hchs evidently suppress the tke in wake in the standard cube case the distribution of high tke concentrate at height of z 20 mm fig 11 a is symmetrically distributed at both sides of the wake it is obviously different from the x y planes of z 35 and 50 mm figs 12 a and fig 13 a in which their high tke concentrates near the centerline it indicates that the development of spanwise vortices at height of z 20 mm is different from that at other two heights which is mainly due to the boundary layer of bottom wall wang and zhou 2009 in the case of the hch a high concentration of tke are observed near hch outlets and in the rear reverse region as shown in figs 11 b fig 12 c and fig 13 d on the other hand the high concentrations of tke appearing in standard cube are suppressed at three spanwise heights by the hchs and their peak values are summarized in table 2 the decrease of tke may result in the reduction of the drag force acted on the cube lim and lee 2003 it can be found from table 2 that the suppression of tke by the hch jets in the x y plane is more obvious than that in x z plane this phenomenon is similar to reynolds shear stress discussed above and indicates that the hch jet mainly influence the development of spanwise vortices in the x y planes the hch35 suppress the tke by more than 20 at all spanwise heights which is larger than other two hch cubes therefore based on the results of reynolds shear stress and tke the vortex dynamics of the hch35 cube wake in the x y plane will be discussed in the following sections 3 2 wake vortex dynamics 3 2 1 power spectrum analysis the spectral distributions of the streamwise velocity for the standard cube and the hch35 cube are shown in fig 14 the velocity measurement points are selected at x d 1 5 and their transverse position is at the position of the maximum u r m s u as shown in fig 7 fig 14 a c is the standard cube case from high to low span height and fig 14 d f is the hch35 cube case in the same order fig 14 d f the spectra of the standard cube as shown in fig 14 a c exhibit significant frequency peaks the spectrum at the heights of z 35 and 50 mm is the single peak pattern fig 14 a and b and their strouhal numbers of peak are st 0 103 and 0 098 respectively at the height of z 20 mm where is closer to the bottom wall the spectrum has a relatively weaker secondary peak in addition to a main peak and their strouhal numbers is st 0 096 and 0 107 respectively fig 14 c these results indicate the existence of periodic vortex motion in cube wake and the dimensionless frequency is also close to previous studies of the finite square cylinder by hearst et al 2016 wang et al 2009 2017 and vinuesa et al 2015 it is worth noting that the main peak frequency slightly decreases with z increases this phenomenon also occurs in the study of rinoshika and rinoshika 2018 about a short wall mounted circular cylinder and may be influenced by the downwash flow wang and zhou 2009 pointed out that due to the influence of the free end downwash flow and the bottom wall boundary layer the mode of vortex shedding near the two ends of the cylinder is more unstable so the peak energy in fig 14 a and c is lower than that in the mid span position of fig 14 b a second peak appearing in fig 14 c may well be also caused by the unstable shedding of the vortices fig 14 d f is the spectrum of the hch35 cube wake and show a significant different from the standard cube spectra in these plots are not the single peak pattern but become the double peak or multi peak pattern due to the hch jet suppresses the development of spanwise vortex the peak energy decreases in all spanwise height at z 50 and 35 mm shown in fig 14 d and e there is a strouhal number of peak higher than the standard cube case at each height respectively he et al 2014 and rinoshika et al 2018 indicate that the horizontal jet could shorten the scale of the vortex formation causing the vortex shedding frequency increases in addition the reduction of spanwise vortices scale also contributes to the drag reduce because of without direct effect of the hch35 jet the first two peak frequency at z 20 mm fig 14 f is same as standard cube case in which st of peak are still 0 096 and 0 107 but corresponding energy decreases it is worth noting that a third peak with st 0 048 appears in fig 14 f evidently indicating that the wake structure near the bottom wall is more complicated due to the boundary layer wang and zhou 2009 revealed that the symmetrical vortices with longer evolving length and lower frequency have a higher probability in this region at the same time ogunremi and sumner 2015 indicated that the main frequency of a square cylinder wake separated by a splitter plate was reduced from st 1 03 without plate to 0 048 the following discussion of phase averaged flow field section 3 2 2 will illustrate that the effect of the hch jet is like the splitter plate to some extent therefore this third peak of st 0 048 may be caused by the combined effect of the boundary layer and the hch35 jet 3 2 2 phase averaged vortical structures to better understand the evolution of wake structure and the horizontal jet figs 15 17 show the phase averaged wake at different spanwise heights where the first row of each figure represents the standard cube and the second row is the hch35 cube since the development process of spanwise vortices alternate along the centerline of y d 0 only the averaged wake of φ 0 π are shown here the phase averaged wake is obtained based on the cross correlation method as follows the correlation coefficients are first calculated between all frames with a base frame at a certain phase and then the frames corresponding to the correlation peaks are selected finally these selected frames are averaged to produce the averaged flow field at a certain phase angle the coefficient λ c i proposed by zhou et al 1999 is used to identify the spanwise vortices pseudo color in plots λ c i is the imaginary part of the complex eigenvalue of the velocity gradient tensor d u but in present study λ c i is computed from the 2d truncated velocity gradient tensor d 2 given in equation 1 due to the limitation of 2d piv measurement the rotation sense of λ c i depends on the sign of the local vorticity in addition streamlines are also superposed on plots for displaying flow motion at different phase angle 1 d 2 u x u y v x v y first row of fig 15 shows the phase averaged flow field of standard cube at height of z 20 mm at the phase angle of φ 0 a small vortex structure with the negative sign has just formed in the upper part of plot y d 0 and a positive large vortex structure is fully developed in the lower part y d 0 as φ increasing the upper vortex develops the size increases and the foci of vortex moves downstream and the lower vortex is compressed gradually and disintegrated at φ 0 75π subsequently at φ π a new small vortex appears in the lower part and the cycle of the spanwise vortices shedding enters the second half it is worth noting that in the plots of φ 0 0 75π a part of negative vorticity separated from the upper main vortex structure moves downstream and its transverse position is about y d 1 which is the vortex structure generated in the previous cycle and shedding from the shear layer for the hch35 cube case in fig 15 second row the development of the spanwise vortex is similar to the standard cube case since there is not direct effect of the hch35 jet at this height similar to the time averaged flow field of fig 4 the foci of spanwise vortex in the hch35 cube wake is further downstream than that in the standard case due to the blowing effect of the hch35 on the other hand it can be found that the vortices shed from the shear layer is closer to the centerline than that without the hch35 jet its transverse position is about y d 1 fig 16 shows the comparison of phase averaged flow field between the standard cube and hch35 cube in the x y plane of z 35 mm and the flow patterns of two cubes are quite different for the standard cube shown in the first row of fig 16 the reverse flow from the upper shear layer can contact the lower shear flow and wrap the entire cube rear surface when φ 0 5π 0 75π which pattern doesn t occur at z 20 mm of fig 15 for the hch35 cube case in fig 16 second row a pair of symmetrical vorticity occurs behind the hch35 outlet and its sign is opposite to the large spanwise vortex on each side due to the pushing or compressing effect of the jet the scale of large vortex at lower side is smaller than that of the standards cube this phenomenon confirms the explanation in section 3 2 1 regarding the occurrence of higher frequency of peak in fig 14 e it implies that the hch35 jet reduces the formation size of the spanwise vortex and thus increases the shedding frequency on the other hand in the spectrum of fig 14 e a lower peak frequency also appears because the hch35 jet obstructs the reversing of flow for instance in the φ 0 5π of fig 16 first row the reversing flow from upper shear layer can reach the lower shear layer and wrap the entire rear surface of cube but in φ 0 5π of fig 16 second row the reversing flow is obstructed by the hch35 jet this effect is similar to the splitter plate placed in the square cylinder wake ogunremi and sumner 2015 splitting the interaction between spanwise vortices of two sides will lengthen the formation of the vortex and thus delay the vortex shedding however it should be pointed out the interaction between the hch35 jet and the cube wake is unstable and the vortex shedding may be influenced by the pushing effect and the obstructing effect simultaneously therefore the spectrum of fig 14 e has spectral characteristics of wider peak band weaker peak energy and two peaks as shown in fig 17 first row the phase averaged development of spanwise vortex for standard cube at z 50 mm is similar to that in figs 15 and 16 but in fig 17 second row due to the curly hch35 jet flowing along positive spanwise direction a pair of small vortices appears behind hch35 outlet when φ 0 0 5π due to the induction effect of the small negative vortex the large positive vortex in the lower side of plots is closer to the centerline y d 0 and they connect to each other thereafter as the large negative vortex on the upper side growing the large positive concentration of vorticity is cut off and convects to downstream therefore the vortex shedding is accelerated due to the inducing effect of the small vortex pair and results in higher peak frequency in the spectrum of fig 14 d it should be pointed out the unstable interaction between the wake and the horizontal jet causes the weak peak energy and multiple peaks shown in fig 14 d 3 3 pod analysis the proper orthogonal decomposition pod provides an advanced method for the mode decomposition of the turbulent flow in terms of the energy content and can extract the important coherent structures efficiently berkooz et al 1993 especially for analyzing the periodic evolution of vortices such as wakes and jet the pod has become an effective tool perrin et al 2006 wang et al 2014 this work employs the snapshot pod to extract the dominate structures in the highly three dimensional and complicated cube wakes the main idea of the pod method is to decompose the velocity signal into two independent parts the coefficient varied with time and the pod modes orthogonal in space berkooz et al 1993 chatterjee 2000 rowley and dawson 2017 the pod modes are constructed with the eigenvectors of the velocity fluctuation autocovariance matrix and are ranked by their energy content then the large scale coherent structures can be extracted by the first few pod modes which carry most of the energy on the other hand some pod modes having low energy representing unordered flow structures and noise can be ignored in the present study the snapshot pod method rowley and dawson 2017 sirovich 1987 based on the streamwise and transverse velocity fluctuations is applied fig 18 shows the energy ratio of each pod mode decomposed from the wakes of the standard and the hch35 cubes according to the previous literatures he et al 2014 kawai et al 2012 qu et al 2017 wang et al 2014 the first two pod modes which are referred to as mode1 and 2 is related to the large scale vortex shedding and the third mode mode3 is related to the symmetrical vortex shedding while other modes are unordered flow structures for the standard cube case in fig 18 the pod mode1 3 account for a relatively large amount of energy in the x y planes of all heights and the subsequent modes account for less than 3 and decrease rapidly in the case of hch35 cube fig 18 the hch jet has different effects on the pod modes at different heights in fig 18 a and b the energy of mode1 3 decreases and the energy of higher order modes increase it indicates that the relatively periodic flow structures are destroyed and the unordered flow structures increase due to the hch jet however it should be pointed out that the decrease of mode1 3 are different for example at z 20 mm fig 18 a the energy of mode1 is reduced from 21 36 of standard cube to 15 43 of hch35 cube reduced by 5 93 but mode3 is only reduced from 8 7 to 6 53 reduced by 2 17 the pod mode at z 35 mm of fig 18 b also has same tendency indicating the hch35 jet suppress the alternant vortex structures more than the symmetrical structures at z 50 mm as shown in fig 18 c the hch35 jet suppresses mode1 and 2 but enhances mode3 indicating the alternant vortex is suppressed and the symmetric vortex structure is enhanced it is found that the pod modes of standard cube case at all heights are similar in fig 18 pod mode1 3 of hch35 cube at z 20 and 35 mm are only weakened but have no other characteristic due to the limited influence of the hch jet so figs 19 21 21 show the decomposed pod mode1 3 of the standard cube and hch35 cube in the x y plane of z 50 mm for mode1 and 2 of the standard cube wake a and b in figs 19 and 20 their distributions have the typical characteristics of the alternating asymmetric vortex he et al 2014 wang et al 2014 i e the pod mode of the streamwise velocity is antisymmetric along the centerline y d 0 and that of the transverse velocity is symmetrical where mode2 is 1 4 period earlier than mode1 mode1 and 2 have undergone some significant changes influenced by the hch35 jet fig 19 c and d fig 20 c and d here the velocity fluctuation becomes irregular such as the negative velocity in figs 19 d and 20 d at the same time the size and intensity are also weakened as shown in fig 20 c these results illustrate the hch35 jet suppresses the large scale vortex structure the mode3 shown in fig 21 is significantly different from mode1 and mode2 for the standard cube fig 21 a and b the distributions of the streamwise velocity and the transverse velocity are symmetric and antisymmetric along y d 0 respectively which is opposite to mode1 and 2 indicating mode3 represents an ordered symmetric vortex structure it is worth noting that the distribution of mode3 is not as regular and smooth as mode1 and 2 because the mode3 occupies less energy and is not the dominant mode in wake fig 21 c and d is the mode3 effected by hch35 jet and its distribution is more concentrated and regular than that of the standard cube this indicates that the jet enhances the mode3 3 4 physical model of the instantaneous wake structure based on discussion above and referring to the physical model of a wall mounted cube wake proposed by larousse et al 1991 the model of instantaneous wake structure of the standard cube and the hch35 cube are proposed and sketched in fig 22 it should be noted that the flow structure in the figure is only schematic and does not follow the actual size and position the model of standard cube wake fig 22 a is characterized by a large alternating arch type vortex for the hch35 cube wake fig 22 b in addition to the large arch type vortex there is also a flow structure behind the cube rear face generated by hch35 jet the arch type vortex in the standard cube wake fig 22 a is formed by interconnecting the spanwise vortices with the transverse vortex different from the schematic representation proposed by larousse et al 1991 which based on the time averaged data the arch type vortex in fig 22 a is asymmetrical distribution along the symmetry plane y d 0 this means the shedding of spanwise vortices or the development of arch type vortex is alternating due to the low ar and the influence of the boundary layer the cube wake is completely dominated by the free end downwash flow and without the upwash flow appearing in the square cylinder wake with ar arcr reported by sakamoto and arie 1983 tanaka and murata 1999 and zhu et al 2017 in addition the pod mode1 3 of the standard cube wake account for about 45 of the total pod energy but that of a finite length square cylinder with ar 3 5 is about 56 wang et al 2014 therefore the organized flow structure symmetric and asymmetric vortices in the cube wake is relatively weaker than higher cylinders due to the influence of the hch35 jet fig 22 b the arch type vortex becomes smaller and farther downstream than that of the standard cube in addition the flow in the reverse zone is quite different from the standard cube due to the hch35 jet after entering the wake the jet deflects upwards and eventually submerges near the cube free end therefore the jet has no direct effect on the height of z 20 mm at z 35 mm the jet plays the pushing and obstructing effect due to the direct injection of streamwise momentum at z 50 mm a pair of small vortices are formed due to the curly hch35 jet and the jet plays the inducing effect for the spanwise vortices due to the hch35 jet plays different effect at different heights the spectra in fig 14 the phase averaged flow field in fig 15 17 and pod modes of fig 18 vary with spanwise height overall the development of the wake vortex is significantly influenced by the hch35 jet resulting in vortices with alternating arranges tend to decrease and symmetrical structures relatively increase at the same time the organized flow structure is relatively weakened and the irregular structure is relatively enhanced as discussed in section 3 3 4 conclusions the comparison between the standard cube and hch cube is investigated experimentally based on piv the following conclusions are drawn 1 due to the influence of the hchs the arch type vortex becomes smaller and moves to downstream the large region of u r m s u in wake is obviously suppressed by the hch and a small region of high u r m s u appears near the hch outlet due to the interaction between the jet and reverse flow the distributions of the reynolds shear stress and tke show that the hch can effectively suppress the development of vortices especially for spanwise vortices in x y planes the hch35 cube exhibits the optimum control character 2 due to the hch35 jet the spectrum at different heights are no longer the single peak pattern appearing in the standard cube wake but higher peak frequency occurs and the peak energy is significantly reduced these phenomena mean that the organized flow structure becomes weaken by the jet and the development of wake vortices are accelerated at heights of z 35 and 50 mm 3 phase averaged results indicate that the development process of the spanwise vortex in near wake is alternating pattern and the hch35 jet deflects upwards after entering wake and eventually submerge in the reverse zone at the height of z 35 mm the hch35 jet interacts directly with the reverse flow and acts as pushing and obstructing effect at z 50 mm a pair of small symmetric vortices appear due to the jet curls which induces the large spanwise vortices and accelerate its shedding 4 the pod analysis indicates the vortices with alternating arrangement are obviously suppressed by the hch the vortices with symmetric arrangement is slightly weakened at height of z 20 and 35 mm and obviously enhanced at z 50 mm credit authorship contribution statement jiawei li

21644,vessel motions due to the ocean waves contribute to maritime operational safety and efficiency real time prediction of deterministic ship motions in the coming future seconds is essential in decision making when performing motions sensitive activities the long short term memory lstm deep learning model provides a potential way for nonlinear ship motions prediction due to its capability in nonlinearity processing determination of a reasonable dimension of the input vector is critical in training the lstm model conventionally the optimal dimension for the input vector is selected by traversing an empirical preset range hence it suffers both high computational cost and poor adaptation in determining the optimal input vector dimension in the present work an input vector space optimization method is proposed based on the dependence hidden in ship motion records of a sequence taking different correlation expressions into consideration both the impulse response function irf based and auto correlation function acf based techniques are investigated for input vector space optimization numerical simulations are carried out for vilification and comparison purpose the acf technique is better in representing the auto correlation hidden in the stochastic ship motions and the acf based lstm model performs better in both training efficiency and prediction accuracy keywords ship motions real time prediction lstm deep learning model input vector space optimization impulse response function auto correlation function 1 introduction real time prediction of the deterministic vessel motions in the coming future seconds are critical in decision making for performing motion sensitive maritime activities therefore it is extensively studied in various subjects such as ship borne helicopter recovery yang 2013 ship motions active stabilization huang et al 2018 and fire control huang et al 2014 a variety of models have been attempted to achieve real time prediction of vessel motions these models are classified into three types the linear hydrodynamic equations based prediction model classic time series prediction models and the machine learning based prediction models early studies on the real time ship motions prediction were developed based on the linear ship hydrodynamic equations the linear hydrodynamic equations based prediction models for example convolution method based on ship response kernel function kaplan 1965 and state space approaches based on kalman filtering techniques triantafyllou et al 1981 1982 1983 depend on the accuracy ship hydrodynamic coefficients solved in frequency domain however the ship hydrodynamic coefficients are time varying in high sea states and are difficult to obtained in the stochastic sea conditions due to the unknown simulation boundaries therefore their performances are far from expected improvements on real time prediction of ship motions were obtained by using time series analysis time series prediction models are data driven only the ship motions records are required when modeling the auto regressive ar model is one of the most explored huang et al 2014 due to its simplicity and practicability to further improve the prediction accuracy the auto regressive moving average arma model is developed yumori 1981 by using the coming wave records as inputs in addition to the ship motions samples the classic time series models are generally developed based on linear and stationary theories and hence suffer difficulties in nonlinear and non stationary ship motions modeling in addition nielsen et al 2018 proposes a method of ship motion prediction based on auto correlation function without fitting parameters prediction can be made entirely using the acf and a short period 10 30 s of the back dated time series this method achieved good results under different sea conditions in recent years machine learning based prediction models were developed to real time prediction of nonlinear ship motions due to their capability in nonlinearity processing which include neural network method wang et al 1997 fuzzy mathematics method khan et al 2007 and chaos theory method weng et al 2010 etc thanks to the improvements in computer engineering the deep learning techniques were extensively investigated in time series modeling the recurrent neural networks rnn a kind of deep learning techniques is suitable for time series processing it was extensively explored in stock market prediction akita et al 2016 literal translation graves et al 2009 traffic flow forecasting shao et al 2016 chen et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 wind speed forecasting liu et al 2018 etc however the original rnn model suffers gradient explosion and vanish these difficulties are overcome by adding saving and forgetting mechanisms in the neural networks hochreiter et al 1997 gers et al 1999 this kind of model is designated as long short term memory lstm neural networks the lstm model was employed in ship motions time series modeling problems such as deterministic ship motions estimation with wave excitations duan et al 2019 and estimating relative wave direction from in service ship motion measurements mak et al 2019 determination of a reasonable dimension of the input vector is critical in training the lstm model too small dimension of the input vector leads to under fitting as the relations between the inputs and outputs are not well modeled in contrast too large dimension of the input vector results in over fitting and higher computational cost the determination of input vector dimension is similar to the order selection in classic time series models identification the training residuals with respects to model orders in a preset range need to be calculated then the optimal order is selected by applying the information criteria such as aic akaike 1974 and bic akaike 1979 principles on the training residuals it suffers both high computational cost and poor adaptation in determining the optimal model order duan et al 2015 inspired by the memory effects hidden in the ship motions time series duan et al 2015 addressed an impulsive response function irf based order selection technique for the ar model identification both computational efficiency and robustness were obviously improved the optimal input vector space selection or determine the number of past time samples included for predicting ahead of time for the lstm model faces the same difficulties as the conventional time series models order determination therefore we hope to find an efficient highly adaptive and more accurate method to determine the input vector space of the lstm model used for the prediction of the ship motion time series or estimate the optimum number of samples to be included in the present work an input vector space optimization method is proposed based on the dependence hidden in ship motion records of a sequence by taking different correlation expressions into consideration both the impulse response function irf based and auto correlation function acf based techniques are investigated for input vector space optimization numerical simulations are carried out for verification and comparison purpose the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the methodology for lstm deep learning network formulations for the proposed auto correlation based input vector space optimization techniques are given in section 3 in section 4 results and discussion are presented the effect of the acf function in input vector space optimization is analyzed finally section 5 summarizes the concluding remarks of the present research work 2 methodology for lstm deep learning network the rnn model is a deep learning technique designed to solve time sequence modeling problems it is capable of solving nonlinear time series problems when training the rnn model we will expand the recurrent layer in the model into a fully connected layer with the same weight the number of steps in the input feature needs to be the same as the number of layers in the recurrent layer we call it the characteristic memory length or the length of the feature input on the time axis when the memory length is too long the training efficiency of the model will decrease at the same time vanish gradient and exploding gradient will inevitably occur during the training process this means that the rnn model cannot handle the problem when those input features have a long memory length in order to meet the needs of practical problems some researchers have created long short term memory network models lstm lstm neuron structure is based on the self recurrent structure of the rnn model different from the traditional rnn model the lstm model constructs a stable state stream during data self looping and control the state of neurons at each moment through an update structure with input gate forget gate and output gate neurons remember the input of the previous moment through the state of the cell the existence of the update structure transforms the relationship between the output of the current moment and the output of the previous moment from a composite function to a linear superposition of multiple independent functions this can reduce the possibility of vanish gradient or exploding gradient in the process of solving the gradient for a time series x x 1 x 2 x n traditional rnn neurons as shown in fig 1 calculate a state sequence h h 1 h 2 h n and an output sequence y y 1 y 2 y n their calculation process can be expressed as 1 h n f w x h x n w h h h n 1 b h 2 y ϕ w h y h b y in the formula w represents the weight matrix b represents the offset vector and f represents the activation function the lstm model replaces the rnn neurons in hidden layer with lstm neurons which will empower the model for long term memory the most widely used lstm model structure is shown in fig 2 in this structure i f o c represent the input gate the forgetting gate the output gate and the cell state respectively where tanh is the hyperbolic tangent activation function the input gate the forgetting gate and the output gate are shown as equation 3 5 3 i n σ w x i x n w h i h n 1 b i 4 f n σ w x f x n w h f h n 1 b f 5 o n σ w x o x n w h o h n 1 b o for lstm neuron status c it is shown in equation 6 6 c n f n c n 1 i n tanh w x c x n w h c h n 1 b c for lstm neuron hidden state h it is shown in equation 7 7 h n o n tanh c n w is the weight coefficient matrix b is the offset vector σ is the activation function correspondingly c n and h n respectively represent the cell state and hidden state of the lstm structure in the nth time step among them the maximum n will not exceed our preset input vector space of feature an rnn neural network is usually composed of several rnn layers and the last fully connected layer the lstm network will use the lstm layer to replace the rnn layer after the lstm structure completes the sequence feature extraction these features will be input into a fully connected layer for processing to obtain the final output of the entire neural network as shown in equation 8 8 y ϕ w h y h b y y is a vector and its dimension is determined when designing the network when the lstm model is applied to ship motion prediction it represents all predicted future ship motion like all neural network models the initialization neurons parameters of the lstm neural network and rnn neural network are randomly generated it uses the data of the training set to calculate the loss function and based on the bptt algorithm boden 2002 to reverse solve the gradient and then adjust the model neurons parameters according to the gradient until convergence gers et al 1999 pointed out that the existence of the forget gate structure avoids the vanishing gradient caused by the continuous product in the process of solving the weight matrix gradient in the lstm model 3 auto correlation based input vector space optimization techniques 3 1 the impulsive response function different with time series of traffic flow and stock price etc ship motions time series have obvious memory effects the memory effects are consequences of the radiated waves result from the ship motions and their scattering of incident waves this means the waves generated by the ship motions will persist and affect subsequent ship motions that is the present ship motion is related to the past ship motion records under the linear theoretical assumptions the memory effects of ship motions can be reasonably modeled by using the impulsive response function irf cummins 1962 liapis 1986 the magnitudes of the irf represent the effects of the past ship motions on the present ship motions in order to model the ship motions memory effects the ship is regarded as a linear system the ship motions are inputs while the hydrodynamic forces on the ship induced by the motions are outputs the ship motions equations using the irf are described as the following forms cummins 1962 liapis 1986 9 j 1 6 m j k m j k η j 0 t h j k t τ η j τ d τ d j k η j f k t k 1 6 where m jk and m jk are the inertial mass matrix and added mass matrix of the ship f k t are time varying generalized external forces including the incident wave force diffraction force etc h jk τ are irfs that represents the memory effects of ship motion the indices jk represents the contribution of the j th mode impulsive velocity of ship motion in irf respect to the k th mode the t and τ represent the current time and the length of time back from the current time under the assumption that each degree of freedom of motion is independent the equation for ship motion with memory effects in one degree of freedom can be modeled using a generalized form as shown in eq 10 10 m m η t t h τ η t τ d τ d η t f t where η t η t and η t represent the ship motion displacement velocity and acceleration respectively the inertial mass and added mass are respectively designated as m and m f t is the external force acting on the ship while d is the hydrostatic restoring coefficient h τ is irf that related to the degree of freedom motion η t firstly we defines a differential operators 11 δ η η n η n 1 subsequently the ship motion equation in 10 can be discretized into finite terms eq 10 is reformulated as 12 δ 2 η n δ t 2 h 1 δ η n δ t h 2 δ η n 1 δ t h l δ η n l 1 δ t d η f n 13 1 δ t 2 η n 2 η n 1 η n 2 h 1 δ t η n η n 1 h l δ t η n l 1 η n l d η n f n collecting the terms equation 13 becomes 14 1 h 1 δ t d δ t 2 η n h 2 δ t h 1 δ t 2 η n 1 h l δ t h l 1 δ t η n l 1 h l δ t δ η n l f n δ t 2 let 15 ϕ 1 1 h 1 δ t c δ t 2 ϕ 2 h 2 δ t h 1 δ t 2 ϕ 3 1 h 3 δ t h 2 δ t ϕ 4 h 4 δ t h 3 δ t ϕ l h l δ t h l 1 δ t ϕ l 1 h l δ t replacing the terms of equation 15 using simple forms in equation 14 we can obtain 16 ϕ 1 η n ϕ 2 η n 1 ϕ 3 η n 2 ϕ l η n l 1 ϕ l 1 η n l f n as shown in 16 it is suggested that the ship motion in ocean wave is an ar process it may be modeled using ar model with an order of p designated as ar p discrete process of the ship motion equation as shown in 15 indicates that the model order p to model the ship model depends on the convolution of 0 h τ x t τ d τ ship impulse response function can be calculated in the time or frequency domain since it is difficult to solve the impulse response function in the time domain we use the kramers konig relations to solve it in the frequency domain as shown in 17 17 h j k τ 2 π 0 ω e m j k ω e a j k ω e 1 ω e d j k sin ω e τ d ω e ω e is the encounter frequency example in fig 3 presents the irf of heave from which it is found that the strength of memory effect h τ decreases as time variable τ increases and is close to zero among them t and τ represent the current time and the length of time back from the current time obviously the value of the ship motion impulse response function tends to 0 gradually as the distance increases and the value of the impulse response function is related to the added mass coefficients damping coefficients hydrodynamic restoring coefficient and encounter frequency therefore the ship impulse response function of known ship type and working condition can be calculated by hydrodynamic method according to the impulse response function curve it is close to zero infinitely when τ exceeds the threshold value τ 0 if the sampling interval of the ship s motion time series is δ t then we can get the time length of the model input p which is 18 p τ 0 δ t 3 2 the auto correlation function correlation coefficient is an important concept in time series analysis we use auto covariance k x τ e x t x t τ to quantify the degree of correlation between values at different times in a time series but the value of the auto covariance is related to the value of the two points that are related to each other therefore we need to use the dimensionless auto covariance to represent the correlation of time series as shown in formula 19 19 r x τ k x τ k x 0 r x m x 2 σ x 2 we call r x τ the auto correlation function acf of time series x t and use it to represent the degree of correlation between any two points with the same time interval there may be a positive or negative correlation between the two points in which the smaller the absolute value of the value of x the weaker the correlation between the two points nielsen et al 2018 point out that using directly the time series to calculate the autocorrelation function may cause the acf curve fails to damp out according to expectation considering that the ship motion prediction model usually based on the time series method requires an input time series length not exceeding 50 s the slight oscillation of the acf curve not more than 0 25 at this length of time will not affect its accuracy in determining the input vector space in addition nielsen et al 2018 proposed a method of using the response spectrum to calculate the auto correlation function this is an interesting idea and seems to be able to better guarantee the convergence of the acf curve generally as τ grows the absolute value of r x τ tends to decrease which means that the degree of correlation between the two is weakening when the absolute value of r x τ is small enough we can believe that there is no correlation between the two points therefore there is a τ 0 and r so for any τ τ 0 there is always r x τ r x τ 0 we call τ 0 the related time of the time series 4 results and discussion 4 1 brief descriptions of the nonlinear ship motions in this paper we use the numerical simulation motion data of the s175 container ship the corresponding sea conditions are the sea state 4 and the sea state 5 in order to reflect the non linearity of the actual sea condition the gn numerical model is used to generate the wave duration based on the generated wave duration nonlinear time domain simulation method can be used to generate ship motion data the equations of motion for ship heave and

β e 2 a z a z n m n z n m 1 d z the total duration of motion data is 7998 s and the sampling interval is 0 5 s for each set of data we use the first 7498 s data as a train set to generate model and use the remaining data as a test set to measure the performance of the model main particulars of s175 container ship are presented in table 1 and the partial ship motion time series under different sea states are shown in figs 4 7 4 2 the effects of the input vector space on the prediction accuracy we use the lstm model to predict the motion of the s175 container ship model has a hidden layer and the number of units in the lstm layer is 20 the optimizer used by the model is adam kingma et al 2015 and we set the activator parameter to learning rate 0 001 beta 1 0 9 beta 2 0 999 epsilon 1 10 8 in addition the model sets batch size to 64 and epoch to 3000 and uses the mean square error as the loss function starting with a smaller value we train a series models which feature with different sizes of the input vector space as input until the model results show a significant deterioration trend and we use these models to predict the heave and pitch motion of the s175 container ship after 5 s under the condition of sea state 5 and sea state 6 the root mean square error between the motion pre diction value and the real value obtained by the model are calculated separately the result is shown in fig 8 and table 2 the prediction error of traditional auto regressive model for short term prediction for ship motion generally decreases with the increase of the input vector space of model input features and finally stabilizes akaike et al 1979 from the results of the calculation it is known that the lstm model is different from the auto regressive model as the input vector space of model input features increases the related information received by the model increases which makes the prediction error of the model gradually decrease until a threshold after exceeding this threshold as the input vector space of model input features increases the model begins to accept more and more irrelevant input information the input of irrelevant information causes the model to try to approximate the random noise which leads to a decrease in the generalization ability of the model and makes the prediction error of the model in the test set begin to increase in order to verify our conclusion we have designed ship heave motion prediction models with different advance prediction times t p and compare the results of models with different input vector space of model input features the result is shown in fig 9 and table 3 the new calculation results are in line with our conclusions when we use the lstm model to predict ship motion there is a certain optimal value for the input vector space of model input features this optimum value is related to the working conditions of the ship motion but not related to the forecast time 4 3 optimized input vector space by the auto correlation based techniques 4 3 1 the irf based optimization technique we calculated all the impulse response function of the s175 container ship and normalized the results in all impulse response functions h 33 and h 35 are related to the ship heave motion and h 53 and h 55 are related to the ship pitch motion as τ increases the normalized impulse response function drops rapidly and eventually converges at 0 considering the existence of calculation errors we believe that when ϵ 0 01 it can be determined that the impulse response function has converged the maximum convergence time of the relevant impulse response function is used to determine the input vector space of model input features of the model the result is shown in fig 10 and table 4 4 3 2 the acf based optimization technique for the heave and pitch motion of the s175 container ship under the condition of sea state 5 and sea state 6 we tried to calculate acf using data with different window length interestingly when the window length is large enough such as 3000s the acf curve does not change significantly with the change of the window length and when the window length is too small as the calculated window length changes the acf curve will change significantly the acf of the heave motion of the s175 container ship under the sea state 5 calculated by different window lengths is shown in fig 11 in the following content we use all training set data 7498s to calculate the auto correlation function of the motion time series and used to determine the input vector space of the model under different sea conditions we believe that when the correlation coefficient of the time series is less than 0 5 it can be concluded that there is no enough correlation between the two considering the existence of calculation errors we believe that when r 0 45 it can be determined that the correlation coefficient is small enough the minimum time that the correlation coefficient is not above this value is used to determine the input vector space of model input features of the model the result is shown in fig 12 and table 5 4 4 predicted time series results by the irf and acf based optimization techniques according to the calculation results in 4 3 we use the impulse response function and the auto correlation function to determine the input vector space of the short term prediction model for ship motion in table 4 the memory length of the impulse response function of the s175 container ship is 14 4s and 13 9s and in table 5 the correlation length of the auto correlation function of the s175 container ship is 20s 16 5s 15s and 13 9s since the sampling interval of the time series is 0 5 we can determine the input vector space of the model based on the memory time obtained by the two methods in section 4 2 of the paper we compared the calculation error of models with different input vector spaces that is parameter traversal methods and obtained the best input vector space in each dataset we can verify the accuracy of the obtained input vector space length by comparing them with the best value obtained by parameter traversal the results are shown in table 6 and based on the input vector space determined by the two methods we also completed the training of the lstm model and compared the prediction error the result is shown in fig 13 and table 7 from the results in tables 4 6 we find that two different input vector space determination methods can efficiently determine the input vector space of the model at a value close to the optimal threshold but the performance of the model based on the determination method of the autocorrelation function tends to be better 5 conclusions deep learning neural networks are capable in processing nonlinear dynamic the lstm deep learning model provides a potential way for nonlinear ship motions prediction it is critical to determine an optimal input vector dimension when training a lstm model conventional method suffers both high computational cost and poor adaptation difficulties as it selects the optimal dimension by traversing an empirical preset range the present work proposes an input vector space optimization method based on the dependence hidden in ship motion records of a sequence both the impulse response function irf based and auto correlation function acf based techniques are investigated for input vector space optimization numerical simulations are carried out for vilification and comparison concluding remarks are made as follows when keeping the other hyper parameters constant prediction rms of the lstm model increases and subsequently decreases as the input vector dimension grows simulation results under various sea condition consistently suggest that global optimum can be found in the prediction rms functions the optimal input vector dimension is obtained based on the global optimum where the prediction rms is the least compared to the conventional method the proposed ship motion memory effects based input vector space optimization method provide a direct effective and more efficient way both the irf and the acf techniques produce reasonable results which highly agree with the optimal input vector dimension for example the optimal input vector dimension with respect to the least prediction rms is 35 the selected dimensions based on the irf and the acf techniques are 28 and 33 respectively in addition comparison study is also carried out it is found that the irf and acf techniques perform equivalently in training efficiency while the acf technique is better in prediction accuracy as shown in table 7 the prediction rmss of the acf based lstm model are smaller under various sea states it results from that the memory effects of the nonlinear ship motions have nonlinearity while the irfs are calculated based on linear hydrodynamic approach the irf technique is not capable in exactly representing the auto correlations hidden in nonlinear ship motions in contrast the acf technique is data driven and without linear theoretical assumption it calculates the auto correlation measures by using the nonlinear ship motion time series hence acf technique can describe the nonlinear memory effects in ship motion more precisely and therefore performs better in input vector space optimization in summary the proposed input vector space optimization method

21644,vessel motions due to the ocean waves contribute to maritime operational safety and efficiency real time prediction of deterministic ship motions in the coming future seconds is essential in decision making when performing motions sensitive activities the long short term memory lstm deep learning model provides a potential way for nonlinear ship motions prediction due to its capability in nonlinearity processing determination of a reasonable dimension of the input vector is critical in training the lstm model conventionally the optimal dimension for the input vector is selected by

ship motions real time prediction lstm deep learning model input vector space optimization impulse response function auto correlation function 1 introduction real time prediction of the deterministic vessel motions in the coming future seconds are critical in decision making for performing motion sensitive maritime activities therefore it is extensively studied in various subjects such as ship borne helicopter recovery yang 2013 ship motions active stabilization huang et al 2018 and fire control huang et al 2014 a variety of models have been attempted to achieve real time prediction of vessel motions these models are classified into three types the linear hydrodynamic equations based prediction model classic time series prediction models and the machine learning based prediction models early studies on the real time ship motions prediction were developed based on the linear ship hydrodynamic equations the linear hydrodynamic equations based prediction models for example convolution method based on ship response kernel function kaplan 1965 and state space approaches based on kalman filtering techniques triantafyllou et al 1981 1982 1983 depend on the accuracy ship hydrodynamic coefficients solved in frequency domain however the ship hydrodynamic coefficients are time varying in high sea states and are difficult to obtained in the stochastic sea conditions due to the unknown simulation boundaries therefore their performances are far from expected improvements on real time prediction of ship motions were obtained by using time series analysis time series prediction models are data driven only the ship motions records are required when modeling the auto regressive ar model is one of the most explored huang et al 2014 due to its simplicity and practicability to further improve the prediction accuracy the auto regressive moving average arma model is developed yumori 1981 by using the coming wave records as inputs in addition to the ship motions samples the classic time series models are generally developed based on linear and stationary theories and hence suffer difficulties in nonlinear and non stationary ship motions modeling in addition nielsen et al 2018 proposes a method of ship motion prediction based on auto correlation function without fitting parameters prediction can be made entirely using the acf and a short period 10 30 s of the back dated time series this method achieved good results under different sea conditions in recent years machine learning based prediction models were developed to real time prediction of nonlinear ship motions due to their capability in nonlinearity processing which include neural network method wang et al 1997 fuzzy mathematics method khan et al 2007 and chaos theory method weng et al 2010 etc thanks to the improvements in computer engineering the deep learning techniques were extensively investigated in time series modeling the recurrent neural networks rnn a kind of deep learning techniques is suitable for time series processing it was extensively explored in stock market prediction akita et al 2016 literal translation graves et al 2009 traffic flow forecasting shao et al 2016 chen et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 wind speed forecasting liu et al 2018 etc however the original rnn model suffers gradient explosion and vanish these difficulties are overcome by adding saving and forgetting mechanisms in the neural networks hochreiter et al 1997 gers et al 1999 this kind of model is designated as long short term memory lstm neural networks the lstm model was employed in ship motions time series modeling problems such as deterministic ship motions estimation with wave excitations duan et al 2019 and estimating relative wave direction from in service ship motion measurements mak et al 2019 determination of a reasonable dimension of the input vector is critical in training the lstm model too small dimension of the input vector leads to under fitting as the relations between the inputs and outputs are not well modeled in contrast too large dimension of the input vector results in over fitting and higher computational cost the determination of input vector dimension is similar to the order selection in classic time series models identification the training residuals with respects to model orders in a preset range need to be calculated then the optimal order is selected by applying the information criteria such as aic akaike 1974 and bic akaike 1979 principles on the training residuals it suffers both high computational cost and poor adaptation in determining the optimal model order duan et al 2015 inspired by the memory effects hidden in the ship motions time series duan et al 2015 addressed an impulsive response function irf based order selection technique for the ar model identification both computational efficiency and robustness were obviously improved the optimal input vector space selection or determine the number of past time samples included for predicting ahead of time for the lstm model faces the same difficulties as the conventional time series models order determination therefore we hope to find an efficient highly adaptive and more accurate method to determine the input vector space of the lstm model used for the prediction of the ship motion time series or estimate the optimum number of samples to be included in the present work an input vector space optimization method is proposed based on the dependence hidden in ship motion records of a sequence by taking different correlation expressions into consideration both the impulse response function irf based and auto correlation function acf based techniques are investigated for input vector space optimization numerical simulations are carried out for verification and comparison purpose the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the methodology for lstm deep learning network formulations for the proposed auto correlation based input vector space optimization techniques are given in section 3 in section 4 results and discussion are presented the effect of the acf function in input vector space optimization is analyzed finally section 5 summarizes the concluding remarks of the present research work 2 methodology for lstm deep learning network the rnn model is a deep learning technique designed to solve time sequence modeling problems it is capable of solving nonlinear time series problems when training the rnn model we will expand the recurrent layer in the model into a fully connected layer with the same weight the number of steps in the input feature needs to be the same as the number of layers in the recurrent layer we call it the characteristic memory length or the length of the feature input on the time axis when the memory length is too long the training efficiency of the model will decrease at the same time vanish gradient and exploding gradient will inevitably occur during the training process this means that the rnn model cannot handle the problem when those input features have a long memory length in order to meet the needs of practical problems some researchers have created long short term memory network models lstm lstm neuron structure is based on the self recurrent structure of the rnn model different from the traditional rnn model the lstm model constructs a stable state stream during data self looping and control the state of neurons at each moment through an update structure with input gate forget gate and output gate neurons remember the input of the previous moment through the state of the cell the existence of the update structure transforms the relationship between the output of the current moment and the output of the previous moment from a composite function to a linear superposition of multiple independent functions this can reduce the possibility of vanish gradient or exploding gradient in the process of solving the gradient for a time series x x 1 x 2 x n traditional rnn neurons as shown in fig 1 calculate a state sequence h h 1 h 2 h n and an output sequence y y 1 y 2 y n their calculation process can be expressed as 1 h n f w x h x n w h h h n 1 b h 2 y ϕ w h y h b y in the formula w represents the weight matrix b represents the offset vector and f represents the activation function the lstm model replaces the rnn neurons in hidden layer with lstm neurons which will empower the model for long term memory the most widely used lstm model structure is shown in fig 2 in this structure i f o c represent the input gate the forgetting gate the output gate and the cell state respectively where tanh is the hyperbolic tangent activation function the input gate the forgetting gate and the output gate are shown as equation 3 5 3 i n σ w x i x n w h i h n 1 b i 4 f n σ w x f x n w h f h n 1 b f 5 o n σ w x o x n w h o h n 1 b o for lstm neuron status c it is shown in equation 6 6 c n f n c n 1 i n tanh w x c x n w h c h n 1 b c for lstm neuron hidden state h it is shown in equation 7 7 h n o n tanh c n w is the weight coefficient matrix b is the offset vector σ is the activation function correspondingly c n and h n respectively represent the cell state and hidden state of the lstm structure in the nth time step among them the maximum n will not exceed our preset input vector space of feature an rnn neural network is usually composed of several rnn layers and the last fully connected layer the lstm network will use the lstm layer to replace the rnn layer after the lstm structure completes the sequence feature extraction these features will be input into a fully connected layer for processing to obtain the final output of the entire neural network as shown in equation 8 8 y ϕ w h y h b y y is a vector and its dimension is determined when designing the network when the lstm model is applied to ship motion prediction it represents all predicted future ship motion like all neural network models the initialization neurons parameters of the lstm neural network and rnn neural network are randomly generated it uses the data of the training set to calculate the loss function and based on the bptt algorithm boden 2002 to reverse solve the gradient and then adjust the model neurons parameters according to the gradient until convergence gers et al 1999 pointed out that the existence of the forget gate structure avoids the vanishing gradient caused by the continuous product in the process of solving the weight matrix gradient in the lstm model 3 auto correlation based input vector space optimization techniques 3 1 the impulsive response function different with time series of traffic flow and stock price etc ship motions time series have obvious memory effects the memory effects are consequences of the radiated waves result from the ship motions and their scattering of incident waves this means the waves generated by the ship motions will persist and affect subsequent ship motions that is the present ship motion is related to the past ship motion records under the linear theoretical assumptions the memory effects of ship motions can be reasonably modeled by using the impulsive response function irf cummins 1962 liapis 1986 the magnitudes of the irf represent the effects of the past ship motions on the present ship motions in order to model the ship motions memory effects the ship is regarded as a linear system the ship motions are inputs while the hydrodynamic forces on the ship induced by the motions are outputs the ship motions equations using the irf are described as the following forms cummins 1962 liapis 1986 9 j 1 6 m j k m j k η j 0 t h j k t τ η j τ d τ d j k η j f k t k 1 6 where m jk and m jk are the inertial mass matrix and added mass matrix of the ship f k t are time varying generalized external forces including the incident wave force diffraction force etc h jk τ are irfs that represents the memory effects of ship motion the indices jk represents the contribution of the j th mode impulsive velocity of ship motion in irf respect to the k th mode the t and τ represent the current time and the length of time back from the current time under the assumption that each degree of freedom of motion is independent the equation for ship motion with memory effects in one degree of freedom can be modeled using a generalized form as shown in eq 10 10 m m η t t h τ η t τ d τ d η t f t where η t η t and η t represent the ship motion displacement velocity and acceleration respectively the inertial mass and added mass are respectively designated as m and m f t is the external force acting on the ship while d is the hydrostatic restoring coefficient h τ is irf that related to the degree of freedom motion η t firstly we defines a differential operators 11 δ η η n η n 1 subsequently the ship motion equation in 10 can be discretized into finite terms eq 10 is reformulated as 12 δ 2 η n δ t 2 h 1 δ η n δ t h 2 δ η n 1 δ t h l δ η n l 1 δ t d η f n 13 1 δ t 2 η n 2 η n 1 η n 2 h 1 δ t η n η n 1 h l δ t η n l 1 η n l d η n f n collecting the terms equation 13 becomes 14 1 h 1 δ t d δ t 2 η n h 2 δ t h 1 δ t 2 η n 1 h l δ t h l 1 δ t η n l 1 h l δ t δ η n l f n δ t 2 let 15 ϕ 1 1 h 1 δ t c δ t 2 ϕ 2 h 2 δ t h 1 δ t 2 ϕ 3 1 h 3 δ t h 2 δ t ϕ 4 h 4 δ t h 3 δ t ϕ l h l δ t h l 1 δ t ϕ l 1 h l δ t replacing the terms of equation 15 using simple forms in equation 14 we can obtain 16 ϕ 1 η n ϕ 2 η n 1 ϕ 3 η n 2 ϕ l η n l 1 ϕ l 1 η n l f n as shown in 16 it is suggested that the ship motion in ocean wave is an ar process it may be modeled using ar model with an order of p designated as ar p discrete process of the ship motion equation as shown in 15 indicates that the model order p to model the ship model depends on the convolution of 0 h τ x t τ d τ ship impulse response function can be calculated in the time or frequency domain since it is difficult to solve the impulse response function in the time domain we use the kramers konig relations to solve it in the frequency domain as shown in 17 17 h j k τ 2 π 0 ω e m j k ω e a j k ω e 1 ω e d j k sin ω e τ d ω e ω e is the encounter frequency example in fig 3 presents the irf of heave from which it is found that the strength of memory effect h τ decreases as time variable τ increases and is close to zero among them t and τ represent the current time and the length of time back from the current time obviously the value of the ship motion impulse response function tends to 0 gradually as the distance increases and the value of the impulse response function is related to the added mass coefficients damping coefficients hydrodynamic restoring coefficient and encounter frequency therefore the ship impulse response function of known ship type and working condition can be calculated by hydrodynamic method according to the impulse response function curve it is close to zero infinitely when τ exceeds the threshold value τ 0 if the sampling interval of the ship s motion time series is δ t then we can get the time length of the model input p which is 18 p τ 0 δ t 3 2 the auto correlation function correlation coefficient is an important concept in time series analysis we use auto covariance k x τ e x t x t τ to quantify the degree of correlation between values at different times in a time series but the value of the auto covariance is related to the value of the two points that are related to each other therefore we need to use the dimensionless auto covariance to represent the correlation of time series as shown in formula 19 19 r x τ k x τ k x 0 r x m x 2 σ x 2 we call r x τ the auto correlation function acf of time series x t and use it to represent the degree of correlation between any two points with the same time interval there may be a positive or negative correlation between the two points in which the smaller the absolute value of the value of x the weaker the correlation between the two points nielsen et al 2018 point out that using directly the time series to calculate the autocorrelation function may cause the acf curve fails to damp out according to expectation considering that the ship motion prediction model usually based on the time series method requires an input time series length not exceeding 50 s the slight oscillation of the acf curve not more than 0 25 at this length of time will not affect its accuracy in determining the input vector space in addition nielsen et al 2018 proposed a method of using the response spectrum to calculate the auto correlation function this is an interesting idea and seems to be able to better guarantee the convergence of the acf curve generally as τ grows the absolute value of r x τ tends to decrease which means that the degree of correlation between the two is weakening when the absolute value of r x τ is small enough we can believe that there is no correlation between the two points therefore there is a τ 0 and r so for any τ τ 0 there is always r x τ r x τ 0 we call τ 0 the related time of the time series 4 results and discussion 4 1 brief descriptions of the nonlinear ship motions in this paper we use the numerical simulation motion data of the s175 container ship the corresponding sea conditions are the sea state 4 and the sea state 5 in order to reflect the non linearity of the actual sea condition the gn numerical model is used to generate the wave duration based on the generated wave duration nonlinear time domain simulation method can be used to generate ship motion data the equations of motion for ship heave and pitch can be expressed as follows 20 m μ 33 η 3 b 33 η 3 0 t k 33 t τ η 3 d τ c 33 η 3 μ 35 η 5 b 35 η 5 0 t k 35 t τ η 5 d τ c 35 η 5 f 3 i s f 3 d f 3 s l a m min g m g 21 i y y μ 55 η 5 b 55 η 5 0

of inertia of the ship over the center of gravity μ 33 μ 55 μ 35 μ 53 are the high frequency additional mass coefficient for the heave and pitch of ship motion b 33 b 55 b 35 b 53 are the high frequency damping coefficient for ship motions c33 c35 c53 c55 are the coefficient of restoring force in the direction of heave and pitch of ship motions k 33 k 55 k 35 k 53 are the impulse response functions of radiation force in the direction of heave and pitch of ship motions the f i s on the right side of the equation represents the resultant forces of incident wave force and hydrostatic recovery force f d and f s l a m min g are diffraction force and slamming force when the incident wave and hydrostatic pressure p i s are integrated on the instantaneous wet surface of the ship the non linear incident wave force and hydrostatic recovery force can be expressed as follow 22 f s t p i s n d s 23 m s t p i s r g n d s for the non linear incident wave force and hydrostatic restoring force the incident wave and hydrostatic pressure in integral formula is the basis of the whole accurate calculation process according to the derivation of zhao et al 2015 the pressure at any point in the gn wave model can be written as follow 24 p ρ g β z n 0 k w n t t 1 n n 0 k m 0 k u m w n x t 2 n m n 0 k m 0 k w m w n t 4 n m 25 t 1 n z β e a z z n 26 t 2 n m z β e 2 a z z n m d z 27 t 4 n m z

use the remaining data as a test set to measure the performance of the model main particulars of s175 container ship are presented in table 1 and the partial ship motion time series under different sea states are shown in figs 4 7 4 2 the effects of the input vector space on the prediction accuracy we use the lstm model to predict the motion of the s175 container ship model has a hidden layer and the number of units in the lstm layer is 20 the optimizer used by the model is adam kingma et al 2015 and we set the activator parameter to learning rate 0 001 beta 1 0 9 beta 2 0 999 epsilon 1 10 8 in addition the model sets batch size to 64 and epoch to 3000 and uses the mean square error as the loss function starting with a smaller value we train a series models which feature with different sizes of the input vector space as input until the model results show a significant deterioration trend and we use these models to predict the heave and pitch motion of the s175 container ship after 5 s under the condition of sea state 5 and sea state 6 the root mean square error between the motion pre diction value and the real value obtained by the model are calculated separately the result is shown in fig 8 and table 2 the prediction error of traditional auto regressive model for short term prediction for ship motion generally decreases with the increase of the input vector space of model input features and finally stabilizes akaike et al 1979 from the results of the calculation it is known that the lstm model is different from the auto regressive model as the input vector space of model input features increases the related information received by the model increases which makes the prediction error of the model gradually decrease until a threshold after exceeding this threshold as the input vector space of model input features increases the model begins to accept more and more irrelevant input information the input of irrelevant information causes the model to try to approximate the random noise which leads to a decrease in the generalization ability of the model and makes the prediction error of the model in the test set begin to increase in order to verify our conclusion we have designed ship heave motion prediction models with different advance prediction times t p and compare the results of models with different input vector space of model input features the result is shown in fig 9 and table 3 the new calculation results are in line with our conclusions when we use the lstm model to predict ship motion there is a certain optimal value for the input vector space of model input features this optimum value is related to the working conditions of the ship motion but not related to the forecast time 4 3 optimized input vector space by the auto correlation based techniques 4 3 1 the irf based optimization technique we calculated all the impulse response function of the s175 container ship and normalized the results in all impulse response functions h 33 and h 35 are related to the ship heave motion and h 53 and h 55 are related to the ship pitch motion as τ increases the normalized impulse response function drops rapidly and eventually converges at 0 considering the existence of calculation errors we believe that when ϵ 0 01 it can be determined that the impulse response function has converged the maximum convergence time of the relevant impulse response function is used to determine the input vector space of model input features of the model the result is shown in fig 10 and table 4 4 3 2 the acf based optimization technique for the heave and pitch motion of the s175 container ship under the condition of sea state 5 and sea state 6 we tried to calculate acf using data with different window length interestingly when the window length is large enough such as 3000s the acf curve does not change significantly with the change of the window length and when the window length is too small as the calculated window length changes the acf curve will change significantly the acf of the heave motion of the s175 container ship under the sea state 5 calculated by different window lengths is shown in fig 11 in the following content we use all training set data 7498s to calculate the auto correlation function of the motion time series and used to determine the input vector space of the model under different sea conditions we believe that when the correlation coefficient of the time series is less than 0 5 it can be concluded that there is no enough correlation between the two considering the existence of calculation errors we believe that when r 0 45 it can be determined that the correlation coefficient is small enough the minimum time that the correlation coefficient is not above this value is used to determine the input vector space of model input features of the model the result is shown in fig 12 and table 5 4 4 predicted time series results by the irf and acf based optimization techniques according to the calculation results in 4 3 we use the impulse response function and the auto correlation function to determine the input vector space of the short term prediction model for ship motion in table 4 the memory length of the impulse response function of the s175 container ship is 14 4s and 13 9s and in table 5 the correlation length of the auto correlation function of the s175 container ship is 20s 16 5s 15s and 13 9s since the sampling interval of the time series is 0 5 we can determine the input vector space of the model based on the memory time obtained by the two methods in section 4 2 of the paper we compared the calculation error of models with different input vector spaces that is parameter traversal methods and obtained the best input vector space in each dataset we can verify the accuracy of the obtained input vector space length by comparing them with the best value obtained by parameter traversal the results are shown in table 6 and based on the input vector space determined by the two methods we also completed the training of the lstm model and compared the prediction error the result is shown in fig 13 and table 7 from the results in tables 4 6 we find that two different input vector space determination methods can efficiently determine the input vector space of the model at a value close to the optimal threshold but the performance of the model based on the determination method of the autocorrelation function tends to be better 5 conclusions deep learning neural networks are capable in processing nonlinear dynamic the lstm deep learning model provides a potential way for nonlinear ship motions prediction it is critical to determine an optimal input vector dimension when training a lstm model conventional method suffers both high computational cost and poor adaptation difficulties as it selects the optimal dimension by traversing an empirical preset range the present work proposes an input vector space optimization method based on the dependence hidden in ship motion records of a sequence both the impulse response function irf based and auto correlation function acf based techniques are investigated for input vector space optimization numerical simulations are carried out for vilification and comparison concluding remarks are made as follows when keeping the other hyper parameters constant prediction rms of the lstm model increases and subsequently decreases as the input vector dimension grows simulation results under various sea condition consistently suggest that global optimum can be found in the prediction rms functions the optimal input vector dimension is obtained based on the global optimum where the prediction rms is the least compared to the conventional method the proposed ship motion memory effects based input vector space optimization method provide a direct effective and more efficient way both the irf and the acf techniques produce reasonable results which highly agree with the optimal input vector dimension for example the optimal input vector dimension with respect to the least prediction rms is 35 the selected dimensions based on the irf and the acf techniques are 28 and 33 respectively in addition comparison study is also carried out it is found that the irf and acf techniques perform equivalently in training efficiency while the acf technique is better in prediction accuracy as shown in table 7 the prediction rmss of the acf based lstm model are smaller under various sea states it results from that the memory effects of the nonlinear ship motions have nonlinearity while the irfs are calculated based on linear hydrodynamic approach the irf technique is not capable in exactly representing the auto correlations hidden in nonlinear ship motions in contrast the acf technique is data driven and without linear theoretical assumption it calculates the auto correlation measures by using the nonlinear ship motion time series hence acf technique can describe the nonlinear memory effects in ship motion more precisely and therefore performs better in input vector space optimization in summary the proposed input vector space optimization method provides a feasible way to reduce computational cost and improve the adaptation when training a lstm model credit authorship contribution statement yucheng liu methodology software validation
