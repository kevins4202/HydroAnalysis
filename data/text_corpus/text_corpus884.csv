4420,in this study we assessed the impacts of uncertainties arising from hydrologic model parameters and climate change data on streamflow and catchment level non floodplain wetland nfw water storage predictions for the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed the hydrologic model used in this study was the soil and water assessment tool swat coupled with improved wetland modules model uncertainty was represented using 12 parameter sets pars with acceptable model performance different projections of future climate conditions eight global circulation models gcms under three representative concentration pathways rcps were used to represent climate change uncertainty the ensemble method and analysis of variance were adopted for uncertainty assessment the results showed that monthly streamflow projections did not substantially differ with respect to individual pars gcms and rcps by contrast the projected nfw water storage varied significantly however the changes in projected hydrological values relative to historic conditions greatly differed with regard to the pars gcms and rcps leading to a high uncertainty in assessing climate change impacts the variability of gcm projections was the most significant single contributor accounting for 46 and 49 of the total streamflow and nfw water storage projection uncertainties respectively followed by pars and rcps our work assessed the impacts of different uncertainty sources on nfw hydrology under climate change suggesting careful consideration of model and climate change uncertainties for the reliable projections of nfw hydrologic behaviors keywords uncertainty hydrologic model parameters climate change data streamflow non floodplain wetland nfw 1 introduction increased awareness of the hydrological ecological and biogeochemical benefits of wetlands has led to extensive research on mapping wetland extents du et al 2020 huang et al 2014 jin et al 2017 lang et al 2020 monitoring wetland dynamics haque et al 2018 jones et al 2018 yeo et al 2019a and quantifying wetland functions evenson et al 2018a mclaughlin et al 2014 the use of hydrologic models is rapidly increasing because of their ability to quantitatively assess wetland benefits at various spatiotemporal scales golden et al 2017 jones et al 2019 the major applications of hydrological models include projecting catchment level wetland benefits and hydrology under changing climates fossey et al 2016 records et al 2014 zhu et al 2020 analyzing wetland contributions to hydrologic resilience evenson et al 2018a 2016 2015 wu et al 2020 yeo et al 2019b and simulating field level wetland impacts on water quality and quantity dynamics qi et al 2019 sharifi et al 2019 these studies emphasized the significance of wetland protection and management in enhancing landscape resilience to changing climatic conditions and maintaining the integrity of aquatic ecosystems hydrologic models were applied when their simulation results represented acceptable performance measures even though model outputs are shown to be acceptable careful assessment of model results is required because of predictive uncertainty involved in hydrologic models beeson et al 2014 renard et al 2010 strauch et al 2012 teweldebrhan et al 2018 yen et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 in particular parameter uncertainty has been commonly investigated owing to the existence of numerous model parameters the lack of observational data kuczera and mroczkowski 1998 shirmohammadi et al 2006 non measurable parameters her and chaubey 2015 and equifinality which means that different parameter sets can generate satisfactory model performance beven 2006 the predictive uncertainty of hydrologic models is further amplified when climate change projections are concurrently examined bastola et al 2011 climate change data inevitably include uncertainties stemming from general circulation model gcm initial conditions structure and parameterization the choice of gcms and climate change scenarios e g representative concentration pathways rcp and greenhouse gas emission scenarios gges and downscaling techniques chen et al 2011a 2011b mirdashtvan et al 2018 sharma et al 2018 numerous attempts have been made to explore the uncertainties arising from climate change data and hydrologic models arnell 1999 christensen et al 2004 dibike and coulibaly 2005 jung et al 2012 for example ficklin and barnhart 2014 tested multiple parameter sets for simulating streamflow based on different gcm data and found that large differences in streamflow and peak snowmelt timing existed depending on the parameter sets and gcm data for the western us her et al 2019 also reported similar predictions that gcm data and model parameterization exerted substantial impacts on streamflow variability predictions for the ohio river basin these studies suggest the importance of addressing both climate change data and hydrologic model uncertainties for developing holistic water resource management plans ficklin and barnhart 2014 her et al 2019 although the simultaneous consideration of climate change data and hydrological model uncertainties has been widely explored in previous studies this topic has rarely been investigated within the context of wetland hydrology previous examples of when these two sources of uncertainties were separately addressed include evaluations of the impact of downscaling techniques on wetland water balance prediction etemadi et al 2014 zhang et al 2011 and the impact of model structure and parameter uncertainty in simulating wetland hydrological processes lee et al 2020c 2019 muhammad et al 2019 sources of uncertainty may be non additive consequently it is necessary to examine both sources of uncertainty simultaneously during predictions of wetland hydrologic processes to provide better insights into the use of modeling approaches for assessing changes in the provision of wetland ecosystem services under changing climates previous wetland studies within the context of climate change have mostly been conducted for operational purposes the key topics are 1 impacts of climate change on flow regimes within wetland dominated watersheds dibike and coulibaly 2005 muhammad et al 2020 2 impacts of wetland loss on streamflow or water quality under climate change fossey et al 2016 muhammad et al 2018 records et al 2014 and 3 variability of wetland water regimes under climate change fossey and rousseau 2016 zhu et al 2020 however little attention has been paid on modeling the uncertainties in wetland hydrology under climate change this study assessed the uncertainties of model parameters and climate change data rcps and gcms entailed in simulating streamflow and wetland hydro logy for a wetland dominant watershed a modified version of the soil and water assessment tool swat was employed because of its improved representation of wetland hydrology and lower structural uncertainty relative to a default swat structure lee et al 2020c the model parameter uncertainty was examined by considering different parameter sets pars with acceptable performance measures this study considered eight different gcm data for three individual rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 to quantify climate change uncertainty in total 24 climate change data eight gcm three rcps were used we focused on the catchment level non floodplain wetland nfw water storage nfws exert considerable hydrological influence on nfw dominant study areas lee et al 2018c nevertheless nfw hydrology under climate change remains largely unknown the specific objectives of this study were i to compare streamflow and nfw water storage under historical conditions and climate change scenarios ii to quantify the impacts of uncertainties arising from the selection of pars gcms and rcps on streamflow and nfw water storage projections and iii to identify the key uncertainty contributors among the above sources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the tuckahoe creek watershed tcw on the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed cbw was chosen as the test site fig 1 the tcw is part of one of the focal research sites for the us department of agriculture usda conservation effects assessment project ceap and the long term agroecosystem research ltar network the site is designated as an impaired watershed by the us environmental protection agency usepa which highlights the importance of this site for research activities mccarty et al 2008 wetlands indicated by the us fish and wildlife service usfws national wetlands inventory nwi geospatial dataset occupy 15 5 34 km2 of the tcw 220 km2 riparian wetlands rws and nfws classified by the riparian wetland module rwm see section 2 2 cover 6 13 km2 and 9 5 21 km2 of the study site respectively the high abundance of wetlands in this region has led to numerous efforts to substantiate the hydrologic ecological and biogeochemical benefits provided by wetlands lee et al 2020b hydrologic and biogeochemical processes are anticipated to be significantly altered by climate change in the studied region however wetlands are expected to mitigate such climate change induced fluctuations lee et al 2018b however the responses of wetlands in the region to climate change have rarely been projected our study provides an insight into wetland hydrologic behavior under climate change in this coastal region 2 2 a modified version of swat the swat is a process based hydrologic model designed to evaluate the influence of anthropogenic activities and environmental changes on water resources and associated physical processes within a watershed neitsch et al 2011 the model partitions a watershed into sub watersheds and further into hydrologic response units hrus determined based on a combination of the unique slope land use and soil type all physical processes are simulated at the hru level and model outputs are summed at the sub watershed and watershed scales via routing processes the original swat version can reflect wetland hydrological processes using two default modules wetland and pothole modules the original module was known to oversimplify wetland modeling structure reducing the output reliability lee et al 2020c detailed limitations of the original wetland module are illustrated in the method s1 and fig s1 of the supplementary material this study adopted the modified swat that includes the rwm and non floodplain wetland module nfwm for the improved simulation of wetland hydrological processes lee et al 2018c the rwm developed by liu et al 2008 better characterizes bi directional water exchange between an rw and an adjacent stream segment at the sub watershed scale fig s1b nfws were simulated using the nfwm developed by evenson et al 2015 enabling individual hrus to represent individual nfws or their contributing areas based on the spatial positioning of nfws and improving hydrologic interactions between nfws and drainage areas fig s1 therefore these improved representations better simulated wetland hydrological interactions with contributing areas and nearby streams however the modified swat used in this study is limited to representing spillage from upgradient wetlands to downgradient ones which is the so called fill and spill or fill and merge evenson et al 2018a lane et al 2018 these terms indicate hydrological processes driven by the spillage from upgradient nfws to downgradient ones please refer to leibowitz et al 2016 for further details on these hydrological processes these processes are known to occur to a lesser extent in this region yeo et al 2019b this is supported by other observational studies epting et al 2018 hosen et al 2018 lee et al 2020a phillips and shedlock 1993 therefore catchment level nfw water storage and streamflow might not be significantly affected by disregarding fill and spill or fill and merge processes in this region please refer to liu et al 2008 and evenson et al 2015 for further details on the rwm and nfwm respectively the parameter values used for the two wetland modules were directly adapted from lee et al 2018c further details about the improved wetland module and associated parameter calculations are provided in the method s2 figs s1 s2 tables s2 s3 of the supplementary material 2 3 swat input and climate change data the basic geospatial and climatic data needed to run the swat are listed in table 1 the land use map produced by lee et al 2016 was employed as it includes representative cropping practices for this region the soil map was downloaded from the soil survey geographical database a light detection and ranging lidar driven digital elevation model dem was used to delineate modeling units e g hrus daily observations of precipitation and temperature from 1999 to 2014 were obtained from national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national climate data center ncdc weather stations around the study site chestertown usc00181750 royal oak usc00187806 and greensboro us1mdcl0009 respectively fig 1a the remaining required climatic data i e daily humidity wind speed and solar radiation were prepared using the swat built in weather generator because there were no observations for model calibration and validation daily streamflow data were downloaded from us geological survey usgs gauge 01491500 at the outlet of the tcw fig 1a the projected daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures were obtained from the world climate research program wcrp coupled model intercomparison project5 cmip5 archive brekke et al 2014 eight gcms were prepared for three individual rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 assuming different radiative forcing levels with a range of 2 6 8 5 w m2 at the end of the century taylor et al 2012 the rcps corresponding to 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 indicate representative low medium and high radiative forcing scenarios respectively taylor et al 2012 details of the eight gcms are illustrated in table s4 of the supplementary material for temporal consistency with the historical period 1999 2014 the future period was 2083 2098 this study employed the historical conditions from 1999 to 2014 including a two year warm up period 1999 2000 owing to the unavailability of streamflow observations before 2001 the 14 year simulation period employed herein is shorter than that in other climate change studies nevertheless several studies employ a short baseline period 12 16 years for climate change projections guevara ochoa et al 2020 singh and saravanan 2020 furthermore a study with a shorter simulation period baseline and future periods 5 and 10 years respectively successfully assessed the uncertainties stemming from climate change and hydrologic models her et al 2019 the calibration period of our study 2001 2008 includes representative wet dry and average climate conditions as recommended by the model guidelines arnold et al 2012 similar to the annual precipitation data of the past 30 years 1981 2010 precipitation data over the 8 year calibration period accounted for three representative climate conditions tables s5 s6 supporting the reasoning of this study with the further accumulation of streamflow observations a long term simulation will be conducted bias correction of the raw gcm has been emphasized because of inherent uncertainty such as the overestimation of wet days chen et al 2011b simulation results from the raw gcm provided unrealistic projections of snowmelt driven flow troin et al 2015 evapotranspiration and crop growth lee et al 2018a in this study we performed bias correction using the delta change method presented below wang et al 2014 1 p delta gcm p f u t u r e m o n t h l y ã gcm p b a s e l i n e m

monthly averages of gcm data for the future 2083 2098 and historical 1999 2014 periods respectively obs baseline d a i l y indicates the observed daily climate and dgcm future d a i l y indicates bias corrected gcm data comparisons of historical and future climate data are made in fig s3 and table s7 of the supplementary material 2 4 model calibration and validation the calibration and validation of a modified swat were executed with a daily time step using streamflow observations over 16 years 2 year warm up 1999 2000 8 year calibration 2001 2008 and 6 year validation 2009 2014 periods previous modeling studies conducted in this region were referenced in selecting 11 streamflow parameters for calibration lee et al 2016 qi et al 2020 sexton et al 2010 tian et al 2014 yeo et al 2014 three thousand different pars were reproduced using latin hypercube sampling which allowed the efficient identification of pars that resulted in acceptable model outputs mckay et al 2000 three goodness of fit measures were used to evaluate swat performance moriasi et al 2007 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean squared error rmse standard deviation ratio rsr and percent bias p bias the three metrics were calculated as follows 5 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 6 rsr rmse stde v obs i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 7 p b i a s i 1 n o i s i 100 i 1 n o i where o i are observed data s i are simulated data o is the observed mean value and n equals the number of observations a parameter set was generally viewed as acceptable when it satisfied the monthly model performance measures outlined in moriasi et al 2007 for example nse 0 5 rsr 0 7 and p bias 25 for daily simulations less strict criteria have been used because daily outputs entail significant streamflow variability leading to more inaccurate values jimeno sáez et al 2018 records et al 2014 yeo et al 2019b this study defined daily performances as acceptable when nse 0 3 and p bias 25 based on previous studies jimeno sáez et al 2018 records et al 2014 yeo et al 2019b twelve pars led to acceptable daily model performances and these pars were used to represent parameter uncertainty each parameter value and its daily performance measures for the 12 acceptable pars are available in supplementary tables s8 s9 respectively the monthly performance measures for the 12 pars are also provided in supplementary table s10 the parameter sensitivity see table 2 was computed using a global sensitivity analysis by obtaining an optimal fit between the objective function and the parameters via linear regression khalid et al 2016 the objective function value was defined as the kge for estimating the et this global sensitivity method estimates the average changes in the objective function relative to the changes in each parameter while simultaneously modifying all other parameters khalid et al 2016 parameter sensitivity increases as the absolute value of the t test increases and the associated p value decreases six of the 11 parameters were found to be sensitive parameters 2 5 comparing streamflow and catchment level nfw water storage under the historical condition and climate change scenarios monthly streamflow and catchment level nfw water storage were used to compare streamflow and nfw water storage under historical and climate change scenarios daily outputs across the 14 year simulation period were aggregated at monthly scales catchment level nfw water storage was calculated by summing the water storage volume of all nfws within the watershed to depict streamflow and nfw water storage under climate change scenarios 2085 2098 12 acceptable pars were forced with eight gcm data for three rcps in total 288 simulations 12 pars eight gcms three rcps were performed fig 2 an ensemble mean was computed for eight gcms and 12 acceptable pars to compare 12 simulations under historical conditions 2001 2014 first an ensemble mean of eight gcm simulations projected from each par was calculated for the three individual rcps 36 gcm ensemble means 12 par three rcps were compared with the corresponding 12 historical simulations fig 2 then an ensemble mean of 12 pars projected from each gcm was also calculated for three individual rcps subsequently 24 par ensemble means eight gcms three rcps were compared with one ensemble mean from 12 historical simulations fig 2 additionally we evaluated the significant difference between the gcm ensemble means and par ensemble means for individual rcps using the kolmogorov smirnov test at p 0 05 2 6 uncertainty assessment our study employed the analysis of variance anova method to quantify the contribution of individual sources to the total uncertainty of monthly streamflow and nfw water storage projections this method has been widely adopted to measure uncertainties from multiple sources such as gcms hydrological models model parameters climate change scenarios and downscaling methods bosshard et al 2013 nover et al 2016 trudel et al 2017 vetter et al 2017 the anova method decomposes the total variance into different sources par gcm and rcp the total sum of squares sst was computed as follows 8 sst i 1 n par j 1 n gcm k 1 n rcp y ijk y ooo 2 where y ijk is the value of the hydrologic component streamflow and catchment scale nfw water storage in this study corresponding to par i gcm j and rcp k respectively y ooo is the overall mean sst comprises three main effects ss par ss gcm and ss rcp corresponding to 12 pars eight gcms and three rcps respectively and four interaction effects ss par g c m ss gcm r c

par g c m r c p s s t ss par ss gcm ss rcp ss par g c m ss gcm r c p ss par r c p where n gcm n rcp and n par indicate the number of gcms rcps and pars respectively o was averaged over a particular index when the sample size of individual uncertainty sources differs a biased variance is generated bosshard et al 2013 this bias is eliminated by a subsampling method that generates all combinations of the same number of pars gcms and rcps bosshard et al 2013 vetter et al 2017 in this study the combination of three pars three gcms and three rcps was used to set the same sample size for the three uncertainty sources for 12 pars and eight gcms 220 and 56 combinations with three samples were generated respectively in total 12 320 subsamples were applied and each subsample entailed 27 simulations three pars three gcms three rcps after the sum of squares of individual uncertainty sources was calculated for all subsamples the variance fraction η 2 of each uncertainty source was computed as follows as an example η 2 of the parameter set was calculated 17 η par 2 1 12320 m 1 12320 sst par m sst m 100 where m indicates a subsample 3 results and discussions 3 1 monthly streamflow fig 3 shows the gcm ensemble mean of the monthly streamflow simulated from each par the gcm ensemble means were not significantly different from each other p value 0 05 from the kolmogorov smirnov test such ensemble means indicated small differences among rcps 0 7 m3 s 1 for individual pars the largest and smallest monthly streamflow appeared at similar timings respectively for example the largest monthly streamflow was in march par 5 fig 3e and february par 8 fig 3h and the smallest monthly streamflow was in july par 1 fig 3a and august par 2 fig 3b the gcm ensemble means had greater monthly variances than those of the historical values for the 12 pars relative to the range of the historical variance 0 1 1 2 m3 s 1 the ranges were greater for the three rcps rcp 2 6 1 0 2 8 m3 s 1 rcp 4 5 0 9 2 5 m3 s 1 and rcp 8 5 0 9 2 5 m3 s 1 the major contributors that led to greater variance under the three rcps included increases in streamflow from january to april and decreases in streamflow from june to september compared to historical values fig 3 for example the projected streamflow was 3 0 m3 s 1 greater from january to april and 1 0 m3 s 1 lower from june to september than the historical values these results are in good agreement with a previous study reporting that increased precipitation driven by climate change would increase runoff during the winter and spring seasons in the chesapeake bay irby et al 2018 warmer temperatures under the rcps lowered the streamflow from june to september relative to the historical values likely due to intensified et depending on the selection of an acceptable par the changes in monthly streamflow projections relative to the historical values varied substantially fig 3 distinctive relative differences were found between october and december projections historical 6 of 12 pars 2 4 5 10 11 and 12 projections historical 5 of 12 pars 1 3 6 8 and 9 and projections historical 1 par 7 previous studies have also shown different hydrological processes under climate change in response to parameter selection for example ficklin and barnhart 2014 found that the choice of the par shifted the timing of peak snowmelt depth under climate change the results from her et al 2019 indicated the high variability in groundwater contributed to streamflow our study reconfirmed that model parameter uncertainty greatly affects the interpretations of projected climate change impacts on hydrological processes the par ensemble means of monthly streamflow under the rcps are compared with those corresponding to the historical conditions in fig 4 note that the historical value is also an ensemble mean corresponding to the 12 pars similar to the trend of the gcm ensemble means the par ensemble means were greater than the historical values from january to april the monthly variance was also greater under rcp2 6 mean value 1 8 m3 s 1 rcp4 5 mean value 1 7 m3 s 1 and rcp8 5 mean value 1 5 m3 s 1 than that under the historical conditions mean value 0 37 m3 s 1 the par ensemble means indicated larger differences 0 8 2 4 m3 s 1 among the three rcps for individual gcms fig 4 relative to the gcm ensemble means for individual pars fig 3 the relative difference between the projected values and the historical values showed similar patterns among the three rcps particularly the historical values were lower than those corresponding to the three rcps from january to april further the historical values were consistent with those corresponding to the three rcps for the rest of the months fig 4 the degree of relative variation among the values corresponding to the three rcps was different for the gcms for example rcp 4 5 streamflow was greater or lower than rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 streamflow for gcm 2 4 6 and 8 or gcm 1 3 5 and 7 except for two pairs gcm 3 and 8 for rcp 4 5 and gcm 4 and 5 for rcp 8 5 p value 0 05 kolmogorov smirnov test there was no significant difference between the gcms with regard to individual rcps however this finding indicates that the interpretation of climate change impacts varies with respect to the gcms pesce et al 2019 also found a large disparity in projected water quantity and quality variables from simulations with ten different climate model projections monthly projected surface runoff and baseflow highly differ depending on the gcms githui et al 2009 overall our results presented in figs 4 and 5 indicate that high uncertainty in predicting climate change impacts on monthly streamflow projections can be induced owing to the selection of pars gcms and rcps 3 2 monthly catchment level nfw water storage the gcm ensemble means of monthly catchment level nfw water storage are presented along with the historical values in fig 5 the temporal changes in ensemble means were similar to those in the historical values in that nfw water storage was high from november to may and low from june to october further the values corresponding to the three rcp simulations were consistently greater than the historical values for all pars likely due to increased precipitation climate change driven warmer temperatures caused summertime streamflow to be lower than the historical value fig 3 but nfw water storage did not exhibit this hydrologic change fig 5 lee et al 2020a found that in the studied region nfw water levels were correlated with streamflow owing to strong seasonality therefore nfw water storage would exhibit dynamics similar to those of streamflow under the same climatic data the unexpected results were likely caused by the limited ability of the model to consider wetland vegetation impacts nfw water loss by evaporation is simulated as a function of the evaporation coefficient nfw surface area and the leaf area index of the nfw relative to the parameter evlai defined as the leaf area index at which no evaporation occurs from the water surface neitsch et al 2011 evlai is assumed to be uniform for all nfws in the swat and nfw vegetation growth was not well depicted in the nfwm mainly because of limited information the dominant wetland plants deciduous woody species yepsen et al 2014 in this region would consume a substantial amount of water under climate change scenarios with warmer temperatures the reliability of the projections of the hydrologic behavior of nfws under climate change can be improved by carefully considering the effects of the vegetation in nfws par selection exerted substantial impacts on nfw water storage in the historical and rcp scenarios the gcm ensemble means significantly differed for the historical and rcp cases p value 0 5 kolmogorov smirnov test of the 66 combinations the historical condition indicated 41 significant combinations and the three rcps exhibited 48 rcp 2 6 46 rcp 4 5 and 50 rcp 8 5 significant combinations table s11 in particular differences in nfw water storage were large depending on the selection of the par and the difference was larger under rcps relative to that for the historical values for example the nfw water storage values obtained via par 1 were greater than those obtained via par 9 under the historical conditions and rcps by 61 69 and 75 96 104 m3 respectively monthly nfw water storage also significantly differed depending on the gcms fig 6 p value 0 05 kolmogorov smirnov test the rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 results showed 25 significant combinations among the 28 total combinations table s12 overall the historical values were lower than those corresponding to the three rcps but the values corresponding to the three gcms 5 6 and 7 were similar to the historical values furthermore the relative variation between the values corresponding to the three rcps and those corresponding to the historical data also differed depending on the gcms the relative shift of the values corresponding to rcp 8 5 compared to the historical data was lower than and greater than the shift of the values corresponding to the two other rcps for gcm 1 and gcm 3 fig 6ac respectively the results shown in figs 5 and 6 support the assertion that nfw water storage predictions involve high uncertainties arising from pars and gcms overall nfw water storage significantly differed with respect to individual pars gcms and rcps while streamflow did not show significant differences in this region the spatial and temporal patterns of nfws are greatly variable huang et al 2014 jin et al 2017 the sensitive characteristics of nfws can lead to significant differences streamflow is a representative value of hydrological processes within a watershed thus streamflow projections might be less significant under climate change relative to nfws 3 3 decomposing uncertainty sources fig 7 shows the variance fraction η 2 of individual uncertainty sources for the monthly streamflow and catchment level nfw water storage projections the main effects gcm rcp and par account for the majority of the projection uncertainty monthly streamflow η 2 67 84 average value 75 fig 7a and monthly nfw water storage η 2 77 81 average value 79 fig 7b as a single source gcm was the greatest contributor accounting for 31 61 average value 46 and 46 52 average value 49 of the total streamflow and nfw water storage projection uncertainties respectively followed by pars and rcps the uncertainty results comply with those of some previous studies gcm has also been projected to be the dominant source chen et al 2011b galavi et al 2019 kay et al 2009 in contrast some studies have reported that uncertainty stemming from hydrologic models significantly impacts future projections bastola et al 2011 najafi et al 2011 direct comparisons with previous studies were impossible due to differences in landscape characteristics input data projected values uncertainty quantification methods etc according to the type of projected variables such as extreme flow e g low or high flow and future periods far or near futures the uncertainty proportion was also different galavi et al 2019 tian et al 2014 these studies highlighted that projections with increased reliability could be achieved by considering possible uncertainty contributors in addition different sample numbers corresponding to individual uncertainty sources e g gcms or pars might lead to the underestimation or overestimation of uncertainty impacts zhang et al 2014 our study included various uncertainty sources and constrained sample numbers providing useful knowledge for future climate change studies the individual uncertainty source for monthly streamflow was highly variable relative to the uncertainty source for nfw water storage the par and rcp uncertainties of streamflow ranged from 5 to 36 average value 16 and 10 18 average value 13 respectively moreover those of nfw water storage 19 26 average value 23 and 6 8 average value 7 respectively were relatively consistent except for rcp gcm most interaction uncertainty sources had negligible impacts on the total uncertainty the sum of the three other interaction uncertainties par gcm rcp par and rcp gcm par was 2 6 for streamflow and 20 for nfw water storage rcp gcm was also more variable for streamflow prediction 14 28 than for nfw water storage prediction 17 22 catchment level wetland assessments using a hydrologic model are commonly calibrated and validated against only streamflow because of the unavailability of individual wetland data across a landscape evenson et al 2018a 2015 wetland parameters are predefined using default model parameters geospatial analysis or remotely sensed data further the wetland parameters are not adjusted during the calibration validation process lee et al 2018a yeo et al 2019b calibrated parameters were chosen not because of their effects on catchment level nfw storage but because of their effects on streamflow both predefined wetland parameters and the selection of calibrated streamflow parameters collectively led to small variability of the variance fraction η 2 of the par for nfw water storage fig 7b the lack of validation of catchment level nfw water storage may further diminish the accuracy of the uncertainty evaluation of nfw water storage more efforts to collect reliable wetland data and enhance pertinent model algorithms are still needed to attain accurate model predictions for catchment level nfw water storage 4 implications and limitations this study s findings have important implications for the importance of hydrologic model parameters and climate change uncertainty in water resource management this study showed significant variability in the post harvest season october to december streamflow under climate change scenarios depending on the selection of the pars fig 3 nutrient discharge during this season is a major driver of water quality degradation in the coastal plain of the cbw because the soil nutrients retained from crop fertilizers are readily exported to downstream areas due to increased water loads from seasonal et yeo et al 2014 the increased uncertainty of post harvest season streamflow under climate change calls for management tools that can accommodate a wide range of adequate water quality controls determining the climate change uncertainty in water management is critical for providing practical water resource management strategies stakhiv 2011 on average the amount of water stored in nfws is expected to increase under climate change relative to historical values these findings suggest that there will be increased nfw impacts on hydrological biogeochemical and ecological processes under climate change inundated areas and water residence time associated with water storage are key parameters for supporting wetland dependent species battle and golladay 2001 chandler et al 2017 reducing carbon export mitsch and mander 2018 and nutrient loads noe and hupp 2007 and mitigating peak flow in downstream areas jones et al 2018 our simulations suggest that these wetland functions might change under climate change given that the projected nfw water storage fluctuates owing to different uncertainty sources the assessment of future nfw functions should involve various uncertainty factors to provide increased confidence in projections the three rcps projected a similar streamflow although the projected streamflow was significantly different from the historical values figs 4 and 5 these findings are likely due to the ensemble of multiple simulations which can dilute the significant differences among the three rcps if a simulation is performed using one par and one gcm we might observe the hydrologic disparity among different rcps guevara ochoa et al 2020 singh and saravanan 2020 previous studies focusing on uncertainty commonly adopted an ensemble approach chen et al 2011a ficklin and barnhart 2014 her and chaubey 2015 and our study complied well with the prior uncertainty assessments based on the simulated results we can expect changes in wetland water regimes e g inundation depth duration and frequency and resultant ecological impacts increased wetland water storage driven by climate change may lead to composition of a wetland vegetation community one experimental study found that wetland vegetation types significantly differed by water depth because wetland vegetation has different tolerances to water conditions depending on species casanova and brock 2000 at a large scale the distribution of plant communities varied by water regimes and dominant plant communities also differed by inundation depth duration and frequency zhiqiang et al 2016 in addition to water regimes exotic species can affect wetland vegetation compositions due to modified wetland conditions caused by climate change yepsen et al 2014 responses of wetland vegetation to climate change largely remain unknown this aspect should be explored for wetland management and conservation under climate change several efforts for future studies are required to gain increased reliability the modified swat used in this study disregarded specific wetland hydrological processes particularly spill and fill or spill and merge because these processes have a lower likelihood of occurrence in this region a more complete representation of wetland behaviors considering interactions with surrounding areas along flow gradients i e spill and fill or spill and merge would better reflect nfw responses to climate change and the associated uncertainties evenson et al 2018a 2018b 2016 groundwater processes should be further improved to better represent wetland groundwater interactions thereby supporting the interpretation of the wetland hydrology in this region yeo et al 2019b an improved groundwater simulation could provide a better insight into the lag time and amount of groundwater flow from wetlands to downstream water which varies with the spatial distance hydrogeomorphic characteristics and soil conditions ameli and creed 2017 neff and rosenberry 2018 qi et al 2019 this effort would be especially critical in a wetland rich landscape with a high dependence on groundwater flow paths furthermore it is necessary to collect field data to validate wetland parameters such as depth and surface area these data are often unavailable and thus data collection should be included in ongoing efforts to increase modeling predictability lastly the modified swat employed herein required a substantially long simulation time owing to an increased number of modeling units i e hrus a detailed representation of modeling units might improve the overall accuracy to some degree but it might be less worthwhile owing to the requirement of heavy computational resources evenson et al 2016 recent studies have significantly reduced the simulation time by incorporating the concept of a nfw storage threshold into the swat dibike et al 2020 muhammad et al 2020 future studies should use a storage threshold concept to efficiently explore wetland hydrology when considering numerous simulation scenarios or large study areas we have additional notes for future studies as illustrated in the method section this study covered only 14 years due to data availability although this short term period included representative wet dry and average weather conditions compared to the past 30 years however this simulation period is still short relative to other climate change studies and thus this period might represent biased climatic conditions since the period can fall within wet or dry periods this limitation should be involved in the interpretation of our results comparative analysis of bias correction methods should be taken into account for future studies this study chose the delta change method due to its simplicity and robustness shown in previous studies musau et al 2015 shrestha et al 2012 wang et al 2014 the selection of bias correction methods was reported to have substantial impacts on hydrologic variables and a suitable correction method might differ by geographical areas gao et al 2019 therefore application of different bias correction methods is recommended for future studies for the study region considered herein lee et al 2018c performed simulations using a modified swat and found that wetlands served as key features to curtail flooding events by decreasing surface runoff and increasing baseflow increased baseflow led to stabilized downstream water during dry seasons under the current conditions however the manner in which these wetland benefits will vary under climate change remains unknown climate change studies often focus on either uncertainty sources or wetland benefits our future research goal will be to conduct a comparative analysis of wetland benefits under current climate change conditions 5 summary and conclusions quantification of wetland benefits using hydrologic models has been conducted to understand the necessity of wetland protection and management previously hydrologic models and climate change uncertainty were separately considered to provide insights on projected values however the simultaneous investigation of hydrologic model parameters and climate change uncertainties with respect to wetland hydrology has rarely been performed in this study a modified swat coupled with improved wetland modules was employed to explore how model parameter selection and climate change data simultaneously affect streamflow and nfw water storage projections for the coastal plain of the cbw the swat calibrated under historical conditions 2001 2014 was applied to predict climate change driven streamflow and nfw water storage from 2085 to 2098 a total of 12 acceptable pars were employed with eight gcms under three rcps to reflect the uncertainty stemming from model parameters and climate change data the total uncertainty was decomposed into uncertainties arising from individual sources using anova our simulations suggest that applying a single combination of par gcm and rcp to project streamflow and nfw water storage in the studied region should be avoided large differences in monthly streamflow with respect to the pars and gcms were not found but the relative differences between the projected values and the historical values were substantial significant differences due to pars and gcms were observed in the nfw water storage projections and relative variations in addition the rcp values were not consistent across the pars and gcms indicating uncertainties arising from the selection of rcps these findings highlight the need for the concurrent use of multi pars multi gcms and multi rcps for climate change projections the anova results showed that among single sources the largest uncertainty was related to gcms followed by par and rcps gcms contributed 46 and 49 of the total uncertainties of streamflow and nfw water storage respectively uncertainties stemming from par and rcps contributed 16 and 23 of the total streamflow projection uncertainty and 13 and 7 of the total nfw projection uncertainty respectively interaction uncertainty the combination of two or three uncertainty sources only accounted for 25 and 22 of the total streamflow and nfw projection uncertainties respectively this study demonstrates that using a single par gcm and rcp can lead to biased projections of streamflow and nfw water storage under climate change this demonstration has important implications regarding the effect of climate change on water resources it is strongly recommended to identify multiple acceptable pars and apply those pars with different gcms and rcps to climate change projections to obtain better streamflow and nfw hydrology predictions credit authorship contribution statement sangchul lee

4420,in this study we assessed the impacts of uncertainties arising from hydrologic model parameters and climate change data on streamflow and catchment level non floodplain wetland nfw water storage predictions for the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed the hydrologic model used in this study was the soil and water assessment tool swat coupled with improved wetland modules model uncertainty was represented using 12 parameter sets pars with acceptable model performance different projections of future climate conditions eight global circulation models gcms under three representative concentration pathways rcps were used to represent climate change uncertainty the ensemble method and analysis of variance were adopted for uncertainty assessment the results showed that monthly streamflow projections did not substantially differ with respect to individual pars gcms and rcps by contrast the projected nfw water storage varied significantly however the changes in projected hydrological values relative to historic conditions greatly differed with regard to the pars gcms and rcps leading to a high uncertainty in assessing climate change impacts the variability of gcm projections was the most significant single contributor accounting for 46 and 49 of the total streamflow and nfw water storage projection uncertainties respectively followed by pars and rcps our work assessed the impacts of different uncertainty sources on nfw hydrology under climate change suggesting careful consideration of model and climate change uncertainties for the reliable projections of nfw hydrologic behaviors keywords uncertainty hydrologic model parameters climate change data streamflow non floodplain wetland nfw 1 introduction increased awareness of the hydrological ecological and biogeochemical benefits of wetlands has led to extensive research on mapping wetland extents du et al 2020 huang et al 2014 jin et al 2017 lang et al 2020 monitoring wetland dynamics haque et al 2018 jones et al 2018 yeo et al 2019a and quantifying wetland functions evenson et al 2018a mclaughlin et al 2014 the use of hydrologic models is rapidly increasing because of their ability to quantitatively assess wetland benefits at various spatiotemporal scales golden et al 2017 jones et al 2019 the major applications of hydrological models include projecting catchment level wetland benefits and hydrology under changing climates fossey et al 2016 records et al 2014 zhu et al 2020 analyzing wetland contributions to hydrologic resilience evenson et al 2018a 2016 2015 wu et al 2020 yeo et al 2019b and simulating field level wetland impacts on water quality and quantity dynamics qi et al 2019 sharifi et al 2019 these studies emphasized the significance of wetland protection and management in enhancing landscape resilience to changing climatic conditions and maintaining the integrity of aquatic ecosystems hydrologic models were applied when their simulation results represented acceptable performance measures even though model outputs are shown to be acceptable careful assessment of model results is required because of predictive uncertainty involved in hydrologic models beeson et al 2014 renard et al 2010 strauch et al 2012 teweldebrhan et al 2018 yen et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 in particular parameter uncertainty has been commonly investigated owing to the existence of numerous model parameters the lack of observational data kuczera and mroczkowski 1998 shirmohammadi et al 2006 non measurable parameters her and chaubey 2015 and equifinality which means that different parameter sets can generate satisfactory model performance beven 2006 the predictive uncertainty of hydrologic models is further amplified when climate change projections are concurrently examined bastola et al 2011 climate change data inevitably include uncertainties stemming from general circulation model gcm initial conditions structure and parameterization the choice of gcms and climate change scenarios e g representative concentration pathways rcp and greenhouse gas emission scenarios gges and downscaling techniques chen et al 2011a 2011b mirdashtvan et al 2018 sharma et al 2018 numerous attempts have been made to explore the uncertainties arising from climate change data and hydrologic models arnell 1999 christensen et al 2004 dibike and coulibaly 2005 jung et al 2012 for example ficklin and barnhart 2014 tested multiple parameter sets for simulating streamflow based on different gcm data and found that large differences in streamflow and peak snowmelt timing existed depending on the parameter sets and gcm data for the western us her et al 2019 also reported similar predictions that gcm data and model parameterization exerted substantial impacts on streamflow variability predictions for the ohio river basin these studies suggest the importance of addressing both climate change data and hydrologic model uncertainties for developing holistic water resource management plans ficklin and barnhart 2014 her et al 2019 although the simultaneous consideration of climate change data and hydrological model uncertainties has been widely explored in previous studies this topic has rarely been investigated within the context of wetland hydrology previous examples of when these two sources of uncertainties were separately addressed include evaluations of the impact of downscaling techniques on wetland water balance prediction etemadi et al 2014 zhang et al 2011 and the impact of model structure and parameter uncertainty in simulating wetland hydrological processes lee et al 2020c 2019 muhammad et al 2019 sources of uncertainty may be non additive consequently it is necessary to examine both sources of uncertainty simultaneously during predictions of wetland hydrologic processes to provide better insights into the use of modeling approaches for assessing changes in the provision of wetland ecosystem services under changing climates previous wetland studies within the context of climate change have mostly been conducted for operational purposes the key topics are 1 impacts of climate change on flow regimes within wetland dominated watersheds dibike and coulibaly 2005 muhammad et al 2020 2 impacts of wetland loss on streamflow or water quality under climate change fossey et al 2016 muhammad et al 2018 records et al 2014 and 3 variability of wetland water regimes under climate change fossey and rousseau 2016 zhu et al 2020 however little attention has been paid on modeling the uncertainties in wetland hydrology under climate change this study assessed the uncertainties of model parameters and climate change data rcps and gcms entailed in simulating streamflow and wetland hydro logy for a wetland dominant watershed a modified version of the soil and water assessment tool swat was employed because of its improved representation of wetland hydrology and lower structural uncertainty relative to a default swat structure lee et al 2020c the model parameter uncertainty was examined by considering different parameter sets pars with acceptable performance measures this study considered eight different gcm data for three individual rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 to quantify climate change uncertainty in total 24 climate change data eight gcm three rcps were used we focused on the catchment level non floodplain wetland nfw water storage nfws exert considerable hydrological influence on nfw dominant study areas lee et al 2018c nevertheless nfw hydrology under climate change remains largely unknown the specific objectives of this study were i to compare streamflow and nfw water storage under historical conditions and climate change scenarios ii to quantify the impacts of uncertainties arising from the selection of pars gcms and rcps on streamflow and nfw water storage projections and iii to identify the key uncertainty contributors among the above sources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the tuckahoe creek watershed tcw on the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed cbw was chosen as the test site fig 1 the tcw is part of one of the focal research sites for the us department of agriculture usda conservation effects assessment project ceap and the long term agroecosystem research ltar network the site is designated as an impaired watershed by the us environmental protection agency usepa which highlights the importance of this site for research activities mccarty et al 2008 wetlands indicated by the us fish and wildlife service usfws national wetlands inventory nwi geospatial dataset occupy 15 5 34 km2 of the tcw 220 km2 riparian wetlands rws and nfws classified by the riparian wetland module rwm see section 2 2 cover 6 13 km2 and 9 5 21 km2 of the study site respectively the high abundance of wetlands in this region has led to numerous efforts to substantiate the hydrologic ecological and biogeochemical benefits provided by wetlands lee et al 2020b hydrologic and biogeochemical processes are anticipated to be significantly altered by climate change in the studied region however wetlands are expected to mitigate such climate change induced fluctuations lee et al 2018b however the responses of wetlands in the region to climate change have rarely been projected our study provides an insight into wetland hydrologic behavior under climate change in this coastal region 2 2 a modified version of swat the swat is a process based hydrologic model designed to evaluate the influence of anthropogenic activities and environmental changes on water resources and associated physical processes within a watershed neitsch et al 2011 the model partitions a watershed into sub watersheds and further into hydrologic response units hrus determined based on a combination of the unique slope land use and soil type all physical processes are simulated at the hru level and model outputs are summed at the sub watershed and watershed scales via routing processes the original swat version can reflect wetland hydrological processes using two default modules wetland and pothole modules the original module was known to oversimplify wetland modeling structure reducing the output reliability lee et al 2020c detailed limitations of the original wetland module are illustrated in the method s1 and fig s1 of the supplementary material this study adopted the modified swat that includes the rwm and non floodplain wetland module nfwm for the improved simulation of wetland hydrological processes lee et al 2018c the rwm developed by liu et al 2008 better characterizes bi directional water exchange between an rw and an adjacent stream segment at the sub watershed scale fig s1b nfws were simulated using the nfwm developed by evenson et al 2015 enabling individual hrus to represent individual nfws or their contributing areas based on the spatial positioning of nfws and improving hydrologic interactions between nfws and drainage areas fig s1 therefore these improved representations better simulated wetland hydrological interactions with contributing areas and nearby streams however the modified swat used in this study is limited to representing spillage from upgradient wetlands to downgradient ones which is the so called fill and spill or fill and merge evenson et al 2018a lane et al 2018 these terms indicate hydrological processes driven by the spillage from upgradient nfws to downgradient ones please refer to leibowitz et al 2016 for further details on these hydrological processes these processes are known to occur to a lesser extent in this region yeo et al 2019b this is supported by other observational studies epting et al 2018 hosen et al 2018 lee et al 2020a phillips and shedlock 1993 therefore catchment level nfw water storage and streamflow might not be significantly affected by disregarding fill and spill or fill and merge processes in this region please refer to liu et al 2008 and evenson et al 2015 for further details on the rwm and nfwm respectively the parameter values used for the two wetland modules were directly adapted from lee et al 2018c further details about the improved wetland module and associated parameter calculations are provided in the method s2 figs s1 s2 tables s2 s3 of the supplementary material 2 3 swat input and climate change data the basic geospatial and climatic data needed to run the swat are listed in table 1 the land use map produced by lee et al 2016 was employed as it includes representative cropping practices for this region the soil map was downloaded from the soil survey geographical database a light detection and ranging lidar driven digital elevation model dem was used to delineate modeling units e g hrus daily observations of precipitation and temperature from 1999 to 2014 were obtained from national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national climate data center ncdc weather stations around the study site chestertown usc00181750 royal oak usc00187806 and greensboro us1mdcl0009 respectively fig 1a the remaining required climatic data i e daily humidity wind speed and solar radiation were prepared using the swat built in weather generator because there were no observations for model calibration and validation daily streamflow data were downloaded from us geological survey usgs gauge 01491500 at the outlet of the tcw fig 1a the projected daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures were obtained from the world climate research program wcrp coupled model intercomparison project5 cmip5 archive brekke et al 2014 eight gcms were prepared for three individual rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 assuming different radiative forcing levels with a range of 2 6 8 5 w m2 at the end of the century taylor et al 2012 the rcps corresponding to 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 indicate representative low medium and high radiative forcing scenarios respectively taylor et al 2012 details of the eight gcms are illustrated in table s4 of the supplementary material for temporal consistency with the historical period 1999 2014 the future period was 2083 2098 this study employed the historical conditions from 1999 to 2014 including a two year warm up period 1999 2000 owing to the unavailability of streamflow observations before 2001 the 14 year simulation period employed herein is shorter than that in other climate change studies nevertheless several studies employ a short baseline period 12 16 years for climate change projections guevara ochoa et al 2020 singh and saravanan 2020 furthermore a study with a shorter simulation period baseline and future periods 5 and 10 years respectively successfully assessed the uncertainties stemming from climate change and hydrologic models her et al 2019 the calibration period of our study 2001 2008 includes representative wet dry and average climate conditions as recommended by the model guidelines arnold et al 2012 similar to the annual precipitation data of the past 30 years 1981 2010 precipitation data over the 8 year calibration period accounted for three representative climate conditions tables s5 s6 supporting the reasoning of this study with the further accumulation of streamflow observations a long term simulation will be conducted bias correction of the raw gcm has been emphasized because of inherent uncertainty such as the overestimation of wet days chen et al 2011b simulation results from the raw gcm provided unrealistic projections of snowmelt driven flow troin et al 2015 evapotranspiration and crop growth lee et al 2018a in this study we performed bias correction using the delta change method presented below wang et al 2014 1 p delta gcm p f u t u r e m o n t h l y ã gcm p b a s e l i n e m

corrected gcm data comparisons of historical and future climate data are made in fig s3 and table s7 of the supplementary material 2 4 model calibration and validation the calibration and validation of a modified swat were executed with a daily time step using streamflow observations over 16 years 2 year warm up 1999 2000 8 year calibration 2001 2008 and 6 year validation 2009 2014 periods previous modeling studies conducted in this region were referenced in selecting 11 streamflow parameters for calibration lee et al 2016 qi et al 2020 sexton et al 2010 tian et al 2014 yeo et al 2014 three thousand different pars were reproduced using latin hypercube sampling which allowed the efficient identification of pars that resulted in acceptable model outputs mckay et al 2000 three goodness of fit measures were used to evaluate swat performance moriasi et al 2007 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean squared error rmse standard deviation ratio rsr and percent bias p bias the three metrics were calculated as follows 5 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 6 rsr rmse stde v obs i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 7 p b i a s i 1 n o i s i 100 i 1 n o i where o i are observed data s i are simulated data o is the observed mean value and n equals the number of observations a parameter set was generally viewed as acceptable when it satisfied the monthly model performance measures outlined in moriasi et al 2007 for example nse 0 5 rsr 0 7 and p bias 25 for daily simulations less strict criteria have been used because daily outputs entail significant streamflow variability leading to more inaccurate values jimeno sáez et al 2018 records et al 2014 yeo et al 2019b this study defined daily performances as acceptable when nse 0 3 and p bias 25 based on previous studies jimeno sáez et al 2018 records et al 2014 yeo et al 2019b twelve pars led to acceptable daily model performances and these pars were used to represent parameter uncertainty each parameter value and its daily performance measures for the 12 acceptable pars are available in supplementary tables s8 s9 respectively the monthly performance measures for the 12 pars are also provided in supplementary table s10 the parameter sensitivity see table 2 was computed using a global sensitivity analysis by obtaining an optimal fit between the objective function and the parameters via linear regression khalid et al 2016 the objective function value was defined as the kge for estimating the et this global sensitivity method estimates the average changes in the objective function relative to the changes in each parameter while simultaneously modifying all other parameters khalid et al 2016 parameter sensitivity increases as the absolute value of the t test increases and the associated p value decreases six of the 11 parameters were found to be sensitive parameters 2 5 comparing streamflow and catchment level nfw water storage under the historical condition and climate change scenarios monthly streamflow and catchment level nfw water storage were used to compare streamflow and nfw water storage under historical and climate change scenarios daily outputs across the 14 year simulation period were aggregated at monthly scales catchment level nfw water storage was calculated by summing the water storage volume of all nfws within the watershed to depict streamflow and nfw water storage under climate change scenarios 2085 2098 12 acceptable pars were forced with eight gcm data for three rcps in total 288 simulations 12 pars eight gcms three rcps were performed fig 2 an ensemble mean was computed for eight gcms and 12 acceptable pars to compare 12 simulations under historical conditions 2001 2014 first an ensemble mean of eight gcm simulations projected from each par was calculated for the three individual rcps 36 gcm ensemble means 12 par three rcps were compared with the corresponding 12 historical simulations fig 2 then an ensemble mean of 12 pars projected from each gcm was also calculated for three individual rcps subsequently 24 par ensemble means eight gcms three rcps were compared with one ensemble mean from 12 historical simulations fig 2 additionally we evaluated the significant difference between the gcm ensemble means and par ensemble means for individual rcps using the kolmogorov smirnov test at p 0 05 2 6 uncertainty assessment our study employed the analysis of variance anova method to quantify the contribution of individual sources to the total uncertainty of monthly streamflow and nfw water storage projections this method has been widely adopted to measure uncertainties from multiple sources such as gcms hydrological models model parameters climate change scenarios and downscaling methods bosshard et al 2013 nover et al 2016 trudel et al 2017 vetter et al 2017 the anova method decomposes the total variance into different sources par gcm and rcp the total sum of squares sst was computed as follows 8 sst i 1 n par j 1 n gcm k 1 n rcp y ijk y ooo 2 where y ijk is the value of the hydrologic component streamflow and catchment scale nfw water storage in this study corresponding to par i gcm j and rcp k respectively

index when the sample size of individual uncertainty sources differs a biased variance is generated bosshard et al 2013 this bias is eliminated by a subsampling method that generates all combinations of the same number of pars gcms and rcps bosshard et al 2013 vetter et al 2017 in this study the combination of three pars three gcms and three rcps was used to set the same sample size for the three uncertainty sources for 12 pars and eight gcms 220 and 56 combinations with three samples were generated respectively in total 12 320 subsamples were applied and each subsample entailed 27 simulations three pars three gcms three rcps after the sum of squares of individual uncertainty sources was calculated for all subsamples the variance fraction η 2 of each uncertainty source was computed as follows as an example η 2 of the parameter set was calculated 17 η par 2 1 12320 m 1 12320 sst par m sst m 100 where m indicates a subsample 3 results and discussions 3 1 monthly streamflow fig 3 shows the gcm ensemble mean of the monthly streamflow simulated from each par the gcm ensemble means were not significantly different from each other p value 0 05 from the kolmogorov smirnov test such ensemble means indicated small differences among rcps 0 7 m3 s 1 for individual pars the largest and smallest monthly streamflow appeared at similar timings respectively for example the largest monthly streamflow was in march par 5 fig 3e and february par 8 fig 3h and the smallest monthly streamflow was in july par 1 fig 3a and august par 2 fig 3b the gcm ensemble means had greater monthly variances than those of the historical values for the 12 pars relative to the range of the historical variance 0 1 1 2 m3 s 1 the ranges were greater for the three rcps rcp 2 6 1 0 2 8 m3 s 1 rcp 4 5 0 9 2 5 m3 s 1 and rcp 8 5 0 9 2 5 m3 s 1 the major contributors that led to greater variance under the three rcps included increases in streamflow from january to april and decreases in streamflow from june to september compared to historical values fig 3 for example the projected streamflow was 3 0 m3 s 1 greater from january to april and 1 0 m3 s 1 lower from june to september than the historical values these results are in good agreement with a previous study reporting that increased precipitation driven by climate change would increase runoff during the winter and spring seasons in the chesapeake bay irby et al 2018 warmer temperatures under the rcps lowered the streamflow from june to september relative to the historical values likely due to intensified et depending on the selection of an acceptable par the changes in monthly streamflow projections relative to the historical values varied substantially fig 3 distinctive relative differences were found between october and december projections historical 6 of 12 pars 2 4 5 10 11 and 12 projections historical 5 of 12 pars 1 3 6 8 and 9 and projections historical 1 par 7 previous studies have also shown different hydrological processes under climate change in response to parameter selection for example ficklin and barnhart 2014 found that the choice of the par shifted the timing of peak snowmelt depth under climate change the results from her et al 2019 indicated the high variability in groundwater contributed to streamflow our study reconfirmed that model parameter uncertainty greatly affects the interpretations of projected climate change impacts on hydrological processes the par ensemble means of monthly streamflow under the rcps are compared with those corresponding to the historical conditions in fig 4 note that the historical value is also an ensemble mean corresponding to the 12 pars similar to the trend of the gcm ensemble means the par ensemble means were greater than the historical values from january to april the monthly variance was also greater under rcp2 6 mean value 1 8 m3 s 1 rcp4 5 mean value 1 7 m3 s 1 and rcp8 5 mean value 1 5 m3 s 1 than that under the historical conditions mean value 0 37 m3 s 1 the par ensemble means indicated larger differences 0 8 2 4 m3 s 1 among the three rcps for individual gcms fig 4 relative to the gcm ensemble means for individual pars fig 3 the relative difference between the projected values and the historical values showed similar patterns among the three rcps particularly the historical values were lower than those corresponding to the three rcps from january to april further the historical values were consistent with those corresponding to the three rcps for the rest of the months fig 4 the degree of relative variation among the values corresponding to the three rcps was different for the gcms for example rcp 4 5 streamflow was greater or lower than rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 streamflow for gcm 2 4 6 and 8 or gcm 1 3 5 and 7 except for two pairs gcm 3 and 8 for rcp 4 5 and gcm 4 and 5 for rcp 8 5 p value 0 05 kolmogorov smirnov test there was no significant difference between the gcms with regard to individual rcps however this finding indicates that the interpretation of climate change impacts varies with respect to the gcms pesce et al 2019 also found a large disparity in projected water quantity and quality variables from simulations with ten different climate model projections monthly projected surface runoff and baseflow highly differ depending on the gcms githui et al 2009 overall our results presented in figs 4 and 5 indicate that high uncertainty in predicting climate change impacts on monthly streamflow projections can be induced owing to the selection of pars gcms and rcps 3 2 monthly catchment level nfw water storage the gcm ensemble means of monthly catchment level nfw water storage are presented along with the historical values in fig 5 the temporal changes in ensemble means were similar to those in the historical values in that nfw water storage was high from november to may and low from june to october further the values corresponding to the three rcp simulations were consistently greater than the historical values for all pars likely due to increased precipitation climate change driven warmer temperatures caused summertime streamflow to be lower than the historical value fig 3 but nfw water storage did not exhibit this hydrologic change fig 5 lee et al 2020a found that in the studied region nfw water levels were correlated with streamflow owing to strong seasonality therefore nfw water storage would exhibit dynamics similar to those of streamflow under the same climatic data the unexpected results were likely caused by the limited ability of the model to consider wetland vegetation impacts nfw water loss by evaporation is simulated as a function of the evaporation coefficient nfw surface area and the leaf area index of the nfw relative to the parameter evlai defined as the leaf area index at which no evaporation occurs from the water surface neitsch et al 2011 evlai is assumed to be uniform for all nfws in the swat and nfw vegetation growth was not well depicted in the nfwm mainly because of limited information the dominant wetland plants deciduous woody species yepsen et al 2014 in this region would consume a substantial amount of water under climate change scenarios with warmer temperatures the reliability of the projections of the hydrologic behavior of nfws under climate change can be improved by carefully considering the effects of the vegetation in nfws par selection exerted substantial impacts on nfw water storage in the historical and rcp scenarios the gcm ensemble means significantly differed for the historical and rcp cases p value 0 5 kolmogorov smirnov test of the 66 combinations the historical condition indicated 41 significant combinations and the three rcps exhibited 48 rcp 2 6 46 rcp 4 5 and 50 rcp 8 5 significant combinations table s11 in particular differences in nfw water storage were large depending on the selection of the par and the difference was larger under rcps relative to that for the historical values for example the nfw water storage values obtained via par 1 were greater than those obtained via par 9 under the historical conditions and rcps by 61 69 and 75 96 104 m3 respectively monthly nfw water storage also significantly differed depending on the gcms fig 6 p value 0 05 kolmogorov smirnov test the rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 results showed 25 significant combinations among the 28 total combinations table s12 overall the historical values were lower than those corresponding to the three rcps but the values corresponding to the three gcms 5 6 and 7 were similar to the historical values furthermore the relative variation between the values corresponding to the three rcps and those corresponding to the historical data also differed depending on the gcms the relative shift of the values corresponding to rcp 8 5 compared to the historical data was lower than and greater than the shift of the values corresponding to the two other rcps for gcm 1 and gcm 3 fig 6ac respectively the results shown in figs 5 and 6 support the assertion that nfw water storage predictions involve high uncertainties arising from pars and gcms overall nfw water storage significantly differed with respect to individual pars gcms and rcps while streamflow did not show significant differences in this region the spatial and temporal patterns of nfws are greatly variable huang et al 2014 jin et al 2017 the sensitive characteristics of nfws can lead to significant differences streamflow is a representative value of hydrological processes within a watershed thus streamflow projections might be less significant under climate change relative to nfws 3 3 decomposing uncertainty sources fig 7 shows the variance fraction η 2 of individual uncertainty sources for the monthly streamflow and catchment level nfw water storage projections the main effects gcm rcp and par account for the majority of the projection uncertainty monthly streamflow η 2 67 84 average value 75 fig 7a and monthly nfw water storage η 2 77 81 average value 79 fig 7b as a single source gcm was the greatest contributor accounting for 31 61 average value 46 and 46 52 average value 49 of the total streamflow and nfw water storage projection uncertainties respectively followed by pars and rcps the uncertainty results comply with those of some previous studies gcm has also been projected to be the dominant source chen et al 2011b galavi et al 2019 kay et al 2009 in contrast some studies have reported that uncertainty stemming from hydrologic models significantly impacts future projections bastola et al 2011 najafi et al 2011 direct comparisons with previous studies were impossible due to differences in landscape characteristics input data projected values uncertainty quantification methods etc according to the type of projected variables such as extreme flow e g low or high flow and future periods far or near futures the uncertainty proportion was also different galavi et al 2019 tian et al 2014 these studies highlighted that projections with increased reliability could be achieved by considering possible uncertainty contributors in addition different sample numbers corresponding to individual uncertainty sources e g gcms or pars might lead to the underestimation or overestimation of uncertainty impacts zhang et al 2014 our study included various uncertainty sources and constrained sample numbers providing useful knowledge for future climate change studies the individual uncertainty source for monthly streamflow was highly variable relative to the uncertainty source for nfw water storage the par and rcp uncertainties of streamflow ranged from 5 to 36 average value 16 and 10 18 average value 13 respectively moreover those of nfw water storage 19 26 average value 23 and 6 8 average value 7 respectively were relatively consistent except for rcp gcm most interaction uncertainty sources had negligible impacts on the total uncertainty the sum of the three other interaction uncertainties par gcm rcp par and rcp gcm par was 2 6 for streamflow and 20 for nfw water storage rcp gcm was also more variable for streamflow prediction 14 28 than for nfw water storage prediction 17 22 catchment level wetland assessments using a hydrologic model are commonly calibrated and validated against only streamflow because of the unavailability of individual wetland data across a landscape evenson et al 2018a 2015 wetland parameters are predefined using default model parameters geospatial analysis or remotely sensed data further the wetland parameters are not adjusted during the calibration validation process lee et al 2018a yeo et al 2019b calibrated parameters were chosen not because of their effects on catchment level nfw storage but because of their effects on streamflow both predefined wetland parameters and the selection of calibrated streamflow parameters collectively led to small variability of the variance fraction η 2 of the par for nfw water storage fig 7b the lack of validation of catchment level nfw water storage may further diminish the accuracy of the uncertainty evaluation of nfw water storage more efforts to collect reliable wetland data and enhance pertinent model algorithms are still needed to attain accurate model predictions for catchment level nfw water storage 4 implications and limitations this study s findings have important implications for the importance of hydrologic model parameters and climate change uncertainty in water resource management this study showed significant variability in the post harvest season october to december streamflow under climate change scenarios depending on the selection of the pars fig 3 nutrient discharge during this season is a major driver of water quality degradation in the coastal plain of the cbw because the soil nutrients retained from crop fertilizers are readily exported to downstream areas due to increased water loads from seasonal et yeo et al 2014 the increased uncertainty of post harvest season streamflow under climate change calls for management tools that can accommodate a wide range of adequate water quality controls determining the climate change uncertainty in water management is critical for providing practical water resource management strategies stakhiv 2011 on average the amount of water stored in nfws is expected to increase under climate change relative to historical values these findings suggest that there will be increased nfw impacts on hydrological biogeochemical and ecological processes under climate change inundated areas and water residence time associated with water storage are key parameters for supporting wetland dependent species battle and golladay 2001 chandler et al 2017 reducing carbon export mitsch and mander 2018 and nutrient loads noe and hupp 2007 and mitigating peak flow in downstream areas jones et al 2018 our simulations suggest that these wetland functions might change under climate change given that the projected nfw water storage fluctuates owing to different uncertainty sources the assessment of future nfw functions should involve various uncertainty factors to provide increased confidence in projections the three rcps projected a similar streamflow although the projected streamflow was significantly different from the historical values figs 4 and 5 these findings are likely due to the ensemble of multiple simulations which can dilute the significant differences among the three rcps if a simulation is performed using one par and one gcm we might observe the hydrologic disparity among different rcps guevara ochoa et al 2020 singh and saravanan 2020 previous studies focusing on uncertainty commonly adopted an ensemble approach chen et al 2011a ficklin and barnhart 2014 her and chaubey 2015 and our study complied well with the prior uncertainty assessments based on the simulated results we can expect changes in wetland water regimes e g inundation depth duration and frequency and resultant ecological impacts increased wetland water storage driven by climate change may lead to composition of a wetland vegetation community one experimental study found that wetland vegetation types significantly differed by water depth because wetland vegetation has different tolerances to water conditions depending on species casanova and brock 2000 at a large scale the distribution of plant communities varied by water regimes and dominant plant communities also differed by inundation depth duration and frequency zhiqiang et al 2016 in addition to water regimes exotic species can affect wetland vegetation compositions due to modified wetland conditions caused by climate change yepsen et al 2014 responses of wetland vegetation to climate change largely remain unknown this aspect should be explored for wetland management and conservation under climate change several efforts for future studies are required to gain increased reliability the modified swat used in this study disregarded specific wetland hydrological processes particularly spill and fill or spill and merge because these processes have a lower likelihood of occurrence in this region a more complete representation of wetland behaviors considering interactions with surrounding areas along flow gradients i e spill and fill or spill and merge would better reflect nfw responses to climate change and the associated uncertainties evenson et al 2018a 2018b 2016 groundwater processes should be further improved to better represent wetland groundwater interactions thereby supporting the interpretation of the wetland hydrology in this region yeo et al 2019b an improved groundwater simulation could provide a better insight into the lag time and amount of groundwater flow from wetlands to downstream water which varies with the spatial distance hydrogeomorphic characteristics and soil conditions ameli and creed 2017 neff and rosenberry 2018 qi et al 2019 this effort would be especially critical in a wetland rich landscape with a high dependence on groundwater flow paths furthermore it is necessary to collect field data to validate wetland parameters such as depth and surface area these data are often unavailable and thus data collection should be included in ongoing efforts to increase modeling predictability lastly the modified swat employed herein required a substantially long simulation time owing to an increased number of modeling units i e hrus a detailed representation of modeling units might improve the overall accuracy to some degree but it might be less worthwhile owing to the requirement of heavy computational resources evenson et al 2016 recent studies have significantly reduced the simulation time by incorporating the concept of a nfw storage threshold into the swat dibike et al 2020 muhammad et al 2020 future studies should use a storage threshold concept to efficiently explore wetland hydrology when considering numerous simulation scenarios or large study areas we have additional notes for future studies as illustrated in the method section this study covered only 14 years due to data availability although this short term period included representative wet dry and average weather conditions compared to the past 30 years however this simulation period is still short relative to other climate change studies and thus this period might represent biased climatic conditions since the period can fall within wet or dry periods this limitation should be involved in the interpretation of our results comparative analysis of bias correction methods should be taken into account for future studies this study chose the delta change method due to its simplicity and robustness shown in previous studies musau et al 2015 shrestha et al 2012 wang et al 2014 the selection of bias correction methods was reported to have substantial impacts on hydrologic variables and a suitable correction method might differ by geographical areas gao et al 2019 therefore application of different bias correction methods is recommended for future studies for the study region considered herein lee et al 2018c performed simulations using a modified swat and found that wetlands served as key features to curtail flooding events by decreasing surface runoff and increasing baseflow increased baseflow led to stabilized downstream water during dry seasons under the current conditions however the manner in which these wetland benefits will vary under climate change remains unknown climate change studies often focus on either uncertainty sources or wetland benefits our future research goal will be to conduct a comparative analysis of wetland benefits under current climate change conditions 5 summary and conclusions quantification of wetland benefits using hydrologic models has been conducted to understand the necessity of wetland protection and management previously hydrologic models and climate change uncertainty were separately considered to provide insights on projected values however the simultaneous investigation of hydrologic model parameters and climate change uncertainties with respect to wetland hydrology has rarely been performed in this study a modified swat coupled with improved wetland modules was employed to explore how model parameter selection and climate change data simultaneously affect streamflow and nfw water storage projections for the coastal plain of the cbw the swat calibrated under historical conditions 2001 2014 was applied to predict climate change driven streamflow and nfw water storage from 2085 to 2098 a total of 12 acceptable pars were employed with eight gcms under three rcps to reflect the uncertainty stemming from model parameters and climate change data the total uncertainty was decomposed into uncertainties arising from individual sources using anova our simulations suggest that applying a single combination of par gcm and rcp to project streamflow and nfw water storage in the studied region should be avoided large differences in monthly streamflow with respect to the pars and gcms were not found but the relative differences between the projected values and the historical values were substantial significant differences due to pars and gcms were observed in the nfw water storage projections and relative variations in addition the rcp values were not consistent across the pars and gcms indicating uncertainties arising from the selection of rcps these findings highlight the need for the concurrent use of multi pars multi gcms and multi rcps for climate change projections the anova results showed that among single sources the largest uncertainty was related to gcms followed by par and rcps gcms contributed 46 and 49 of the total uncertainties of streamflow and nfw water storage respectively uncertainties stemming from par and rcps contributed 16 and 23 of the total streamflow projection uncertainty and 13 and 7 of the total nfw projection uncertainty respectively interaction uncertainty the combination of two or three uncertainty sources only accounted for 25 and 22 of the total streamflow and nfw projection uncertainties respectively this study demonstrates that using a single par gcm and rcp can lead to biased projections of streamflow and nfw water storage under climate change this demonstration has important implications regarding the effect of climate change on water resources it is strongly recommended to identify multiple acceptable pars and apply those pars with different gcms and rcps to climate change projections to obtain better streamflow and nfw hydrology predictions credit authorship contribution statement sangchul lee

4421,the groundwater in the dry climatic agricultural regions of sri lanka has been a focus of research for more than two decades as a likely contributor to the epidemic chronic kidney disease that does not have an identified causality ckdu the intense agriculture that heavily depends on irrigation and excessive use of agrochemicals as well as the increasing population that prompt over extraction and sewage discharge presents increasing threats to these groundwaters particulate organic matter pom stable environmental isotopes 13c 15n 18o and 2h together with hydrochemistry were used to determine the natural and anthropogenic sources of solutes and their dynamics in these waters twenty nine domestic drinking water wells and spring were sampled from ckdu endemic medawachchiya area during the dry season of 2018 pom of most waters were found to have aquatic origin resulted from biological processes that assimilate nutrients in groundwater the isotopic compositions 18o and 15n of nitrate provided evidence for anthropogenic nitrate inputs in some wells and denitrification of potentially anthropogenic nitrates in others these waters were recharged locally and subjected to varying degrees of evaporation the water rock interactions evaporation and anthropogenic inputs significantly influence shallow drinking water quality in wells 4 m below ground surface in contrast deeper domestic drinking wells 4 m below ground surface potentially connect with deep groundwater this study emphasises the importance of the integrated use of pom environmental isotopes and water chemistry in identifying the dynamics of solutes in groundwater thereby determining the overall groundwater quality especially in investigating complex environmental health problems like ckdu keywords ckdu water quality nutrient cycling environmental isotopes particulate organic matter 1 introduction chronic kidney disease ckd that does not have known causality is found as a geographically localised epidemic in many parts of asia central america and sub saharan africa paho 2017 webster et al 2017 known as chronic kidney disease of unknown origin ckdu in sri lanka the disease is widespread among agricultural communities in relatively dry climatic areas rainfall 1250 mm year 1 ranasinghe et al 2019 wijewickrama et al 2019 despite 20 years of research causality of the kidney disease is yet to be determined ckdu results in serious human health issues as well as livelihood concerns and is widespread among poor middle age farmers ranasinghe et al 2019 risk factors studied in the scientific literature related to the occurrence of ckdu include genetics occupational exposure and viral infections friedman and luyckx 2019 gamage et al 2017 gunarathna et al 2018 jayasumana et al 2015 nanayakkara et al 2020 sarathkumara et al 2019 wesseling et al 2016 the majority of causal factors are however related to the quality of shallow groundwater pinto et al 2020 which is the drinking water source for nearly 80 of the population panabokke et al 2005 currently there is minimal drinking water treatment in these areas and communities rely on domestic drinking water wells accessing groundwater cooray et al 2019 among water quality issues discussed in relation to the occurrence of ckdu are high fluoride f concentration high hardness metal pollutants agrochemicals and combinations of these hydrochemical characteristics chandrajith et al 2011 jayasumana et al 2014b levine et al 2016 nikagolla et al 2020 wanigasuriya et al 2011 wasana et al 2016 wimalawansa 2016 the dissolved organic carbon doc makehelwala et al 2020 and cyanotoxins liyanage et al 2016 in drinking water as well as different sources of groundwater edirisinghe et al 2018 have also been discussed as risk factors for ckdu although the chemistry of groundwater in ckdu endemic areas has been studied an advanced hydrochemical study using environmental isotopes and groundwater chemistry combined with particulate organic matter pom characteristics that allows identification of sources and dynamics of solutes especially potential contaminants of concern have not yet been undertaken in ckdu areas identifying characteristics of pom in groundwater can provide useful information on biological activities that influence dynamics of nutrients in groundwater systems biological processes influence the groundwater chemistry by utilising nutrients including dissolved inorganic carbon dic dissolved organic carbon doc and nitrates fiorentino et al 2017 kendall and aravena 2000 mcdonough et al 2020b during these processes isotope fractionation occurs influencing the isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon δ13cdic and nitrates δ15nno3 and δ18o no3 in the water studies have shown that the δ15nno3 and δ 18ono3 values can provide vital information on nitrogen sources and thus on potential anthropogenic contamination processes in groundwater nikolenko et al 2018 ransom et al 2016 rainwater that infiltrates to recharge groundwater generally inherits the δ13cdic composition of the soil gas co2 contained within the soil zone which is then altered by number of geochemical processes such as carbonate dissolution influencing the chemistry of groundwater clark and fritz 1997 water rock interactions between the recharging groundwater and the aquifer are main processes that influence the concentrations of major ions in groundwater in natural systems elango and kannan 2007 furthermore the δ18o and δ2h values can be used to determine the evaporation history of the groundwater prior to groundwater recharge considering the abovementioned processes environmental isotopes and hydrochemistry in combination with pom are powerful tools that can be used to accurately characterise the quality of groundwater by understanding the processes and mechanisms that may have occurred to form the resultant groundwater for an area studied the aim of this study was to determine a new approach to accurately characterise the sources and the fate of carbon nitrogen major anions and cations in domestic drinking water wells of a ckdu endemic medawachchiya area sri lanka the hypothesis of this study was that a comprehensive suite of analyses is needed to characterise the water quality of the dry zone agricultural areas and identify natural and anthropogenic processes the source and fate of nutrients carbon and nitrogen sources of the groundwater and hydrochemical processes leading to the observed well water chemistry sampled were explored to answer questions related to how land use practises are influencing the drinking water in a ckdu affected catchment this investigation was the first to use a suite of environmental tracers such as δ15nno3 and δ18o no3 as well as δ15npom δ13cpom and c npom in groundwater used for drinking in sri lanka and provides valuable insights the study could also provide essential knowledge for designing sustainable water treatment solutions for providing safe drinking water in the area 2 materials and methods 2 1 environmental setting sri lanka is a tropical island in indian ocean located between 60 and 100 northings and longitudes 79 and 81 easting the island subdivided into three climatic zones the wet intermediate and dry dependent on the annual rainfall fig 1 ckdu is widespread in the dry zone of the country where annual rainfall is 1250 mm year 1 the average temperature for the area is 27 c and the average humidity of 70 dcssl 2017 the area experiences two distinct seasons throughout the year wet and dry october to february is the wet season when the inter monsoonal rain and north east ne monsoon are active the basement geology of sri lanka is subdivided into four distinct lithological units based on age metamorphic grades and geology namely the highland vijayan wanni and kadunaggawa cooray 1994 medawachchiya is located in the wanni complex which consists of metamorphic rocks such as charnockitic gneiss garnet biotite gneisses garnet cordierite gneiss and hornblende biotite gneisses minor quartzite and marble outcrops are also found in the area quartz feldspar hornblende and biotite are some of the major mineral constituents hirayama et al 2020 the groundwater is susceptible to contamination from a number of complex environmental issues associated with human activities the livelihood of most of the people in medawachchiya is farming rice is the main crop and rainfed dryland vegetables and cereals are also cultivated in cleared forest areas chena cultivation homesteads with crops such as lime coconut pepper banana and traditional and small scale animal husbandry especially water buffalo and cattle are also common in the area paddy is cultivated two times a year and is irrigated by human made reservoirs tanks that act as a cascade system which stores and distributes rainwater for irrigation bebermeier et al 2017 the area studied includes seven medium scale cascade systems and 312 small scale cascade systems spreading over 161 ha and irrigating 1371 ha of paddy most of these cascades overflow during the wet season the tank cascades are thought to have significant control over the recharge into shallow aquifers the groundwater table in the area is at the surface during the wet season and decreases by 3 5 m below the ground surface bgs during the dry season domestic drinking water wells 2 10 m in depth with a diameter of 2 3 m extract water from shallow regolith aquifers for both domestic and irrigation purpose there are approximately 5427 domestic drinking water wells and 2258 agricultural wells located in the area there are also 324 deep wells approximately 60 m in depth located within the fractured bedrock aquifers used for domestic purposes divisional secretariat 2018 the shallow groundwater of the area has been characterised as a ca cl to mixed water types mcdonough et al 2020a the waters are hard with total alkalinities that range between 41 2 mg

analysis were collected in 60 ml hdpe bottles and acidified with 0 2 ml of hcl the δ2h and δ18o samples were collected in duplicate into 30 ml hdpe bottles approximately 2 l of water was passed through a pre treated 0 7 µm glass filter paper for pom the filter papers were removed and frozen immediately after sampling samples for δ13cdic were collected in pre treated 12 ml glass gas tight vials with no headspace sample bottles were rinsed three times before sampling all sample processing and preservation were performed following the united state geological society usgs standard

concentrations were calculated using the wateq4f thermodynamic database in the phreeqc 2 4 2 programme parkhurst and appelo 1999 the δ2h δ18o and δ13c isotope methods are described in meredith et al 2012 and meredith et al 2015 2 3 results table 1 presents a description of each site including distances to potential point sources of nutrients and surface water bodies physical observation of the wells and the colour and presence of aquatic plants in water 2 4 characteristics of particulate organic matter the averages and ranges of δ15n δ13c and c n values of pom are given in table 2 the δ15npom values ranged between 1 2 and 16 0 with an average of 7 4 n 25 over 20 of samples had δ15npom values between 2 0 and 7 0 which is the average range for terrestrial plants or soil organic matter kendall and aravena 2000 all other samples had δ15npom values 7 0 which is the range for aquatic plant planktons and macrophytes materials fig 2 a the δ13cpom values ranged between 43 1 and 27 0 and the c n ratio vary between 26 8 and 56 4 with an average of 37 1 n 28 the δ13cpom of terrestrial sources and aquatic plants can be similar fig 2b however the δ15npom together with δ13cpom and c n provides useful information on pom sources contained in water in these wells 2 5 stable environmental isotopes in water the δ15n and δ18o isotopic composition of no3 in water is shown in fig 3 the δ15nno3 of samples ranged between 6 7 and 29 4 while δ18ono3 values ranged between 13 8 and 29 4 fig 3 the spring had a δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 composition of 7 5 and 14 5 respectively which is in the range of soil no3 inorganic fertilisers have δ15n and δ18o values that range from 4 0 to 4 0 0 and 18 0 to 22 0 respectively kendall and aravena 2000 few samples l4 l6 l13 l19 l22 and l25 had δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 within or close to this range suggesting possible fertiliser contaminations only one sample l16 had δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values 10 3 and 13 8 respectively in the range of manure and sewage the rest of the samples had enriched δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values compared to known sources given in fig 3 the δ13cdic of well waters ranged from 18 9 to 11 6 and the spring had the most depleted value of 23 5 nikagolla et al 2020 found similar δ13cdic values for the domestic and spring water in the area the variation of stable water isotopes δ2h and δ18o is shown in fig 4 the average δ2h and δ18o values for groundwater in the area were 26 9 and 4 17 respectively n 30 over 60 of samples plotted along or close to the global meteoric water line gmwl and the remaining along a regression line of δ2h 4 9 δ18o 6 2 2 6 geochemistry the physicochemical parameters and hydrochemistry are given in table 3 and highlight the variability between sample sites shallow groundwater samples were fresh to brackish with ec values that ranged between 467 µs cm 1 and 2095 µs cm 1 the united states environmental protection agency usepa 2009 applies a tds level of 500 mg l 1 as a secondary drinking water guideline based on palatability which is a converted ec value of 782µs cm 1 lenntech 2010 nearly 80 of the samples from this study exceed this epa secondary drinking water guideline for palatability well water samples had higher alkalinity 1 50 mmol l 1 7 70 mmol l 1 compared to that of spring water 0 41 mmol l 1 the f concentration of domestic well waters ranged between 0 03 mmol l 1 and 0 20 mmol l 1 and 0 004 mmoll 1 for the spring water nearly 60 of waters exceed the sri lankan portable water standards slis 2013 for f 0 05 mmol l 1 and 31 exceeded the who standards 0 08 mmol l 1 other studies also reported high concentrations of f in the area and it had been discussed in relation to the occurrence of ckdu and dental fluorosis chandrajith et al 2011 dissanayake and chandrajith 2007 compared to potable water standards in sri lanka 72 of samples had an excess of mg concentration 17 of sample had ca concentration and 3 5 of samples had sodium na concentration of in excess over 7 of samples had cl concentrations above the potable water standards of sri lanka the molar cl br ratios of waters ranged between 300 and 1100 and cl concentration ranged between 2 7 mmol l 1 and 8 7 mmol l 1 manganese mn concentration of over 17 of samples also exceeded the sri lankan portable water guidelines potentially hazardous trace element concentrations including cd as and pb were below the detection limit in these samples only 5 samples had u concentrations above the detection limit with the highest of 0 02 µmol l 1 over 66 of water samples had cr concentration above the detection limit with the highest concentration of 0 04 µmol l 1 2 µg l 1 both u and cr values were below the who safe drinking water standards 0 13 µmol l 1 and 0 96 µmol l 1 respectively who 2017 3 discussion the sources and fate of nutrients evaporation processes and the evolution of water quality will be discussed in this section although the lithology hydrology and land use pattern were considered in selecting sample locations all domestic well waters will be discussed as one data set and the spring will be discussed separately 3 1 nitrogen and carbon processes typical terrestrial sources of pom in water are from soil organics and leaf debris but in stream sources are from phytoplankton algae and macrophytes the different sources have characteristic δ15npom δ13cpom and c n values kendall et al 2001 only few samples l2 l7 l8 l13 l16 and l28 had similar δ15npom values fig 2a in the range of terrestrial sources these samples also had δ13cpom values in the range of pom dominated by terrestrial plant or soil organic matter 32 to 22 fig 2b the field observations conducted at the time of sampling showed that these samples were obtained from wells that did not appear to have algae mats table 1 the isotopic signatures and the lack of surface algae suggest that the pom of samples from l2 l7 l8 l13 l16 and l28 were terrestrial organic matter the high c n of the pom 40 fig 2c may indicate that these terrestrial organic matter are decaying kendall et al 2001 as expected from a deep groundwater sample the pom of the spring also comprised of decaying terrestrial organic matter as evidenced by δ13cpom of 27 8 and c n of 56 4 the δ15npom and δ13cpom values of the remaining samples were in the range of aquatic plants 7 and between 42 to 24 respectively suggesting the pom has resulted from aquatic plants the c n ratios for these samples are close to 30 the wide range of δ13cpom is likely to reflect the various transported and insitu sources of organic carbon in the wells because they are open to atmospheric sources and are also receiving carbon from the groundwaters the c n ratio of pom that is derived from freshwater planktons ranges from 5 to 8 kendall et al 2001 the observed c n ratios suggest that the aquatic organic matter was derived from cyanobacteria or macrophytes field observations table 1 and the presence of cyanotoxins found by mcdonough et al 2020a in the same domestic drinking water wells confirmed the presence of cyanobacteria in these waters the δ15npom values were enriched compared to δ15nno3 may further explain the biological processes occurred in these waters the incorporation of n bearing compounds into organisms to produce organic matter is referred to as assimilation kendall and aravena 2000 assimilation can result in high δ15nno3 values in water compared to δ15npom the isotopic discrimination occurs during the assimilation process and results in δ15n being enriched in the inorganic no3 source and the δ15n depleted in the organic nitrogen products fig 2a and d the isotope fractionation between δ15nno3 and δ15npom is small when no3 concentration is low in the waters kendall et al 2001 the area is known for its agrochemical use and interestingly only 31 of water samples had no3 concentrations above the detection limit 0 008 mmol l 1 with a maximum of 0 2 mmol l 1 fig 2e a number of studies also found low no3 concentrations in ckdu endemic areas nikagolla et al 2020 rubasinghe et al 2015a wickremasinghe et al 2011 the absence of no3 in the water doesn t indicate that these waters were not impacted by no3 contamination nitrate is highly mobile and can transform to different n species such as no2 nh4 and organic nitrogen nikolenko et al 2018 therefore the isotopes and c n ratio of pom were used to provide evidence to suggest that the assimilation process which converts inorganic nitrates to organic nitrogen could be a process that explains why the groundwater in this agricultural region has low nitrate concentrations denitrification is another key process that may lead to low concentration of nitrates in these waters and the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 isotopes were used to identify where this process is occurring burgin and hamilton 2007 nikolenko et al 2018 over two third of our samples had enriched δ15n and δ18o of no3 values compared to the published values of sources such as fertiliser nh4 and no3 sewage or soil no3 denitrification can lead to such enriched δ15nno3 and δ18o no3 values nikolenko et al 2018 baily et al 2011 found δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values up to 32 4 and 21 2 respectively in shallow groundwaters as a result of the denitrification of inorganic fertiliser the denitrification process also results in an enrichment of δ15nno3 to δ18ono3 ratio close to 2 1 kendall and aravena 2000 our results plot close to a line with a slope of 0 5 fig 3 the presence of no2 in groundwaters in the study area average 0 04 mmol l 1 n 5 also suggests denitrification because the production of no2 is an intermediate product of the multistep denitrification process fig 2e the isotopic signatures of n sources can be similar and there are many potential sources of nitrogen in this study site including from raw sewage from unlined wet latrine systems cattle manure and synthetic fertilizers in the region the results presented in this study suggest that the no3 from these sources may have been denitrified and this explains why the no3 concentrations are so low in this study and the study by nikagolla et al 2020 the δ15npom and c n ratio of pom provides evidence for the incorporation of n bearing compounds into organisms to produce organic matter assimilation process the low concentrations of no3 observed in this study are likely to have resulted from microbial uptake during the denitrification and assimilation processes it is recommended that in future studies focus on time series sampling for no3 at a higher frequency to help quantify the no3 contamination in these drinking waters further determining the δ15n and δ18o values of the fertilizer sewage and manure would lead to a clearer identification of the nitrogen sources in these waters the character of pom also reveals important information on emerging threats to the water quality in the area aquatic organisms such as algae may thrive in these environments that are open to atmospheric interaction and light whereby utilising the no3 and dic sources from carbonate dissolution and plant respiration kendall et al 2001 the terrestrial organic matter in the water can also be subject to methanogenesis especially when there is high demand for do as the aquatic plants grow these processes can potentially lead to eutrophication of the well waters also cyanotoxins may build up and remain in high concentrations presenting threats to the health of well water consumers further studies into doc can provide detail understanding on these processes 3 2 inorganic carbon the variation of hco3 with ca and mg may be used to understand main inorganic carbon sources the molar concentration of hco3 did not correlate with molar ca concentration but correlated with the sum of ca and mg molar concentrations fig 5 a b r 0 624 the main source hco3 in these water may be calcite dissolution and the weak correlations fig 5b possibly due to the influence of microbial activities on dic the weathering of silicate minerals such as anorthite caal2si3o8 consume soil co2 shifting dic species towards hco3 eq 1 the hco3 concentration accounts for 60 94 of dic in domestic well waters the dissolution of carbonate and silicate minerals may therefore contribute to the high hco3 concentration mcdonough et al 2021b in the spring water hco3 concentration accounts only for 3 8 of the dic and co2 aq accounts for 96 of the dic this may indicate that the spring water is hydrochemically immature and is similar to rainfall bottrell et al 2019 1 caa l 2 s i 2 o 8 2 c o 2 a q 3 h 2 o c a 2 a l 2 s i 2 o 5 oh 4 2 h c o 3 the variation of δ13cdic with the concentration of dic given in fig 6 also provides important information on dic sources the groundwater recharged from infiltrating rainwater will inherit the δ13c signature of soil zone co2 24 0 clark and fritz 1997 by the dissolution of soil zone co2 and then evolve by weathering carbonates have δ13c signature close to 0 and carbonate dissolution adds heavy δ13c into the groundwater the enriched δ13cdic values 18 9 to 11 6 compared to soil co2 is suggests minor carbonate dissolution processes or that the δ13cdic has been fractionated by other processes the poor correlation between δ13cdic and dic fig 6 r 0 42 may indicate dic sources other than carbonates possibly microbial processes also contribute to the dic the wide range of δ13cdic values in these waters is likely to result from various stages of dic evolution using strontium sr isotopic ratios and mass balance modelling mcdonough et al 2021a also confirmed the carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering respectively in the area interestingly the spring water which is considered the deeper uncontaminated water has a δ13cdic value close to soil gas co2 23 5 the low ph 4 92 and hco3 0 83 mmol l 1 compared to other samples also confirmed that the spring water had not been buffered beyond soil co2 dissolution 3 3 source of groundwater direct groundwater recharge from rainfall will inherit the isotopic composition of the local rainfall craig 1961 long term δ2h and δ18o data of precipitation were unavailable for the medawachchiya area therefore the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 was used to compare the groundwaters with precipitation in this study the spring sample δ2h and δ18o plotted slightly below gmwl suggesting the spring water has a rainfall origin but may have experienced minor evaporation the waters that plot below the gmwl are likely to have experienced evaporation this may be from direct open water evaporation from open wells that are in contact with the atmosphere similarly recharge and infiltration of evaporated surface water can result in isotopically enriched water which deviate from the gmwl wickramarathna et al 2017 the ec of with surface water bodies such as tanks and irrigation channels in dry zone areas of sri lanka were below 400 µs cm 1 edirisinghe et al 2018 waters that are hydraulically connected to these surface waters may therefore have low salinity waters due to mixing and dilution of fresh surface water especially in wells located close to the surface however our findings show that groundwater ec is higher close to the surface bgs 4 m 1000 µs cm 1 and decreases 400 µs cm 1 with depth bgs 4 m this suggests that the wells have a limited direct connection with the surface water sources in the area at the time of sampling therefore it is highly unlikely that the enriched isotopic values in these waters resulted from the infiltration of evaporated surface water the evaporation from open wells further evidenced by the slope s of the regression line 4 9 along which the evaporated groundwaters plot in the δ2h and δ18o graph fig 4 a slope close to 5 is expected in high humid areas like the dry zone of sri lanka where humidity is close to 75 clark and fritz 1997 further shallow evaporated groundwaters have a wide range of δ18o 1 to 5 5 values this may indicate that the well waters have experienced various stages of evaporation controlled by site specific environmental factors and volumes of water contained in the wells when sampled edirisinghe et al 2018 found that several samples from domestic wells in the ckdu endemic dry zone are regional groundwater with δ2h and δ18o values less than 6 4 and 38 5 respectively however we did not see evidence for the domestic drinking water wells sampled in this study being connected with the regional groundwater system the δ2h and δ18o values suggested that shallow groundwaters in medawachchiya are recharged from local rainfall and some have been subjected to different degrees of open water evaporation further studies on groundwater residence times using 3h isotopes in the catchment will help to confirm this finding 3 4 evolution of water quality the ec of the samples show clear variations with the depth bgs of the wells decrease in ec with depth bgs indicates that deeper groundwater may be fresher than in the shallow regolith aquifers the higher ec close to the surface is more likely to be resulted from unsaturated zone processes such as water rock interactions and agrochemical and sewage inputs than evapo concentration the major ion chemistry and their relationships provide strong evidence for the water rock interactions of the area the variation in f concentration with na and mg is given in fig 7 f concentration is correlated with na and mg r 0 76 and 0 59 respectively fig 7a b this suggested that f na and mg have similar sources geology of the area consists of gneisses rich in biotite and hornblende weathering of these gneisses could be the source of high f in these groundwaters this finding is consistent with the findings of rubasinghe et al 2015b and young et al 2011 the mg ca na cl and br relationships are shown in fig 8 high mg cl and ca cl ratios with low cl concentrations also suggest mineral weathering if there is no other source of contamination fig 8a c feldspar anorthite biotite and hornblende are some of the mg and ca silicate minerals commonly found in the basement rocks of the region kitano et al 2018 weathering of these minerals have the potential to add ca and mg into shallow groundwaters hofmann and cartwright 2013 mg calcite dissolution also adds ca and mg which was evidenced by the δ13cdic and relationships between ca mg and hco3 figs 5 and 6 the higher na cl ratio than rainfall or marine sources indicates an excess of na in the groundwater relative to cl fig 8c weathering of silicate minerals such as albite naalsi3o8 ion exchange between mg and na and fertilizer are common na sources ion exchange between mg and na can result in high na cl ratios with high cl concentrations however in these waters high na cl was observed with low cl concentrations suggesting silicate weathering as the probable source of na petrides et al 2006 high cl concentrations 3 5 mmol l 1 were found in samples l2 l7 l12 l16 l23 and l27 compared to the rest of the samples these samples also had high cl br molar ratios 700 1000 fig 8d stable water isotopes of l12 were relatively enriched and plotted away from the gmwl in fig 4 and had high ec 1499 µs cm 1 indicating that the sample has experienced evaporation the higher cl concentration of l12 may therefore results from evaporation enrichment l2 l7 l23 and l27 plot close to the gmwl indicating that these waters have not experienced intense evaporation the high cl concentrations 6 48 mmol l 1 5 15 mmol l 1 and 6 92 mmol l 1 respectively along with high concentrations of mn 4 8 µmol l 1 0 1 µmol l 1 and 1 9 µmol l 1 respectively and high ec between 1200 µs cm 1 and 1900 µs cm 1 of sample l2 l7 and l27 may therefore results from agrochemicals inputs the high cl concentration 8 73 mmol l 1 of l16 bgs 3 5 m with high ec 1877 µs cm 1 may indicate possible sewage contaminations which was also evidenced by the isotopic composition of no3 fig 3 further studies into cl isotopes are required to confirm this finding potentially hazardous trace elements such as cd as and pb in groundwater have been discussed as a causal factor for ckdu in the area jayasumana et al 2014a nanayakkara et al 2019 a number of studies including this study confirmed that the well waters were not contaminated with potentially hazardous trace elements cooray et al 2019 nikagolla et al 2020 wickramarathna et al 2017 based on the potable water guidelines for sri lanka most of the well waters sampled from the medawachchiya area can be classified as poor quality high concentrations of f alkalinity mn and ec were found to be major concerns the deep wells bgs 4 m and spring water may connect with deep groundwater water resulting in good quality waters according to the sri lankan portable water guideline values the drinking water chemistry has resulted from a range of hydrochemical processes including silicate weathering dissolution of carbonates evaporation and anthropogenic impacts although the influence of these physicochemical properties on ckdu is yet to be determined the observed water chemistry requires treatment before consumption 4 conclusion in complex environmental settings where human activities such as agriculture irrigation extraction of groundwater and sanitation practices influence the groundwater determining water quality is challenging for such waters a comprehensive suite of analysis including pom characterisation environmental isotopes and water chemistry is required to characterise the water quality and understand the dynamics of the solutes especially potential contaminants of concern in this study the characteristics of pom isotopic compositions of 13cdic δ15nno3 δ18o no3 δ18o and δ2h as well as hydrochemistry were used the study identified that these open domestic drinking water wells are subjected to the growth of aquatic organisms and this may increase health hazards the isotopic composition of the nitrates suggests that some of these waters are contaminated with anthropogenic inputs such as agrochemicals and sewage the stable groundwater isotopes suggests that these waters are locally recharged and subjected to evaporation which is controlled by site specific local factors the hydrochemical data may suggest the influence of site specific factors such as evaporation water rock interactions and contaminations that impact quality of these waters the deeper wells that have lower ec tds and lower trace element concentration indicate that deeper wells may be connected with deep groundwater whereas water from the shallow wells are influenced by the unsaturated zone processes such as anthropogenic inputs evaporation and water rock interactions study limitations include the sampling timeframe the study was conducted in the dry season an additional sampling round in the wet season is required to identify trends in the chemical and isotopic composition of waters in the wet season further studies into the groundwater resident time using tritium will help distinguish between shallow groundwaters that are locally recharged and fed by the deep groundwater systems and verify current findings this study has significantly advanced our understanding of the source of drinking water and how nutrients are cycling within a ckdu impacted catchment in sri lanka by using isotopic tracers it was discovered that the natural hydrochemical processes together with anthropogenic processes influence the drinking water quality of the area more importantly the study emphasises the importance of a comprehensive suite of analyses including geochemical and stable environmental isotopic tracers and pom characteristics in investigating the water quality in complex environmental settings especially in relation to complicated environmental health problems such as ckdu credit authorship contribution statement chandima nikagolla conceptualization methodology investigation data

4421,the groundwater in the dry climatic agricultural regions of sri lanka has been a focus of research for more than two decades as a likely contributor to the epidemic chronic kidney disease that does not have an identified causality ckdu the intense agriculture that heavily depends on irrigation and excessive use of agrochemicals as well as the increasing population that prompt over extraction and sewage discharge presents increasing threats to these groundwaters particulate organic matter pom stable environmental isotopes 13c 15n 18o and 2h together with hydrochemistry were used to determine the natural and anthropogenic sources of solutes and their dynamics in these waters twenty nine domestic drinking water wells and spring were sampled from ckdu endemic medawachchiya area during the dry season of 2018 pom of most waters were found to have aquatic origin resulted from biological processes that assimilate nutrients in groundwater the isotopic compositions 18o and 15n of nitrate provided evidence for anthropogenic nitrate inputs in some wells and denitrification of potentially anthropogenic nitrates in others these waters were recharged locally and subjected to varying degrees of evaporation the water rock interactions evaporation and anthropogenic inputs significantly influence shallow drinking water quality in wells 4 m below ground surface in contrast deeper domestic drinking wells 4 m below ground surface potentially connect with deep groundwater this study emphasises the importance of the integrated use of pom environmental isotopes and water chemistry in identifying the dynamics of solutes in groundwater thereby determining the overall groundwater quality especially in investigating complex environmental health problems like ckdu keywords ckdu water quality nutrient cycling environmental isotopes particulate organic matter 1 introduction chronic kidney disease ckd that does not have known causality is found as a geographically localised epidemic in many parts of asia central america and sub saharan africa paho 2017 webster et al 2017 known as chronic kidney disease of unknown origin ckdu in sri lanka the disease is widespread among agricultural communities in relatively dry climatic areas rainfall 1250 mm year 1 ranasinghe et al 2019 wijewickrama et al 2019 despite 20 years of research causality of the kidney disease is yet to be determined ckdu results in serious human health issues as well as livelihood concerns and is widespread among poor middle age farmers ranasinghe et al 2019 risk factors studied in the scientific literature related to the occurrence of ckdu include genetics occupational exposure and viral infections friedman and luyckx 2019 gamage et al 2017 gunarathna et al 2018 jayasumana et al 2015 nanayakkara et al 2020 sarathkumara et al 2019 wesseling et al 2016 the majority of causal factors are however related to the quality of shallow groundwater pinto et al 2020 which is the drinking water source for nearly 80 of the population panabokke et al 2005 currently there is minimal drinking water treatment in these areas and communities rely on domestic drinking water wells accessing groundwater cooray et al 2019 among water quality issues discussed in relation to the occurrence of ckdu are high fluoride f concentration high hardness metal pollutants agrochemicals and combinations of these hydrochemical characteristics chandrajith et al 2011 jayasumana et al 2014b levine et al 2016 nikagolla et al 2020 wanigasuriya et al 2011 wasana et al 2016 wimalawansa 2016 the dissolved organic carbon doc makehelwala et al 2020 and cyanotoxins liyanage et al 2016 in drinking water as well as different sources of groundwater edirisinghe et al 2018 have also been discussed as risk factors for ckdu although the chemistry of groundwater in ckdu endemic areas has been studied an advanced hydrochemical study using environmental isotopes and groundwater chemistry combined with particulate organic matter pom characteristics that allows identification of sources and dynamics of solutes especially potential contaminants of concern have not yet been undertaken in ckdu areas identifying characteristics of pom in groundwater can provide useful information on biological activities that influence dynamics of nutrients in groundwater systems biological processes influence the groundwater chemistry by utilising nutrients including dissolved inorganic carbon dic dissolved organic carbon doc and nitrates fiorentino et al 2017 kendall and aravena 2000 mcdonough et al 2020b during these processes isotope fractionation occurs influencing the isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon δ13cdic and nitrates δ15nno3 and δ18o no3 in the water studies have shown that the δ15nno3 and δ 18ono3 values can provide vital information on nitrogen sources and thus on potential anthropogenic contamination processes in groundwater nikolenko et al 2018 ransom et al 2016 rainwater that infiltrates to recharge groundwater generally inherits the δ13cdic composition of the soil gas co2 contained within the soil zone which is then altered by number of geochemical processes such as carbonate dissolution influencing the chemistry of groundwater clark and fritz 1997 water rock interactions between the recharging groundwater and the aquifer are main processes that influence the concentrations of major ions in groundwater in natural systems elango and kannan 2007 furthermore the δ18o and δ2h values can be used to determine the evaporation history of the groundwater prior to groundwater recharge considering the abovementioned processes environmental isotopes and hydrochemistry in combination with pom are powerful tools that can be used to accurately characterise the quality of groundwater by understanding the processes and mechanisms that may have occurred to form the resultant groundwater for an area studied the aim of this study was to determine a new approach to accurately characterise the sources and the fate of carbon nitrogen major anions and cations in domestic drinking water wells of a ckdu endemic medawachchiya area sri lanka the hypothesis of this study was that a comprehensive suite of analyses is needed to characterise the water quality of the dry zone agricultural areas and identify natural and anthropogenic processes the source and fate of nutrients carbon and nitrogen sources of the groundwater and hydrochemical processes leading to the observed well water chemistry sampled were explored to answer questions related to how land use practises are influencing the drinking water in a ckdu affected catchment this investigation was the first to use a suite of environmental tracers such as δ15nno3 and δ18o no3 as well as δ15npom δ13cpom and c npom in groundwater used for drinking in sri lanka and provides valuable insights the study could also provide essential knowledge for designing sustainable water treatment solutions for providing safe drinking water in the area 2 materials and methods 2 1 environmental setting sri lanka is a tropical island in indian ocean located between 60 and 100 northings and longitudes 79 and 81 easting the island subdivided into three climatic zones the wet intermediate and dry dependent on the annual rainfall fig 1 ckdu is widespread in the dry zone of the country where annual rainfall is 1250 mm year 1 the average temperature for the area is 27 c and the average humidity of 70 dcssl 2017 the area experiences two distinct seasons throughout the year wet and dry october to february is the wet season when the inter monsoonal rain and north east ne monsoon are active the basement geology of sri lanka is subdivided into four distinct lithological units based on age metamorphic grades and geology namely the highland vijayan wanni and kadunaggawa cooray 1994 medawachchiya is located in the wanni complex which consists of metamorphic rocks such as charnockitic gneiss garnet biotite gneisses garnet cordierite gneiss and hornblende biotite gneisses minor quartzite and marble outcrops are also found in the area quartz feldspar hornblende and biotite are some of the major mineral constituents hirayama et al 2020 the groundwater is susceptible to contamination from a number of complex environmental issues associated with human activities the livelihood of most of the people in medawachchiya is farming rice is the main crop and rainfed dryland vegetables and cereals are also cultivated in cleared forest areas chena cultivation homesteads with crops such as lime coconut pepper banana and traditional and small scale animal husbandry especially water buffalo and cattle are also common in the area paddy is cultivated two times a year and is irrigated by human made reservoirs tanks that act as a cascade system which stores and distributes rainwater for irrigation bebermeier et al 2017 the area studied includes seven medium scale cascade systems and 312 small scale cascade systems spreading over 161 ha and irrigating 1371 ha of paddy most of these cascades overflow during the wet season the tank cascades are thought to have significant control over the recharge into shallow aquifers the groundwater table in the area is at the surface during the wet season and decreases by 3 5 m below the ground surface bgs during the dry season domestic

2012 and meredith et al 2015 2 3 results table 1 presents a description of each site including distances to potential point sources of nutrients and surface water bodies physical observation of the wells and the colour and presence of aquatic plants in water 2 4 characteristics of particulate organic matter the averages and ranges of δ15n δ13c and c n values of pom are given in table 2 the δ15npom values ranged between 1 2 and 16 0 with an average of 7 4 n 25 over 20 of samples had δ15npom values between 2 0 and 7 0 which is the average range for terrestrial plants or soil organic matter kendall and aravena 2000 all other samples had δ15npom values 7 0 which is the range for aquatic plant planktons and macrophytes materials fig 2 a the δ13cpom values ranged between 43 1 and 27 0 and the c n ratio vary between 26 8 and 56 4 with an average of 37 1 n 28 the δ13cpom of terrestrial sources and aquatic plants can be similar fig 2b however the δ15npom together with δ13cpom and c n provides useful information on pom sources contained in water in these wells 2 5 stable environmental isotopes in water the δ15n and δ18o isotopic composition of no3 in water is shown in fig 3 the δ15nno3 of samples ranged between 6 7 and 29 4 while δ18ono3 values ranged between 13 8 and 29 4 fig 3 the spring had a δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 composition of 7 5 and 14 5 respectively which is in the range of soil no3 inorganic fertilisers have δ15n and δ18o values that range from 4 0 to 4 0 0 and 18 0 to 22 0 respectively kendall and aravena 2000 few samples l4 l6 l13 l19 l22 and l25 had δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 within or close to this range suggesting possible fertiliser contaminations only one sample l16 had δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values 10 3 and 13 8 respectively in the range of manure and sewage the rest of the samples had enriched δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values compared to known sources given in fig 3 the δ13cdic of well waters ranged from 18 9 to 11 6 and the spring had the most depleted value of 23 5 nikagolla et al 2020 found similar δ13cdic values for the domestic and spring water in the area the variation of stable water isotopes δ2h and δ18o is shown in fig 4 the average δ2h and δ18o values for groundwater in the area were 26 9 and 4 17 respectively n 30 over 60 of samples plotted along or close to the global meteoric water line gmwl and the remaining along a regression line of δ2h 4 9 δ18o 6 2 2 6 geochemistry the physicochemical parameters and hydrochemistry are given in table 3 and highlight the variability between sample sites shallow groundwater samples were fresh to brackish with ec values that ranged between 467 µs cm 1 and 2095 µs cm 1 the united states environmental protection agency usepa 2009 applies a tds level of 500 mg l 1 as a secondary drinking water guideline based on palatability which is a converted ec value of 782µs cm 1 lenntech 2010 nearly 80 of the samples from this study exceed this epa secondary drinking water guideline for palatability well water samples had higher alkalinity 1 50 mmol l 1 7 70 mmol l 1 compared to that of spring water 0 41 mmol l 1 the f concentration of domestic well waters ranged between 0 03 mmol l 1 and 0 20 mmol l 1 and 0 004 mmoll 1 for the spring water nearly 60 of waters exceed the sri lankan portable water standards slis 2013 for f 0 05 mmol l 1 and 31 exceeded the who standards 0 08 mmol l 1 other studies also reported high concentrations of f in the area and it had been discussed in relation to the occurrence of ckdu and dental fluorosis chandrajith et al 2011 dissanayake and chandrajith 2007 compared to potable water standards in sri lanka 72 of samples had an excess of mg concentration 17 of sample had ca concentration and 3 5 of samples had sodium na concentration of in excess over 7 of samples had cl concentrations above the potable water standards of sri lanka the molar cl br ratios of waters ranged between 300 and 1100 and cl concentration ranged between 2 7 mmol l 1 and 8 7 mmol l 1 manganese mn concentration of over 17 of samples also exceeded the sri lankan portable water guidelines potentially hazardous trace element concentrations including cd as and pb were below the detection limit in these samples only 5 samples had u concentrations above the detection limit with the highest of 0 02 µmol l 1 over 66 of water samples had cr concentration above the detection limit with the highest concentration of 0 04 µmol l 1 2 µg l 1 both u and cr values were below the who safe drinking water standards 0 13 µmol l 1 and 0 96 µmol l 1 respectively who 2017 3 discussion the sources and fate of nutrients evaporation processes and the evolution of water quality will be discussed in this section although the lithology hydrology and land use pattern were considered in selecting sample locations all domestic well waters will be discussed as one data set and the spring will be discussed separately 3 1 nitrogen and carbon processes typical terrestrial sources of pom in water are from soil organics and leaf debris but in stream sources are from phytoplankton algae and macrophytes the different sources have characteristic δ15npom δ13cpom and c n values kendall et al 2001 only few samples l2 l7 l8 l13 l16 and l28 had similar δ15npom values fig 2a in the range of terrestrial sources these samples also had δ13cpom values in the range of pom dominated by terrestrial plant or soil organic matter 32 to 22 fig 2b the field observations conducted at the time of sampling showed that these samples were obtained from wells that did not appear to have algae mats table 1 the isotopic signatures and the lack of surface algae suggest that the pom of samples from l2 l7 l8 l13 l16 and l28 were terrestrial organic matter the high c n of the pom 40 fig 2c may indicate that these terrestrial organic matter are decaying kendall et al 2001 as expected from a deep groundwater sample the pom of the spring also comprised of decaying terrestrial organic matter as evidenced by δ13cpom of 27 8 and c n of 56 4 the δ15npom and δ13cpom values of the remaining samples were in the range of aquatic plants 7 and between 42 to 24 respectively suggesting the pom has resulted from aquatic plants the c n ratios for these samples are close to 30 the wide range of δ13cpom is likely to reflect the various transported and insitu sources of organic carbon in the wells because they are open to atmospheric sources and are also receiving carbon from the groundwaters the c n ratio of pom that is derived from freshwater planktons ranges from 5 to 8 kendall et al 2001 the observed c n ratios suggest that the aquatic organic matter was derived from cyanobacteria or macrophytes field observations table 1 and the presence of cyanotoxins found by mcdonough et al 2020a in the same domestic drinking water wells confirmed the presence of cyanobacteria in these waters the δ15npom values were enriched compared to δ15nno3 may further explain the biological processes occurred in these waters the incorporation of n bearing compounds into organisms to produce organic matter is referred to as assimilation kendall and aravena 2000 assimilation can result in high δ15nno3 values in water compared to δ15npom the isotopic discrimination occurs during the assimilation process and results in δ15n being enriched in the inorganic no3 source and the δ15n depleted in the organic nitrogen products fig 2a and d the isotope fractionation between δ15nno3 and δ15npom is small when no3 concentration is low in the waters kendall et al 2001 the area is known for its agrochemical use and interestingly only 31 of water samples had no3 concentrations above the detection limit 0 008 mmol l 1 with a maximum of 0 2 mmol l 1 fig 2e a number of studies also found low no3 concentrations in ckdu endemic areas nikagolla et al 2020 rubasinghe et al 2015a wickremasinghe et al 2011 the absence of no3 in the water doesn t indicate that these waters were not impacted by no3 contamination nitrate is highly mobile and can transform to different n species such as no2 nh4 and organic nitrogen nikolenko et al 2018 therefore the isotopes and c n ratio of pom were used to provide evidence to suggest that the assimilation process which converts inorganic nitrates to organic nitrogen could be a process that explains why the groundwater in this agricultural region has low nitrate concentrations denitrification is another key process that may lead to low concentration of nitrates in these waters and the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 isotopes were used to identify where this process is occurring burgin and hamilton 2007 nikolenko et al 2018 over two third of our samples had enriched δ15n and δ18o of no3 values compared to the published values of sources such as fertiliser nh4 and no3 sewage or soil no3 denitrification can lead to such enriched δ15nno3 and δ18o no3 values nikolenko et al 2018 baily et al 2011 found δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values up to 32 4 and 21 2 respectively in shallow groundwaters as a result of the denitrification of inorganic fertiliser the denitrification process also results in an enrichment of δ15nno3 to δ18ono3 ratio close to 2 1 kendall and aravena 2000 our results plot close to a line with a slope of 0 5 fig 3 the presence of no2 in groundwaters in the study area average 0 04 mmol l 1 n 5 also suggests denitrification because the production of no2 is an intermediate product of the multistep denitrification process fig 2e the isotopic signatures of n sources can be similar and there are many potential sources of nitrogen in this study site including from raw sewage from unlined wet latrine systems cattle manure and synthetic fertilizers in the region the results presented in this study suggest that the no3 from these sources may have been denitrified and this explains why the no3 concentrations are so low in this study and the study by nikagolla et al 2020 the δ15npom and c n ratio of pom provides evidence for the incorporation of n bearing compounds into organisms to produce organic matter assimilation process the low concentrations of no3 observed in this study are likely to have resulted from microbial uptake during the denitrification and assimilation processes it is recommended that in future studies focus on time series sampling for no3 at a higher frequency to help quantify the no3 contamination in these drinking waters further determining the δ15n and δ18o values of the fertilizer sewage and manure would lead to a clearer identification of the nitrogen sources in these waters the character of pom also reveals important information on emerging threats to the water quality in the area aquatic organisms such as algae may thrive in these environments that are open to atmospheric interaction and light whereby utilising the no3 and dic sources from carbonate dissolution and plant respiration kendall et al 2001 the terrestrial organic matter in the water can also be subject to methanogenesis especially when there is high demand for do as the aquatic plants grow these processes can potentially lead to eutrophication of the well waters also cyanotoxins may build up and remain in high concentrations presenting threats to the health of well water consumers further studies into doc can provide detail understanding on these processes 3 2 inorganic carbon the variation of hco3 with ca and mg may be used to understand main inorganic carbon sources the molar concentration of hco3 did not correlate with molar ca concentration but correlated with the sum of ca and mg molar concentrations fig 5 a b r 0 624 the main source hco3 in these water may be calcite dissolution and the weak correlations fig 5b possibly due to the influence of microbial activities on dic the weathering of silicate minerals such as anorthite caal2si3o8 consume soil co2 shifting dic species towards hco3 eq 1 the hco3 concentration accounts for 60 94 of dic in domestic well waters the dissolution of carbonate and silicate minerals may therefore contribute to the high hco3 concentration mcdonough et al 2021b in the spring water hco3 concentration accounts only for 3 8 of the dic and co2 aq accounts for 96 of the dic this may indicate that the spring water is hydrochemically immature and is similar to rainfall bottrell et al 2019 1 caa l 2 s i 2 o 8 2 c o 2 a q 3 h 2 o c a 2 a l 2 s i 2 o 5 oh 4 2 h c o 3 the variation of δ13cdic with the concentration of dic given in fig 6 also provides important information on dic sources the groundwater recharged from infiltrating rainwater will inherit the δ13c signature of soil zone co2 24 0 clark and fritz 1997 by the dissolution of soil zone co2 and then evolve by weathering carbonates have δ13c signature close to 0 and carbonate dissolution adds heavy δ13c into the groundwater the enriched δ13cdic values 18 9 to 11 6 compared to soil co2 is suggests minor carbonate dissolution processes or that the δ13cdic has been fractionated by other processes the poor correlation between δ13cdic and dic fig 6 r 0 42 may indicate dic sources other than carbonates possibly microbial processes also contribute to the dic the wide range of δ13cdic values in these waters is likely to result from various stages of dic evolution using strontium sr isotopic ratios and mass balance modelling mcdonough et al 2021a also confirmed the carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering respectively in the area interestingly the spring water which is considered the deeper uncontaminated water has a δ13cdic value close to soil gas co2 23 5 the low ph 4 92 and hco3 0 83 mmol l 1 compared to other samples also confirmed that the spring water had not been buffered beyond soil co2 dissolution 3 3 source of groundwater direct groundwater recharge from rainfall will inherit the isotopic composition of the local rainfall craig 1961 long term δ2h and δ18o data of precipitation were unavailable for the medawachchiya area therefore the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 was used to compare the groundwaters with precipitation in this study the spring sample δ2h and δ18o plotted slightly below gmwl suggesting the spring water has a rainfall origin but may have experienced minor evaporation the waters that plot below the gmwl are likely to have experienced evaporation this may be from direct open water evaporation from open wells that are in contact with the atmosphere similarly recharge and infiltration of evaporated surface water can result in isotopically enriched water which deviate from the gmwl wickramarathna et al 2017 the ec of with surface water bodies such as tanks and irrigation channels in dry zone areas of sri lanka were below 400 µs cm 1 edirisinghe et al 2018 waters that are hydraulically connected to these surface waters may therefore have low salinity waters due to mixing and dilution of fresh surface water especially in wells located close to the surface however our findings show that groundwater ec is higher close to the surface bgs 4 m 1000 µs cm 1 and decreases 400 µs cm 1 with depth bgs 4 m this suggests that the wells have a limited direct connection with the surface water sources in the area at the time of sampling therefore it is highly unlikely that the enriched isotopic values in these waters resulted from the infiltration of evaporated surface water the evaporation from open wells further evidenced by the slope s of the regression line 4 9 along which the evaporated groundwaters plot in the δ2h and δ18o graph fig 4 a slope close to 5 is expected in high humid areas like the dry zone of sri lanka where humidity is close to 75 clark and fritz 1997 further shallow evaporated groundwaters have a wide range of δ18o 1 to 5 5 values this may indicate that the well waters have experienced various stages of evaporation controlled by site specific environmental factors and volumes of water contained in the wells when sampled edirisinghe et al 2018 found that several samples from domestic wells in the ckdu endemic dry zone are regional groundwater with δ2h and δ18o values less than 6 4 and 38 5 respectively however we did not see evidence for the domestic drinking water wells sampled in this study being connected with the regional groundwater system the δ2h and δ18o values suggested that shallow groundwaters in medawachchiya are recharged from local rainfall and some have been subjected to different degrees of open water evaporation further studies on groundwater residence times using 3h isotopes in the catchment will help to confirm this finding 3 4 evolution of water quality the ec of the samples show clear variations with the depth bgs of the wells decrease in ec with depth bgs indicates that deeper groundwater may be fresher than in the shallow regolith aquifers the higher ec close to the surface is more likely to be resulted from unsaturated zone processes such as water rock interactions and agrochemical and sewage inputs than evapo concentration the major ion chemistry and their relationships provide strong evidence for the water rock interactions of the area the variation in f concentration with na and mg is given in fig 7 f concentration is correlated with na and mg r 0 76 and 0 59 respectively fig 7a b this suggested that f na and mg have similar sources geology of the area consists of gneisses rich in biotite and hornblende weathering of these gneisses could be the source of high f in these groundwaters this finding is consistent with the findings of rubasinghe et al 2015b and young et al 2011 the mg ca na cl and br relationships are shown in fig 8 high mg cl and ca cl ratios with low cl concentrations also suggest mineral weathering if there is no other source of contamination fig 8a c feldspar anorthite biotite and hornblende are some of the mg and ca silicate minerals commonly found in the basement rocks of the region kitano et al 2018 weathering of these minerals have the potential to add ca and mg into shallow groundwaters hofmann and cartwright 2013 mg calcite dissolution also adds ca and mg which was evidenced by the δ13cdic and relationships between ca mg and hco3 figs 5 and 6 the higher na cl ratio than rainfall or marine sources indicates an excess of na in the groundwater relative to cl fig 8c weathering of silicate minerals such as albite naalsi3o8 ion exchange between mg and na and fertilizer are common na sources ion exchange between mg and na can result in high na cl ratios with high cl concentrations however in these waters high na cl was observed with low cl concentrations suggesting silicate weathering as the probable source of na petrides et al 2006 high cl concentrations 3 5 mmol l 1 were found in samples l2 l7 l12 l16 l23 and l27 compared to the rest of the samples these samples also had high cl br molar ratios 700 1000 fig 8d stable water isotopes of l12 were relatively enriched and plotted away from the gmwl in fig 4 and had high ec 1499 µs cm 1 indicating that the sample has experienced evaporation the higher cl concentration of l12 may therefore results from evaporation enrichment l2 l7 l23 and l27 plot close to the gmwl indicating that these waters have not experienced intense evaporation the high cl concentrations 6 48 mmol l 1 5 15 mmol l 1 and 6 92 mmol l 1 respectively along with high concentrations of mn 4 8 µmol l 1 0 1 µmol l 1 and 1 9 µmol l 1 respectively and high ec between 1200 µs cm 1 and 1900 µs cm 1 of sample l2 l7 and l27 may therefore results from agrochemicals inputs the high cl concentration 8 73 mmol l 1 of l16 bgs 3 5 m with high ec 1877 µs cm 1 may indicate possible sewage contaminations which was also evidenced by the isotopic composition of no3 fig 3 further studies into cl isotopes are required to confirm this finding potentially hazardous trace elements such as cd as and pb in groundwater have been discussed as a causal factor for ckdu in the area jayasumana et al 2014a nanayakkara et al 2019 a number of studies including this study confirmed that the well waters were not contaminated with potentially hazardous trace elements cooray et al 2019 nikagolla et al 2020 wickramarathna et al 2017 based on the potable water guidelines for sri lanka most of the well waters sampled from the medawachchiya area can be classified as poor quality high concentrations of f alkalinity mn and ec were found to be major concerns the deep wells bgs 4 m and spring water may connect with deep groundwater water resulting in good quality waters according to the sri lankan portable water guideline values the drinking water chemistry has resulted from a range of hydrochemical processes including silicate weathering dissolution of carbonates evaporation and anthropogenic impacts although the influence of these physicochemical properties on ckdu is yet to be determined the observed water chemistry requires treatment before consumption 4 conclusion in complex environmental settings where human activities such as agriculture irrigation extraction of groundwater and sanitation practices influence the groundwater determining water quality is challenging for such waters a comprehensive suite of analysis including pom characterisation environmental isotopes and water chemistry is required to characterise the water quality and understand the dynamics of the solutes especially potential contaminants of concern in this study the characteristics of pom isotopic compositions of 13cdic δ15nno3 δ18o no3 δ18o and δ2h as well as hydrochemistry were used the study identified that these open domestic drinking water wells are subjected to the growth of aquatic organisms and this may increase health hazards the isotopic composition of the nitrates suggests that some of these waters are contaminated with anthropogenic inputs such as agrochemicals and sewage the stable groundwater isotopes suggests that these waters are locally recharged and subjected to evaporation which is controlled by site specific local factors the hydrochemical data may suggest the influence of site specific factors such as evaporation water rock interactions and contaminations that impact quality of these waters the deeper wells that have lower ec tds and lower trace element concentration indicate that deeper wells may be connected with deep groundwater whereas water from the shallow wells are influenced by the unsaturated zone processes such as anthropogenic inputs evaporation and water rock interactions study limitations include the sampling timeframe the study was conducted in the dry season an additional sampling round in the wet season is required to identify trends in the chemical and isotopic composition of waters in the wet season further studies into the groundwater resident time using tritium will help distinguish between shallow groundwaters that are locally recharged and fed by the deep groundwater systems and verify current findings this study has significantly advanced our understanding of the source of drinking water and how nutrients are cycling within a ckdu impacted catchment in sri lanka by using isotopic tracers it was discovered that the natural hydrochemical processes together with anthropogenic processes influence the drinking water quality of the area more importantly the study emphasises the importance of a comprehensive suite of analyses including geochemical and stable environmental isotopic tracers and pom characteristics in investigating the water quality in complex environmental settings especially in relation to complicated environmental health problems such as ckdu credit authorship contribution statement chandima nikagolla conceptualization methodology investigation data

4422,the construction and operation of reservoirs arise the problems in downstream river of hydrological regime alteration and threat to freshwater biodiversity currently most researches on reservoir operation model considering downstream ecology just quantify single ecological objective which is difficult to reflect the downstream ecological demands comprehensively to address the challenges above this paper divides the parameters in indicators of hydrological alteration iha a widely used tool reflecting flow regime from multiple perspectives but seldom applied to guide practice reservoir operation into two categories to reflect ecological demands of water quantity and fluctuation respectively then two ecological objectives of water quantity level wql and hydrological alteration ha are defined to be incorporated into reservoir operation model with the economic objective of hydropower production hp for generating optimal operation strategy coordinating economic and ecological benefits the case study of a typical reservoir in hunan province china shows that 1 two ecological objectives defined can reflect the alteration of hydrological regime from the perspective of water quantity and fluctuation accurately and 2 compared with historical operation strategy and optimal operation strategies in the other two scenarios the optimal operation strategy in scenario c is proved an excellent strategy to guide operation practice reconciling the economic benefits of hydropower plant with the ecological benefits of downstream river which can balance two objectives of wql and ha well with high level hp and make the released flow maintain more regime of natural flow keywords indicators of hydrological alteration water quantity level hydrological alteration hydrological regime optimal operation strategy 1 introduction reservoirs have the ability of regulating water in space and time flexibly and play a fundamental role in development through benefits of hydropower production flood control water supply and so on tilmant et al 2010 however the primary goal of conventional reservoir operation strategy is to maximize the utilization of water resources and economic benefits while ignore the influence from the operation of reservoirs on downstream ecology resulting in the alteration of natural flow regime and different degrees of damage to river ecosystem nilsson et al 2005 chen and olden 2017 lu et al 2018 dong et al 2020 hence to restore the downstream ecology reservoir operation should reconcile the economic benefits of hydropower plant with the ecological benefits of downstream river on which many studies have been carried out in recent years jager and smith 2008 chen and olden 2017 jiang et al 2019 the researches of reservoir operation considering the downstream ecology can be divided into two categories wang et al 2015 one is to calculate the environmental flow downstream with the techniques of hydrological methods e g tennant tennant 1976 10 maf operacz et al 2018 and rva methods richter et al 1996 hydraulic methods e g the wetted perimeter method and the r2cross method ye et al 2013 and habitat simulation methods e g the instream flow incremental method and river2d method zhang et al 2019 as the constraint of reservoir operation model another is to quantify the downstream ecological demands and regard it as the objective of operation model with the economic benefits e g hydropower production tsai et al 2015 li et al 2018 suwal et al 2020 the former is to maximize the economic benefits on the premise of meeting constraints from ecological demands thus the different operation strategies achieved can t be compared by ecological benefits in fact the select of operation strategy should balance the conflicts between economic and ecological objectives zhang et al 2019 thus the latter is more effective on guide practice in reservoir operation considering ecology the key of which is how to define the ecological objective and coordinate it with economic objective however most researches on the latter only quantify a single objective as the ecological objective of operation model which is hard to reflect the different demands of downstream ecology it has been well proved that flow is one of the key factors influencing riverine structure function and ecology richter et al 1996 poff et al 1997 bunn and arthington 2002 considering that construction and operation of reservoirs mainly alter the natural flow series and then influence the ecology downstream thus restoring the natural flow regime is a frequently used approach to meet the ecological demands dittmann et al 2009 shiau and wu 2013 the indicators of hydrological alteration iha richter et al 1996 richter et al 1997 composed of 33 parameters is a widely used tool for expressing flow regime from magnitude duration time timing of extreme flow and frequency gao et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2017 achieving hydrological parameters from iha to define ecological objective is a promising and effective way which can be easy to implement where there is little ecological data barbour et al 2016 however it is difficult that apply iha parameters directly as objective or constrain of reservoir operation model due to the complexities and substantial cross correlation among these 33 parameters to solve the problem above and define reasonable objectives wang et al 2015 put forward an intermediate metric with linear combination of some iha parameters e g monthly flows and magnitude of extreme flow and apply the metric to operation model li et al 2018 formulated all 33 parameters quantitatively into the objectives or constraints of operation model and defined the objective of eco index by the main parameters selected nonetheless most of ecological objectives defined by current researches are not universal due to the differences in different regions in addition the complex relationships between iha parameters and different ecological demands downstream have not been considered explicitly resulting in the incompleteness of ecological objectives defined and difficulty in applying these objectives to guide practice operation to address the problem above this paper optimizes reservoir operation considering different ecological demands of downstream based on iha parameters the three main contributions of this paper are as follow 1 explores the general process of defining ecological objectives and can be applied to most reservoirs 2 defines two different ecological objectives of wql and ha considering the ecological demands of water quantity and fluctuation by iha parameters and ensure the integrity of the objectives defined 3 incorporates the ecological objectives into reservoir operation model and searches for optimal reservoir operation strategy coordinating economic and ecological benefits the organization structure of the paper is as follow section 2 introduces the methods section 3 carries out a case study and conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 methods 2 1 framework defining scientific and reasonable ecological objectives is the premise for optimizing reservoir operation considering ecology of downstream which is yet given insufficient attention and remains a major challenge of incorporating ecological objectives into reservoir operation barbour et al 2016 to address this challenge the framework of this paper includes two steps shown in fig 1 1 define ecological objectives and constraints 2 incorporate the ecological objectives and constraints defined above into reservoir operation model with the economic objective and adopt appropriate methods to solve the model in different scenarios for optimal reservoir operation strategies specifically to reflect different ecological demands and make clear the ecological explanation of parameters selected this paper divides iha parameters into different categories for the definition of ecological objectives and constraints the parameter named number of zero flow days is used as the ecological constrain of optimal reservoir operation model the parameters remained are divided into two parts and defined as two objectives of water quantity level wql and hydrological alteration ha considering the demands of water quantity and fluctuation respectively with different methods seen in section 2 2 then the ecological objectives and constraints are incorporated into reservoir operation model with the economic objective of hydropower production hp and the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii which is an effective algorithm solving multi objectives problem is adopted to search for optimal reservoir operation strategies in different scenarios scenario a b c seen in section 2 3 2 2 defining ecological objectives and constraints in general defining ecological objectives and constraints need solve three problems below 1 select parameters related ecology 2 use appropriate method to quantify ecological objectives based on parameters selected 3 provide the criteria to measure the relationship between value quantified above and ecology and show how much is good or bad for ecology to solve the three problems above all parameters selected in this paper are based on iha which is consist of five groups related to ecology explicitly with a total of 33 parameters shown in table 1 in terms of ecological constraints considering there is no zero flow days occurring in natural flow of study area and the downstream ecology will be seriously damaged when the flow is zero so this paper sets a minimum release flow as the ecological constraint to ensure that there is no zero flow days downstream in terms of ecological objectives this paper defines ecological objectives by the 32 parameters except the parameter of number of zero flow days in group 2 in order to show different ecological demands by different objectives and avoid using a single objective li et al 2018 suwal et al 2020 which can t reflect clear ecological explanation this paper puts forward the assumption that the parameters of different scales can reflect different ecological demands of downstream specifically large scale parameter describing objects in a wide perspective can t show the detail variable process of objects while small scale parameter can for example take the flow series as the object the monthly scale parameter of mean flow can t describe the flow variable process in detail but represent the water quantity each month the daily scale parameter such as extreme flow and rate of change can show some details about variable process of flow series in a word large scale parameters reflect the information of quantity while small scale parameter reflect the information of fluctuation based on analysis above the paper holds that the flow series meeting the demands of river ecology should include two aspects one is to ensure the water quantity of flow series and another is that each hydrological parameter in iha calculated by flow series fluctuates within an acceptable range reflecting the demands of quantity and fluctuation respectively through the feature analysis of all 32 parameters it can be found that the scales of 12 mean monthly flows in group 1 belong to the monthly while the 20 parameters remained can be considered as the daily the former can be used to quantify the ecological objective of wql by fuzzy evaluation based on the standard of tennant details in section 2 2 1 and main parameters extracted from latter by principal component analysis pca method will be combined with the weights set based on contribution rate of each pc to quantify the ecological objective of ha details in section 2 2 2 2 2 1 water quantity level water quantity level wql is defined by 12 mean monthly flow to reflect the water quantity demands of ecology each mean monthly flow above can be evaluated according to the tennant method tennant 1976 which is the most widely used method for evaluating e flows tharme 2003 d ambrosio et al 2018 by eight standards of severe degradation poor fair good excellent outstanding optimum range flushing or maximum and then the question comes that how to evaluate the flow series composed of 12 mean monthly flow it is obvious that different assessment results will appear in different months for example the mean flow in jan belongs to the range of poor while the mean flow in feb belongs to the range of good so the evaluation of flow series above can be seen as a multiple criteria decision making mcdm process and is solved with the method of fuzzy evaluation in this paper which uses the membership degree of fuzzy mathematics to make an overall evaluation of things or objects restricted by many factors and is widely applied in the area of evaluation yu et al 2015 mardani et al 2019 the steps of defining wql is below step1 construct the standard matrix for evaluation of flow series based on the standard of tennant the tennant method provides only one value in some standards while provides one range in other standards karakoyun et al 2016 for example the optimum range gives the range of 0 6 x x while flushing or maximum just give one value of 2 x considering the above inconsistencies this paper provides eight ranges for two periods of dry and flood season respectively as below and the matched descriptions are severe degradation poor fair good outstanding optimum range beyond optimum range flushing or maximum the two periods above of dry and flood season are set from oct to mar and from apr to sept respectively which is consistent with the division of tennant considering the definition of wql is based on the standard tennant other division criteria may not work in this paper 1 y 1 0 1 x 0 1 x 0 2 x 0 2 x 0 3 x 0 3 x 0 4 x 0 4 x 0 6 x 0 6 x x x 2 x 2 x 2 y 2 0 1 x 0 1 x 0 3 x 0 3 x 0 4 x 0 4 x 0 5 x 0 5 x 0 6 x 0 6 x x x 2 x 2 x where y 1 and y 2 are the eight flow ranges for two periods of dry season and flood season respectively x is average annual flow according to the method of fuzzy evaluation this paper takes middle value as the typical value of range to calculate the membership degree in step2 therefore eqs 1 and 2 above can be transferred to eqs 3 and 4 as below 3 y dry 0 1 x 0 15 x 0 25 x 0 35 x 0 5 x 0 8 x 1 5 x 2 x 4 y flood 0 1 x 0 2 x 0 3 5 x 0 4 5 x 0 5 5 x 0 8 x 1 5 x 2 x where y dry and y flood are typical value vector of each range for dry and flood season respectively and they can make up the standard matrix y together as eq 5 for evaluation of flow series 5 y y 1 y 2 y m y i y 11 y 12 y 1 c y 21 y 22 y 2 c y m 1 y m 2 y mc y ik where y is the standard matrix compose of typical value vector y i when i 1 3 or 10 12 y i y dry when i 4 9 y i y flood m is 12 the number of months c is 8 the number of levels and y ik is the typical value of i th month of k th level step 2 calculate the membership degree of each level for flow series by month with the standard matrix y take the i th month flow q i of flow series q as example suppose q i is between k th level and k 1 th level and then the membership degree of k th level and k 1 th level can be calculated as below 6 μ ik q y i k 1 q i y i k 1 y ik μ i k 1 q 1 μ ik q where μ ik q and μ i k 1 q are the membership degree of k th level and k 1 th level respectively the membership degree of other level is zero step3 calculate the weight of each mean month flow with the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation critic method critic is a widely used objective weighting method which can comprehensively reflect the variability and cross correlations between indicators yang et al 2017 in this paper the weight of each mean month flow can be calculated with critic as below 7 c j σ j i 1 m 1 r ij 8 w j c j j 1 m c j where σ j is the standard deviation of j th indicator r ij is the correlation coefficient between i th indicator and j th indicator w j the weight of j th indicator step4 calculate the cumulative membership degree of each level for flow series 9 v l q i 1 m w i μ il q where v l q is the cumulative membership degree of l th level step5 calculate the value reflecting the level of flow series 10 δ q l 1 c v l q l where δ q is used to define water quantity level wql to reflect the level of flow series q the larger value is the higher level is the wql includes eight levels from 1 to 8 corresponding to eight flow ranges from poor to flushing or maximum it should be noted that the first six ranges based on tennant meet the rule that the higher level is the better ecology is while the other two ranges don t the seventh range is beyond the optimal range but it still meets the ecological flow demands so this paper supposes its level is slightly lower than optimal range and give the value of 5 the eighth range exceeds the allowable maximum and will damage the ecology so this paper supposes the level is poor and give the value of 1 in general when l 7 l 5 when l 8 l 1 otherwise l l through the modification above there will be a positive correlation between wql and ecology that the value of wql is higher the ecology of downstream is better 2 2 2 hydrological alteration hydrological alteration ha is defined by 22 parameters remained reflecting the information of flow series from the perspective of fluctuation considering the substantial cross correlation among that 22 indicators to reduce the dimension and remain the original information as much as possible by less parameters this paper uses pca to extract the main parameters and then calculates ha of flow series by the weighted mean value of the changing ratio of parameters extracted as below it is the alteration of flow regime that affects the downstream ecology so keeping the stabilization of flow regime is beneficial for downstream ecology and the smaller value is the lower alteration is the better ecology of downstream is 11 ξ i q z i z i z i 12 ξ q i 1 n ω i ξ i q where ξ i q is the alteration of i th parameter extracted by pca and ξ q is the alteration of flow series q z i is i th parameter of flow series n is total number of parameters extracted ω i is the weight of the i th parameter calculated by the contribution rate of the i th principal component li et al 2018 2 3 optimization model the ecology of downstream should be considered together with the economy of power plant in reservoir operation model so this paper takes the hydropower production hp water quantity level wql and hydrological alteration ha as the objectives of reservoir operation model and adds the minimum release flow constraint to avoid the appearance of zero flow days 2 3 1 objectives 1 ecological objectives wql and ha are used to reflect the alteration of hydrological regime according to the analysis in section 2 2 the value of wql is higher and the value of ha is lower the ecology of downstream is better so the ecological objectives are below 13 wql max δ q max δ q s h a min ξ q min ξ q s where q is the released flow including the generation flow q and spill flow s 2 economical objectives hp reflects the economy of power plant and the reservoir operation strategy should improve the hp as much as possible so the economic objective is below 14 hp max e q max t 1 t k q t h t up h t down δ t where k is the output coefficient of power plant q t h t up h t down are the generation flow average reservoir water level and downstream tailwater level of t th day respectively 2 3 2 constraints reservoir operation should obey the operation regulations and physical constraints such as water balance constraint water storage constraint and released flow constraint the mathematical expressions of constraints are shown as below 1 water balance constraint 15 v t 1 v t q t in q t out δ t where v t 1 and v t are beginning and ending storage of the reservoir on day t q t in and q t out are the net inflow and net outflow on day t the value of δ t is the seconds of a day 2 water storage constraint 16 v t min v t v t max where v t min and v t max are the minimum and maximum storage allowed on day t 3 released flow constraint 17 q t min q t out q t max where q t min and q t max are the minimum and maximum released flow allowed on day t q t min is set to ensure there is no zero flow days downstream 4 output constraint the hydropower station output should be within the guaranteed output and the installed capacity 18 n g k q t h t up h t down n max where n g is the guaranteed output and n max is the installed capacity 2 3 3 solving technique considering the complex objectives and various physical constraints this paper uses nsga ii deb et al 2002 an effective algorithm solving multi objective problem with the advantages of a fast running speed and good convergence of the solution set and implemented successfully in solving various water resources management issues chang and chang 2009 zheng et al 2014 tsai et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 to solve the model above which can be summarized into the following steps ① take 365 daily reservoir water levels of a year as the decision variables and initializes the population of size n based on the physical constraints of reservoir operation ② calculate the ecological objectives of wql ha and economic objective of hp for each chromosome and sort by non dominated strategy ③ select excellent chromosome from population non dominated as parent chromosome and create child chromosome by the cross and mutation operation ④ combine the parent chromosome with the child chromosome and update the population by non dominated strategy ⑤ repeat the four steps above until the number of iterations is reached 3 case study 3 1 study area and data under the tide of reservoir construction in 1970s and 1980s many small hydropower plants have been built one by one on the river in china there are many small hydropower plants on the same river from upstream to downstream and the conventional operation strategy of these plants is to pursue economic benefits but ignore the preserve of ecology for downstream which arises many serious ecological problems considering there is little ecological data but abundant flow data in most small hydropower plants so the model and method proposed in this paper is more promising to address the ecological problems and restore the downstream ecology of such plants the liujiaping hydropower plant a typical small hydropower plant located in hunan province china between 110 39 e 110 43 e and 27 27 n 27 30 n as shown in fig 2 is selected to verify the rationality and reliability of the model and methods promised above including two parts of sections 3 2 and 3 3 the liujiaping reservoir has a total length of 21 km and a drainage area of 53 63 km2 and is the leading reservoir at the upstream of the liujiaping river the liujiaping hydropower plant located about 3 km downstream of the dam is a medium sized hydropower plant with the guaranteed output of 7 5 mw and the installed capacity of 18 9 mw the plant built in 1984 has brought remarkable benefits of flood control and power generation through the operation for many years however the historical operation strategy mainly aiming at purpose of power generation has changed the natural flow regime and brought serious damage on the downstream ecology it is urgent to search the optimal operation strategy for liujiaping hydropower plant to preserve the downstream ecology considering the liujiaping reservoir was built in 1984 and began operating in 1987 the daily flow data from 1962 to 1981 obtained from the hydrological station upstream of dam site and the daily flow data from 1999 to 2018 obtained from daily released flow of hydropower plant are collected as pre impact and post impact flow series respectively the daily inflow flow data are obtained from the monitoring date set of power station 3 2 hydrological regime alteration this section firstly analyzes the alteration of downstream hydrological regime brought by the construction and operation of the reservoir with 33 iha parameters of two flow series above pre impact and post impact flow series next the widely used tool of rva and two defined objectives of wql and ha are used respectively to assess hydrological regime alteration quantitatively 3 2 1 results of iha this paper calculates 33 parameters iha1 iha33 and normalizes the values calculated from 0 to 1 reflected by different color depths shown in fig 3 to compare the hydrological regime before and after the construction of the reservoir the left and right figures have 20 squares of each parameter representing the values normalized of 20 years before the construction and 20 years after the construction respectively the darker the color is the bigger the value is in fig 3 the squares color depth of most parameters in right figures are different from left among the parameters of group 1 iha1 iha12 representing mean monthly flow from jan to dec iha4 iha8 are darker in left than right but the results are just opposite for iha1 iha3 and iha9 iha12 it means that the streamflow of downstream river is small in dry season and large in flood season before construction which is consistent with the local rainfall characteristics but it reverses after construction under the reservoir operation of storing water in flood reason to raise reservoir water level for hydropower production in dry season among the parameters of group 2 iha13 iha24 representing extreme flow the first 11 parameters except iha24 are lighter in right than left which means that the peak of extreme flow is reduced and the flow series become flat under the reservoir operation there is no zero flow days before construction while the number increases a lot after construction which can be reflected by iha24 among the parameters of group3 group5 the differences between left and right in parameters of high pulse duration iha28 and low pulse duration iha30 are evident it mainly because that the reservoir operation makes flow series flat and the duration of a single pulse increases compared with flow series before construction overall it is obvious that the hydrological parameters of natural flow have a lager alteration due to the construction and operation of reservoir which may change the downstream riverine structure and threaten freshwater biodiversity 3 2 2 results of rva wql and ha 1 rva to assess hydrological regime alteration quantitatively between the pre impact and post impact flow series this paper uses the range of variable approach rva richter et al 1997 a statistical method targeting the magnitude of flow between 25th percentile and 75th percentile values and identifying the alteration of hydrological regime into low category middle category and high category by the formula below 19 d i n 0 n e n e 100 d 0 1 33 i 1 33 d i 2 1 2 100 where n 0 is the numbers of years where of iha values fall in the target ranges during the post impact flow series n e can be calculated with half of the sample size of streamflow after the construction zhang et al 2015 and the value is 10 in this paper d 0 is the overall hydrological regime alteration and d i is the hydrological alteration of i th parameter fig 4 shows the hydrological alteration of 33 parameters only 5 parameters alteration mean flow in march mean flow in august 30 day maximum date of minimum number of reversals are belong to low category but 13 parameters alteration even reach to 100 the value of overall hydrological regime alteration is 80 26 falling in the high category demonstrating that hydrological regime of post impact flow series has a large alteration compared with pre impact which is consistent with the results shown in fig 3 2 wql and ha the water quantity level wql is calculated by the 12 mean monthly flow parameters in group1 based on eqs 3 10 and the hydrological alteration ha is calculated through the six parameters low pulse duration iha30 90 day maximum iha21 low pulse count iha29 1 day minimum iha14 date of maximum iha25 base flow index iha23 shown in table 2 based on eqs 11 and 12 the six parameters above are extracted by pca method according to the kaiser guttman criterion and the weights in eq 12 are set as 0 371 0 196 0 124 0 118 0 112 0 080 respectively based on the contribution rate of each pc the results show that the low pulse duration is the most significant ecological parameter in this case and the first six pcs explain 84 3 of the variation table 3 shows the wql and ha results of pre impact and post impact flow series by year in terms of wql the value is mainly between 5 and 6 before the construction and the matched description is lv5 outstanding and lv6 optimum range but the average value drops from 5 11 to 2 89 after the construction and the matched description is lv5 only in 2003 and below lv5 in other years in terms of ha the average value increases from 0 87 to 1 58 due to the construction and the number of parameters beyond the range between 25th percentile and 75th percentile values among the six parameters extracted increases a lot the wql and ha can reflect the alteration of hydrological regime from the perspective of the quantity and fluctuation respectively it is obvious that both have a large alteration which illustrates that the construction and operation of reservoir has a great impact on flow series compared with rva the wql and ha have the advantage of making more detailed analysis of hydrological regime and assessment for a specific flow series the released flow series of reservoir during the operation period of one year and the assessment can be directly used as the objectives of reservoir operation model which solves the problem of how to incorporate the ecological objectives into reservoir operation model 3 3 operation strategies in different scenarios the optimal reservoir operation strategy should consider both economic benefits and downstream ecological demands to analyze the differences between different operation strategies generated from reservoir operation model considering different ecological objectives three scenarios are set up as shown in fig 1 scenarios a and b incorporate the wql and ha respectively into reservoir operation model to obtain the operation strategy only considering the demand of quantity or fluctuation in scenario c both two are considered in the model hence wql ha and hp are set as objectives to compare the optimal reservoir operation strategies with the historical reservoir operation strategy this paper selects two typical years of normal and dry based on the annual inflow i e 2006 and 2007 the nsga ii is used to solve the reservoir operation model to search for optimal operation strategies satisfying both downstream ecology and the economy of plant in which the population size generation crossover rate and mutation rate are set as 200 400 0 9 and 0 1 respectively 3 3 1 pareto front strategies of nsga ii in different scenarios figs 5 and 6 show pareto front strategies in different scenarios for two typical years of normal and dry respectively next this paper takes fig 5 as an example to illustrate in detail fig 5 includes four subgraphs first three of which i e a b c are pareto front of nsga ii in three different scenarios and the fourth of which i e d is the comparison results of strategies in three scenarios above it is obvious that the converged strategies in three scenarios are all well distributed and the economic objective of hp has the conflicts with the ecological objectives of wql and ha specifically when the value of hp increases more economic benefits of plant the value of wql decreases and ha increases more influence on downstream ecology fig 5 a shows the competitive relationships between hp and wql in scenario a that wql decreases slowly at the beginning as hp increases hp increases from 5 85e7kwh to 6 05e7kwh while wql only decreases from 5 12 to 5 09 that is to say the wql decrease of 0 03 can be exchanged for the hp increase of 0 2e7kwh but when hp exceeds 6 14e7kwh wql decreases sharply hp only increases from 6 14e7kwh to 6 2e7kwh while wql decreases from 5 02 to 4 89 the hp increase of 0 06e7kwh need the wql decrease of 0 13 to exchange the relationships above obey the law of diminishing marginal utility so the hollow dots in green circle are chosen as compromised operation strategies balancing economic and ecological benefits and the one selected named a1 from hollow dots above is marked with red solid as optimal operation strategy to compare with historical operation strategy which is shown in table 4 similarly the pareto front strategies in fig 5 b show the law of diminishing marginal utility between hp and ha the hollow dots in green circle and the one marked with red solid as b1 represent the compromised operation strategies and optimal operation strategy respectively fig 5 d contrasts the operation strategies converged in three different scenarios represented by the symbol of circle square and triangle respectively by the objectives of hp wql and ha the abscissa and ordinate are hp and wql respectively and the value of ha is reflected by right colormap it is obvious that the strategies converged in scenario a have higher wql which has more advantages in meeting the demand of quantity due to incorporating the objectives of wql into operation model while scenario a does not consider the demand of fluctuation and results in the higher ha of strategies compared with scenario a the result of scenario b is just the opposite with lower wql and ha due to incorporating the objectives of ha not wql into operation model the two scenarios above only consider the single ecological demand of quantity or fluctuation and result in the high ha or low wql respectively while scenario c combines both two ecological demands and most of strategies have appropriate wql and ha without sacrificing too much hp which are marked with the green circle as compromised strategies from the subgraph it is intuitive that the location of the strategies is mostly within the boundary formed by the above two scenarios the strategies of scenario a forms the upper boundary while scenario b forms the lower although there are few strategies without marked with the red circle and as inferior strategies fig 6 shows similar results to fig 5 and the relevant instructions for it will not be repeated in this paper this paper applies the nsga ii to solve the reservoir operation model considering multi objectives although nsga ii has the advantages of a fast running speed and good convergence of the solution set the converged results is hard to guarantee the global optimum which is the general problem of most intelligent algorithms thus for the reservoir optimal operation problem including multi objectives some strategies in scenario c will fall into local optimal and are not as good as that of scenario a or scenario b as marked with red circle in figs 5 and 6 however there are only a few inferior strategies in scenario c e g only no more than 10 strategies in fig 5 and most belong to compromised strategies from which the optimal operation strategy can be selected 3 3 2 comparison with historical operation strategy to verify the rationality of strategies obtained by optimal operation model this paper compares the optimal operation strategy selected in different scenarios with historical operation strategy the optimal operation strategy in scenario a or scenario b is selected one from compromised strategies as the representative for comparison and marked with the symbol of red solid dot seen in figs 5 and 6 the optimal operation strategy in scenario c is selected based on the combination of three objectives with the weights considering that the hydropower production plays an important role on the local economic development this paper prefers to give a slightly larger weight to hp than the other two objectives and the weights of three objectives hp wql and ha are set as 0 4 0 3 and 0 3 the two optimal strategies selected in scenario c under the above weight distribution are marked with the symbol of red solid diamond in the figs 5 d and 6 d and will be compared with historical operation strategy in table 4 considering that the optimal model simplifies the power plant in the simulation operation such as fixing the output coefficient which is inconsistent with reality so this paper inputs historical operation strategy e g historical released flow series into simulation operation model and takes the hp calculated as historical hp instead of statistics based on historical power generation data the three objectives of hp wql and ha for historical operation strategy in two typical years of normal and dry are illustrated with the symbol of solid diamond in the figs 5 d and 6 d respectively both two diamonds are out of axis range with larger hp but lower wql and higher ha and the detailed value of three objectives can be seen in table 4 as is shown in table 4 compared with optimal operation strategies the hp of historical operation strategy is slightly large while the wql is extremely low and the ha is very high which means the historical operation strategy only pursues economic benefits and has more disadvantages on downstream ecology the optimal operation strategy in scenario a and scenario b has the largest wql and lowest ha respectively while another objective is dissatisfactory in meeting the demands of ecology however the optimal operation strategy in scenario c balancing the wql with ha well and maintaining the hp at a high level is demonstrated to be an excellent strategy for reservoir operation reconciling the economic benefits of hydropower plant with the ecological benefits of downstream river fig 7 shows the comparison of optimal operation strategy in scenario c with historical operation strategy in two typical years of normal 2006 and dry 2007 from two aspects of released flow and the corresponding 33 parameters in terms of released flow historical operation strategy changed the flow regime substantially with the result of that the flow in dry season is greater than that in flood season which is contrary to natural flow while the released flow in scenario c has better similarity with natural flow in terms of the 33 parameters of historical and optimal released flow shown in the subgraph of box diagram only10 of 33 parameters are within the range record as r1 minimum to maximum values of each parameter by statistics of natural flow data under historical operation strategy in year 2006 and 5 of 10 parameters above are within the range record as r2 25th percentile to 75th percentile values of each parameter while the optimal released flow maintains more regime of natural flow and the number of parameters falling into the range of r1 and r2 in year 2006 is 20 and 9 which means the optimal operation strategy has little influence on hydrological parameters and is beneficial to recover downstream ecology 4 conclusions this paper divides iha parameters into two categories based on the scale of each parameter to reflect the ecological demands of water quantity and fluctuation and then explores the general process of defining the two ecological objectives of wql and ha by two categories of parameters above respectively the two ecological objectives can be incorporated into reservoir operation model with the objective of hp to search for optimal reservoir operation strategy coordinating economic and ecological benefits the optimal reservoir operation model proposed makes a successful attempt on how to apply iha parameters to guide practice in reservoir operation considering ecology and can be easy to implement where there is little ecological data the case study with the typical small hydropower plant of liujiaping shows that the hydrological regime has a large alteration under the construction and operation of reservoir compared with conventional method of rva two ecological objectives defined can reflect the alteration of hydrological regime from the perspective of the quantity and fluctuation accurately and can be directly used as ecological objectives of reservoir optimal operation model the comparison of operation strategies in different scenarios shows that historical operation strategy only pursues economic benefits but ignores downstream ecology and the operation strategies considering single ecological demand scenario a and scenario b will make another ecological demand difficult to meet while the optimal operation strategy in scenario c balances two objectives of wql and ha well with a high level hp and make the released flow maintain more regime of natural flow which is an excellent strategy to guide operation practice reconciling the economic benefits of hydropower plant with the ecological benefits of downstream river to prove the feasibility of methods and model proposed this paper only compares operation strategies generated by optimal operation model with historical operation strategy however reservoir operators prefer simple operation rule curves to guide practice so how to extract rule curves from optimal operation strategies is worthy of further study credit authorship contribution

4422,the construction and operation of reservoirs arise the problems in downstream river of hydrological regime alteration and threat to freshwater biodiversity currently most researches on reservoir operation model considering downstream ecology just quantify single ecological objective which is difficult to reflect the downstream ecological demands comprehensively to address the challenges above this paper divides the parameters in indicators of hydrological alteration iha a widely used tool reflecting flow regime from multiple perspectives but seldom applied to guide practice reservoir operation into two categories to reflect ecological demands of water quantity and fluctuation respectively then two ecological objectives of water quantity level wql and hydrological alteration ha are defined to be incorporated into reservoir operation model with the economic objective of hydropower production hp for generating optimal operation strategy coordinating economic and ecological benefits the case study of a typical reservoir in hunan province china shows that 1 two ecological objectives defined can reflect the alteration of hydrological regime from the perspective of water quantity and fluctuation accurately and 2 compared with historical operation strategy and optimal operation strategies in the other two scenarios the optimal operation strategy in scenario c is proved an excellent strategy to guide operation practice reconciling the economic benefits of hydropower plant with the ecological benefits of downstream river which can balance two objectives of wql and ha well with high level hp and make the released flow maintain more regime of natural flow keywords indicators of hydrological alteration water quantity level hydrological alteration hydrological regime optimal operation strategy 1 introduction reservoirs have the ability of regulating water in space and time flexibly and play a fundamental role in development through benefits of hydropower production flood control water supply and so on tilmant et al 2010 however the primary goal of conventional reservoir operation strategy is to maximize the utilization of water resources and economic benefits while ignore the influence from the operation of reservoirs on downstream ecology resulting in the alteration of natural flow regime and different degrees of damage to river ecosystem nilsson et al 2005 chen and olden 2017 lu et al 2018 dong et al 2020 hence to restore the downstream ecology reservoir operation should reconcile the economic benefits of hydropower plant with the ecological benefits of downstream river on which many studies have been carried out in recent years jager and smith 2008 chen and olden 2017 jiang et al 2019 the researches of reservoir operation considering the downstream ecology can be divided into two categories wang et al 2015 one is to calculate the environmental flow downstream with the techniques of hydrological methods e g tennant tennant 1976 10 maf operacz et al 2018 and rva methods richter et al 1996 hydraulic methods e g the wetted perimeter method and the r2cross method ye et al 2013 and habitat simulation methods e g the instream flow incremental method and river2d method zhang et al 2019 as the constraint of reservoir operation model another is to quantify the downstream ecological demands and regard it as the objective of operation model with the economic benefits e g hydropower production tsai et al 2015 li et al 2018 suwal et al 2020 the former is to maximize the economic benefits on the premise of meeting constraints from ecological demands thus the different operation strategies achieved can t be compared by ecological benefits in fact the select of operation strategy should balance the conflicts between economic and ecological objectives zhang et al 2019 thus the latter is more effective on guide practice in reservoir operation considering ecology the key of which is how to define the ecological objective and coordinate it with economic objective however most researches on the latter only quantify a single objective as the ecological objective of operation model which is hard to reflect the different demands of downstream ecology it has been well proved that flow is one of the key factors influencing riverine structure function and ecology richter et al 1996 poff et al 1997 bunn and arthington 2002 considering that construction and operation of reservoirs mainly alter the natural flow series and then influence the ecology downstream thus restoring the natural flow regime is a frequently used approach to meet the ecological demands dittmann et al 2009 shiau and wu 2013 the indicators of hydrological alteration iha richter et al 1996 richter et al 1997 composed of 33 parameters is a widely used tool for expressing flow regime from magnitude duration time timing of extreme flow and frequency gao et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 yang et al 2017 achieving hydrological parameters from iha to define ecological objective is a promising and effective way which can be easy to implement where there is little ecological data barbour et al 2016 however it is difficult that apply iha parameters directly as objective or constrain of reservoir operation model due to the complexities and substantial cross correlation among these 33 parameters to solve the problem above and define reasonable objectives wang et al 2015 put forward an intermediate metric with linear combination of some iha parameters e g monthly flows and magnitude of extreme flow and apply the metric to operation model li et al 2018 formulated all 33 parameters quantitatively into the objectives or constraints of operation model and defined the objective of eco index by the main parameters selected nonetheless most of ecological objectives defined by current researches are not universal due to the differences in different regions in addition the complex relationships between iha parameters and different ecological demands downstream have not been considered explicitly resulting in the incompleteness of ecological objectives defined and difficulty in applying these objectives to guide practice operation to address the problem above this paper optimizes reservoir operation considering different ecological demands of downstream based on iha parameters the three main contributions of this paper are as follow 1 explores the general process of defining ecological objectives and can be applied to most reservoirs 2 defines two different ecological objectives of wql and ha considering the ecological demands of water quantity and fluctuation by iha parameters and ensure the integrity of the objectives defined 3 incorporates the ecological objectives into reservoir operation model and searches for optimal reservoir operation strategy coordinating economic and ecological benefits the organization structure of the paper is as follow section 2 introduces the methods section 3 carries out a case study and conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 methods 2 1 framework defining scientific and reasonable ecological objectives is the premise for optimizing reservoir operation considering ecology of downstream which is yet given insufficient attention and remains a major challenge of incorporating ecological objectives into reservoir operation barbour et al 2016 to address this challenge the framework of this paper includes two steps shown in fig 1 1 define ecological objectives and constraints 2 incorporate the ecological objectives and constraints defined above into reservoir operation model with the economic objective and adopt appropriate methods to solve the model in different scenarios for optimal reservoir operation strategies specifically to reflect different ecological demands and make clear the ecological explanation of parameters selected this paper divides iha parameters into different categories for the definition of ecological objectives and constraints the parameter named number of zero flow days is used as the ecological constrain of optimal reservoir operation model the parameters remained are divided into two parts and defined as two objectives of water quantity level wql and hydrological alteration ha considering the demands of water quantity and fluctuation respectively with different methods seen in section 2 2 then the ecological objectives and constraints are incorporated into reservoir operation model with the economic objective of hydropower production hp and the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii which is an effective algorithm solving multi objectives problem is adopted to search for optimal reservoir operation strategies in different scenarios scenario a b c seen in section 2 3 2 2 defining ecological objectives and constraints in general defining ecological objectives and constraints need solve three problems below 1 select parameters related ecology 2 use appropriate method to quantify ecological objectives based on parameters selected 3 provide the criteria to measure the relationship between value quantified above and ecology and show how much is good or bad for ecology to solve the three problems above all parameters selected in this paper are based on iha which is consist of five groups related to ecology explicitly with a total of 33 parameters shown in table 1 in terms of ecological constraints considering there is no zero flow days occurring in natural flow of study area and the downstream ecology will be seriously damaged when the flow is zero so this paper sets a minimum release flow as the ecological constraint to ensure that there is no zero flow days downstream in terms of ecological objectives this paper defines ecological objectives by the 32 parameters except the parameter of number of zero flow days in group 2 in order to show different ecological demands by different objectives and avoid using a single objective li et al 2018 suwal et al 2020 which can t reflect clear ecological explanation this paper puts forward the assumption that the parameters of different scales can reflect different ecological demands of downstream specifically large scale parameter describing objects in a wide perspective can t show the detail variable process of objects while small scale parameter can for example take the flow series as the object the monthly scale parameter of mean flow can t describe the flow variable process in detail but represent the water quantity each month the daily scale parameter such as extreme flow and rate of change can show some details about variable process of flow series in a word large scale parameters reflect the information of quantity while small scale parameter reflect the information of fluctuation based on analysis above the paper holds that the flow series meeting the demands of river ecology should include two aspects one is to ensure the water quantity of flow series and another is that each hydrological parameter in iha calculated by flow series fluctuates within an acceptable range reflecting the demands of quantity and fluctuation respectively through the feature analysis of all 32 parameters it can be found that the scales of 12 mean monthly flows in group 1 belong to the monthly while the 20 parameters remained can be considered as the daily the former can be used to quantify the ecological objective of wql by fuzzy evaluation based on the standard of tennant details in section 2 2 1 and main parameters extracted from latter by principal component analysis pca method will be combined with the weights set based on contribution rate of each pc to quantify the ecological objective of ha details in section 2 2 2 2 2 1 water quantity level water quantity level wql is defined by 12 mean monthly flow to reflect the water quantity demands of ecology each mean monthly flow above can be evaluated according to the tennant method tennant 1976 which is the most widely used method for evaluating e flows tharme 2003 d ambrosio et al 2018 by eight standards of severe degradation poor fair good excellent outstanding optimum range flushing or maximum and then the question comes that how to evaluate the flow series composed of 12 mean monthly flow it is obvious that different assessment results will appear in different months for example the mean flow in jan belongs to the range of poor while the mean flow in feb belongs to the range of good so the evaluation of flow series above can be seen as a multiple criteria decision making mcdm process and is solved with the method of fuzzy evaluation in this paper which uses the membership degree of fuzzy mathematics to make an overall evaluation of things or objects restricted by many factors and is widely applied in the area of evaluation yu et al 2015 mardani et al 2019 the steps of defining wql is below step1 construct the standard matrix for evaluation of flow series based on the standard of tennant the tennant method provides only one value in some standards while provides one range in other standards karakoyun et al 2016 for example the optimum range gives the range of 0 6 x x while flushing or maximum just give one value of 2 x considering the above inconsistencies this paper provides eight ranges for two periods of dry and flood season respectively as below and the matched descriptions are severe degradation poor fair good outstanding optimum range beyond optimum range flushing or maximum the two periods above of dry and flood season are set from oct to mar and from apr to sept respectively which is consistent with the division of tennant considering the definition of wql is based on the standard tennant other division criteria may not work in this paper 1 y 1 0 1 x 0 1 x 0 2 x 0 2 x 0 3 x 0 3 x 0 4 x 0 4 x 0 6 x 0 6 x x x 2 x 2 x 2 y 2 0 1 x 0 1 x 0 3 x 0 3 x 0 4 x 0 4 x 0 5 x 0 5 x 0 6 x 0 6 x x x 2 x 2 x where y 1 and y 2 are the eight flow ranges for two periods of dry season and flood season respectively x is average annual flow according to the method of fuzzy evaluation this paper takes middle value as the typical value of range to calculate the membership degree in step2 therefore eqs 1 and 2 above can be transferred to eqs 3 and 4 as below 3 y dry 0 1 x 0 15 x 0 25 x 0 35 x 0 5 x 0 8 x 1 5 x 2 x 4 y flood 0 1 x 0 2 x 0 3 5 x 0 4 5 x 0 5 5 x 0 8 x 1 5 x 2 x where y dry and y flood are typical value vector of each range for dry and flood season respectively and they can make up the standard matrix y together as eq 5 for evaluation of flow series 5 y y 1 y 2 y m y i y 11 y 12 y 1 c y 21 y 22 y 2 c y m 1 y m 2 y mc y ik where y is the standard matrix compose of typical value vector y i when i 1 3 or 10 12 y i y dry when i 4 9 y i y flood m is 12 the number of months c is 8 the number of levels and y ik is the typical value of i th month of k th level step 2 calculate the membership degree of each level for flow series by month with the standard matrix y take the i th month flow q i of flow series q as example suppose q i is between k th level and k 1 th level and then the membership degree of k th level and k 1 th level can be calculated as below 6 μ ik q y i k 1 q i y i k 1 y ik μ i k 1 q 1 μ ik q where μ ik q and μ i k 1 q are the membership degree of k th level and k 1 th level respectively the membership degree of other level is zero step3 calculate the weight of each mean month flow with the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation critic method critic is a widely used objective weighting method which can comprehensively reflect the variability and cross correlations between indicators yang et al 2017 in this paper the weight of each mean month flow can be calculated with critic as below 7 c j σ j i 1 m 1 r ij 8 w j c j j 1 m c j where σ j is the standard deviation of j th indicator r ij is the correlation coefficient between i th indicator and j th indicator w j the weight of j th indicator step4 calculate the cumulative membership degree of each level for flow series 9 v l q i 1 m w i μ il q where v l q is the cumulative membership degree of l th level step5 calculate the value reflecting the level of flow series 10 δ q l 1 c v l q l where δ q is used to define water quantity level wql to reflect the level of flow series q the larger value is the higher level is the wql includes eight levels from 1 to 8 corresponding to eight flow ranges from poor to flushing or maximum it should be noted that the first six ranges based on tennant meet the rule that the higher level is the better ecology is while the other two ranges don t the seventh range is beyond the optimal range but it still meets the ecological flow demands so this paper supposes its level is slightly lower than optimal range and give the value of 5 the eighth range exceeds the allowable maximum and will damage the ecology so this paper supposes the level is poor and give the value of 1 in general when l 7 l 5 when l 8 l 1 otherwise l l through the modification above there will be a positive correlation between wql and ecology that the value of wql is higher the ecology of downstream is better 2 2 2 hydrological alteration hydrological alteration ha is defined by 22 parameters remained reflecting the information of flow series from the perspective of fluctuation considering the substantial cross correlation among that 22 indicators to reduce the dimension and remain the original information as much as possible by less parameters this paper uses pca to extract the main parameters and then calculates ha of flow series by the weighted mean value of the changing ratio of parameters extracted as below it is the alteration of flow regime that affects the downstream ecology so keeping the stabilization of flow regime is beneficial for downstream ecology and the smaller value is the lower alteration is the better ecology of downstream is 11 ξ i q z i z i z i 12 ξ q i 1 n ω i ξ i q where ξ i q is the alteration of i th parameter extracted by pca and ξ q is the alteration of flow series q z i is i th parameter of flow series n is total number of parameters extracted ω i is the weight of the i th parameter calculated by the contribution rate of the i th principal component li et al 2018 2 3 optimization model the ecology of downstream should be considered together with the economy of power plant in reservoir operation model so this paper takes the hydropower production hp water quantity level wql and hydrological alteration ha as the objectives of reservoir operation model and adds the minimum release flow constraint to avoid the appearance of zero flow days 2 3 1 objectives 1 ecological objectives wql and ha are used to reflect the alteration of hydrological regime according to the analysis in section 2 2 the value of wql is higher and the value of ha is lower the ecology of downstream is better so the ecological objectives are below 13 wql max δ q max δ q s h a min ξ q min ξ q s where q is the released flow including the generation flow q and spill flow s 2 economical objectives hp reflects the economy of power plant and the reservoir operation strategy should improve the hp as much as possible so the economic objective is below 14 hp max e q max t 1 t k q t h t up h t down δ t where k is the output coefficient of power plant q t h t up h t down are the generation flow average reservoir water level and downstream tailwater level of t th day respectively 2 3 2 constraints reservoir operation should obey the operation regulations and physical constraints such as water balance constraint water storage constraint and released flow constraint the mathematical expressions of constraints are shown as below 1 water balance constraint 15 v t 1 v t q t in q t out δ t where v t 1 and v t are beginning and ending storage of the reservoir on day t q t in and q t out are the net inflow and net outflow on day t the value of δ t is the seconds of a day 2 water storage constraint 16 v t min v t v t max where v t min and v t max are the minimum and maximum storage allowed on day t 3 released flow constraint 17 q t min q t out q t max where q t min and q t max are the minimum and maximum released flow allowed on day t q t min is set to ensure there is no zero flow days downstream 4 output constraint the hydropower station output should be within the guaranteed output and the installed capacity 18 n g k q t h t up h t down n max where n g is the guaranteed output and n max is the installed capacity 2 3 3 solving technique considering the complex objectives and various physical constraints this paper uses nsga ii deb et al 2002 an effective algorithm solving multi objective problem with the advantages of a fast running speed and good convergence of the solution set and implemented successfully in solving various water resources management issues chang and chang 2009 zheng et al 2014 tsai et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 to solve the model above which can be summarized into the following steps ① take 365 daily reservoir water levels of a year as the decision variables and initializes the population of size n based on the physical constraints of reservoir operation ② calculate the ecological objectives of wql ha and economic objective of hp for each chromosome and sort by non dominated strategy ③ select excellent chromosome from population non dominated as parent chromosome and create child chromosome by the cross and mutation operation ④ combine the parent chromosome with the child chromosome and update the population by non dominated strategy ⑤ repeat the four steps above until the number of iterations is reached 3 case study 3 1 study area and data under the tide of reservoir construction in 1970s and 1980s many small hydropower plants have been built one by one on the river in china there are many small hydropower plants on the same river from upstream to downstream and the conventional operation strategy of these plants is to pursue economic benefits but ignore the preserve of ecology for downstream which arises many serious ecological problems considering there is little ecological data but abundant flow data in most small hydropower plants so the model and method proposed in this paper is more promising to address the ecological problems and restore the downstream ecology of such plants the liujiaping hydropower plant a typical small hydropower plant located in hunan province china between 110 39 e 110 43 e and 27 27 n 27 30 n as shown in fig 2 is selected to verify the rationality and reliability of the model and methods promised above including two parts of sections 3 2 and 3 3 the liujiaping reservoir has a total length of 21 km and a drainage area of 53 63 km2 and is the leading reservoir at the upstream of the liujiaping river the liujiaping hydropower plant located about 3 km downstream of the dam is a medium sized hydropower plant with the guaranteed output of 7 5 mw and the installed capacity of 18 9 mw the plant built in 1984 has brought remarkable benefits of flood control and power generation through the operation for many years however the historical operation strategy mainly aiming at purpose of power generation has changed the natural flow regime and brought serious damage on the downstream ecology it is urgent to search the optimal operation strategy for liujiaping hydropower plant to preserve the downstream ecology considering the liujiaping reservoir was built in 1984 and began operating in 1987 the daily flow data from 1962 to 1981 obtained from the hydrological station upstream of dam site and the daily flow data from 1999 to 2018 obtained from daily released flow of hydropower plant are collected as pre impact and post impact flow series respectively the daily inflow flow data are obtained from the monitoring date set of power station 3 2 hydrological regime alteration this section firstly analyzes the alteration of downstream hydrological regime brought by the construction and operation of the reservoir with 33 iha parameters of two flow series above pre impact and post impact flow series next the widely used tool of rva and two defined objectives of wql and ha are used respectively to assess hydrological regime alteration quantitatively 3 2 1 results of iha this paper calculates 33 parameters iha1 iha33 and normalizes the values calculated from 0 to 1 reflected by different color depths shown in fig 3 to compare the hydrological regime before and after the construction of the reservoir the left and right figures have 20 squares of each parameter representing the values normalized of 20 years before the construction and 20 years after the construction respectively the darker the color is the bigger the value is in fig 3 the squares color depth of most parameters in right figures are different from left among the parameters of group 1 iha1 iha12 representing mean monthly flow from jan to dec iha4 iha8 are darker in left than right but the results are just opposite for iha1 iha3 and iha9 iha12 it means that the streamflow of downstream river is small in dry season and large in flood season before construction which is consistent with the local rainfall characteristics but it reverses after construction under the reservoir operation of storing water in flood reason to raise reservoir water level for hydropower production in dry season among the parameters of group 2 iha13 iha24 representing extreme flow the first 11 parameters except iha24 are lighter in right than left which means that the peak of extreme flow is reduced and the flow series become flat under the reservoir operation there is no zero flow days before construction while the number increases a lot after construction which can be reflected by iha24 among the parameters of group3 group5 the differences between left and right in parameters of high pulse duration iha28 and low pulse duration iha30 are evident it mainly because that the reservoir operation makes flow series flat and the duration of a single pulse increases compared with flow series before construction overall it is obvious that the hydrological parameters of natural flow have a lager alteration due to the construction and operation of reservoir which may change the downstream riverine structure and threaten freshwater biodiversity 3 2 2 results of rva wql and ha 1 rva to assess hydrological regime alteration quantitatively between the pre impact and post impact flow series this paper uses the range of variable approach rva richter et al 1997 a statistical method targeting the magnitude of flow between 25th percentile and 75th percentile values and identifying the alteration of hydrological regime into low category middle category and high category by the formula below 19 d i n 0 n e n e 100 d 0 1 33 i 1 33 d i 2 1 2 100 where n 0 is the numbers of years where of iha values fall in the target ranges during the post impact flow series n e can be calculated with half of the sample size of streamflow after the construction zhang et al 2015 and the value is 10 in this paper d 0 is the overall hydrological regime alteration and d i is the hydrological alteration of i th parameter fig 4 shows the hydrological alteration of 33 parameters only 5 parameters alteration mean flow in march mean flow in august 30 day maximum date of minimum number of reversals are belong to low category but 13 parameters alteration even reach to 100 the value of overall hydrological regime alteration is 80 26 falling in the high category demonstrating that hydrological regime of post impact flow series has a large alteration compared with pre impact which is consistent with the results shown in fig 3 2 wql and ha the water quantity level wql is calculated by the 12 mean monthly flow parameters in group1 based on eqs 3 10 and the hydrological alteration ha is calculated through the six parameters low pulse duration iha30 90 day maximum iha21 low pulse count iha29 1 day minimum iha14 date of maximum iha25 base flow index iha23 shown in table 2 based on eqs 11 and 12 the six parameters above are extracted by pca method according to the kaiser guttman criterion and the weights in eq 12 are set as 0 371 0 196 0 124 0 118 0 112 0 080 respectively based on the contribution rate of each pc the results show that the low pulse duration is the most significant ecological parameter in this case and the first six pcs explain 84 3 of the variation table 3 shows the wql and ha results of pre impact and post impact flow series by year in terms of wql the value is mainly between 5 and 6 before the construction and the matched description is lv5 outstanding and lv6 optimum range but the average value drops from 5 11 to 2 89 after the construction and the matched description is lv5 only in 2003 and below lv5 in other years in terms of ha the average value increases from 0 87 to 1 58 due to the construction and the number of parameters beyond the range between 25th percentile and 75th percentile values among the six parameters extracted increases a lot the wql and ha can reflect the alteration of hydrological regime from the perspective of the quantity and fluctuation respectively it is obvious that both have a large alteration which illustrates that the construction and operation of reservoir has a great impact on flow series compared with rva the wql and ha have the advantage of making more detailed analysis of hydrological regime and assessment for a specific flow series the released flow series of reservoir during the operation period of one year and the assessment can be directly used as the objectives of reservoir operation model which solves the problem of how to incorporate the ecological objectives into reservoir operation model 3 3 operation strategies in different scenarios the optimal reservoir operation strategy should consider both economic benefits and downstream ecological demands to analyze the differences between different operation strategies generated from reservoir operation model considering different ecological objectives three scenarios are set up as shown in fig 1 scenarios a and b incorporate the wql and ha respectively into reservoir operation model to obtain the operation strategy only considering the demand of quantity or fluctuation in scenario c both two are considered in the model hence wql ha and hp are set as objectives to compare the optimal reservoir operation strategies with the historical reservoir operation strategy this paper selects two typical years of normal and dry based on the annual inflow i e 2006 and 2007 the nsga ii is used to solve the reservoir operation model to search for optimal operation strategies satisfying both downstream ecology and the economy of plant in which the population size generation crossover rate and mutation rate are set as 200 400 0 9 and 0 1 respectively 3 3 1 pareto front strategies of nsga ii in different scenarios figs 5 and 6 show pareto front strategies in different scenarios for two typical years of normal and dry respectively next this paper takes fig 5 as an example to illustrate in detail fig 5 includes four subgraphs first three of which i e a b c are pareto front of nsga ii in three different scenarios and the fourth of which i e d is the comparison results of strategies in three scenarios above it is obvious that the converged strategies in three scenarios are all well distributed and the economic objective of hp has the conflicts with the ecological objectives of wql and ha specifically when the value of hp increases more economic benefits of plant the value of wql decreases and ha increases more influence on downstream ecology fig 5 a shows the competitive relationships between hp and wql in scenario a that wql decreases slowly at the beginning as hp increases hp increases from 5 85e7kwh to 6 05e7kwh while wql only decreases from 5 12 to 5 09 that is to say the wql decrease of 0 03 can be exchanged for the hp increase of 0 2e7kwh but when hp exceeds 6 14e7kwh wql decreases sharply hp only increases from 6 14e7kwh to 6 2e7kwh while wql decreases from 5 02 to 4 89 the hp increase of 0 06e7kwh need the wql decrease of 0 13 to exchange the relationships above obey the law of diminishing marginal utility so the hollow dots in green circle are chosen as compromised operation strategies balancing economic and ecological benefits and the one selected named a1 from hollow dots above is marked with red solid as optimal operation strategy to compare with historical operation strategy which is shown in table 4 similarly the pareto front strategies in fig 5 b show the law of diminishing marginal utility between hp and ha the hollow dots in green circle and the one marked with red solid as b1 represent the compromised operation strategies and optimal operation strategy respectively fig 5 d contrasts the operation strategies converged in three different scenarios represented by the symbol of circle square and triangle respectively by the objectives of hp wql and ha the abscissa and ordinate are hp and wql respectively and the value of ha is reflected by right colormap it is obvious that the strategies converged in scenario a have higher wql which has more advantages in meeting the demand of quantity due to incorporating the objectives of wql into operation model while scenario a does not consider the demand of fluctuation and results in the higher ha of strategies compared with scenario a the result of scenario b is just the opposite with lower wql and ha due to incorporating the objectives of ha not wql into operation model the two scenarios above only consider the single ecological demand of quantity or fluctuation and result in the high ha or low wql respectively while scenario c combines both two ecological demands and most of strategies have appropriate wql and ha without sacrificing too much hp which are marked with the green circle as compromised strategies from the subgraph it is intuitive that the location of the strategies is mostly within the boundary formed by the above two scenarios the strategies of scenario a forms the upper boundary while scenario b forms the lower although there are few strategies without marked with the red circle and as inferior strategies fig 6 shows similar results to fig 5 and the relevant instructions for it will not be repeated in this paper this paper applies the nsga ii to solve the reservoir operation model considering multi objectives although nsga ii has the advantages of a fast running speed and good convergence of the solution set the converged results is hard to guarantee the global optimum which is the general problem of most intelligent algorithms thus for the reservoir optimal operation problem including multi objectives some strategies in scenario c will fall into local optimal and are not as good as that of scenario a or scenario b as marked with red circle in figs 5 and 6 however there are only a few inferior strategies in scenario c e g only no more than 10 strategies in fig 5 and most belong to compromised strategies from which the optimal operation strategy can be selected 3 3 2 comparison with historical operation strategy to verify the rationality of strategies obtained by optimal operation model this paper compares the optimal operation strategy selected in different scenarios with historical operation strategy the optimal operation strategy in scenario a or scenario b is selected one from compromised strategies as the representative for comparison and marked with the symbol of red solid dot seen in figs 5 and 6 the optimal operation strategy in scenario c is selected based on the combination of three objectives with the weights considering that the hydropower production plays an important role on the local economic development this paper prefers to give a slightly larger weight to hp than the other two objectives and the weights of three objectives hp wql and ha are set as 0 4 0 3 and 0 3 the two optimal strategies selected in scenario c under the above weight distribution are marked with the symbol of red solid diamond in the figs 5 d and 6 d and will be compared with historical operation strategy in table 4 considering that the optimal model simplifies the power plant in the simulation operation such as fixing the output coefficient which is inconsistent with reality so this paper inputs historical operation strategy e g historical released flow series into simulation operation model and takes the hp calculated as historical hp instead of statistics based on historical power generation data the three objectives of hp wql and ha for historical operation strategy in two typical years of normal and dry are illustrated with the symbol of solid diamond in the figs 5 d and 6 d respectively both two diamonds are out of axis range with larger hp but lower wql and higher ha and the detailed value of three objectives can be seen in table 4 as is shown in table 4 compared with optimal operation strategies the hp of historical operation strategy is slightly large while the wql is extremely low and the ha is very high which means the historical operation strategy only pursues economic benefits and has more disadvantages on downstream ecology the optimal operation strategy in scenario a and scenario b has the largest wql and lowest ha respectively while another objective is dissatisfactory in meeting the demands of ecology however the optimal operation strategy in scenario c balancing the wql with ha well and maintaining the hp at a high level is demonstrated to be an excellent strategy for reservoir operation reconciling the economic benefits of hydropower plant with the ecological benefits of downstream river fig 7 shows the comparison of optimal operation strategy in scenario c with historical operation strategy in two typical years of normal 2006 and dry 2007 from two aspects of released flow and the corresponding 33 parameters in terms of released flow historical operation strategy changed the flow regime substantially with the result of that the flow in dry season is greater than that in flood season which is contrary to natural flow while the released flow in scenario c has better similarity with natural flow in terms of the 33 parameters of historical and optimal released flow shown in the subgraph of box diagram only10 of 33 parameters are within the range record as r1 minimum to maximum values of each parameter by statistics of natural flow data under historical operation strategy in year 2006 and 5 of 10 parameters above are within the range record as r2 25th percentile to 75th percentile values of each parameter while the optimal released flow maintains more regime of natural flow and the number of parameters falling into the range of r1 and r2 in year 2006 is 20 and 9 which means the optimal operation strategy has little influence on hydrological parameters and is beneficial to recover downstream ecology 4 conclusions this paper divides iha parameters into two categories based on the scale of each parameter to reflect the ecological demands of water quantity and fluctuation and then explores the general process of defining the two ecological objectives of wql and ha by two categories of parameters above respectively the two ecological objectives can be incorporated into reservoir operation model with the objective of hp to search for optimal reservoir operation strategy coordinating economic and ecological benefits the optimal reservoir operation model proposed makes a successful attempt on how to apply iha parameters to guide practice in reservoir operation considering ecology and can be easy to implement where there is little ecological data the case study with the typical small hydropower plant of liujiaping shows that the hydrological regime has a large alteration under the construction and operation of reservoir compared with conventional method of rva two ecological objectives defined can reflect the alteration of hydrological regime from the perspective of the quantity and fluctuation accurately and can be directly used as ecological objectives of reservoir optimal operation model the comparison of operation strategies in different scenarios shows that historical operation strategy only pursues economic benefits but ignores downstream ecology and the operation strategies considering single ecological demand scenario a and scenario b will make another ecological demand difficult to meet while the optimal operation strategy in scenario c balances two objectives of wql and ha well with a high level hp and make the released flow maintain more regime of natural flow which is an excellent strategy to guide operation practice reconciling the economic benefits of hydropower plant with the ecological benefits of downstream river to prove the feasibility of methods and model proposed this paper only compares operation strategies generated by optimal operation model with historical operation strategy however reservoir operators prefer simple operation rule curves to guide practice so how to extract rule curves from optimal operation strategies is worthy of further study credit authorship contribution

4423,numerical modeling of co2 injection in the deep saline aquifer is computationally expensive due to the large spatial and temporal scales to address the computational challenge reduced dimensional models e g vertical equilibrium ve and dynamic reconstruction dr models based on vertical integration of the full dimensional governing equations have been developed ve models assume rapid segregation of the injected and the resident fluids due to strong buoyancy conversely dr models employ a multiscale framework that relaxes the ve assumption and captures the vertical dynamics of co2 and brine by solving the vertical two phase flow dynamics as one dimensional fine scale problems although dr models relax the ve assumption while maintaining much of the computational efficiency of ve models they are thus far limited to homogeneous and layered heterogeneous formations we present a novel hybrid framework that couples a multilayer dynamic reconstruction model and a full dimensional model the new hybrid framework allows simulation of co2 injection in geological formations with local heterogeneities it employs a full dimensional model in local heterogeneous regions where the full dimensional

reducing anthropogenic co2 emissions e g metz et al 2005 deep geological formations are the major storage sites for large scale and long term storage of co2 among the various types of geological formations deep saline aquifers have been estimated to hold the largest storage potential on the order of 10 000 gt bachu and adams 2003 metz et al 2005 celia et al 2015 bachu 2015 co2 injection in a deep saline aquifer leads a two phase flow problem where the injected co2 often in its supercritical state may be considered as the nonwetting phase and the resident brine may be considered as the wetting phase to ensure safe and long term storage numerical flow simulations are frequently employed to address engineering questions during planning and operation such as evaluating potential storage sites based on limited geological data and identifying co2 plume evolution under different system configurations and engineering operations due to the multiscale nature of the saline aquifers highly nonlinear multiphase flow dynamics and large spatial and temporal scales computational complexity imposes a strong limitation furthermore the significant uncertainties involved in geological parameters often require numerical simulations of many realizations e g ren et al 2016 chen et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 which poses even stronger computational demands to address the computational challenge a family of simplified models based on reduction of spatial dimensions have been developed for geological co2 storage over the past decade the dimension reduction is achieved by vertically integrating the full dimensional governing equations one type of vertically integrated models referred to as vertical equilibrium model ve and initially developed for oil and gas flow in reservoirs coats et al 1971 yortsos 1995 were introduced and developed to study the co2 brine system by assuming a rapid segregation of the injected co2 and the resident brine due to strong buoyancy nordbotten

effects andersen and nilsen 2018 and the presence of fractures tao et al 2019 while ve models have been widely used to answer many important science and engineering questions related to geological co2 storage they are limited by the vertical equilibrium assumption that may not be valid under certain conditions when the time scale of the buoyant segregation is large relative to the time scale of interest court et al 2012 bandilla et al 2019 guo et al 2014 developed a new vertically integrated model in a multiscale framework that relaxes the vertical equilibrium assumption similar to the ve model the pressure equation is integrated along the vertical direction leading to a vertically integrated coarse scale pressure equation in contrast to the ve model the new vertically integrated model accounts for the vertical dynamics of co2 and brine by solving one dimensional two phase flow along the vertical dimension as a set of fine scale problems this new vertically integrated model referred to as dynamic reconstruction dr model maintains much of the computational efficiency of the ve model and extends the applicability of vertically integrated models to problems that involve strong vertical dynamics later on guo et al 2016a extended the dr model to multiple vertically integrated layers that can simulate co2 injection in layered heterogeneous geological formations this extended dr model is referred to as multilayer dynamic reconstruction mldr model though vertically integrated models have grown significantly in sophistication they are still limited to geological formations with homogeneous or layered heterogeneous properties for problems that involve complex local heterogeneity within a layer the full dimensional models are the only available option however heterogeneity is ubiquitous in geological formations local heterogeneous regions may significantly impact the migration of co2 reducing or enhancing the storage capacity of a geological formation because of the relative low or high permeability and other complex fluid dynamic processes e g li and benson 2015 ren 2018 xu et al 2019 bakhshian et al 2020 moreno and rabinovich 2021 some recent attempts are made to couple vertical equilibrium and full dimensional models ve 3d becker et al 2018 møyner and nilsen 2019 møyner et al 2020 these hybrid ve 3d modeling approaches prove to maintain much of the computational efficiency of vertical equilibrium models while being able to capture complex heterogeneities while promising the ve 3d models are to date limited to special types of heterogeneous aquifers that either have a single layer with relative high permeability becker et al 2018 or multiple layers separated by aquitards that are only permeable for brine and do not allow for co2 penetration møyner and nilsen 2019 møyner et al 2020 to fill the gap between standard reduced dimensional and full dimensional models more general coupling between vertically integrated and full dimensional models need to be developed to model aquifers with local heterogeneities in the present work we develop a new hybrid model that monolithically couples the multilayer dynamic reconstruction mldr model and the full dimensional model we decompose the spatial domain into heterogeneous and homogeneous subdomains in a heterogeneous subdomain we solve full dimensional governing equations in a homogeneous subdomain we employ the mldr model guo et al 2016a the new hybrid model maintains much of the computational efficiency of vertically integrated models while is capable of solving co2 migration in geological layers with both in layer and layered heterogeneity to demonstrate the applicability of our hybrid model we simulate three scenarios of co2 injection into a a high permeability layer with an embedded relatively low permeability subdomain b a low permeability layer with an embedded relatively high permeability subdomain and c a two layer geological formation with multiple heterogeneous zones we present comparisons of simulated co2 plumes as well as the computational efficiency of the new hybrid model and a standard full dimensional model the present paper is organized as follows we first give a brief review of the governing equations of the full dimensional model and vertically integrated models including the ve model and the dr model both of which are closely related to our hybrid framework we then present the detailed coupling scheme of the hybrid model next we compare the new hybrid model with a standard full dimensional model under different geological conditions we then discuss the key ingredients and computational efficiency of the new hybrid modeling framework we close with concluding remarks 2 governing equations and modeling approaches in this section we briefly review the governing equations for the full dimensional model and vertically integrated models i e ve and dr models the definitions of variables and measures can be found in nomenclature 2 1 full dimensional model to simplify the presentation we assume that the co2 and brine phases are immiscible and incompressible and the solid matrix is rigid in addition brine and co2 are considered as the wetting and nonwetting phases respectively the mass balance equation for each fluid phase can be written as 1 ϕ s α t u α ψ α α b c where ϕ is the porosity s α is the saturation of phase α b and c denote the brine and co2 phases respectively u α is the darcy flux and ψ α is the source sink term of phase α the darcy flux u α of phase α can be computed by the two phase extended darcy s law 2 u α k λ α p α ϱ α g where k is the intrinsic permeability tensor λ α k r α μ α is the mobility of phase α k r α is the relative permeability that is often parameterized as a function of the phase saturation μ α is the fluid viscosity ϱ α is the density of phase α and g is the gravitational acceleration vector the two fluid phases are assumed to occupy the entire pore space so their saturations sum to unity 3 s b s c 1 the capillary pressure p cap is defined as the difference between the pressure of co2 and that of brine and is parameterized as a function of phase saturation 4 p c p b p cap s α eqs 1 4 represent a closed mathematical description of the co2 brine flow in deep saline aquifers the above full dimensional variables and equations are referred to as fine scale variables and equations the vertically integrated variables and equations presented in the following are referred to as coarse scale variables and equations 2 2 vertically integrated models 2 2 1 vertical equilibrium ve model the ve model assumes that the two fluid phases co2 and brine have fully segregated due to buoyancy and the pressure of each phase has reached equilibrium between gravity and capillary pressure in the vertical direction nordbotten and celia 2011 this so called vertical equilibrium assumption allows one to integrate the governing equations along the vertical direction to obtain a set of two dimensional equations see fig 2 the governing equations eq 1 and eq 2 integrated over the vertical direction are presented in eq 5 and eq 6 5 φ s α t c α φ s α p α t u α ψ α 6 u α k λ α p α ϱ α g where subscript stands for the x y plane c α represents the compressibility coefficient of the fluid phase and the uppercase letters denote the vertically integrated i e coarse scale variables and parameters and are defined as 7 φ x y ξ b ξ t ϕ x y z d z 8 s α x y t 1 φ ξ b ξ t ϕ x y z s α x y z t d z 9 u α ξ b ξ t u α d z 10 ψ α ξ b ξ t ψ α d z 11 k ξ b ξ t k d z 12 λ α k 1 ξ b ξ t k λ α d z where ξ b and ξ t represent the elevation of bottom and top boundary of the formation summing eq 5 for the two fluid phases yields the coarse scale pressure equation 13 φ c c s c p c t φ c b s b p b t u c u b ψ c ψ b the mass balance equation for one of the fluid phases eq 5 is then used as the coarse scale saturation equation the difference between the two coarse scale phase pressures is referred to as the pseudo capillary pressure which is a function of the coarse scale saturation 14 p c p b p cap s c eqs 5 14 represent a closed mathematical description for the ve model once the coarse scale pressure and saturation are solved the fine scale pressure and saturation in the vertical direction can be reconstructed algebraically based on the ve assumption readers can refer to nordbotten and celia 2011 for more details of the ve model 2 2 2 single layer dynamic reconstruction dr model guo et al 2014 presented a more general vertically integrated model referred to as dynamic reconstruction dr model that is not limited by the ve assumption the dr model also integrates the fine scale equations over the vertical direction to derive a set of vertically integrated coarse scale equations however instead of employing the ve assumption it solves the vertical dynamics of co2 and brine as an additional set of fine scale problems along the vertical direction see fig 3 the coarse scale pressure equation is similar to the vertically integrated equation of the ve model see eq 13 once the coarse scale pressure p α is solved from the coarse scale pressure equation the fine scale pressure can be reconstructed as 15 p α x y z t p α x y t π α x y z t where π α ξ b ξ t s c ϱ c s b ϱ b g s c p cap s b z d z refers to the deviation of the fine scale pressure from the coarse scale pressure which is assumed to follow a saturation weighted hydrostatic profile the reconstructed fine scale pressure profiles are used to compute the fine scale horizontal fluxes then the fine scale saturation can be reconstructed based on the fractional flow formulation in the vertical dimension summing the fine scale mass balance equations for the two phases yields 16 c ϕ ϕ c b s b p b t c ϕ ϕ c c s c p c t u b z z u c z z ψ b ψ c u b u c eq 16 allows one to compute the total flux in the vertical direction u tot z u b z u c z given the vertical total flux the phase flux u α z can be solved using the fractional flow form of the darcy s equation 17 u b z f b u tot z k z λ c ϱ g λ c k z p cap z 18 u c z f c u tot z k z λ b ϱ g λ b k z p cap z where k z is the permeability in z direction and f α is the fractional flow function 19 f α λ α λ b λ c now all the vertical and horizontal phase fluxes are known the fine scale saturation can be computed by solving the fine scale transport equation 20 ϕ s b t c ϕ ϕ c b s b p b t u b z z ψ b u b more detailed derivations and the algorithimic steps of the dr model can be found in guo et al 2014 and guo 2016 2 2 3 multilayer dynamic reconstruction mldr model the single layer dr model was further extended to a multilayer dynamic reconstruction mldr model guo et al 2016a that can simulate co2 migration in layered heterogeneous formations fig 4 the mldr algorithm formulates a vertically integrated model for each layer and couples the integrated layers via the fluxes across the layer interfaces without loss of generality we take the flux between layer j and layer j 1 as an example δ z z j 1 z j denotes the distance between these two layers the total flux between the two layers have the following form 21 u tot j 1 2 k z j 1 2 λ tot j 1 2 p b j 1 p b j δ z ω 1 j 1 2 ω 2 j 1 2 where 22a k z j 1 2 λ tot j 1 2 1 1 δ z z j z j 1 1 k z λ b λ c d z 22b ω 1 j 1 2 1 δ z z j z j 1 λ c λ b λ c p cap z d z 22c ω 2 j 1 2 1 δ z z j z j 1 λ b ρ b λ c ρ c λ b λ c g d z ω 1 j 1 2 and ω 2 j 1 2 are the terms associated with the capillary and gravity driving forces phase fluxes of co2 and brine can be computed from u tot j 1 2 based on the fractional flow equation for the two fine scale cells at the layer interface by coupling different vertically integrated layers eq 21 extends the single layer dr model to the mldr model that allows for geological formations with multiple layers the dr models are often solved by an implicit pressure explicit saturation impes algorithm the coarse scale p α is solved implicitly as a vertically integrated problem for the single layer dr model and as a full dimensional the number of vertical grid cells equals to the number of layers problem for the mldr model for both the single layer dr and mldr models the fine scale p α and s α are solved explicitly as many one dimensional problems that require minor computational costs by design the dr models maintain much of the computational efficiency of the ve models while being able to provide similar accuracy compared to full dimensional models for homogeneous and layered heterogeneous formations guo et al 2016a guo 2016 3 development of hybrid framework we generalize the concept of the vertically integrated models and develop a hybrid framework that couples the multilayer dr models with full dimensional models in the same computational domain the new hybrid framework targets layered geological formations with local heterogeneities e g low permeability shales or high permeability channels see figs 1 and 5 a we decompose the entire computational domain into heterogeneous i e containing local heterogeneities and homogeneous subdomains the heterogenous subdomains are solved by the full dimensional model while the mldr is applied to the homogeneous subdomains which significantly reduces the computational cost in the following we introduce the coupling scheme and the numerical algorithm used in the hybrid framework for a layered geological formation shown in fig 5 a we identify the local heterogeneous regions in layers as full dimensional subdomains the gray areas in fig 5 b for illustration purposes here we assume that the geological layers are horizontal our hybrid framework and the algorithms are capable of handling general lateral geological formations with topographical features the coupling between full dimensional and mldr subdomains either occurs within a layer e g fig 5 d or at the interface between two layers e g fig 5 e for the former the phase fluxes across boundary γ x between a full dimensional subdomain and a dr subdomain have the following forms 23 u α ij γ x k ij λ α ij p α j p α i δ x where i is the index of fine scale cells in the vertical column of the full dimensional domain and j is the index of fine scale cells in the dr column with denoting the fine scale variables reconstructed from solving the vertically integrated problems k ij and λ α ij are permeability and mobility at the subdomain interface respectively the reconstructed pressure p α j p α j π α j for subdomain interfaces like γ z in fig 5 e we use m to index the fine scale cell in the full dimensional domain at the interface and n to index the coarse scale dr cell column the phase fluxes across γ z are computed using the following equation 24 u α mn γ z k mn λ α mn p α n p α m 1 2 δ z δ z ρ g where coefficients k mn and λ α mn at the interface between layers have similar forms as eqs 22a p α n is the coarse scale pressure which is defined as the pressure at the center of the dr column p α m is the pressure of the fine scale cell in the full dimensional subdomain δ z is the height of the full dimensional fine scale numerical cell and δ z is the depth of the dr column a monolithic scheme is used to couple the full dimensional model and the mldr model in the different subdomains an impes method is implemented for solving the primary variables the full numerical algorithm involves the following steps 1 assume the solutions for fine scale phase pressures and saturations are known at all points in the domain for discrete time level t n here integer n denotes discrete time step 2 compute the coefficients in eqs 15 24 and solve the resulting equations for pressures at t n 1 implicitly using saturation values from t n this gives a solution of the coarse scale pressure in the mldr domains and fine scale pressure in the full dimensional domains 3 given the pressure field from step 2 compute phase fluxes using eqs 6 21 and 23 reconstruct fine scale pressure in the mldr domain using π α x y z at t n and compute fine scale horizontal fluxes between the dr columns 4 given the phase fluxes computed at the subdomain interfaces and the horizontal fluxes between the vertical columns in the mldr subdomains solve the vertically integrated problems for the mldr subdomains to update the fine scale saturations explicitly for t n 1 4 results we construct three scenarios to demonstrate the applicability and accuracy of the new hybrid framework fig 6 the first two scenarios consider a single geological layer a injection of co2 into a high permeability domain with an embedded relatively low permeability subdomain and b injection of co2 into a low permeablity domain with an embedded relatively high permeability subdomain in the third scenario we simulate the injection of co2 into a two layer geological formation with multiple heterogeneous subdomains a standard full dimensional model is used as a reference to evaluate the accuracy of the simulations performed using the hybrid model for simplicity we simulate them in a two dimensional cross sectional domain so that the problem setup only contains one horizontal dimension and one vertical dimension 4 1 scenarios and simulation setup the model setups for the single layer and two layer scenarios are shown in fig 6 a c respectively all of the scenarios involve injection through a vertical fully penetrating well the simulation times for the three scenarios are all set to 5 years to focus on the early period during which dynamic segregation of co2 and brine plays an important role for the problem setup the whole domain is considered to be isotropic the thickness of each layer is 50 m and the horizontal extent is 1 500 m no flow condition for both fluid phases is assigned at the top and bottom boundaries of the domain co2 flux is injected at a constant rate hydrostatic pressure profiles are employed at the right boundary of the domain the domain is initially saturated with brine under a hydrostatic pressure field for all the test cases the solutions of hybrid model are compared with those from the full dimensional model for all the simulated cases the brine density and co2 densities are set to be 1000 kg m3 and 710 kg m3 respectively the brine and co2 viscosity are 3 10 4 and 4 25 10 5 pa s respectively the injection rate of co2 in each layer is 5 10 6 mt year m2 the porosity is set to 0 25 the residual saturation for brine is 0 1 the brooks corey curve is used for calculating the relative permeability and capillary pressure with a pore size distribution parameter of 2 for scenario 1 as shown in fig 6 a low permeability subdomain is located 500 m away from the left boundary the permeabilities of the low permeability subdomain and the rest of the domain are 5 md and 100 md respectively the corresponding entry pressures are 40 kpa and 10 kpa for scenario 2 a high permeability subdomain of 200 m 5 m is located 200 m from the left boundary and 10 m from the top boundary fig 6 b the permeability of the high permeable zone is 100 md and the rest of the domain has a permeability of 20 md the entry pressures are 0 5 kpa for the high permeability subdomain and 10 kpa for the rest of the domain for scenario 3 the formation is made up of a less permeable layer κ 1 10 md with an entry pressure of 32 kpa and a more permeable layer κ 2 100 md with an entry pressure of 10 kpa two low permeability subdomains κ 3 κ 4 0 01 md with an entry pressure of 1 000 kpa are located at the interface of the two layers fig 6 c for each layer the domain is discretized into 150 columns in the horizontal dimension for both the hybrid and full dimensional models 50 grid cells are employed in the vertical dimension in each layer for the full dimensional subdomains of the hybrid model i e where embedded heterogeneous subdomains exist the dr subdomains of the hybrid model also employ 50 grid cells in the vertical dimension but they are only used for the fine scale calculations a buffer zone is employed at the interface between the dr and full dimensional domains i e several columns up to 10 in the homogeneous domain adjacent to the heterogeneous domain are assigned to the full dimensional model we found that employing the buffer zone leads to a more robust coupling between the dr and full dimensional model a fixed time step size 0 25 day is employed for all simulations note that the algorithm itself allows for adaptive time stepping 4 2 model comparison scenario 1 the co2 plumes simulated by the hybrid model and a full dimensional model with and without the inclusion of capillary pressure are presented in figs 7 and 8 respectively in both cases we can see that the co2 plume has not reached the low permeability subdomain after 1 year of injection after 5 years of injection the co2 plume encounters the low permeability subdomain the results show only a small amount of co2 invaded into the low permeability zone while the majority of co2 flows through from beneath when capillary pressure is included the co2 has a greater spreading in the vertical dimension due to capillary diffusion i e the macroscopic interface between co2 and brine is smeared which subsequently leads to slower lateral migration of co2 for both test cases after either 1 year or 5 years of co2 injection the agreement between the simulations from the hybrid model and the full dimensional model is excellent we present direct comparison between the leading edges of the co2 plume from the two models in figs 7 and 8 the leading edge of the plume is defined as the transition from grid cells with co2 saturation greater than 1 to neighbor cells with saturation less than 1 guo et al 2014 the results show that simulated leading edges from the two models are almost identical with only slight deviations the differences are within 1 to 3 numerical cells 4 3 model comparison scenario 2 the co2 plumes for the second scenario are presented in figs 9 and 10 it can be seen that co2 reaches and penetrates into the high permeability subdomain after 5 years of injection it is interesting to note that the saturation inside this subdomain is much greater than that of the outside similar to scenario 1 more vertical spreading of co2 and brine is observed when capillary pressure is accounted for which also leads to slower lateral migration of co2 the co2 plumes simulated by the hybrid model and full dimensional models are very close either with and without accounting for capillary pressure the difference between the leading edges of the co2 plumes is minimal 4 4 model comparison scenario 3 fig 11 presents the co2 plume after injection of 1 year and 5 years for the third scenario we can see that after 1 year co2 in the lower layer moves much faster than that in the upper layer because of the higher permeability the faster moving co2 in the bottom layer also starts to migrate upward and enter the upper layer driven by buoyancy after 5 years co2 migrates much further in the bottom layer but it cannot enter the upper layer due to the presence of the low permeability subdomains until it goes beyond the right boundary of the low permeability subdomains the comparison between the simulated co2 plumes from the two models again shows an excellent agreement minor deviations within two grid cells are observed at approximately 500 m away from the left boundary near the boundaries of the local heterogeneous zones this is likely a result of the difference in computational algorithms of the hybrid and full dimensional models for computing vertical flux between the two layers guo et al 2016a 5 discussion we have developed a new hybrid framework coupling the dynamic reconstruction model and full dimensional model for simulating co2 storage in deep saline aquifers the hybrid model applies to geological formations that have both layered and local geological heterogeneities a key feature of this new hybrid modeling framework is that it can provide solutions that are almost equally accurate as those from the full dimensional model while being much more computationally efficient so long as the geological heterogeneities are layered and or localized below we comment on the computational efficiency of the hybrid model compared to that of the full dimensional model the computational cost of the hybrid model relative to the full dimensional model may be measured by a simple complexity analysis both models employ the impes algorithm that solves the pressure implicit and saturation explicit equations sequentially because the saturation equation is solved explicitly with a relatively minor computational cost compared to the pressure equation we focus our complexity analysis on the solution of the pressure without loss of generality we assume that the hybrid system has a total number of m columns with k grid cells in the vertical direction the heterogeneous subdomains are comprised of α fraction of the total number of columns and the whole domain contains l layers at each time step the full dimensional model solves a lmk by lmk linear system with a complexity of o lmk n the hybrid model solves a l 1 α m α mk by l 1 α m α mk system that involves a complexity of o l 1 α m α mk n here n is an exponent that depends on which linear system solver is employed to solve the matrix for elliptic boundary value problems in 2d or 3d n 1 33 1 17 and 1 for conjugate gradient cg preconditioned cg and multigrid linear system solvers respectively heath 2018 to illustrate the computational complexity of the simulations presented in section 4 we take the single layer case scenario 1 as an example and apply the above analysis to compare the complexity between the hybrid and full dimensional models in this case l m k and α are 1 150 50 1 and 0 2 respectively at each numerical time step the hybrid model needs to solve a 1 620 1 620 linear system with a complexity of o 1 620 n while for the full dimensional model needs to solve a 7 500 7 500 linear system with a complexity of o 7 500 n for illustration purpose we take n 1 33 for a conjugate gradient cg linear system solver to do the comparison in this case the computational costs of hybrid model and full dimensional model at each numerical time step are respectively o 1 620 1 33 and o 7 500 1 33 the computational cost of the full dimensional model is approximately 10 times greater than that of the hybrid model for each time step finally we note that the reduction of computational cost depends on the fraction of the heterogeneous subdomains α the smaller the α is the greater higher computational efficiency the hybrid model will have compared to that of the full dimensional model when α approaches 1 the hybrid model would be identical to the full dimensional model 6 conclusion we present a novel hybrid framework by coupling the multilayer dynamic reconstruction dr model with the full dimensional model to address both layered and local heterogeneities in two phase flow systems for co2 storage in deep saline aquifers this new hybrid framework can capture both the vertical and horizontal dynamics of the co2 plume and requires much less computational effort than the standard full dimensional models comparisons of the hybrid model and the full dimensional model for three injection scenarios are presented for a injection of co2 into a high permeability domain with an embedded relatively low permeability subdomain b injection of co2 into a low permeablity domain with an embedded relatively high permeability subdomain and c injection of co2 into a two layer geological formation in the presence of multiple heterogeneous subdomains the agreement between the simulated co2 plumes from the hybrid model and those from the full dimensional model is excellent in addition the hybrid model is much more computationally efficient than the full dimensional model as long as the heterogeneous subdomains are small relative to the entire geological formation credit authorship contribution statement tianyuan zheng methodology investigation software validation data curation

models e g vertical equilibrium ve and dynamic reconstruction dr models based on vertical integration of the full dimensional governing equations have been developed ve models assume rapid segregation of the injected and the resident fluids due to strong buoyancy conversely dr models employ a multiscale framework that relaxes the ve assumption and captures the vertical dynamics of co2 and brine by solving the vertical two phase flow dynamics as one dimensional fine scale problems although dr models relax the ve assumption while maintaining much of the computational efficiency of ve models they are thus far limited to homogeneous and layered heterogeneous formations we present a novel hybrid framework that couples a multilayer dynamic reconstruction model and a full dimensional model the new

reducing anthropogenic co2 emissions e g metz et al 2005 deep geological formations are the major storage sites for large scale and long term storage of co2 among the various types of geological formations deep saline aquifers have been estimated to hold the largest storage potential on the order of 10 000 gt bachu and adams 2003 metz et al 2005 celia et al 2015 bachu 2015 co2 injection in a deep saline aquifer leads a two phase flow problem where the injected co2 often in its supercritical state may be considered as the nonwetting phase and the resident brine may be considered as the wetting phase to ensure safe and long term storage numerical flow simulations are frequently employed to address engineering questions during planning and operation such as evaluating potential storage sites based on limited geological data and identifying co2 plume evolution under different system configurations and engineering operations due to the multiscale nature of the saline aquifers highly nonlinear multiphase flow dynamics and large spatial and temporal scales computational complexity imposes a strong limitation furthermore the significant uncertainties involved in geological parameters often require numerical simulations of many realizations e g ren et al 2016 chen et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 which poses even stronger computational demands to address the computational challenge a family of simplified models based on reduction of spatial dimensions have been developed for geological co2 storage over the past decade the dimension reduction is achieved by vertically integrating the full dimensional governing equations one type of vertically integrated models referred to as vertical equilibrium model ve and initially developed for oil and gas flow in reservoirs coats et al 1971 yortsos 1995 were introduced and developed to study the co2 brine system by assuming a rapid segregation of the injected co2 and the resident brine due to strong buoyancy nordbotten

effects andersen and nilsen 2018 and the presence of fractures tao et al 2019 while ve models have been widely used to answer many important science and engineering questions related to geological co2 storage they are limited by the vertical equilibrium assumption that may not be valid under certain conditions when the time scale of the buoyant segregation is large relative to the time scale of interest court et al 2012 bandilla et al 2019 guo et al 2014 developed a new vertically integrated model in a multiscale framework that relaxes the vertical equilibrium assumption similar to the ve model the pressure equation is integrated along the vertical direction leading to a vertically integrated coarse scale pressure equation in contrast to the ve model the new vertically integrated model accounts for the vertical dynamics of co2 and brine by solving one dimensional two phase flow along the vertical dimension as a set of fine scale problems this new vertically integrated model referred to as dynamic reconstruction dr model maintains much of the computational efficiency of the ve model and extends the applicability of vertically integrated models to problems that involve strong vertical dynamics later on guo et al 2016a extended the dr model to multiple vertically integrated layers that can simulate co2 injection in layered heterogeneous geological formations this extended dr model is referred to as multilayer dynamic reconstruction mldr model though vertically integrated models have grown significantly in sophistication they are still limited to geological formations with homogeneous or layered heterogeneous properties for problems that involve complex local heterogeneity within a layer the full dimensional models are the only available option however heterogeneity is ubiquitous in geological formations local heterogeneous regions may significantly impact the migration of co2 reducing or enhancing the storage capacity of a geological formation because of the relative low or high permeability and other complex fluid dynamic processes e g li and benson 2015 ren 2018 xu et al 2019 bakhshian et al 2020 moreno and rabinovich 2021 some recent attempts are made to couple vertical equilibrium and full dimensional models ve 3d becker et al 2018 møyner and nilsen 2019 møyner et al 2020 these hybrid ve 3d modeling approaches prove to maintain much of the computational efficiency of vertical equilibrium models while being able to capture complex heterogeneities while promising the ve 3d models are to date limited to special types of heterogeneous aquifers that either have a single layer with relative high permeability becker et al 2018 or multiple layers separated by aquitards that are only permeable for brine and do not allow for co2 penetration møyner and nilsen 2019 møyner et al 2020 to fill the gap between standard reduced dimensional and full dimensional models more general coupling between vertically integrated and full dimensional models need to be developed to model aquifers with local heterogeneities in the present work we develop a new hybrid model that monolithically couples the multilayer dynamic reconstruction mldr model and the full dimensional model we decompose the spatial domain into heterogeneous and homogeneous subdomains in a heterogeneous subdomain we solve full dimensional governing equations in a homogeneous subdomain we employ the mldr model guo et al 2016a the new hybrid model maintains much of the computational efficiency of vertically integrated models while is capable of solving co2 migration in geological layers with both in layer and layered heterogeneity to demonstrate the applicability of our hybrid model we simulate three scenarios of co2 injection into a a high permeability layer with an embedded relatively low permeability subdomain b a low permeability layer with an embedded relatively high permeability subdomain and c a two layer geological formation with multiple heterogeneous zones we present comparisons of simulated co2 plumes as well as the computational efficiency of the new hybrid model and a standard full dimensional model the present paper is organized as follows we first give a brief review of the governing equations of the full dimensional model and vertically integrated models including the ve model and the dr model both of which are closely related to our hybrid framework we then present the detailed coupling scheme of the hybrid model next we compare the new hybrid model with a standard full dimensional model under different geological conditions we then discuss the key ingredients and computational efficiency of the new hybrid modeling framework we close with concluding remarks 2 governing equations and modeling approaches in this section we briefly review the governing equations for the full dimensional model and vertically integrated models i e ve and dr models the definitions of variables and measures can be found in nomenclature 2 1 full dimensional model to simplify the presentation we assume that the co2 and brine phases are immiscible and incompressible and the solid matrix is rigid in addition brine and co2 are considered as the wetting and nonwetting phases respectively the mass balance equation for each fluid phase can be written as 1 ϕ s α t u α ψ α α b c where ϕ is the porosity s α is the saturation of phase α b and c denote the brine and co2 phases respectively u α is the darcy flux and ψ α is the source sink term of phase α the darcy flux u α of phase α can be computed by the two phase extended darcy s law 2 u α k λ α p α ϱ α g where k is the intrinsic permeability tensor λ α k r α μ α is the mobility of phase α k r α is the relative permeability that is often parameterized as a function of the phase saturation μ α is the fluid viscosity ϱ α is the density of phase α and g is the gravitational acceleration vector the two fluid phases are assumed to occupy the entire pore space so their saturations sum to unity 3 s b s c 1 the capillary pressure p cap is defined as the difference between the pressure of co2 and that of brine and is parameterized as a function of phase saturation 4 p c p b p cap s α eqs 1 4 represent a closed mathematical description of the co2 brine flow in deep saline aquifers the above full dimensional variables and equations are referred to as fine scale variables and equations the vertically integrated variables and equations presented in the following are referred to as coarse scale variables and equations 2 2 vertically integrated models 2 2 1 vertical equilibrium ve model the ve model assumes that the two fluid phases co2 and brine have fully segregated due to buoyancy and the pressure of each phase has reached equilibrium between gravity and capillary pressure in the vertical direction nordbotten and celia 2011 this so called vertical equilibrium assumption allows one to integrate the governing equations along the vertical direction to obtain a set of two dimensional equations see fig 2 the governing equations eq 1 and eq 2 integrated over the vertical direction are presented in eq 5 and eq 6 5 φ s α t c α φ s α p α t u α ψ α 6 u α k λ α p α ϱ α g where subscript stands for the x y plane c α represents the compressibility coefficient of the fluid phase and the uppercase letters denote the vertically integrated i e coarse scale variables and parameters and are defined as 7 φ x y ξ b ξ t ϕ x y z d z 8 s α x y t 1 φ ξ b ξ t ϕ x y z s α x y z t d z 9 u α ξ b ξ t u α d z 10 ψ α ξ b ξ t ψ α d z 11 k ξ b ξ t k d z 12 λ α k 1 ξ b ξ t k λ α d z where ξ b and ξ t represent the elevation of bottom and top boundary of the formation summing eq 5 for the two fluid phases yields the coarse scale pressure equation 13 φ c c s c p c t φ c b s b p b t u c u b ψ c ψ b the mass balance equation for one of the fluid phases eq 5 is then used as the coarse scale saturation equation the difference between the two coarse scale phase pressures is referred to as the pseudo capillary pressure which is a function of the coarse scale saturation 14 p c p b p cap s c eqs 5 14 represent a closed mathematical description for the ve model once the coarse scale pressure and saturation are solved the fine scale pressure and saturation in the vertical direction can be reconstructed algebraically based on the ve assumption readers can refer to nordbotten and celia 2011 for more details of the ve model 2 2 2 single layer dynamic reconstruction dr model guo et al 2014 presented a more general vertically integrated model referred to as dynamic reconstruction dr model that is not limited by the ve assumption the dr model also integrates the fine scale equations over the vertical direction to derive a set of vertically integrated coarse scale equations however instead of employing the ve assumption it solves the vertical dynamics of co2 and brine as an additional set of fine scale problems along the vertical direction see fig 3 the coarse scale pressure equation is similar to the vertically integrated equation of the ve model see eq 13 once the coarse scale pressure p α is solved from the coarse scale pressure equation the fine scale pressure can be reconstructed as 15 p α x y z t p α x y t π α x y z t where π α ξ b ξ t s c ϱ c s b ϱ b g s c p cap s b z d z refers to the deviation of the fine scale pressure from the coarse scale pressure which is assumed to follow a saturation weighted hydrostatic profile the reconstructed fine scale pressure profiles are used to compute the fine scale horizontal fluxes then the fine scale saturation can be reconstructed based on the fractional flow formulation in the vertical dimension summing the fine scale mass balance equations for the two phases yields 16 c ϕ ϕ c b s b p b t c ϕ ϕ c c s c p c t u b z z u c z z ψ b ψ c u b u c eq 16 allows one to compute the total flux in the vertical direction u tot z u b z u c z given the vertical total flux the phase flux u α z can be solved using the fractional flow form of the darcy s equation 17 u b z f b u tot z k z λ c ϱ g λ c k z p cap z 18 u c z f c u tot z k z λ b ϱ g λ b k z p cap z where k z is the permeability in z direction and f α is the fractional flow function 19 f α λ α λ b λ c now all the vertical and horizontal phase fluxes are known the fine scale saturation can be computed by solving the fine scale transport equation 20 ϕ s b t c ϕ ϕ c b s b p b t u b z z ψ b u b more detailed derivations and the algorithimic steps of the dr model can be found in guo et al 2014 and guo 2016 2 2 3 multilayer dynamic reconstruction mldr model the single layer dr model was further extended to a multilayer dynamic reconstruction mldr model guo et al 2016a that can simulate co2 migration in layered heterogeneous formations fig 4 the mldr algorithm formulates a vertically integrated model for each layer and couples the integrated layers via the fluxes across the layer interfaces without loss of generality we take the flux between layer j and layer j 1 as an example δ z z j 1 z j denotes the distance between these two layers the total flux between the two layers have the following form 21 u tot j 1 2 k z j 1 2 λ tot j 1 2 p b j 1 p b j δ z ω 1 j 1 2 ω 2 j 1 2 where 22a k z j 1 2 λ tot j 1 2 1 1 δ z z j z j 1 1 k z λ b λ c d z 22b ω 1 j 1 2 1 δ z z j z j 1 λ c λ b λ c p cap z d z 22c ω 2 j 1 2 1 δ z z j z j 1 λ b ρ b λ c ρ c λ b λ c g d z ω 1 j 1 2 and ω 2 j 1 2 are the terms associated with the capillary and gravity driving forces phase fluxes of co2 and brine can be computed from u tot j 1 2 based on the fractional flow equation for the two fine scale cells at the layer interface by coupling different vertically integrated layers eq 21 extends the single layer dr model to the mldr model that allows for geological formations with multiple layers the dr models are often solved by an implicit pressure explicit saturation impes algorithm the coarse scale p α is solved implicitly as a vertically integrated problem for the single layer dr model and as a full dimensional the number of vertical grid cells equals to the number of layers problem for the mldr model for both the single layer dr and mldr models the fine scale p α and s α are solved explicitly as many one dimensional problems that require minor computational costs by design the dr models maintain much of the computational efficiency of the ve models while being able to provide similar accuracy compared to full dimensional models for homogeneous and layered heterogeneous formations guo et al 2016a guo 2016 3 development of hybrid framework we generalize the concept of the vertically integrated models and develop a hybrid framework that couples the multilayer dr models with full dimensional models in the same computational domain the new hybrid framework targets layered geological formations with local heterogeneities e g low permeability shales or high permeability channels see figs 1 and 5 a we decompose the entire computational domain into heterogeneous i e containing local heterogeneities and homogeneous subdomains the heterogenous subdomains are solved by the full dimensional model while the mldr is applied to the homogeneous subdomains which significantly reduces the computational cost in the following we introduce the coupling scheme and the numerical algorithm used in the hybrid framework for a layered geological formation shown in fig 5 a we identify the local heterogeneous regions in layers as full dimensional subdomains the gray areas in fig 5 b for illustration purposes here we assume that the geological layers are horizontal our hybrid framework and the algorithms are capable of handling general lateral geological formations with topographical features the coupling between full dimensional and mldr subdomains either occurs within a layer e g fig 5 d or at the interface between two layers e g fig 5 e for the former the phase fluxes across boundary γ x between a full dimensional subdomain and a dr subdomain have the following forms 23 u α ij γ x k ij λ α ij p α j p α i δ x where i is the index of fine scale cells in the vertical column of the full dimensional domain and j is the index of fine scale cells in the dr column with denoting the fine scale variables reconstructed from solving the vertically integrated problems k ij and λ α ij are permeability and mobility at the subdomain interface respectively the reconstructed pressure p α j p α j π α j for subdomain interfaces like γ z in fig 5 e we use m to index the fine scale cell in the full dimensional domain at the interface and n to index the coarse scale dr cell column the phase fluxes across γ z are computed using the following equation 24 u α mn γ z k mn λ α mn p α n p α m 1 2 δ z δ z ρ g where coefficients k mn and λ α mn at the interface between layers have similar forms as eqs 22a p α n is the coarse scale pressure which is defined as the pressure at the center of the dr column p α m is the pressure of the fine scale cell in the full dimensional subdomain δ z is the height of the full dimensional fine scale numerical cell and δ z is the depth of the dr column a monolithic scheme is used to couple the full dimensional model and the mldr model in the different subdomains an impes method is implemented for solving the primary variables the full numerical algorithm involves the following steps 1 assume the solutions for fine scale phase pressures and saturations are known at all points in the domain for discrete time level t n here integer n denotes discrete time step 2 compute the coefficients in eqs 15 24 and solve the resulting equations for pressures at t n 1 implicitly using saturation values from t n this gives a solution of the coarse scale pressure in the mldr domains and fine scale pressure in the full dimensional domains 3 given the pressure field from step 2 compute phase fluxes using eqs 6 21 and 23 reconstruct fine scale pressure in the mldr domain using π α x y z at t n and compute fine scale horizontal fluxes between the dr columns 4 given the phase fluxes computed at the subdomain interfaces and the horizontal fluxes between the vertical columns in the mldr subdomains solve the vertically integrated problems for the mldr subdomains to update the fine scale saturations explicitly for t n 1 4 results we construct three scenarios to demonstrate the applicability and accuracy of the new hybrid framework fig 6 the first two scenarios consider a single geological layer a injection of co2 into a high permeability domain with an embedded relatively low permeability subdomain and b injection of co2 into a low permeablity domain with an embedded relatively high permeability subdomain in the third scenario we simulate the injection of co2 into a two layer geological formation with multiple heterogeneous subdomains a standard full dimensional model is used as a reference to evaluate the accuracy of the simulations performed using the hybrid model for simplicity we simulate them in a two dimensional cross sectional domain so that the problem setup only contains one horizontal dimension and one vertical dimension 4 1 scenarios and simulation setup the model setups for the single layer and two layer scenarios are shown in fig 6 a c respectively all of the scenarios involve injection through a vertical fully penetrating well the simulation times for the three scenarios are all set to 5 years to focus on the early period during which dynamic segregation of co2 and brine plays an important role for the problem setup the whole domain is considered to be isotropic the thickness of each layer is 50 m and the horizontal extent is 1 500 m no flow condition for both fluid phases is assigned at the top and bottom boundaries of the domain co2 flux is injected at a constant rate hydrostatic pressure profiles are employed at the right boundary of the domain the domain is initially saturated with brine under a hydrostatic pressure field for all the test cases the solutions of hybrid model are compared with those from the full dimensional model for all the simulated cases the brine density and co2 densities are set to be 1000 kg m3 and 710 kg m3 respectively the brine and co2 viscosity are 3 10 4 and 4 25 10 5 pa s respectively the injection rate of co2 in each layer is 5 10 6 mt year m2 the porosity is set to 0 25 the residual saturation for brine is 0 1 the brooks corey curve is used for calculating the relative permeability and capillary pressure with a pore size distribution parameter of 2 for scenario 1 as shown in fig 6 a low permeability subdomain is located 500 m away from the left boundary the permeabilities of the low permeability subdomain and the rest of the domain are 5 md and 100 md respectively the corresponding entry pressures are 40 kpa and 10 kpa for scenario 2 a high permeability subdomain of 200 m 5 m is located 200 m from the left boundary and 10 m from the top boundary fig 6 b the permeability of the high permeable zone is 100 md and the rest of the domain has a permeability of 20 md the entry pressures are 0 5 kpa for the high permeability subdomain and 10 kpa for the rest of the domain for scenario 3 the formation is made up of a less permeable layer κ 1 10 md with an entry pressure of 32 kpa and a more permeable layer κ 2 100 md with an entry pressure of 10 kpa two low permeability subdomains κ 3 κ 4 0 01 md with an entry pressure of 1 000 kpa are located at the interface of the two layers fig 6 c for each layer the domain is discretized into 150 columns in the horizontal dimension for both the hybrid and full dimensional models 50 grid cells are employed in the vertical dimension in each layer for the full dimensional subdomains of the hybrid model i e where embedded heterogeneous subdomains exist the dr subdomains of the hybrid model also employ 50 grid cells in the vertical dimension but they are only used for the fine scale calculations a buffer zone is employed at the interface between the dr and full dimensional domains i e several columns up to 10 in the homogeneous domain adjacent to the heterogeneous domain are assigned to the full dimensional model we found that employing the buffer zone leads to a more robust coupling between the dr and full dimensional model a fixed time step size 0 25 day is employed for all simulations note that the algorithm itself allows for adaptive time stepping 4 2 model comparison scenario 1 the co2 plumes simulated by the hybrid model and a full dimensional model with and without the inclusion of capillary pressure are presented in figs 7 and 8 respectively in both cases we can see that the co2 plume has not reached the low permeability subdomain after 1 year of injection after 5 years of injection the co2 plume encounters the low permeability subdomain the results show only a small amount of co2 invaded into the low permeability zone while the majority of co2 flows through from beneath when capillary pressure is included the co2 has a greater spreading in the vertical dimension due to capillary diffusion i e the macroscopic interface between co2 and brine is smeared which subsequently leads to slower lateral migration of co2 for both test cases after either 1 year or 5 years of co2 injection the agreement between the simulations from the hybrid model and the full dimensional model is excellent we present direct comparison between the leading edges of the co2 plume from the two models in figs 7 and 8 the leading edge of the plume is defined as the transition from grid cells with co2 saturation greater than 1 to neighbor cells with saturation less than 1 guo et al 2014 the results show that simulated leading edges from the two models are almost identical with only slight deviations the differences are within 1 to 3 numerical cells 4 3 model comparison scenario 2 the co2 plumes for the second scenario are presented in figs 9 and 10 it can be seen that co2 reaches and penetrates into the high permeability subdomain after 5 years of injection it is interesting to note that the saturation inside this subdomain is much greater than that of the outside similar to scenario 1 more vertical spreading of co2 and brine is observed when capillary pressure is accounted for which also leads to slower lateral migration of co2 the co2 plumes simulated by the hybrid model and full dimensional models are very close either with and without accounting for capillary pressure the difference between the leading edges of the co2 plumes is minimal 4 4 model comparison scenario 3 fig 11 presents the co2 plume after injection of 1 year and 5 years for the third scenario we can see that after 1 year co2 in the lower layer moves much faster than that in the upper layer because of the higher permeability the faster moving co2 in the bottom layer also starts to migrate upward and enter the upper layer driven by buoyancy after 5 years co2 migrates much further in the bottom layer but it cannot enter the upper layer due to the presence of the low permeability subdomains until it goes beyond the right boundary of the low permeability subdomains the comparison between the simulated co2 plumes from the two models again shows an excellent agreement minor deviations within two grid cells are observed at approximately 500 m away from the left boundary near the boundaries of the local heterogeneous zones this is likely a result of the difference in computational algorithms of the hybrid and full dimensional models for computing vertical flux between the two layers guo et al 2016a 5 discussion we have developed a new hybrid framework coupling the dynamic reconstruction model and full dimensional model for simulating co2 storage in deep saline aquifers the hybrid model applies to geological formations that have both layered and local geological heterogeneities a key feature of this new hybrid modeling framework is that it can provide solutions that are almost equally accurate as those from the full dimensional model while being much more computationally efficient so long as the geological heterogeneities are layered and or localized below we comment on the computational efficiency of the hybrid model compared to that of the full dimensional model the computational cost of the hybrid model relative to the full dimensional model may be measured by a simple complexity analysis both models employ the impes algorithm that solves the pressure implicit and saturation explicit equations sequentially because the saturation equation is solved explicitly with a relatively minor computational cost compared to the pressure equation we focus our complexity analysis on the solution of the pressure without loss of generality we assume that the hybrid system has a total number of m columns with k grid cells in the vertical direction the heterogeneous subdomains are comprised of α fraction of the total number of columns and the whole domain contains l layers at each time step the full dimensional model solves a lmk by lmk linear system with a complexity of o lmk n the hybrid model solves a l 1 α m α mk by l 1 α m α mk system that involves a complexity of o l 1 α m α mk n here n is an exponent that depends on which linear system solver is employed to solve the matrix for elliptic boundary value problems in 2d or 3d n 1 33 1 17 and 1 for conjugate gradient cg preconditioned cg and multigrid linear system solvers respectively heath 2018 to illustrate the computational complexity of the simulations presented in section 4 we take the single layer case scenario 1 as an example and apply the above analysis to compare the complexity between the hybrid and full dimensional models in this case l m k and α are 1 150 50 1 and 0 2 respectively at each numerical time step the hybrid model needs to solve a 1 620 1 620 linear system with a complexity of o 1 620 n while for the full dimensional model needs to solve a 7 500 7 500 linear system with a complexity of o 7 500 n for illustration purpose we take n 1 33 for a conjugate gradient cg linear system solver to do the comparison in this case the computational costs of hybrid model and full dimensional model at each numerical time step are respectively o 1 620 1 33 and o 7 500 1 33 the computational cost of the full dimensional model is approximately 10 times greater than that of the hybrid model for each time step finally we note that the reduction of computational cost depends on the fraction of the heterogeneous subdomains α the smaller the α is the greater higher computational efficiency the hybrid model will have compared to that of the full dimensional model when α approaches 1 the hybrid model would be identical to the full dimensional model 6 conclusion we present a novel hybrid framework by coupling the multilayer dynamic reconstruction dr model with the full dimensional model to address both layered and local heterogeneities in two phase flow systems for co2 storage in deep saline aquifers this new hybrid framework can capture both the vertical and horizontal dynamics of the co2 plume and requires much less computational effort than the standard full dimensional models comparisons of the hybrid model and the full dimensional model for three injection scenarios are presented for a injection of co2 into a high permeability domain with an embedded relatively low permeability subdomain b injection of co2 into a low permeablity domain with an embedded relatively high permeability subdomain and c injection of co2 into a two layer geological formation in the presence of multiple heterogeneous subdomains the agreement between the simulated co2 plumes from the hybrid model and those from the full dimensional model is excellent in addition the hybrid model is much more computationally efficient than the full dimensional model as long as the heterogeneous subdomains are small relative to the entire geological formation credit authorship contribution statement tianyuan zheng methodology investigation software validation data curation

4424,a pilot study was carried out in the matsi spring fen southern estonia to test a proposed methodology terasmaa et al 2020 for identifying potential effects of groundwater bodies on groundwater dependent terrestrial ecosystems gdte a comprehensive hydrochemical and isotopic dataset was collected and analyzed using multivariate statistical methods to assess the origin of the groundwater discharging in the spring fen and to determine both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of gdte groundwater interdependence the hydrochemical findings were complemented with the hydrogeological hydrodynamical and botanical observations and summarized into a conceptual model of the study site the results show that the status of the spring fen is influenced both by groundwater inflow from the regional middle devonian sandstone aquifer d2gj ar in the transboundary gauja koiva river basin but also by discharge of the shallow aquifer found in quaternary q deposits of local extent by using multivariate statistical methods the mixing of the two main groundwater sources in the spring fen discharge was quantified on average the regional d2gj ar and local q aquifer contributed 67 and 33 respectively to the spring fen discharge the groundwater was generally more mineralized in the d2gj ar aquifer while more nutrient rich in the shallow q aquifer agricultural activities in the arable lands adjacent to the spring fen have resulted in the elevated loads of macronutrients and halogens in the shallow q aquifer ntot 1 95 2 6 mg n l ptot 0 59 0 8 mg p l although generally in pristine state the elevated macronutrient loading from the q aquifer and perhaps the beaver activity has led to deterioration of the status of the spring fen communities in the upstream parts of the main fen polygon the n p ratios were occasionally above the 16 1 indicating nitrogen limitation and phosphorus excess which is likely due to increased upland loading of phosphorus from fertilizers the results of the study show that poor chemical status of a gdte can result from local pollution sources and land use even in cases when the related regional gw body itself is in good chemical status also the usefulness of analyzing minor groundwater components e g ba sr al f sio2 in a gdte assessment in establishing the end member mixing relationships has been shown all in all it is one of the first

global changes affecting both its quantity and quality cuthbert et al 2019 dalin et al 2017 gleeson et al 2012 mcdonough et al 2020 wada et al 2010 while a critical resource for the growing human population groundwater is also essential for groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes which in turn provide vital ecosystem services for other species boulton 2020 kløve et al 2011 gdes including springs wetlands rivers lakes and lagoons are valuable ecosystems that depend on the quantity and quality of groundwater input any changes in the groundwater quality or quantity often result in significant damage of dependent flora and fauna kløve et al 2011a rohde et al 2017 in recent decades the gdes have gained worldwide recognition richardson et al 2011a richardson et al 2011b more emphasis has been put on their protection and sustainable management rohde et al 2017 the eu water framework directive 2000 60 ec european commission 2000 aims to ensure good quality of all water resources in member states including groundwater and protection of associated ecosystems from further deterioration water framework directive wfd distinguishes between groundwater dependent aquatic ecosystems and groundwater dependent terrestrial ecosystems gdte schutten et al 2012 the environmental objectives of wfd are applied to groundwater bodies gwb management and reporting units set by each member state to estimate its quantitative and qualitative status as gdtes are dependent on the groundwater bodies the good chemical and quantitative status of the latter is also critical for the health of gdtes thus the status of the gdte cannot be assessed separately from the groundwater body the reliance of a gdte on a groundwater body may be complex the dependence may be both quantitative and qualitative or partial fens are commonly continuously supplied by a groundwater body kløve et al 2011a and can be sensitive to changes both in the quantity and specific physico chemical properties of the groundwater at the same time raised bogs are not typically perceived as groundwater dependent ecosystems however according to kløve et al 2011 and marandi et al 2014 marandi et al 2013 bogs can be sensitive to changes in the hydraulic pressure of the underlying groundwater body thus may also be considered as gdtes under certain conditions therefore the identification of gdte groundwater body dependency and the status assessment of a gdte requires a multi pronged approach combining methods from several disciplines gdtes are directly or indirectly protected by a number of european union directives birds habitats groundwater floods and international agreements such as the ramsar convention on wetlands many gdtes are included in the natura 2000 network of protected sites often the national monitoring networks have not been established to determine interactions between groundwater and surface water nor have monitoring networks been established keeping gdtes in mind moreover the parameters monitored in groundwater are not always relevant for assessing the status of gdtes it is complicated or impossible to reliably assess the status of gdtes in the framework of the existing monitoring and inventory programs a common problem in many countries including estonia is that the national monitoring and inventory programs for terrestrial ecosystems do not include monitoring of the hydrodynamics or hydrochemistry of the gdtes terasmaa et al 2020 so far the only indicator available to determine the potential negative effect of groundwater bodies on gdtes has been the deterioration of the ecological status according to the assessment of annex i habitats for example total phosphorus and nitrogen are not currently monitored in groundwater in estonia but they are used to determine chemical status of surface water bodies terasmaa et al 2020 marandi et al 2019 as a joint initiative in estonia and latvia a methodology for assessing gdtes terasmaa et al 2020 has been updated in the framework of the project joint management of groundwater dependent ecosystems in transboundary gauja koiva river basin groundeco financed from interreg estonia latvia cross border cooperation program 2014 2020 the proposed methodology allows to test the potential effect of groundwater bodies on gdtes as far as there is available data for further development and verification of the methodology proposed by terasmaa et al 2020 this pilot study was carried out within the groundeco project the matsi spring fen in the transboundary gauja koiva river basin was selected as the pilot area to verify and characterize the presumed link terasmaa et al 2015 marandi et al 2019 between the gdte and the middle devonian groundwater body in the gauja koiva river basin in the framework of this study a comprehensive hydrochemical and isotopic dataset was collected and analyzed using multivariate statistical methods to assess the origin of the groundwater discharging in the spring fen the hydrochemical findings were complemented by the hydrogeological hydrodynamical and botanical observations and summarized into a conceptual model of the matsi spring fen it is one of the first comprehensive studies of the interactions between a groundwater body and a groundwater dependent terrestrial ecosystem in the estonian context 1 1 study site the matsi spring fen was chosen as the pilot study site in the estonian part of the transboundary gauja koiva river basin it is located in se estonia võru county rõuge parish matsi village the spring fen is situated in a spring sapping valley in the left slope of the valley of the mustjõgi river at an approximate elevation of 66 m asl fig 1 estonia is situated in the dfb climate region according to köppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 beck et al 2018 the mean annual temperature is 6 c the mustjõgi river catchment area 1820 km2 is the largest tributary of the transboundary gauja river basin basin area 9800 km2 in estonia fig 1 the matsi spring fen consists of three polygons m1 m2 and m3 areas 0 7 3 4 and 0 4 ha respectively separated by road dams and ditches fig 1 the fen has been previously inventoried by ilomets et al 2012 as an important groundwater dependent terrestrial ecosystem with a very representative botanical community belonging to the fennoscandian mineral rich springs and spring fens code 7160 habitats directive annex i habitat type according to lõokene 1968 tufa deposits are present in the matsi spring fen it has been hypothesized that the matsi spring fen is dependent on the middle devonian groundwater body in the gauja koiva river basin terasmaa et al 2015 marandi et al 2019 the mustjõgi river flows in an approximately 1 1 5 km wide and 25 30 m deep valley that runs across the võru hargla depression system in the ne sw direction fig 1 the valley of the mustjõgi river has incised into a glacially eroded sandstone plateau of middle devonian gauja formation gauja stage givetian stage separating the haanja upland in se from the otepää and karula uplands in n and w respectively see fig 1 the gauja stage features fine grained well rounded and weakly to medium cemented sandstones with clay and siltstone interlayers põldvere et al 2016 the total thickness of the formation ranges from 78 to 79 8 m kleesment and mark kurik 1997 quartz dominates the mineralogical composition up to 95 of the formation followed by feldspars and micas while kaolinite and dolomite calcite are the main cement forming minerals kleesment 1995 kleesment and mark kurik 1997 kleesment et al 2012 on the plateau the bedrock is capped with a layer of quaternary sediments primarily till with sandy loam and sandy silt loam gqiii the till is usually overlain by glaciolacustrine lgqiii or in lesser cases glaciofluvial fqiii silt sandy loam sandy silt loam and gravel kummisaar 1967 rahumäe 1968 aia 1971 allikmaa 1986 the exact thickness of the quaternary cover in the matsi village is unknown however measurements from the vicinity suggest that its thickness varies from 1 to 18 m kummisaar 1967 rahumäe 1968 jalast 1976 allikmaa 1986 the geology of the valley in the matsi section has not been studied in detail however there is some data on the floodplain and slope geology in the mõniste and kikkaoja village approximately 7 km downstream and 5 km upstream from matsi village respectively fig 1 in the valley bottom a complex sequence of silty to coarse sands and gravel layers prevails with occasional silt loam lenses allikmaa 1986 the terrigenous sediments are usually overlain by a 0 4 4 5 m thick layer of peat occasionally the peat is underlain by a 0 7 m thick layer of sandy mud allikmaa 1986 the hydrogeological context of the matsi spring fen study area is generally defined by the middle devonian d2 and the overlying quaternary q aquifer systems which constitute the middle devonian groundwater body in the gauja koiva river basin see fig 2 marandi et al 2019 as of 2020 the general status of the groundwater body was assessed as good according to marandi et al 2020 the quaternary glacial glaciolacustrine and glaciofluvial deposits represent the q aquifer system in the study area therefore the lateral variation of the water bearing properties of the q aquifers is significant generally the layers and lenses of more conductive sand and gravel glaciolacustrine and glaciofluvial sediments host the uppermost shallow q unconfined or confined aquifer if between till layers that receives primarily autogenic meteoric recharge the shallow q aquifer of local extent appears to be perched on the underlying glacial till layer acting as a weak aquitard kummisaar 1967 vallner et al 1968 jalast 1976 põldvere et al 2016 according to kummisaar 1967 the groundwater table in the shallow q was at an average depth of 2 2 0 78 m from the surface on the plateau in the matsi village the groundwater of the shallow q aquifer is usually abstracted in the shallow dug wells up to 6 m deep of small households the maximum thickness of the shallow q aquifer in the study area is not known but it could range up to 18 m according to jalast 1976 as observed in the kikkaoja village the middle devonian aquifer system d2 is hosted by the sand and siltstones with interlayers and lenses of clay of the gauja burtnieki and aruküla stages clayey interlayers are frequent in this aquifer system likely forming several confined sandstone water bearing intervals of local distribution which have not been delineated in detail thus the aquifer is generally regarded as the gauja aruküla aquifer d2gj ar verte 1965 perens and vallner 1997 põldvere et al 2016 the d2gj ar aquifer is regionally recharged from the overlying confining q and or snetnaya gora amata aquitard of the upper devonian d3 aquifer system in the haanja upland vallner et al 1968 perens et al 2012 põldvere et al 2016 marandi et al 2019 the d2gj ar aquifer discharges in the slopes of the hargla mustjõgi valley viiding 1959 põldvere et al 2016 marandi et al 2019 according to the borehole 60 m in the mõniste village the d2gj ar aquifer could be up to 188 m thick in total in the vicinity of the study area the prevalent groundwater type in the d2gj ar aquifer is ca hco3 with the approximate tds range of 200 600 mg l perens et al 2012 marandi et al 2019 the d2gj ar aquifer is commonly perceived as a relatively terrigenous unit however extensive tectonic joint systems are known to be present in the middle devonian sandstones heinsalu 1987 heinsalu et al 1992 kleesment and pirrus 2000 pirrus et al 2002 shogenova et al 2009 the interrelation of the tectonic joints springs and suffosion caves in middle devonian sandstones is evident as observed in numerous cases heinsalu 1987 pirrus et al 2002 this refers to likely heterogeneous flow conditions in the sandstone aquifers especially in the vicinity of the discharge zones in addition to the diffuse flow in the matrix and seeping discharge at a seepage face there may also be more concentrated flow in fractures and suffosion conduits discharging in relatively high yield springs 1 l s 2 methods 2 1 geological and botanical survey of the matsi spring fen a shallow sediment coring survey with a russian type peat corer and spiral auger was carried out in the matsi spring fen m1 and m2 polygons in addition a ground penetrating radar gpr survey was carried out in both polygons the gpr profiles were tied with the shallow sediment coring results borehole geophysical survey was conducted in one bore well 10 846 opening the d2gj ar aquifer survey provides a single continuous log of different physical chemical parameters in a bore well to aid in determining rock types and layer boundaries measurement methods included natural gamma ray detector 125 mm 17 5 mm cs tl caliper borehole diameter recorded by three mechanically coupled arms in contact with the borehole wall water temperature and electrical conductivity measurements all equipment used is manufactured by robertson geo the vegetation of both m1 n 30 and m2 n 18 polygons was analyzed by 50 50 cm plots in mid july 2019 in parallel to recording the coverage of all vascular plant and moss species the mean water table in relation to the ground surface was measured from pvc tubes d 2 5 cm installed to the plots the patchy m1 polygon was divided roughly to subcommunities and sampled by establishing at least three plots into each subcommunity m2 as a more uniform area was sampled along two crossing transects still aiming to cover the diversity of the area as much as possible gps coordinates of each plot were recorded as well 2 2 monitoring network and hydrologic survey to verify and characterize the interaction of the matsi spring fen and the groundwater body a comprehensive hydrodynamic and hydrochemical monitoring study was planned and carried out the matsi m1 fen polygon as the most representative polygon was chosen as the central object of study in total 22 monitoring stations were established see fig 1 and table 1 including 9 shallow piezometers 3 dug wells in the shallow q aquifer 4 borewells in d2gj ar aquifer 3 springs and 3 stream stations the selection and construction of the stations was generally based on the principle of a transect along the likely preferential flow path of the m1 spring fen polygon from the local recharge area to the discharge point of the polygon during the study additional monitoring stations dug wells in the q aquifer and springs etc were included also in the neighboring fen polygons m2 and m3 to better identify and delineate the potential mixing end members in the core of the m1 spring fen two piezometer nests m1pa2 m1pa1 and m1pa4 m1pa3 respectively were constructed for location see fig 1 each consisting of one pvc piezometer in peat screen depth 1 5 m and one steel piezometer in below peat stratum screen depth 1 5 m two steel piezometers m1pa6 and m1pa5 respectively were constructed at the edges of the m1 fen polygon at the bottom of the n and s slope of the sapping valley respectively for location see fig 1 in some cases hybrid steel piezometers m1 and m2pa1 screening both the peat and the below peat stratum were installed for location see fig 1 twelve monitoring stations were equipped either with water level hobo onset u20l 01

location see fig 1 with sontek flowtracker2 adv 2 3 water sampling campaigns and analysis a total of 86 water samples n 86 were collected during six sampling campaigns in the period of april 2019

were used for cbe but excluded from the further statistical analysis 3 results and discussion the following chapters describe the matsi spring fen study area focusing primarily on the m1 polygon some data from the m2 and m3 fen polygons are also provided for comparison 3 1 vascular plant and bryophyte communities in the spring fen both fen polygons are flat with a negligible microtopographic variation and aspect water table is generally close to the surface table 3 except in the wooded parts of the m2 polygon the m1 polygon is open and devoid of tree cover m2 is open in the central lower part with a transition to spring fen forest in the higher part the communities of both subsites are rich in species and generally characteristic to spring fens which is supported by high water tables even in the mid summer table 3 the most abundant vascular plants are menyanthes trifoliata and several sedge species e g carex rostrata c lasiocarpa c acuta rumex acetosa galium uliginosum and myosotis scorpioides can be frequently found as well using k means clustering five vegetation clusters were distinguished in m1 and two in m2 fig 3 the water level in m1 polygon is higher than in m2 table 3 and in the majority of the fen within the range of a natural spring fen the plant communities however are not characteristic to spring fens in all parts of the m1 polygon the plant communities in the northern and central parts of m1 resemble the open part of the m2 fen polygon menyanthes trifoliata and typical spring fen bryophytes e g plagiomnium elipticum dominated in both in the southern and eastern part of the m1 polygon but also in its northern margin the plant communities are not characteristic of pristine spring fens fig 3 in the south eastern end of m1 the full domination of carex acuta prevents the formation of moss layer and the overall plant diversity is low in other parts of m1 carex paniculata tussocks have rarely left much space to other species and moss layer is absent these issues could result from the flow of surface water and its high level but also from the unfavorable chemical substances in water for the natural spring fen communities m2 is a rather uniform area in terms of vegetation and thus subclustered to open lower and wooded higher parts wooded cluster also includes the transitional areas from the open to wooded area both subclusters of m2 are clearly dominated by menyanthes trifoliata with a frequent co domination of epipactis palustris a protected species iii category additionally galium uliginosum carex rostrata festuca rubra poa palustris and agrostis stolonifera can be frequently found from both subclusters of m2 whilst lychnis flos cuculi is frequent in open clusters equisetum fluviatile pedicularis palustris and cirsium palustre are more abundant in wooded or transitional areas where the ground elevation is higher and water table is lower moss layer is almost continuous and consists mostly of typical spring fen species e g plagiomnium ellipticum paludella squarrosa and calliergonella cuspidata the biggest disturbance in m2 seems to be drainage surrounding the polygon that has initiated the expansion of the tree layer at the edges the ditches are old but still functioning the higher areas at the northern part of the fen are indeed still open on the historical maps estonian land board 2020 according to the inventory of peatland habitats in estonia paal and leibak 2011 the conservation value of matsi spring fen was good the evaluation of the inventory is however supported only partly by our data on the community composition plant cover and the water table of the spring fens 3 2 general hydrodynamics and temperature signatures of studied waters water level and temperature variations were monitored in eleven monitoring stations in the matsi spring fen study area from november 2018 to march 2020 fig 4 hydraulic heads in m1 and m2pa1 monitoring stations were monitored from september 2018 during the study period the mean annual sum of precipitation in estonia varied from 508 mm in 2018 to 671 mm in 2019 respectively according to estonian weather service 2020 compared to the national long term norm of precipitation 672 mm 2018 was one of the driest years since 1964 according to estonian weather service 2020 the dryness of 2018 was also reflected in the modest spring flood of 2019 fig 4 in contrast to the near normal annual rainfall sum in 2019 the year was abnormally warm 2019 annual mean 7 6 c vs long term mean 6 c so there was almost no significant snow cover in the winter and most of the precipitation fell as rain the autumn flood of 2019 expanded into the spring of 2020 the initial hydraulic head time series observed in d2gj ar represented by the borewell 10846 referred to the aquifer being confined thus the data had to be treated for barometric efficiency table 1 fig 4 as seen in the case of the borewell 10 846 in fig 4 although damped and delayed meteoric recharge impact can be recognized in the head dynamics the elevation of the potentiometric surface of the d2gj ar aquifer in the matsi spring fen study was estimated to range from 74 to 62 m asl with a e w directional slope towards the valley of the mustjõgi river fig 5 the shallow q aquifer represented by the dug wells was found to be perched in the plateau surrounding the sapping valley with water table surface at approximately 84 92 m asl fig 5 as previously stated in the study area chapter the shallow q aquifer is expected to lie on a glacial till layer as seen in the case of the hansi sk in fig 4 the amplitude of water table fluctuations in the q aquifer could reach approximately 1 5 m although quicker to respond to the meteoric recharge signal the response in the q aquifer was damped as seen in the case of hansi sk fig 4 the mean lag between the flood peaks of the hansi sk and 10 846 was 6 days r 0 59 p 0 0001 although very low in both cases the cross correlation coefficient r 0 17 and r 0 08 respectively with respect to precipitation was higher in 10 846 when compared to hansi sk all this refers to lower hydraulic conductivity of the shallow q aquifer when compared to d2gj ar the hydraulic heads in the m1 and m2 fen polygon core piezometers generally fluctuated within 10 cm throughout the study period head fluctuations were somewhat bigger in the fen edge slope piezometers m1pa5 and m1pa6 where they fluctuated within 15 20 cm the fen core piezometer heads generally showed some response to meteoric recharge but more in the fen edge slope piezometers m1pa5 and m1pa6 fig 4 in the case of the two m1 fen polygon piezometer nests the hydraulic heads in the below peat stratum piezometers m1pa1 and m1pa3 were above ground surface and also higher when compared with the heads in the peat piezometers m1pa2 and m1pa4 this indicated artesian groundwater flow conditions below the fen that could be associated with the underlying confined d2gj ar aquifer the water level in the m1 fen polygon was occasionally regulated by beaver dams as seen in fig 4 two larger beaver dams can be identified in the m1 area see fig 1 in most cases the removal of the dams by the landowner caused the water levels to drop abruptly only the dam 2 in the upstream part of the fen between m1pa5 and m1pa3 m1pa4 remained intact until the end of the monitoring period fig 4 during the study period the water level in the m1 outflow fluctuated within 70 cm the damming seemed to have little effect on the sec of the m1 fen polygon outflow at m1 outflow mean sd 480 47 μs cm fig 4 the discharge in the m1 outflow was relatively stable throughout the study period mean sd 13 8 2 3 l s reaching up to 18 l s during high flow conditions in march 2020 s6 fig 4 the minimum discharge 11 7 l s being only 15 lower than the mean was observed during low flow conditions in july 2019 s3 the beaver dams seemed to have little or no long term effect on the outflow q of the fen the stability of discharge generally supports the hypothesis that the spring fen is likely to be fed by an regional artesian aquifer constrained by the global hydraulic characteristics with very little seasonal variation the temperature signatures of the water generally allowed the monitoring stations to be divided into two groups fig 6 a and b the first group of monitoring stations fig 6a that included the peat piezometers m1pa2 m1pa4 the slope piezometer m1pa5 the m1 outflow and the hansi sk dug well in the q aquifer which were clearly affected by the changes in air temperature the core of the second group fig 6b was formed of 10 846 in d2gj ar the slope piezometer m1pa6 and the two below peat piezometers m1pa1 and m1pa3 which had similar mean water temperature 6 9 7 1 c with very low variation 0 04 to 4 the m1 spring and the hybrid piezometer m1 also featured relatively stable signatures but were more susceptible to changes in the overlying water layer due to beaver damming based on these observations a general assumption can be made that the monitoring stations divided in the second group are more similar to 10 846 representing the d2gj ar aquifer when comparing the two piezometer nests it is evident that the downstream nest m1pa1 m1pa2 featured slightly higher mean and deviation of water temperatures when compared to the upstream nest m1pa3 m1pa4 3 3 surface and groundwater hydrochemistry in the matsi spring fen study site figs 7 and 8 present the boxplots of all the assessed physicochemical parameters in the water samples n 86 from the matsi spring fen study site the monitoring stations were divided into initial groups based on presumed stratigraphy as seen in table 1 for better overview 3 3 1 general hydrochemical characteristics the major anion composition of the studied waters was dominated by the hco3 figs 7 and 8 among cations ca2 was the most abundant fig 7 the contribution of the hco3 ca2 and mg2 to the total dissolved solids tds content is confirmed by the strong positive correlations seen in fig 9 the abundance of other reported minor components occurred in the order of sio2 fe ba mn sr al fig 8 the mean sd tds concentration and sec of the studied waters were 402 95 mg l and 421 91 μs cm respectively fig 7 the highest mean values of tds and sec were observed in the the deeper d2gj ar borewells 10890 and 10846 and the upstream monitoring stations of the m1 fen m1 inflow m1pa5 m1pa4 and m1pa3 fig 7 hansi pk shows slightly lower tds values when compared to other d2gj ar wells fig 7 which may be due to shallower depth but also due to impact of water treatment iron removal the lowest tds values were generally observed in the q dug wells hansi sk liivamäe sk and sk04 and in the q1 and q2 springs but occasionally also in m1pa5 located in the margin of the m1 polygon figs 7 and 10 however the greatest min max range of tds values was also observed in the m1pa5 slope piezometer 107 mg l in july 2019 s3 and 570 mg l in april 2019 s1 respectively the occasionally occurring dilute groundwater in m1pa5 was presumably recently infiltrated interflow originating from the agricultural lands on the plateau dilute groundwater was also observed in the q1 spring and q2 spring in march 2020 s6 the tds and sec values figs 7 and 10 of the monitoring stations in m2 m2pa4 and m3 m3 spring fen polygons roughly fell in line with those of the d2gj ar group as a generalization the correlation matrix fig 9 the stations with higher tds had higher minor component fe ba mn sr concentrations and on the contrary the ones with lower tds had higher macronutrient concentrations doc ntot ptot and k the mean sd of ph of the studied water was 7 4 0 4 figs 7 and 10 lower ph values were observed in the hansi sk a dug well screening the shallow q aquifer and in the q1 and q2 spring table 3 and fig 7 based on knutsson 1994 the acidification of shallow groundwater can occur due to numerous natural factors namely due to the acidity of precipitation soil respiration the dissociation of humic acids and the occasional lack of carbonate minerals in the spatially variable primarily terrigenous quaternary aquifer material however the acidification can rise also from the use of fertilizers jolley and pierre 1977 knutsson 1994 which is likely on the agricultural lands on the plateau the dissolved oxygen do concentration of the studied waters was generally moderate to low mean sd 3 3 3 4 mg l fig 7 conditions were predominantly oxic in the q aquifer dug wells q1 spring q2 spring and in surface streams and occasionally or constantly suboxic to anoxic in the d2gj ar boreholes m1 and m2 fen polygon piezometers the q group stations with predominantly oxic conditions also featured higher concentrations of doc ntot and al as indicated by significant moderate to weak positive correlations in fig 9 on the contrary the highest concentrations of the ions mostly contributing to tds ca2 mg2 and hco3 minor components like ba sr sio2 and redox sensitive fe mn were observed in the predominantly anoxic or suboxic water samples of the d2gj ar m2 and m1 group monitoring stations figs 7 8 and 9 the sampled waters were predominantly of the ca hco3 type with the exception of water in m1pa5 for location see fig 1 a shallow piezometer under the slope of the sapping valley which was of the mg hco3 type figs 7 and 10 as indicated by the strong positive correlation between the ca2 mg2 hco3 tds and sec as seen in fig 9 that despite the siliciclastic material prevailing in the terrigenous aquifer matrix carbonate minerals are the major contributor to the hydrochemistry of the waters in the study site the occurrence of carbonate cement primarily dolomite and in less cases calcite is common in the middle devonian siliciclastic rocks kleesment 1995 kleesment and mark kurik 1997 kleesment and shogenova 2005 kleesment et al 2012 moreover carbonate material can also be abundant in quaternary glacigenic sediments raukas 1978 räägel 1997 rattas et al 2014 the studied waters of the matsi spring fen m1 m2 and m3 and d2gj ar were generally oversaturated with respect to dolomite and less with respect to calcite and only in few cases in m1 polygon undersaturated with respect to dolomite high flow in march 2020 s6 fig 7 figs 9 and 11 a on the contrary the water in the q aquifer stations was usually undersaturated both with respect to dolomite and calcite and only in a few cases oversaturated liivamäe sk and sk04 with respect to both minerals low flow during s4 figs 7 and 11a the sidolomite sicalcite ratio of m1 and d2gj ar station groups coincide fig 11a when comparing the two major station groups m1 d2gj ar and q distinct mean sidolomite sicalcite ratios are evident mean ratios 1 5 and 1 3 respectively fig 11a dolomite is initially less soluble than calcite and calcite again precipitates more readily leading to waters being usually more saturated with respect to dolomite over time appelo and postma 2005 the latter could also reflect the origin of the carbonate minerals in each subgroup as seen in the case of the m1 and d2gj ar groups in fig 11a the water is more saturated with respect to dolomite which has been reported to be one of the main cement forming minerals in middle devonian rocks kleesment 1995 kleesment and mark kurik 1997 kleesment and shogenova 2005 kleesment et al 2012 as in the q group the saturation may have risen from more calcite dominated mineral composition of the quaternary deposits due to prevailing oxic conditions in the shallow q aquifer monitoring stations figs 7 and 9 it can be hypothesized that the water evolves in open co2 conditions thus the most likely factor limiting the dolomite calcite dissolution and saturation in the groundwater is usually the availability of the minerals in the aquifer matrix in d2gj ar and also in the prevailingly anoxic stations in m1 and elsewhere semi closed to closed co2 conditions may be suspected as with the ph values the lowest and highest pco2 values were observed in the hansi sk q dug well and in the m1pa5 piezometer in the m1 fen polygon respectively fig 7 when compared to the other q monitoring stations in addition to the lowest ph and highest logpco2 values the hansi sk also featured the highest hco3 concentrations figs 7 and 11b referring again that the most likely cause to excessive acidity might be due to intensive agricultural activities in its vicinity it may be hypothesized that low pco2 values observed in m1pa5 were generally a result of rapid co2 degassing accompanied by calcite precipitation and subsequent oversaturation with respect to dolomite fig 11b moreover even after thorough purging the water in the hansi sk also featured the highest concentrations of sio2 fig 8 thus it was deduced that the excess acidity could have partly been compensated by silicate mineral hydrolysis due to the deficit of the more soluble carbonate minerals in the q aquifer matrix the latter could also be indicated by the significant negative correlation between ph and sio2 fig 9 as shown by kleesment 1995 kleesment and mark kurik 1997 shogenova et al 2009 and kleesment et al 2012 kaolinite is abundant in the middle devonian sandstones the waters of the matsi spring fen study site were found to be in the stability field of the kaolinite mineral phase both in the k and na feldspar systems as seen in fig 11c and d according to kleesment 1995 kleesment and mark kurik 1997 shogenova et al 2009 and kleesment et al 2012 feldspars rank second in abundance in the mineral composition of the middle devonian sandstones with k feldspar being the more common form thus it could be deduced that the abundant kaolinite might be the product of feldspar hydrolysis however when assessing the general hydrochemistry of the waters in the matsi spring fen study site the contribution of silicate hydrolysis to the tds is negligible when compared to carbonate minerals 3 3 2 stable isotopes the mean sd of δ18o and δ2h values of the sampled waters in the matsi spring fen study were 10 8 0 5 and 77 2 3 3 respectively figs 8 9a and 12b falling close to the mean δ18o and δ2h values for precipitation of the tõravere riga and ramata gnip stations 10 5 and 75 6 respectively the studied waters generally plotted along the lmwl defined by δ2h 7 8 δ18o 6 3 mean compiled from the δ18o and δ2h precipitation data of the iaea wmo gnip iaea wmo 2020 tartu riga and ramata stations indicating the meteoric origin the latter was also supported by the majority of deuterium excess dansgaard 1964 values shown in fig 8 falling in the range of 8 1 10 7 thus matching with the regional value ranges for shallow groundwater estimated by raidla et al 2016 as seen in fig 12 b and c the d2gj ar group showed the smallest intra annual variation of isotopic signatures with the mean sd values of 11 0 2 and 78 2 1 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the m1 fen polygon group featured mean sd values of 10 8 0 2 and 77 6 1 5 for δ18o and δ2h respectively thus plotting close to the d2gj ar group the m1 group stations showed a slightly larger temporal deviation towards heavier isotopic composition when compared to d2gj ar group the m2 and m3 fen polygon stations plotted among the d2gj ar and m1 fen polygon observations indicating the similarity in water origin during the warm months april september s1 s4 the m1 polygon features slightly more enriched mean δ18o and δ2h values compared to d2gj ar while during colder months november march s5 and s6 when the evaporation effect is negligible they fall in line with the mean of the d2gj ar group fig 12c the q group mean sd values 10 9 0 9 and 77 6 7 for δ18o and δ2h respectively featured the largest variation fig 12b ranging from 9 to 12 1 and from 68 3 to 87 5 for δ18o and δ2h respectively which is also inherent in the isotopic composition of precipitation fig 7a as seen in the case of the liivamäe sk fig 12b and 12c gradual enrichment in isotopic composition can be seen from april 2019 s1 to november 2019 s5 as the effect of snowmelt induced depleted recharge in the shallow q groundwater dissipates over time as the winter of 2019 2020 was the warmest since 1961 1962 and among the wettest 178 mm compared to the long term norm 138 mm there was very little snow thus the s6 march 2020 campaign sample in the liivamäe sk featured a heavier isotopic signature when compared to the one observed during s1 april 2019 there were noticeable discrepancies within the q group as seen in the case of the hansi sk when compared to the liivamäe sk for example fig 12b an overall downstream enrichment trend in isotope signatures can be seen in the m1 fen polygon when the two piezometer nests m1pa1 m1pa2 and m1pa3 m1pa4 are compared as seen in fig 13 this agrees with the peculiarities of the respective water temperature signatures observed in the two nests fig 6 indicating that there is a general warming evaporation or mixing trend in the downstream direction when compared to mean values of d2gj ar during cold months in march april and november both the deeper and shallower piezometers in both nests had relatively uniform isotopic signatures fig 13 the upstream nest especially the deeper piezometer seems to generally agree with the δ18o values of the d2gj ar fig 13 in the case of the downstream nest the isotope composition in general would clearly become heavier when compared to the upstream nest and the d2gj ar moreover the composition in the shallower peat piezometer gets heavier during warm months may july and september when compared to the deeper piezometer possibly because of evapoconcentration processes within peat layers fig 13 no clear impact of seasonal enrichment was observed in the shallower peat piezometer of the upstream nest 3 3 3 macronutrient dynamics the primary macronutrients doc ntot and ptot observed in the monitoring stations are presented in fig 14 the mean sd concentration of doc of all of the studied water samples was 3 3 3 9 mg l the highest and the lowest mean sd doc concentrations 8 4 2 9 and 0 03 0 07 mg l were observed in the q and d2gj ar groups respectively with the respective value of 1 8 2 6 mg l in the m1 fen polygon group falling in between the two extremes fig 14a within the m1 fen polygon the highest mean doc concentration was observed in the m1pa5 a slope piezometer but also in the m2 fen polygon fig 14a the explanation for these high values are not just related to natural factors but could be related to the disturbance caused by the construction of the monitoring stations this is supported by the decrease of doc concentrations in the m2 polygon as the survey progressed which could also indicate a gradual dissipation of the disturbance the mean sd concentrations of ntot ptot of all of the studied water samples n 68 were 0 79 1 31 mg n l and 0 19 0 42 mg p l respectively the highest and the lowest mean sd concentrations for both ntot and ptot were observed in the q 1 95 2 6 mg n l and 0 59 0 8 mg p l and d2gj ar 0 36 0 12 mg n l and 0 04 0 02 mg p l groups respectively fig 14a as with the doc values the respective mean sd ntot and ptot values for the m1 fen polygon group 0 48 0 28 mg n l and 0 08 0 09 mg p l respectively fell in between the latter two within the m1 fen polygon the highest ntot and ptot mean values were generally observed in the slope piezometers m1pa5 and m1pa6 and or the m1 inflow and the neighboring downstream monitoring stations fig 14a similar to doc the mean values of ntot in the m1 polygon showed a general trend of decrease from april 2019 to march 2020 s1 to s6 in contrast the values of ptot deviated around the mean and showed a weak growing trend fig 15 according to thresholds set for estonian fluvial water bodies the m1 fen polygon was in a very good trophic status regarding mean ntot values and from very good to very bad status regarding mean ptot values fig 14b during 3 sampling campaigns the mean n p ratios of m1 polygon were below the 16 1 ratio defined by redfield 1958 and only in one case in september 2019 s4 the median ratio was above the 16 1 line indicating prevailing nitrogen limitation and phosphorus excess fig 14b according to reddy and delaune 2008 the general cause for nitrogen limitation in wetlands is usually increased upland loading of phosphorus commonly due to the use of fertilizers as a generalization the highest and the lowest mean values of the assessed macronutrients were observed in the q and d2gj ar group respectively similar trends as in the case of doc ntot and ptot could be also seen when assessing the k and cl values amongst the station groups based on the above a general hypothesis can be proposed that the q group was the primary source of macronutrients in the matsi spring fen study site the latter is evident due to intensive agricultural activities carried out on the plateau surrounding the sapping valley based on leibundgut et al 2009 and clark 2015 to a lesser extent the impact from road salting could also be the case regarding the concentrations of cl the highest nutrient concentrations within the m1 fen polygon group were generally observed in the slope piezometers m1pa5 and m1pa6 and in the monitoring stations capturing the upstream inflow from the sapping valley and the upland m1 inflow q1 spring and q2 spring the patterns of the macronutrient dynamics also agree with the specificities of the distribution and status of plant communities in the m1 fen polygon communities that are characteristic to nutrient rich environments rather than pristine spring fens were usually found in ne e part near the slopes and inflow of the m1 polygon but also at the sw margin along the open water section channeling the upstream inflow to the m1 outflow fig 3 3 4 conceptualizing the hydrogeology of the matsi spring fen study site 3 4 1 clustering observations to define and characterize the major end members involved in the hydrochemical system of the matsi spring fen study site multivariate statistical analysis was conducted based on the hydrochemical data the main emphasis here was placed on the m1 fen polygon in advance the data was first treated for normality by applying log transformation güler et al 2002 george and mallery 2010 retike et al 2016 prior to further analysis all of the variables were standardized using the unbiased standard deviation n 1 due to higher sensitivity to possible disturbances during sampling temperature and dissolved oxygen were not included the latter is partly represented by the orp in total 86 observations with 28 selected variables ph sec orp na k mg2 ca2 f cl br so4 2 hco3 doc dic ntot ptot al ba fe mn sio2 sr tds sicalcite sidolomite logpco2 δ18o δ2h figs 7 and 8 were included in the further multivariate statistical analysis agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis ahc was performed on the mean variable values of the 20 monitoring stations listed in table 1 in order to cluster the stations based on their mean physicochemical properties and confirm or modify the initial stratigraphy based monitoring station groups proposed in table 1 in the ahc analysis the similarity proximity matrix pearson correlation coefficient and unweighted pair group average agglomeration methods were used the dendrogram of the performed ahc is presented in fig 15a based on automatic truncation the assessed monitoring stations clustered into three clusters q m1a and m1b clusters respectively truncation indicated by the red phenon line in fig 15a the q cluster included all the monitoring stations that were initially grouped into the q group table 1 the m1a included the m1 group stations located in the downstream half of the m1 fen polygon and the d2gj ar group stations the m1b included the monitoring stations in the upstream half of the m1 fen polygon the ahc derived three cluster distribution fig 15a was validated by carrying out discriminant analysis da da has been successfully used to validate the results of cluster analysis on many occasions lambrakis et al 2004 panagopoulos and panagiotaras 2011 panagopoulos et al 2016 in addition to the previously assessed mean observations of the 20 monitoring stations listed in table 1 the full dataset of 86 discrete observations were included in the analysis thus a total of 106 observations were included in the da analysis as seen in table 4 a the discriminant model classified 98 of the assessed observations into the correct ahc derived clusters fig 15a in the case of cross validation the success rate of discrimination was 95 table 4a this means that the ahc derived cluster distribution could be assumed to be reliable according to the da the mahalanobis distances in the discriminant factor space fig 16 were the greatest between the q cluster and the m1a m1b clusters the m1a and m1b were generally 4 5 times closer similar to one another in the discriminant factor space when compared to the q cluster the q cluster observations were characterized by higher orp and pco2 values oxic conditions high macronutrient loading doc ntot ptot and k but also higher al concentrations in nature al is known to originate primarily from gibbsite dissolution and its mobility is related to soil acidity and organic matter abundance appelo and postma 2005 like many other trace metals al forms organometallic complexes with organic matter enhancing its mobility and thus could be abundant in shallow groundwater budd et al 1981 by all means the q cluster observations were strongly affected by the agricultural activities on the plateau the m1a and m1b cluster observations generally featured higher mineralization higher tds were anoxic more saturated with respect to carbonate minerals and featured higher concentrations of ions associated with longer residence time mg2 ba and sr edmunds and smedley 2000 when compared to the q cluster furthermore the m1a and m1b clusters allowed the m1 fen polygon to be divided into two fig 15a and 16 this was also evident based on the initial assessment of macronutrient dynamics in the previous chapter in addition to the higher macronutrient concentrations the upstream m1b cluster observations also featured elevated mg2 halogen f cl and br and so4 2 concentrations when compared to the downstream m1a cluster observations the origin of elevated concentrations of halogens f cl and br mg2 and so4 2 could be explained by the agricultural activities on the plateau adriano and doner 2015 härdter et al 2005 the latter hypothesis is also supported by the significant positive correlation between all the aforementioned components fig 9 the lower presence of mg2 halogens and so4 2 in the q cluster when compared to the m1b cluster could be justified by the fact that the dug wells primarily forming the q cluster were mostly located upstream of the arable lands that were surrounding the sapping valley moreover it is likely that the arable lands also had a hydromelioration system which in turn would enhance the drainage of soil water surficial groundwater to the sapping valley thus in addition to the typical groundwater of the q aquifer q cluster the sapping valley and consequently the upstream part of the m1 spring fen polygon would exclusively receive substances applied to the fields most likely in a form of dilute interflow component as observed in m1pa5 in july 2019 s3 and q1 spring and q2 spring in march 2020 s6 this interflow could be associated with the elevated concentrations of mg2 halogens and so4 2 the m1a cluster combines the observations of the downstream stations of the m1 fen polygon with the d2gj ar observations fig 15a and 16 the m1a cluster also included the observations of the m1 outflow monitoring station which represent a mix of all the inputs to the m1 fen polygon this suggests that the mean water quality of the m1 fen polygon as a whole as represented by the m1 outflow could have been more affected by the d2gj ar groundwater the m2 and m3 group observations were also plotted in the m1b and m1a clusters respectively from the inclusion of the m3 polygon observation in the m1a subcluster it can be concluded that it is likely to be also recharged by the d2gj ar aquifer the m2 polygon observations are also likely to be primarily affected by the d2gj ar aquifer their inclusion in the m1b sub cluster however could have partly occurred due to the self contamination caused by the construction of the stations 3 4 2 end member mixing analysis to verify and quantify the presumed mixing of three hydrochemical end members d2gj ar aquifer q aquifer and dilute interflow in the m1 spring fen polygon outflow m1 outflow the end member mixing analysis emma as proposed by christophersen and hooper 1992 was performed based on the list of physico chemical parameters that were previously included in the ahc and da six conservative or semi conservative tracers ba sr f δ18o sio2 al characteristic for the presumed end members were selected for further analysis fig 17 b a principal component analysis pca was performed with four m1 outflow observations table 5 projected in the u space defined by the first two principal components u1 and u2 accounting for 94 7 of explained variability exceeding the 90 recommended by christophersen and hooper 1992 fig 17a initially a total of nine potential end members were projected in the em space seen in fig 17a amongst which three final end members were selected table 5 several combinations and modifications of d2gj ar and q aquifer end members were evaluated in the pca the potential end members were selected based on their observation representability among the evaluated q aquifer end member candidates the q group mean was considered to be the most suitable as it represented the monitoring stations from both sides of the sapping valley table 5 the q2 spring mean could have been also a potential end member but was not used as it consisted of only two observations regarding the d2gj ar end member hansi sk 10 846 and d2gj ar mean observations were excluded as all were too dilute with respect to the m1 outflow mixtures fig 17a best results were obtained with the modified d2gj ar group mean with hansi sk observations excluded using 10 890 alone would have caused the d2gj ar contribution to the m1 outflow to be reduced significantly due to the need to increase dilution by the other end members however a lower than 50 contribution from the d2gj ar aquifer would have principally contradicted the evidence of its significant impact presented in the previous chapters to complement the selected q aquifer end member q mean a dilute q aquifer interflow end member was included in the mixing analysis represented by the july 2019 s3 observation of m1pa5 fig 17a the mean sd fit r2 between the observed tracer concentrations and predicted by emma in m1 outflow was 95 1 fig 18 the mean sd normalized root mean square error nrmse of the predicted and observed tracer concentrations was 8 1 3 fig 18 the results of emma suggest that on average the d2gj ar aquifer contributed 67 19 of the water to the mixture in the m1 outflow fig 18c the respective mean sd values for the q aquifer and interflow component were 15 12 and 18 18 the latter two end members could be generally addressed together as the baseflow and the interflow components of the shallow q aquifer the proportional contribution of the d2gj ar end member was the greatest during the low flow period in july and september s3 s4 and the lowest in the case of the high flow period in march s6 although d2gj ar is the dominant contributor to the m1 fen polygon the q aquifer when the baseflow and interflow components were combined may provide up to 59 during s6 of the water to the fen polygon fig 17c 3 5 conceptual hydrogeological model of the matsi spring fen study site the botanical hydrogeological and hydrochemical knowledge obtained in the framework of this study was combined in the conceptual hydrogeological model of the matsi spring fen fig 19 the conceptual model aims to characterize the hydrogeology of the matsi spring fen on the example of the m1 fen polygon although there are still uncertainties regarding the exact slope structure and the depth of the bedrock in the valley some important conclusions were drawn about the shallow subsurface geology from applied geophysical measurements and the findings of earlier studies the thickness of the quaternary cover at the edge of the plateau was re evaluated based on downhole gamma ray logging in the borewell 10 846 and field observation in the matsi bedrock outcrop see location in fig 1 when comparing our results with the findings of rahumäe 1968 and jalast 1976 we came to the conclusion that the actual thickness of the quaternary cover in the vicinity of the borewell 10 846 is likely to be approximately 16 m the shallow unconfined q aquifer was found to be hosted by the topmost layer of glaciolacustrine lgqiii and glaciofluvial fqiii deposits overlying the glacial till layer gqiii which presumably acts as a confining layer on top of the d2gj ar aquifer as stated previously kummisaar 1967 vallner et al 1968 jalast 1976 põldvere et al 2016 the artesian flow conditions in the d2gj ar aquifer were indicated by the above ground surface hydraulic heads in the fen and due to barometric efficiency observed in borewell 10846 the frequent occurrence of clay interlayers in the middle devonian aquifer system is also known from previous studies verte 1965 perens and vallner 1997 põldvere et al 2016 however in the present study we did not receive more detailed data on their occurrence and role as a result of the conducted gpr and sediment coring survey the shallow subsurface geology in the bottom of the sapping valley hosting the m1 fen polygon was specified a peat layer consisting primarily of well decomposed sedge and brown moss remains with the mean sd thickness of 1 6 0 7 m carpets the m1 fen polygon the peat overlies a freshwater tufa layer with the mean sd thickness of 0 6 0 4 m although the age and exact origin of the tufa is unclear on the basis of current knowledge the saturation indices of calcite and dolomite indicated the continuing potential for tufa formation due to carbonate mineral oversaturation langmuir 1997 the peat and tufa usually lies on a layer of predominantly fine sand likely of glaciolacustrine lgqiii or glaciofluvial fqiii origin the combined interpretation of hydrodynamics temperature isotopic signatures and hydrochemistry allowed us to confirm the dependence of the matsi spring fen on the middle devonian groundwater body in the gauja koiva river basin in the matsi spring fen study site this groundwater body included the shallow q aquifer and the underlying d2gj ar aquifer the shallow q aquifer providing a cumulative 33 of recharge to the m1 fen polygon on average was the primary source of macronutrients and pollutants due to intensive agricultural activities on the plateau the d2gj ar aquifer on the other hand was found to be providing the majority 67 19 of the recharge to the m1 fen polygon the d2gj ar aquifer was also found to be the primary contributor to the m2 and m3 fen polygons the groundwater of the d2gj ar aquifer on average featured higher mineralization when compared to the q aquifer likely due to longer residence time but also slightly different mineral composition of the aquifer material the d2gj ar groundwater dilutes the nutrient load originating from the q aquifer to some extent as it flows downstream in the m1 fen polygon however the occasional high mean values of ptot and the n p ratio fig 14b suggest that the dilution of the upland pollution in the m1 fen polygon was not always sufficient consequently the dominance of d2gj ar aquifer discharge in the northern and central part of the m1 polygon has favored the formation of characteristic spring fen vegetation this part of the fen is valuable in its current state to the contrary the nutrient load from the q aquifer in combination with high water level has altered the plant communities at the upstream part of the m1 fen polygon the movement of water might have its impact on the vegetation as well during the short period of this study the impact of beaver activity to the m1 fen polygon status was found to be mainly quantitative and short term due to the dominant artesian discharge of the d2gj ar aquifer the quantitative effect of damming was mainly limited to the period of construction and destruction of the dams due to the shortness and the relatively low resolution of our time series the only significant physico chemical effects rising from the beaver activity were mainly limited to changes in thermal characteristics of the surface water in ponds in some cases also minor alterations in local flow directions could be observed the beaver damming has likely contributed to the distribution of high water dwelling plant species in the se part of the m1 polygon 4 conclusions in this study a comprehensive hydrochemical dataset complemented by hydrogeological hydrodynamical and botanical observations was analyzed using a combination of multivariate statistical analysis methods to verify and characterize the interaction between the matsi spring fen and the middle devonian groundwater body in the gauja koiva river basin the shallow unconfined q aquifer was found to be perched on the till layer underlain by the confined d2gj ar sandstone aquifer which represents the regional flow system in the area the potentiometric surface of the d2gj ar aquifer was found to be above ground surface in the m1 fen polygon resulting in artesian groundwater discharge the water temperature signatures of spring and below peat piezometers in the m1 fen polygon were similar to the deeper d2gj ar borewells while in the peat piezometers and q dug wells the water temperature was affected by the air temperature fluctuations the hydrochemical facies of the analyzed groundwater samples in the study area were similarly of the ca hco3 type referring to the predominance of dissolution of carbonate minerals in primarily terrigenous aquifers the groundwater was generally more mineralized in the d2gj ar aquifer while more nutrient rich in the shallow q aquifer agricultural activities in the arable lands upstream to the spring fen have resulted in the elevated loads of macronutrients and halogens in the shallow q aquifer groundwater also contributing to the spring fen although generally in pristine state the elevated macronutrient loading from the upland and perhaps the beaver activity had led to deterioration of the status of the spring fen communities in the upstream parts of the m1 fen polygon the hydrochemical end members contributing to the final water quality of the matsi spring fen were analyzed by agglomerative hierarchical clustering and verified by discriminant analysis based on the end member mixing model analysis it was learned that the d2gj ar and the shallow q aquifer both belonging to the middle devonian groundwater body in the gauja koiva river basin provide approximately 67 and 33 of groundwater respectively to the m1 fen polygon the water framework directive of the european union 2000 60 ec and its supporting materials schutten et al 2012 stress the importance of conceptualizing interactions between gwbs and gdte dependent on them furthermore a gwb can only have a good status if the groundwater level quantitative status and its chemical composition qualitative status do not cause significant damage the dependent ecosystem 2000 60 ec usually the assessment of gwb status under the gdte test relies on the information collected in the last 6 years from the national monitoring networks however the data provided by such networks is often insufficient to uncover the critical linkages between a gwb and a gdte e g assessing the role of a gwb in the pollutant loading to a gdte effect of site specific conditions on the transport of substances to the gdte and their transformation within the gdte etc schutten et al 2012 hence targeted local studies focusing are needed the results of which can later be used in the assessment of gwb gdte interactions in similar gdtes based on the experience gained from this study we could draw some conclusions which can help the gwb and gdte status assessments in the future 1 our results show that less than good chemical status of a gdte can result from local pollution sources even when the related gwb itself has been classified to be in good chemical status local land use can have a profound effect on the status of the gdtes even if the regional groundwater quality is good and makes up the majority of the total inflow and transports most of the chemical components to the gdte that is why local surface conditions and land use in the vicinity must always be considered when evaluating the status of a gdte kløve et al 2011a good status of gdtes cannot be inferred solely from the status assessments of the related gwbs 2 to gain a valid assessment of the gdte status a detailed hydrodynamical and hydrochemical monitoring on the ecosystem scale has to be carried out kløve et al 2011b richardson et al 2011b bertrand et al 2014 zurek et al 2015 especially critical is the inclusion of wells adjacent to the studied gdte in the monitoring network to characterize all the relevant groundwater end members that contribute to the studied gdte 3 to evaluate and propose measures for the mitigation of gdte status the contribution of different sources to the chemical and nutrient budgets of the gdte must be quantified that in turn requires the monitoring of gdte outflow and all possible end members that contribute to the inflow of the gdte 4 in this study the usefulness of many minor groundwater components e g ba sr al f sio2 to establish the above mentioned mixing relationships has been shown that is why the initial hydrochemical monitoring screening in a gdte chosen for more detailed studies should be as comprehensive as possible in the given circumstances and include more parameters than just macronutrients which are commonly used for gdte status assessment e g ntot and ptot etc some parameters e g isotopic composition of water may turn out to be too crude for studies on a local scale and should always be accompanied by data acquired through other methods in the later stages of the assessment it is recommended to reevaluate the usefulness of screened parameters and to continue monitoring those parameters that give the best results in status assessments are related to identified anthropogenic pressures and allow the establishment of the mixing relationships relevant to the studied gdte credit authorship contribution statement oliver koit conceptualization methodology investigation formal analysis writing original

4424,a pilot study was carried out in the matsi spring fen southern estonia to test a proposed methodology terasmaa et al 2020 for identifying potential effects of groundwater bodies on groundwater dependent terrestrial ecosystems gdte a comprehensive hydrochemical and isotopic dataset was collected and analyzed using multivariate statistical methods to assess the origin of the groundwater discharging in the spring fen and to determine both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of gdte groundwater interdependence the hydrochemical findings were complemented with the hydrogeological hydrodynamical and botanical observations and summarized into a conceptual model of the study site the results show that the status of the spring fen is influenced both by groundwater inflow from the regional middle devonian sandstone aquifer d2gj ar in the transboundary gauja koiva river basin but also by discharge of the shallow aquifer found in quaternary q deposits of local extent by using multivariate statistical methods the mixing of the two main groundwater sources in the spring fen discharge was quantified on average the regional d2gj ar and local q aquifer contributed 67 and 33 respectively to the spring fen discharge the groundwater was generally more mineralized in the d2gj ar aquifer while more nutrient rich in the shallow q aquifer agricultural activities in the arable lands adjacent to the spring fen have resulted in the elevated loads of macronutrients and halogens in the shallow q aquifer ntot 1 95 2 6 mg n l ptot 0 59 0 8 mg p l although generally in pristine state the elevated macronutrient loading from the q aquifer and perhaps the beaver activity has led to deterioration of the status of the spring fen communities in the upstream parts of the main fen polygon the n p ratios were occasionally above the 16 1 indicating nitrogen limitation and phosphorus excess which is likely due to increased upland loading of phosphorus from fertilizers the results of the study show that poor chemical status of a gdte can result from local pollution sources and land use even in cases when the related regional gw body itself is in good chemical status also the usefulness of analyzing minor groundwater components e g ba sr al f sio2 in a gdte assessment in establishing the end member mixing relationships has been shown all in all it is one of the first

population groundwater is also essential for groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes which in turn provide vital ecosystem services for other species boulton 2020 kløve et al 2011 gdes including springs wetlands rivers lakes and lagoons are valuable ecosystems that depend on the quantity and quality of groundwater input any changes in the groundwater quality or quantity often result in significant damage of dependent flora and fauna kløve et al 2011a rohde et al 2017 in recent decades the gdes have gained worldwide recognition richardson et al 2011a richardson et al 2011b more emphasis has been

thus the status of the gdte cannot be assessed separately from the groundwater body the reliance of a gdte on a groundwater body may be complex the dependence may be both quantitative and qualitative or partial fens are commonly continuously supplied by a groundwater body kløve et al 2011a and can be sensitive to changes both in the quantity and specific physico chemical properties of the groundwater at the same time raised bogs are not typically perceived as groundwater dependent ecosystems however according to kløve et al 2011 and marandi et al 2014 marandi et al 2013 bogs can be sensitive to changes in the hydraulic pressure of the underlying groundwater body thus may also be considered as gdtes under certain conditions therefore the identification of gdte groundwater body dependency and the status assessment of a gdte requires a multi pronged approach combining methods from several disciplines gdtes are directly or indirectly protected by a number of european union directives birds habitats groundwater floods and international agreements such as the ramsar convention on wetlands many gdtes are included in the natura 2000 network of protected sites often the national monitoring networks have not been established to determine interactions between groundwater and surface water nor have monitoring networks been established keeping gdtes in mind moreover the parameters monitored in groundwater are not always relevant for assessing the status of gdtes it is complicated or impossible to reliably assess the status of gdtes in the framework of the existing monitoring and inventory programs a common problem in many countries including estonia is that the national monitoring and inventory programs for terrestrial ecosystems do not include monitoring of the hydrodynamics or hydrochemistry of the gdtes terasmaa et al 2020 so far the only indicator available to determine the potential negative effect of groundwater bodies on gdtes has been the deterioration of the ecological status according to the assessment of annex i habitats for example total phosphorus and nitrogen are not currently monitored in groundwater in estonia but they are used to determine chemical status of surface water bodies terasmaa et al 2020 marandi et al 2019 as a joint initiative in estonia and latvia a methodology for assessing gdtes terasmaa et al 2020 has been updated in the framework of the project joint management of groundwater dependent ecosystems in transboundary gauja koiva river basin groundeco financed from interreg estonia latvia cross border cooperation program 2014 2020 the proposed methodology allows to test the potential effect of groundwater bodies on gdtes as far as there is available data for further development and verification of the methodology proposed by terasmaa et al 2020 this pilot study was carried out within the groundeco project the matsi spring fen in the transboundary gauja koiva river basin was selected as the pilot area to verify and characterize the presumed link terasmaa et al 2015 marandi et al 2019 between the gdte and the middle devonian groundwater body in the gauja koiva river basin in the framework of this study a comprehensive hydrochemical and isotopic dataset was collected and analyzed using multivariate statistical methods to assess the origin of the groundwater discharging in the spring fen the hydrochemical findings were complemented by the hydrogeological hydrodynamical and botanical observations and summarized into a conceptual model of the matsi spring fen it is one of the first comprehensive studies of the interactions between a groundwater body and a groundwater dependent terrestrial ecosystem in the estonian context 1 1 study site the matsi spring fen was chosen as the pilot study site in the estonian part of the transboundary gauja koiva river basin it is located in se estonia võru county rõuge parish matsi village the spring fen is situated in a spring sapping valley in the left slope of the valley of the mustjõgi river at an approximate elevation of 66 m asl fig 1 estonia is situated in the dfb climate region according to köppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 beck et al 2018 the mean annual temperature is 6 c the mustjõgi river catchment area 1820 km2 is the largest tributary of the transboundary gauja river basin basin area 9800 km2 in estonia fig 1 the matsi spring fen consists of three polygons m1 m2 and m3 areas 0 7 3 4 and 0 4 ha respectively separated by road dams and ditches fig 1 the fen has been previously inventoried by ilomets et al 2012 as an important groundwater dependent terrestrial ecosystem with a very representative botanical community belonging to the fennoscandian mineral rich springs and spring fens code 7160 habitats directive annex i habitat type according to lõokene 1968 tufa deposits are present in the matsi spring fen it has been hypothesized that the matsi spring fen is dependent on the middle devonian groundwater body in the gauja koiva river basin terasmaa et al 2015 marandi et al 2019 the mustjõgi river flows in an approximately 1 1 5 km wide and 25 30 m deep valley that runs across the võru hargla depression system in the ne sw direction fig 1 the valley of the mustjõgi river has incised into a glacially eroded sandstone plateau of middle devonian gauja formation gauja stage givetian stage separating the haanja upland in se from the otepää and karula uplands in n and w respectively see fig 1 the gauja stage features fine grained well rounded and weakly to medium cemented sandstones with clay and siltstone interlayers põldvere et al 2016 the total thickness of the formation ranges from 78 to 79 8 m kleesment and mark kurik 1997 quartz dominates the mineralogical composition up to 95 of the formation followed by feldspars and micas while kaolinite and dolomite calcite are the main cement forming minerals kleesment 1995 kleesment and mark kurik 1997 kleesment et al 2012 on the plateau the bedrock is capped with a layer of quaternary sediments primarily till with sandy loam and sandy silt loam gqiii the till is usually overlain by glaciolacustrine lgqiii or in lesser cases glaciofluvial fqiii silt sandy loam sandy silt loam and gravel kummisaar 1967 rahumäe 1968 aia 1971 allikmaa 1986 the exact thickness of the quaternary cover in the matsi village is unknown however measurements from the vicinity suggest that its thickness varies from 1 to 18 m kummisaar 1967 rahumäe 1968 jalast 1976 allikmaa 1986 the geology of the valley in the matsi section has not been studied in detail however there is some data on the floodplain and slope geology in the mõniste and kikkaoja village approximately 7 km downstream and 5 km upstream from matsi village respectively fig 1 in the valley bottom a complex sequence of silty to coarse sands and gravel layers prevails with occasional silt loam lenses allikmaa 1986 the terrigenous sediments are usually overlain by a 0 4 4 5 m thick layer of peat occasionally the peat is underlain by a 0 7 m thick layer of sandy mud allikmaa 1986 the hydrogeological context of the matsi spring fen study area is generally defined by the middle devonian d2 and the overlying quaternary q aquifer systems which constitute the middle devonian groundwater body in the gauja koiva river basin see fig 2 marandi et al 2019 as of 2020 the general status of the groundwater body was assessed as good according to marandi et al 2020 the quaternary glacial glaciolacustrine and glaciofluvial deposits represent the q aquifer system in the study area therefore the lateral variation of the water bearing properties of the q aquifers is significant generally the layers and lenses of more conductive sand and gravel glaciolacustrine and glaciofluvial sediments host the uppermost shallow q unconfined or confined aquifer if between till layers that receives primarily autogenic meteoric recharge the shallow q aquifer of local extent appears to be perched on the underlying glacial till layer acting as a weak aquitard kummisaar 1967 vallner et al 1968 jalast 1976 põldvere et al 2016 according to kummisaar 1967 the groundwater table in the shallow q was at an average depth of 2 2 0 78 m from the surface on the plateau in the matsi village the groundwater of the shallow q aquifer is usually abstracted in the shallow dug wells up to 6 m deep of small households the maximum thickness of the shallow q aquifer in the study area is not known but it could range up to 18 m according to jalast 1976 as observed in the kikkaoja village the middle devonian aquifer system d2 is hosted by the sand and siltstones with interlayers and lenses of clay of the gauja burtnieki and aruküla stages clayey interlayers are frequent in this aquifer system likely forming several confined sandstone water bearing intervals of local distribution which have not been delineated in detail thus the aquifer is generally regarded as the gauja aruküla aquifer d2gj ar verte 1965 perens and vallner 1997 põldvere et al 2016 the d2gj ar aquifer is regionally recharged from the overlying confining q and or snetnaya gora amata aquitard of the upper devonian d3 aquifer system in the haanja upland vallner et al 1968 perens et al 2012 põldvere et al 2016 marandi et al 2019 the d2gj ar aquifer discharges in the slopes of the hargla mustjõgi valley viiding 1959 põldvere et al 2016 marandi et al 2019 according to the borehole 60 m in the mõniste village the d2gj ar aquifer could be up to 188 m thick in total in the vicinity of the study area the prevalent groundwater type in the d2gj ar aquifer is ca hco3 with the approximate tds range of 200 600 mg l perens et al 2012 marandi et al 2019 the d2gj ar aquifer is commonly perceived as a relatively terrigenous unit however extensive tectonic joint systems are known to be present in the middle devonian sandstones heinsalu 1987 heinsalu et al 1992 kleesment and pirrus 2000 pirrus et al 2002 shogenova et al 2009 the interrelation of the tectonic joints springs and suffosion caves in middle devonian sandstones is evident as observed in numerous cases heinsalu 1987 pirrus et al 2002 this refers to likely heterogeneous flow conditions in the sandstone aquifers especially in the vicinity of the discharge zones in addition to the diffuse flow in the matrix and seeping discharge at a seepage face there may also be more concentrated flow in fractures and suffosion conduits discharging in relatively high yield springs 1 l s 2 methods 2 1 geological and botanical survey of the matsi spring fen a shallow sediment coring survey with a russian type peat corer and spiral auger was carried out in the matsi spring fen m1 and m2 polygons in addition a ground penetrating radar gpr survey was carried out in both polygons the gpr profiles were tied with the shallow sediment coring results borehole geophysical survey was conducted in one bore well 10 846 opening the d2gj ar aquifer survey provides a single continuous log of different physical chemical parameters in a bore well to aid in determining rock types and layer boundaries measurement methods included natural gamma ray detector 125 mm 17 5 mm cs tl caliper borehole diameter recorded by three mechanically coupled arms in contact with the borehole wall water temperature and electrical conductivity measurements all equipment used is manufactured by robertson geo the vegetation of both m1 n 30 and m2 n 18 polygons was analyzed by 50 50 cm plots in mid july 2019 in parallel to recording the coverage of all vascular plant and moss species the mean water table in relation to the ground surface was measured from pvc tubes d 2 5 cm installed to the plots the patchy m1 polygon was divided roughly to subcommunities and sampled by establishing at least three plots into each subcommunity m2 as a more uniform area was sampled along two crossing transects still aiming to cover the diversity of the area as much as possible gps coordinates of each plot were recorded as well 2 2 monitoring network and hydrologic survey to verify and characterize the interaction of the matsi spring fen and the groundwater body a comprehensive hydrodynamic and hydrochemical monitoring study was planned and carried out the matsi m1 fen polygon as the most representative polygon was chosen as the central object of study in total 22 monitoring stations were established see fig 1 and table 1 including 9 shallow piezometers 3 dug wells in the shallow q aquifer 4 borewells in d2gj ar aquifer 3 springs and 3 stream stations the selection and construction of the stations was generally based on the principle of a transect along the likely preferential flow path of the m1 spring fen polygon from the local recharge area to the discharge point of the polygon during the study additional monitoring stations dug wells in the q aquifer and springs etc were included also in the neighboring fen polygons m2 and m3 to better identify and delineate the potential mixing end members in the core of the m1 spring fen two piezometer nests m1pa2 m1pa1 and m1pa4 m1pa3 respectively were constructed for location see fig 1 each consisting of one pvc piezometer in peat screen depth 1 5 m and one steel piezometer in below peat stratum screen depth 1 5 m two steel piezometers m1pa6 and m1pa5 respectively were constructed at the edges of the m1 fen polygon at the bottom of the n and s slope of the sapping valley respectively for location see fig 1 in some cases hybrid steel piezometers m1 and m2pa1 screening both the peat and the below peat stratum were installed for location see fig 1 twelve monitoring stations were equipped either with water level hobo onset u20l 01 and van essen td diver 10 m temperature hobo onset tidbit v2 or electrical conductivity data logger hobo onset u24 001 see table 1 hobo onset rg3 m automatic rain gauge was installed next to the hansi sk monitoring station for location see fig 1 during a period of above freezing air temperatures in addition precipitation and air temperature data of the tuulemäe weather station ws for location see fig 1 of the estonian weather service was also used estonian weather service 2020 the discharge of the m1 polygon was measured during each sampling campaign in the m1 outflow monitoring station for location see fig 1 with sontek flowtracker2 adv 2 3 water sampling campaigns and analysis a total of 86 water samples n 86 were collected during six sampling campaigns in the period of april 2019

were used for cbe but excluded from the further statistical analysis 3 results and discussion the following chapters describe the matsi spring fen study area focusing primarily on the m1 polygon some data from the m2 and m3 fen polygons are also provided for comparison 3 1 vascular plant and bryophyte communities in the spring fen both fen polygons are flat with a negligible microtopographic variation and aspect water table is generally close to the surface table 3 except in the wooded parts of the m2 polygon the m1 polygon is open and devoid of tree cover m2 is open in the central lower part with a transition to spring fen forest in the higher part the communities of both subsites are rich in species and generally characteristic to spring fens which is supported by high water tables even in the mid summer table 3 the most abundant vascular plants are menyanthes trifoliata and several sedge species e g carex rostrata c lasiocarpa c acuta rumex acetosa galium uliginosum and myosotis scorpioides can be frequently found as well using k means clustering five vegetation clusters were distinguished in m1 and two in m2 fig 3 the water level in m1 polygon is higher than in m2 table 3 and in the majority of the fen within the range of a natural spring fen the plant communities however are not characteristic to spring fens in all parts of the m1 polygon the plant communities in the northern and central parts of m1 resemble the open part of the m2 fen polygon menyanthes trifoliata and typical spring fen bryophytes e g plagiomnium elipticum dominated in both in the southern and eastern part of the m1 polygon but also in its northern margin the plant communities are not characteristic of pristine spring fens fig 3 in the south eastern end of m1 the full domination of carex acuta prevents the formation of moss layer and the overall plant diversity is low in other parts of m1 carex paniculata tussocks have rarely left much space to other species and moss layer is absent these issues could result from the flow of surface water and its high level but also from the unfavorable chemical substances in water for the natural spring fen communities m2 is a rather uniform area in terms of vegetation and thus subclustered to open lower and wooded higher parts wooded cluster also includes the transitional areas from the open to wooded area both subclusters of m2 are clearly dominated by menyanthes trifoliata with a frequent co domination of epipactis palustris a protected species iii category additionally galium uliginosum carex rostrata festuca rubra poa palustris and agrostis stolonifera can be frequently found from both subclusters of m2 whilst lychnis flos cuculi is frequent in open clusters equisetum fluviatile pedicularis palustris and cirsium palustre are more abundant in wooded or transitional areas where the ground elevation is higher and water table is lower moss layer is almost continuous and consists mostly of typical spring fen species e g plagiomnium ellipticum paludella squarrosa and calliergonella cuspidata the biggest disturbance in m2 seems to be drainage surrounding the polygon that has initiated the expansion of the tree layer at the edges the ditches are old but still functioning the higher areas at the northern part of the fen are indeed still open on the historical maps estonian land board 2020 according to the inventory of peatland habitats in estonia paal and leibak 2011 the conservation value of matsi spring fen was good the evaluation of the inventory is however supported only partly by our data on the community composition plant cover and the water table of the spring fens 3 2 general hydrodynamics and temperature signatures of studied waters water level and temperature variations were monitored in eleven monitoring stations in the matsi spring fen study area from november 2018 to march 2020 fig 4 hydraulic heads in m1 and m2pa1 monitoring stations were monitored from september 2018 during the study period the mean annual sum of precipitation in estonia varied from 508 mm in 2018 to 671 mm in 2019 respectively according to estonian weather service 2020 compared to the national long term norm of precipitation 672 mm 2018 was one of the driest years since 1964 according to estonian weather service 2020 the dryness of 2018 was also reflected in the modest spring flood of 2019 fig 4 in contrast to the near normal annual rainfall sum in 2019 the year was abnormally warm 2019 annual mean 7 6 c vs long term mean 6 c so there was almost no significant snow cover in the winter and most of the precipitation fell as rain the autumn flood of 2019 expanded into the spring of 2020 the initial hydraulic head time series observed in d2gj ar represented by the borewell 10846 referred to the aquifer being confined thus the data had to be treated for barometric efficiency table 1 fig 4 as seen in the case of the borewell 10 846 in fig 4 although damped and delayed meteoric recharge impact can be recognized in the head dynamics the elevation of the potentiometric surface of the d2gj ar aquifer in the matsi spring fen study was estimated to range from 74 to 62 m asl with a e w directional slope towards the valley of the mustjõgi river fig 5 the shallow q aquifer represented by the dug wells was found to be perched in the plateau surrounding the sapping valley with water table surface at approximately 84 92 m asl fig 5 as previously stated in the study area chapter the shallow q aquifer is expected to lie on a glacial till layer as seen in the case of the hansi sk in fig 4 the amplitude of water table fluctuations in the q aquifer could reach approximately 1 5 m although quicker to respond to the meteoric recharge signal the response in the q aquifer was damped as seen in the case of hansi sk fig 4 the mean lag between the flood peaks of the hansi sk and 10 846 was 6 days r 0 59 p 0 0001 although very low in both cases the cross correlation coefficient r 0 17 and r 0 08 respectively with respect to precipitation was higher in 10 846 when compared to hansi sk all this refers to lower hydraulic conductivity of the shallow q aquifer when compared to d2gj ar the hydraulic heads in the m1 and m2 fen polygon core piezometers generally fluctuated within 10 cm throughout the study period head fluctuations were somewhat bigger in the fen edge slope piezometers m1pa5 and m1pa6 where they fluctuated within 15 20 cm the fen core piezometer heads generally showed some response to meteoric recharge but more in the fen edge slope piezometers m1pa5 and m1pa6 fig 4 in the case of the two m1 fen polygon piezometer nests the hydraulic heads in the below peat stratum piezometers m1pa1 and m1pa3 were above ground surface and also higher when compared with the heads in the peat piezometers m1pa2 and m1pa4 this indicated artesian groundwater flow conditions below the fen that could be associated with the underlying confined d2gj ar aquifer the water level in the m1 fen polygon was occasionally regulated by beaver dams as seen in fig 4 two larger beaver dams can be identified in the m1 area see fig 1 in most cases the removal of the dams by the landowner caused the water levels to drop abruptly only the dam 2 in the upstream part of the fen between m1pa5 and m1pa3 m1pa4 remained intact until the end of the monitoring period fig 4 during the study period the water level in the m1 outflow fluctuated within 70 cm the damming seemed to have little effect on the sec of the m1 fen polygon outflow at m1 outflow mean sd 480 47 μs cm fig 4 the discharge in the m1 outflow was relatively stable throughout the study period mean sd 13 8 2 3 l s reaching up to 18 l s during high flow conditions in march 2020 s6 fig 4 the minimum discharge 11 7 l s being only 15 lower than the mean was observed during low flow conditions in july 2019 s3 the beaver dams seemed to have little or no long term effect on the outflow q of the fen the stability of discharge generally supports the hypothesis that the spring fen is likely to be fed by an regional artesian aquifer constrained by the global hydraulic characteristics with very little seasonal variation the temperature signatures of the water generally allowed the monitoring stations to be divided into two groups fig 6 a and b the first group of monitoring stations fig 6a that included the peat piezometers m1pa2 m1pa4 the slope piezometer m1pa5 the m1 outflow and the hansi sk dug well in the q aquifer which were clearly affected by the changes in air temperature the core of the second group fig 6b was formed of 10 846 in d2gj ar the slope piezometer m1pa6 and the two below peat piezometers m1pa1 and m1pa3 which had similar mean water temperature 6 9 7 1 c with very low variation 0 04 to 4 the m1 spring and the hybrid piezometer m1 also featured relatively stable signatures but were more susceptible to changes in the overlying water layer due to beaver damming based on these observations a general assumption can be made that the monitoring stations divided in the second group are more similar to 10 846 representing the d2gj ar aquifer when comparing the two piezometer nests it is evident that the downstream nest m1pa1 m1pa2 featured slightly higher mean and deviation of water temperatures when compared to the upstream nest m1pa3 m1pa4 3 3 surface and groundwater hydrochemistry in the matsi spring fen study site figs 7 and 8 present the boxplots of all the assessed physicochemical parameters in the water samples n 86 from the matsi spring fen study site the monitoring stations were divided into initial groups based on presumed stratigraphy as seen in table 1 for better overview 3 3 1 general hydrochemical characteristics the major anion composition of the studied waters was dominated by the hco3 figs 7 and 8 among cations ca2 was the most abundant fig 7 the contribution of the hco3 ca2 and mg2 to the total dissolved solids tds content is confirmed by the strong positive correlations seen in fig 9 the abundance of other reported minor components occurred in the order of sio2 fe ba mn sr al fig 8 the mean sd tds concentration and sec of the studied waters were 402 95 mg l and 421 91 μs cm respectively fig 7 the highest mean values of tds and sec were observed in the the deeper d2gj ar borewells 10890 and 10846 and the upstream monitoring stations of the m1 fen m1 inflow m1pa5 m1pa4 and m1pa3 fig 7 hansi pk shows slightly lower tds values when compared to other d2gj ar wells fig 7 which may be due to shallower depth but also due to impact of water treatment iron removal the lowest tds values were generally observed in the q dug wells hansi sk liivamäe sk and sk04 and in the q1 and q2 springs but occasionally also in m1pa5 located in the margin of the m1 polygon figs 7 and 10 however the greatest min max range of tds values was also observed in the m1pa5 slope piezometer 107 mg l in july 2019 s3 and 570 mg l in april 2019 s1 respectively the occasionally occurring dilute groundwater in m1pa5 was presumably recently infiltrated interflow originating from the agricultural lands on the plateau dilute groundwater was also observed in the q1 spring and q2 spring in march 2020 s6 the tds and sec values figs 7 and 10 of the monitoring stations in m2 m2pa4 and m3 m3 spring fen polygons roughly fell in line with those of the d2gj ar group as a generalization the correlation matrix fig 9 the stations with higher tds had higher minor component fe ba mn sr concentrations and on the contrary the ones with lower tds had higher macronutrient concentrations doc ntot ptot and k the mean sd of ph of the studied water was 7 4 0 4 figs 7 and 10 lower ph values were observed in the hansi sk a dug well screening the shallow q aquifer and in the q1 and q2 spring table 3 and fig 7 based on knutsson 1994 the acidification of shallow groundwater can occur due to numerous natural factors namely due to the acidity of precipitation soil respiration the dissociation of humic acids and the occasional lack of carbonate minerals in the spatially variable primarily terrigenous quaternary aquifer material however the acidification can rise also from the use of fertilizers jolley and pierre 1977 knutsson 1994 which is likely on the agricultural lands on the plateau the dissolved oxygen do concentration of the studied waters was generally moderate to low mean sd 3 3 3 4 mg l fig 7 conditions were predominantly oxic in the q aquifer dug wells q1 spring q2 spring and in surface streams and occasionally or constantly suboxic to anoxic in the d2gj ar boreholes m1 and m2 fen polygon piezometers the q group stations with predominantly oxic conditions also featured higher concentrations of doc ntot and al as indicated by significant moderate to weak positive correlations in fig 9 on the contrary the highest concentrations of the ions mostly contributing to tds ca2 mg2 and hco3 minor components like ba sr sio2 and redox sensitive fe mn were observed in the predominantly anoxic or suboxic water samples of the d2gj ar m2 and m1 group monitoring stations figs 7 8 and 9 the sampled waters were predominantly of the ca hco3 type with the exception of water in m1pa5 for location see fig 1 a shallow piezometer under the slope of the sapping valley which was of the mg hco3 type figs 7 and 10 as indicated by the strong positive correlation between the ca2 mg2 hco3 tds and sec as seen in fig 9 that despite the siliciclastic material prevailing in the terrigenous aquifer matrix carbonate minerals are the major contributor to the hydrochemistry of the waters in the study site the occurrence of carbonate cement primarily dolomite and in less cases calcite is common in the middle devonian siliciclastic rocks kleesment 1995 kleesment and mark kurik 1997 kleesment and shogenova 2005 kleesment et al 2012 moreover carbonate material can also be abundant in quaternary glacigenic sediments raukas 1978 räägel 1997 rattas et al 2014 the studied waters of the matsi spring fen m1 m2 and m3 and d2gj ar were generally oversaturated with respect to dolomite and less with respect to calcite and only in few cases in m1 polygon undersaturated with respect to dolomite high flow in march 2020 s6 fig 7 figs 9 and 11 a on the contrary the water in the q aquifer stations was usually undersaturated both with respect to dolomite and calcite and only in a few cases oversaturated liivamäe sk and sk04 with respect to both minerals low flow during s4 figs 7 and 11a the sidolomite sicalcite ratio of m1 and d2gj ar station groups coincide fig 11a when comparing the two major station groups m1 d2gj ar and q distinct mean sidolomite sicalcite ratios are evident mean ratios 1 5 and 1 3 respectively fig 11a dolomite is initially less soluble than calcite and calcite again precipitates more readily leading to waters being usually more saturated with respect to dolomite over time appelo and postma 2005 the latter could also reflect the origin of the carbonate minerals in each subgroup as seen in the case of the m1 and d2gj ar groups in fig 11a the water is more saturated with respect to dolomite which has been reported to be one of the main cement forming minerals in middle devonian rocks kleesment 1995 kleesment and mark kurik 1997 kleesment and shogenova 2005 kleesment et al 2012 as in the q group the saturation may have risen from more calcite dominated mineral composition of the quaternary deposits due to prevailing oxic conditions in the shallow q aquifer monitoring stations figs 7 and 9 it can be hypothesized that the water evolves in open co2 conditions thus the most likely factor limiting the dolomite calcite dissolution and saturation in the groundwater is usually the availability of the minerals in the aquifer matrix in d2gj ar and also in the prevailingly anoxic stations in m1 and elsewhere semi closed to closed co2 conditions may be suspected as with the ph values the lowest and highest pco2 values were observed in the hansi sk q dug well and in the m1pa5 piezometer in the m1 fen polygon respectively fig 7 when compared to the other q monitoring stations in addition to the lowest ph and highest logpco2 values the hansi sk also featured the highest hco3 concentrations figs 7 and 11b referring again that the most likely cause to excessive acidity might be due to intensive agricultural activities in its vicinity it may be hypothesized that low pco2 values observed in m1pa5 were generally a result of rapid co2 degassing accompanied by calcite precipitation and subsequent oversaturation with respect to dolomite fig 11b moreover even after thorough purging the water in the hansi sk also featured the highest concentrations of sio2 fig 8 thus it was deduced that the excess acidity could have partly been compensated by silicate mineral hydrolysis due to the deficit of the more soluble carbonate minerals in the q aquifer matrix the latter could also be indicated by the significant negative correlation between ph and sio2 fig 9 as shown by kleesment 1995 kleesment and mark kurik 1997 shogenova et al 2009 and kleesment et al 2012 kaolinite is abundant in the middle devonian sandstones the waters of the matsi spring fen study site were found to be in the stability field of the kaolinite mineral phase both in the k and na feldspar systems as seen in fig 11c and d according to kleesment 1995 kleesment and mark kurik 1997 shogenova et al 2009 and kleesment et al 2012 feldspars rank second in abundance in the mineral composition of the middle devonian sandstones with k feldspar being the more common form thus it could be deduced that the abundant kaolinite might be the product of feldspar hydrolysis however when assessing the general hydrochemistry of the waters in the matsi spring fen study site the contribution of silicate hydrolysis to the tds is negligible when compared to carbonate minerals 3 3 2 stable isotopes the mean sd of δ18o and δ2h values of the sampled waters in the matsi spring fen study were 10 8 0 5 and 77 2 3 3 respectively figs 8 9a and 12b falling close to the mean δ18o and δ2h values for precipitation of the tõravere riga and ramata gnip stations 10 5 and 75 6 respectively the studied waters generally plotted along the lmwl defined by δ2h 7 8 δ18o 6 3 mean compiled from the δ18o and δ2h precipitation data of the iaea wmo gnip iaea wmo 2020 tartu riga and ramata stations indicating the meteoric origin the latter was also supported by the majority of deuterium excess dansgaard 1964 values shown in fig 8 falling in the range of 8 1 10 7 thus matching with the regional value ranges for shallow groundwater estimated by raidla et al 2016 as seen in fig 12 b and c the d2gj ar group showed the smallest intra annual variation of isotopic signatures with the mean sd values of 11 0 2 and 78 2 1 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the m1 fen polygon group featured mean sd values of 10 8 0 2 and 77 6 1 5 for δ18o and δ2h respectively thus plotting close to the d2gj ar group the m1 group stations showed a slightly larger temporal deviation towards heavier isotopic composition when compared to d2gj ar group the m2 and m3 fen polygon stations plotted among the d2gj ar and m1 fen polygon observations indicating the similarity in water origin during the warm months april september s1 s4 the m1 polygon features slightly more enriched mean δ18o and δ2h values compared to d2gj ar while during colder months november march s5 and s6 when the evaporation effect is negligible they fall in line with the mean of the d2gj ar group fig 12c the q group mean sd values 10 9 0 9 and 77 6 7 for δ18o and δ2h respectively featured the largest variation fig 12b ranging from 9 to 12 1 and from 68 3 to 87 5 for δ18o and δ2h respectively which is also inherent in the isotopic composition of precipitation fig 7a as seen in the case of the liivamäe sk fig 12b and 12c gradual enrichment in isotopic composition can be seen from april 2019 s1 to november 2019 s5 as the effect of snowmelt induced depleted recharge in the shallow q groundwater dissipates over time as the winter of 2019 2020 was the warmest since 1961 1962 and among the wettest 178 mm compared to the long term norm 138 mm there was very little snow thus the s6 march 2020 campaign sample in the liivamäe sk featured a heavier isotopic signature when compared to the one observed during s1 april 2019 there were noticeable discrepancies within the q group as seen in the case of the hansi sk when compared to the liivamäe sk for example fig 12b an overall downstream enrichment trend in isotope signatures can be seen in the m1 fen polygon when the two piezometer nests m1pa1 m1pa2 and m1pa3 m1pa4 are compared as seen in fig 13 this agrees with the peculiarities of the respective water temperature signatures observed in the two nests fig 6 indicating that there is a general warming evaporation or mixing trend in the downstream direction when compared to mean values of d2gj ar during cold months in march april and november both the deeper and shallower piezometers in both nests had relatively uniform isotopic signatures fig 13 the upstream nest especially the deeper piezometer seems to generally agree with the δ18o values of the d2gj ar fig 13 in the case of the downstream nest the isotope composition in general would clearly become heavier when compared to the upstream nest and the d2gj ar moreover the composition in the shallower peat piezometer gets heavier during warm months may july and september when compared to the deeper piezometer possibly because of evapoconcentration processes within peat layers fig 13 no clear impact of seasonal enrichment was observed in the shallower peat piezometer of the upstream nest 3 3 3 macronutrient dynamics the primary macronutrients doc ntot and ptot observed in the monitoring stations are presented in fig 14 the mean sd concentration of doc of all of the studied water samples was 3 3 3 9 mg l the highest and the lowest mean sd doc concentrations 8 4 2 9 and 0 03 0 07 mg l were observed in the q and d2gj ar groups respectively with the respective value of 1 8 2 6 mg l in the m1 fen polygon group falling in between the two extremes fig 14a within the m1 fen polygon the highest mean doc concentration was observed in the m1pa5 a slope piezometer but also in the m2 fen polygon fig 14a the explanation for these high values are not just related to natural factors but could be related to the disturbance caused by the construction of the monitoring stations this is supported by the decrease of doc concentrations in the m2 polygon as the survey progressed which could also indicate a gradual dissipation of the disturbance the mean sd concentrations of ntot ptot of all of the studied water samples n 68 were 0 79 1 31 mg n l and 0 19 0 42 mg p l respectively the highest and the lowest mean sd concentrations for both ntot and ptot were observed in the q 1 95 2 6 mg n l and 0 59 0 8 mg p l and d2gj ar 0 36 0 12 mg n l and 0 04 0 02 mg p l groups respectively fig 14a as with the doc values the respective mean sd ntot and ptot values for the m1 fen polygon group 0 48 0 28 mg n l and 0 08 0 09 mg p l respectively fell in between the latter two within the m1 fen polygon the highest ntot and ptot mean values were generally observed in the slope piezometers m1pa5 and m1pa6 and or the m1 inflow and the neighboring downstream monitoring stations fig 14a similar to doc the mean values of ntot in the m1 polygon showed a general trend of decrease from april 2019 to march 2020 s1 to s6 in contrast the values of ptot deviated around the mean and showed a weak growing trend fig 15 according to thresholds set for estonian fluvial water bodies the m1 fen polygon was in a very good trophic status regarding mean ntot values and from very good to very bad status regarding mean ptot values fig 14b during 3 sampling campaigns the mean n p ratios of m1 polygon were below the 16 1 ratio defined by redfield 1958 and only in one case in september 2019 s4 the median ratio was above the 16 1 line indicating prevailing nitrogen limitation and phosphorus excess fig 14b according to reddy and delaune 2008 the general cause for nitrogen limitation in wetlands is usually increased upland loading of phosphorus commonly due to the use of fertilizers as a generalization the highest and the lowest mean values of the assessed macronutrients were observed in the q and d2gj ar group respectively similar trends as in the case of doc ntot and ptot could be also seen when assessing the k and cl values amongst the station groups based on the above a general hypothesis can be proposed that the q group was the primary source of macronutrients in the matsi spring fen study site the latter is evident due to intensive agricultural activities carried out on the plateau surrounding the sapping valley based on leibundgut et al 2009 and clark 2015 to a lesser extent the impact from road salting could also be the case regarding the concentrations of cl the highest nutrient concentrations within the m1 fen polygon group were generally observed in the slope piezometers m1pa5 and m1pa6 and in the monitoring stations capturing the upstream inflow from the sapping valley and the upland m1 inflow q1 spring and q2 spring the patterns of the macronutrient dynamics also agree with the specificities of the distribution and status of plant communities in the m1 fen polygon communities that are characteristic to nutrient rich environments rather than pristine spring fens were usually found in ne e part near the slopes and inflow of the m1 polygon but also at the sw margin along the open water section channeling the upstream inflow to the m1 outflow fig 3 3 4 conceptualizing the hydrogeology of the matsi spring fen study site 3 4 1 clustering observations to define and characterize the major end members involved in the hydrochemical system of the matsi spring fen study site multivariate statistical analysis was conducted based on the hydrochemical data the main emphasis here was placed on the m1 fen polygon in advance the data was first treated for normality by applying log transformation güler et al 2002 george and mallery 2010 retike et al 2016 prior to further analysis all of the variables were standardized using the unbiased standard deviation n 1 due to higher sensitivity to possible disturbances during sampling temperature and dissolved oxygen were not included the latter is partly represented by the orp in total 86 observations with 28 selected variables ph sec orp na k mg2 ca2 f cl br so4 2 hco3 doc dic ntot ptot al ba fe mn sio2 sr tds sicalcite sidolomite logpco2 δ18o δ2h figs 7 and 8 were included in the further multivariate statistical analysis agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis ahc was performed on the mean variable values of the 20 monitoring stations listed in table 1 in order to cluster the stations based on their mean physicochemical properties and confirm or modify the initial stratigraphy based monitoring station groups proposed in table 1 in the ahc analysis the similarity proximity matrix pearson correlation coefficient and unweighted pair group average agglomeration methods were used the dendrogram of the performed ahc is presented in fig 15a based on automatic truncation the assessed monitoring stations clustered into three clusters q m1a and m1b clusters respectively truncation indicated by the red phenon line in fig 15a the q cluster included all the monitoring stations that were initially grouped into the q group table 1 the m1a included the m1 group stations located in the downstream half of the m1 fen polygon and the d2gj ar group stations the m1b included the monitoring stations in the upstream half of the m1 fen polygon the ahc derived three cluster distribution fig 15a was validated by carrying out discriminant analysis da da has been successfully used to validate the results of cluster analysis on many occasions lambrakis et al 2004 panagopoulos and panagiotaras 2011 panagopoulos et al 2016 in addition to the previously assessed mean observations of the 20 monitoring stations listed in table 1 the full dataset of 86 discrete observations were included in the analysis thus a total of 106 observations were included in the da analysis as seen in table 4 a the discriminant model classified 98 of the assessed observations into the correct ahc derived clusters fig 15a in the case of cross validation the success rate of discrimination was 95 table 4a this means that the ahc derived cluster distribution could be assumed to be reliable according to the da the mahalanobis distances in the discriminant factor space fig 16 were the greatest between the q cluster and the m1a m1b clusters the m1a and m1b were generally 4 5 times closer similar to one another in the discriminant factor space when compared to the q cluster the q cluster observations were characterized by higher orp and pco2 values oxic conditions high macronutrient loading doc ntot ptot and k but also higher al concentrations in nature al is known to originate primarily from gibbsite dissolution and its mobility is related to soil acidity and organic matter abundance appelo and postma 2005 like many other trace metals al forms organometallic complexes with organic matter enhancing its mobility and thus could be abundant in shallow groundwater budd et al 1981 by all means the q cluster observations were strongly affected by the agricultural activities on the plateau the m1a and m1b cluster observations generally featured higher mineralization higher tds were anoxic more saturated with respect to carbonate minerals and featured higher concentrations of ions associated with longer residence time mg2 ba and sr edmunds and smedley 2000 when compared to the q cluster furthermore the m1a and m1b clusters allowed the m1 fen polygon to be divided into two fig 15a and 16 this was also evident based on the initial assessment of macronutrient dynamics in the previous chapter in addition to the higher macronutrient concentrations the upstream m1b cluster observations also featured elevated mg2 halogen f cl and br and so4 2 concentrations when compared to the downstream m1a cluster observations the origin of elevated concentrations of halogens f cl and br mg2 and so4 2 could be explained by the agricultural activities on the plateau adriano and doner 2015 härdter et al 2005 the latter hypothesis is also supported by the significant positive correlation between all the aforementioned components fig 9 the lower presence of mg2 halogens and so4 2 in the q cluster when compared to the m1b cluster could be justified by the fact that the dug wells primarily forming the q cluster were mostly located upstream of the arable lands that were surrounding the sapping valley moreover it is likely that the arable lands also had a hydromelioration system which in turn would enhance the drainage of soil water surficial groundwater to the sapping valley thus in addition to the typical groundwater of the q aquifer q cluster the sapping valley and consequently the upstream part of the m1 spring fen polygon would exclusively receive substances applied to the fields most likely in a form of dilute interflow component as observed in m1pa5 in july 2019 s3 and q1 spring and q2 spring in march 2020 s6 this interflow could be associated with the elevated concentrations of mg2 halogens and so4 2 the m1a cluster combines the observations of the downstream stations of the m1 fen polygon with the d2gj ar observations fig 15a and 16 the m1a cluster also included the observations of the m1 outflow monitoring station which represent a mix of all the inputs to the m1 fen polygon this suggests that the mean water quality of the m1 fen polygon as a whole as represented by the m1 outflow could have been more affected by the d2gj ar groundwater the m2 and m3 group observations were also plotted in the m1b and m1a clusters respectively from the inclusion of the m3 polygon observation in the m1a subcluster it can be concluded that it is likely to be also recharged by the d2gj ar aquifer the m2 polygon observations are also likely to be primarily affected by the d2gj ar aquifer their inclusion in the m1b sub cluster however could have partly occurred due to the self contamination caused by the construction of the stations 3 4 2 end member mixing analysis to verify and quantify the presumed mixing of three hydrochemical end members d2gj ar aquifer q aquifer and dilute interflow in the m1 spring fen polygon outflow m1 outflow the end member mixing analysis emma as proposed by christophersen and hooper 1992 was performed based on the list of physico chemical parameters that were previously included in the ahc and da six conservative or semi conservative tracers ba sr f δ18o sio2 al characteristic for the presumed end members were selected for further analysis fig 17 b a principal component analysis pca was performed with four m1 outflow observations table 5 projected in the u space defined by the first two principal components u1 and u2 accounting for 94 7 of explained variability exceeding the 90 recommended by christophersen and hooper 1992 fig 17a initially a total of nine potential end members were projected in the em space seen in fig 17a amongst which three final end members were selected table 5 several combinations and modifications of d2gj ar and q aquifer end members were evaluated in the pca the potential end members were selected based on their observation representability among the evaluated q aquifer end member candidates the q group mean was considered to be the most suitable as it represented the monitoring stations from both sides of the sapping valley table 5 the q2 spring mean could have been also a potential end member but was not used as it consisted of only two observations regarding the d2gj ar end member hansi sk 10 846 and d2gj ar mean observations were excluded as all were too dilute with respect to the m1 outflow mixtures fig 17a best results were obtained with the modified d2gj ar group mean with hansi sk observations excluded using 10 890 alone would have caused the d2gj ar contribution to the m1 outflow to be reduced significantly due to the need to increase dilution by the other end members however a lower than 50 contribution from the d2gj ar aquifer would have principally contradicted the evidence of its significant impact presented in the previous chapters to complement the selected q aquifer end member q mean a dilute q aquifer interflow end member was included in the mixing analysis represented by the july 2019 s3 observation of m1pa5 fig 17a the mean sd fit r2 between the observed tracer concentrations and predicted by emma in m1 outflow was 95 1 fig 18 the mean sd normalized root mean square error nrmse of the predicted and observed tracer concentrations was 8 1 3 fig 18 the results of emma suggest that on average the d2gj ar aquifer contributed 67 19 of the water to the mixture in the m1 outflow fig 18c the respective mean sd values for the q aquifer and interflow component were 15 12 and 18 18 the latter two end members could be generally addressed together as the baseflow and the interflow components of the shallow q aquifer the proportional contribution of the d2gj ar end member was the greatest during the low flow period in july and september s3 s4 and the lowest in the case of the high flow period in march s6 although d2gj ar is the dominant contributor to the m1 fen polygon the q aquifer when the baseflow and interflow components were combined may provide up to 59 during s6 of the water to the fen polygon fig 17c 3 5 conceptual hydrogeological model of the matsi spring fen study site the botanical hydrogeological and hydrochemical knowledge obtained in the framework of this study was combined in the conceptual hydrogeological model of the matsi spring fen fig 19 the conceptual model aims to characterize the hydrogeology of the matsi spring fen on the example of the m1 fen polygon although there are still uncertainties regarding the exact slope structure and the depth of the bedrock in the valley some important conclusions were drawn about the shallow subsurface geology from applied geophysical measurements and the findings of earlier studies the thickness of the quaternary cover at the edge of the plateau was re evaluated based on downhole gamma ray logging in the borewell 10 846 and field observation in the matsi bedrock outcrop see location in fig 1 when comparing our results with the findings of rahumäe 1968 and jalast 1976 we came to the conclusion that the actual thickness of the quaternary cover in the vicinity of the borewell 10 846 is likely to be approximately 16 m the shallow unconfined q aquifer was found to be hosted by the topmost layer of glaciolacustrine lgqiii and glaciofluvial fqiii deposits overlying the glacial till layer gqiii which presumably acts as a confining layer on top of the d2gj ar aquifer as stated previously kummisaar 1967 vallner et al 1968 jalast 1976 põldvere et al 2016 the artesian flow conditions in the d2gj ar aquifer were indicated by the above ground surface hydraulic heads in the fen and due to barometric efficiency observed in borewell 10846 the frequent occurrence of clay interlayers in the middle devonian aquifer system is also known from previous studies verte 1965 perens and vallner 1997 põldvere et al 2016 however in the present study we did not receive more detailed data on their occurrence and role as a result of the conducted gpr and sediment coring survey the shallow subsurface geology in the bottom of the sapping valley hosting the m1 fen polygon was specified a peat layer consisting primarily of well decomposed sedge and brown moss remains with the mean sd thickness of 1 6 0 7 m carpets the m1 fen polygon the peat overlies a freshwater tufa layer with the mean sd thickness of 0 6 0 4 m although the age and exact origin of the tufa is unclear on the basis of current knowledge the saturation indices of calcite and dolomite indicated the continuing potential for tufa formation due to carbonate mineral oversaturation langmuir 1997 the peat and tufa usually lies on a layer of predominantly fine sand likely of glaciolacustrine lgqiii or glaciofluvial fqiii origin the combined interpretation of hydrodynamics temperature isotopic signatures and hydrochemistry allowed us to confirm the dependence of the matsi spring fen on the middle devonian groundwater body in the gauja koiva river basin in the matsi spring fen study site this groundwater body included the shallow q aquifer and the underlying d2gj ar aquifer the shallow q aquifer providing a cumulative 33 of recharge to the m1 fen polygon on average was the primary source of macronutrients and pollutants due to intensive agricultural activities on the plateau the d2gj ar aquifer on the other hand was found to be providing the majority 67 19 of the recharge to the m1 fen polygon the d2gj ar aquifer was also found to be the primary contributor to the m2 and m3 fen polygons the groundwater of the d2gj ar aquifer on average featured higher mineralization when compared to the q aquifer likely due to longer residence time but also slightly different mineral composition of the aquifer material the d2gj ar groundwater dilutes the nutrient load originating from the q aquifer to some extent as it flows downstream in the m1 fen polygon however the occasional high mean values of ptot and the n p ratio fig 14b suggest that the dilution of the upland pollution in the m1 fen polygon was not always sufficient consequently the dominance of d2gj ar aquifer discharge in the northern and central part of the m1 polygon has favored the formation of characteristic spring fen vegetation this part of the fen is valuable in its current state to the contrary the nutrient load from the q aquifer in combination with high water level has altered the plant communities at the upstream part of the m1 fen polygon the movement of water might have its impact on the vegetation as well during the short period of this study the impact of beaver activity to the m1 fen polygon status was found to be mainly quantitative and short term due to the dominant artesian discharge of the d2gj ar aquifer the quantitative effect of damming was mainly limited to the period of construction and destruction of the dams due to the shortness and the relatively low resolution of our time series the only significant physico chemical effects rising from the beaver activity were mainly limited to changes in thermal characteristics of the surface water in ponds in some cases also minor alterations in local flow directions could be observed the beaver damming has likely contributed to the distribution of high water dwelling plant species in the se part of the m1 polygon 4 conclusions in this study a comprehensive hydrochemical dataset complemented by hydrogeological hydrodynamical and botanical observations was analyzed using a combination of multivariate statistical analysis methods to verify and characterize the interaction between the matsi spring fen and the middle devonian groundwater body in the gauja koiva river basin the shallow unconfined q aquifer was found to be perched on the till layer underlain by the confined d2gj ar sandstone aquifer which represents the regional flow system in the area the potentiometric surface of the d2gj ar aquifer was found to be above ground surface in the m1 fen polygon resulting in artesian groundwater discharge the water temperature signatures of spring and below peat piezometers in the m1 fen polygon were similar to the deeper d2gj ar borewells while in the peat piezometers and q dug wells the water temperature was affected by the air temperature fluctuations the hydrochemical facies of the analyzed groundwater samples in the study area were similarly of the ca hco3 type referring to the predominance of dissolution of carbonate minerals in primarily terrigenous aquifers the groundwater was generally more mineralized in the d2gj ar aquifer while more nutrient rich in the shallow q aquifer agricultural activities in the arable lands upstream to the spring fen have resulted in the elevated loads of macronutrients and halogens in the shallow q aquifer groundwater also contributing to the spring fen although generally in pristine state the elevated macronutrient loading from the upland and perhaps the beaver activity had led to deterioration of the status of the spring fen communities in the upstream parts of the m1 fen polygon the hydrochemical end members contributing to the final water quality of the matsi spring fen were analyzed by agglomerative hierarchical clustering and verified by discriminant analysis based on the end member mixing model analysis it was learned that the d2gj ar and the shallow q aquifer both belonging to the middle devonian groundwater body in the gauja koiva river basin provide approximately 67 and 33 of groundwater respectively to the m1 fen polygon the water framework directive of the european union 2000 60 ec and its supporting materials schutten et al 2012 stress the importance of conceptualizing interactions between gwbs and gdte dependent on them furthermore a gwb can only have a good status if the groundwater level quantitative status and its chemical composition qualitative status do not cause significant damage the dependent ecosystem 2000 60 ec usually the assessment of gwb status under the gdte test relies on the information collected in the last 6 years from the national monitoring networks however the data provided by such networks is often insufficient to uncover the critical linkages between a gwb and a gdte e g assessing the role of a gwb in the pollutant loading to a gdte effect of site specific conditions on the transport of substances to the gdte and their transformation within the gdte etc schutten et al 2012 hence targeted local studies focusing are needed the results of which can later be used in the assessment of gwb gdte interactions in similar gdtes based on the experience gained from this study we could draw some conclusions which can help the gwb and gdte status assessments in the future 1 our results show that less than good chemical status of a gdte can result from local pollution sources even when the related gwb itself has been classified to be in good chemical status local land use can have a profound effect on the status of the gdtes even if the regional groundwater quality is good and makes up the majority of the total inflow and transports most of the chemical components to the gdte that is why local surface conditions and land use in the vicinity must always be considered when evaluating the status of a gdte kløve et al 2011a good status of gdtes cannot be inferred solely from the status assessments of the related gwbs 2 to gain a valid assessment of the gdte status a detailed hydrodynamical and hydrochemical monitoring on the ecosystem scale has to be carried out kløve et al 2011b richardson et al 2011b bertrand et al 2014 zurek et al 2015 especially critical is the inclusion of wells adjacent to the studied gdte in the monitoring network to characterize all the relevant groundwater end members that contribute to the studied gdte 3 to evaluate and propose measures for the mitigation of gdte status the contribution of different sources to the chemical and nutrient budgets of the gdte must be quantified that in turn requires the monitoring of gdte outflow and all possible end members that contribute to the inflow of the gdte 4 in this study the usefulness of many minor groundwater components e g ba sr al f sio2 to establish the above mentioned mixing relationships has been shown that is why the initial hydrochemical monitoring screening in a gdte chosen for more detailed studies should be as comprehensive as possible in the given circumstances and include more parameters than just macronutrients which are commonly used for gdte status assessment e g ntot and ptot etc some parameters e g isotopic composition of water may turn out to be too crude for studies on a local scale and should always be accompanied by data acquired through other methods in the later stages of the assessment it is recommended to reevaluate the usefulness of screened parameters and to continue monitoring those parameters that give the best results in status assessments are related to identified anthropogenic pressures and allow the establishment of the mixing relationships relevant to the studied gdte credit authorship contribution statement oliver koit conceptualization methodology investigation formal analysis writing original
