13255,coffee wastewater poses a serious threat to the environment due to the presence of a large number of toxic compounds which necessitates the importance of developing suitable treatment methodologies although there are treatments available to treat the different wastewaters the presence of caffeine in wastewater interrupts the complete treatment of coffee wastewater alternatively pseudomonas sp showed an excellent capacity to withstand coffee wastewater and degrades caffeine completely in shake flask studies in this study we scaled up the coffee wastewater treatment to a 1 l in bioreactor and optimized for caffeine degradation using the self directing optimization technique using self directing optimization maximum degradation rate of 16 73 mg l h was obtained at 210 rpm 1 16 vvm and 0 383 g l of initial biomass a regression model was developed to predict the caffeine degradation rate with oxygen mass transfer coefficient k la and initial biomass concentration the regression model was solved and the optimal conditions of initial biomass concentration and k la are 0 23 g l and 64 26 h 1 respectively under those conditions experiments were performed and maximum degradation rate was 16 9 mg l h was obtained which is in comparison with model prediction 15 2 mg l h graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords coffee wastewater treatment pseudomonas sp caffeine degradation bioreactor regression modelling 1 introduction coffee is one of the high demand commodities after petroleum in the world with major consumers from asia africa and latin america around 3 5 billion cups of coffee are being consumed every day around the world 1 out of 70 countries that produce coffee beans brazil contributes to one fourth of total production with the major being arabica and robusta varieties 2 coffee contains over 1000 different compounds that contribute to a wide range of biological properties such as anti inflammatory anti oxidant anti aging and anti microbial effects 3 4 it is found to prevent the occurrence of chronic diseases like parkinson s disease type 2 diabetes coronary artery disease stroke and cardiac arrhythmias 5 due to its high demand the coffee processing industry produces a large amount of wastewater rich in compounds toxic to the environment wet processing methods are used to make high quality beans that generate around 80 organic waste which includes pulp skin and fruits of beans 6 improving coffee quality to meet requirements requires extensive wet processing which further increases the volume of wastewater 7 caffeine a major compound found in coffee is found to be an anthropogenic marker that affects microbial growth and seed development and also leads to the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria 8 9 it also affects the reproduction system in fishes and the human endocrine system 10 several physicochemical treatment methodologies have been developed to mitigate this issue such as nanoparticle based photon fenton process h2o2 treatment and their combinations to target caffeine degradation 11 however they are energy intensive and require the usage of toxic chemicals which raises environmental concerns hence biological wastewater treatment is preferred for eco friendly and cost effective operations 12 in biological treatment many bacteria and fungi that degrade caffeine were identified among which pseudomonas sp found to degrade a wide range of xenobiotics and toxic chemicals 13 pseudomonas sp ncim 5235 isolated from the coffee processing area has shown to degrade caffeine at the highest rate ever reported 14 it also can tolerate and degrade high concentrations of caffeine up to 20 g l which is toxic to most microbes 15 induced cells of pseudomonas sp showed to degrade caffeine at 0 385 g l which is the fastest ever reported 16 the degradation mechanism was found to be sequential demethylation where caffeine 1 3 7 tri methylxanthine converted into theobromine 3 7 di methylxanthine which further degrades into 7 methylxanthine 17 molecular insights on caffeine demethylation pathway showed the presence of array of position specific demethylases it reveals that ndma ndmb and ndmc are specific to n1 n3 and n7 demethylation of methylxanthines respectively 18 treatment of coffee wastewater gains attention due to its detrimental effect on growth of micro organism and on plant developmental process 19 20 caffeine poisoning has been reported in area around coffee processing industries which causes drowsiness and nausea 21 waste stream from these industries also causes mutagenic effect on long exposure to aquatic organism 22 hence to mitigate these issues treatment of coffee wastewater is essential even though there are several processes presence of caffeine in coffee wastewater delays the treatment process here we focussed on optimization of caffeine degradation in synthetic coffee waste water cww where very less reports are available here we have demonstrated the treatment and optimization of synthetic cww using induced cells of pseudomonas sp in the bioreactor by self directing optimization method self directing optimization or simplex method is widely used when there is limitation in running multiple experiments simultaneously 23 it is commonly used for optimizing experiments in bioreactor with low number of experiments thereby reducing time and cost for optimization we have used minimal number of experiments to determine optimum condition for maximum caffeine degradation rate in addition we have studied its effect in the reduction of cod bod and toc of wastewater we developed a mathematical model to predict the caffeine degradation rate based on agitation aeration and initial biomass loading also we have developed a relationship between caffeine degradation and influential parameters initial biomass aeration and agitation from minimal data with the help of regression models 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals caffeine and other salts used for preparation of synthetic wastewater were purchased from himedia laboratories pvt ltd india and srl chemicals india respectively hplc grade methanol were procured from finar chemicals india 2 2 microorganism and culture conditions pseudomonas sp ncim 5235 isolated from coffee processing was maintained by subculturing on cas agar at incubation temperature of 30 c for 36 h cas agar contains caffeine 1 2 g l sucrose 5 g l kh2po4 1 3 g l na2hpo4 0 12 g l cacl2 2h2o 0 3 g l and mgso4 7h2o 0 3 g l freshly grown cells were used to inoculate seed medium 2 3 production of induced cells nutrient broth was prepared for producing seed culture which has following composition beef extract 1 g l yeast extract 2 g l peptone 5 g l and nacl 5 g l production medium was prepared as per the protocol mentioned in earlier reports briefly it contains caffeine 6 4 g l sucrose 5 g l kh2po4 3 2 g l na2hpo4 0 325 g l cacl2 2h2o 0 3 g l mgso4 7h2o 0 3 g l and feso4 0 075 w v 14 media components were autoclaved separately and mixed together under sterile condition and adjusted to ph of 7 8 three loopful of pseudomonas culture was used to inoculate nutrient media and incubated at 30 c in scigenics orbital shaker at 180 rpm when the seed od reaches 1 2 the production medium was inoculated at 6 v v and incubated at 30 c and 180 rpm for induction of cells cells were collected when 90 of caffeine degraded in production medium and used immediately for all experimental runs 2 4 bioreactor operation synthetic coffee wastewater cww is prepared by extracting the ground coffee and adding the salts as mentioned in the previous studies table s1 24 500 stocks of salts were prepared and all components were autoclaved to maintain sterility for all experiments 1 l of freshly prepared cww is used with a treatment temperature of 30 c in a 2 5 l minifors infors ht gmbh percentage dissolved oxygen was measured using a do probe installed in the bioreactor calibration was done by saturating cww with air 100 and sparging n2 post sterilization 0 ph was monitored using an autoclavable ph probe calibrated with standard buffers before sterilization experiments were conducted at different combinations of agitation aeration and initial biomass as mentioned in table 1 samples were collected from sampling port at regular interval of 1 h and centrifuged to get cell pellets and supernatant the cell pellet was used for biomass measurement and supernatant is used for polyphenol and caffeine measurement 2 5 k la determination and correlation with agitation and aeration the gassing out technique was used to determine the k la of the reactor containing synthetic wastewater briefly n2 gas was passed to the reactor for scrubbing out all dissolved oxygen and then air is sparged till the liquid saturates with air an increase in dissolved oxygen was noted down at different time points during saturation and k la was determined by the following equation eq 1 1 ln 1 p o 2 k l a t c where po2 is the percentage of dissolved oxygen concentration in synthetic wastewater t and c are time and constant respectively initial k la values were determined for combinations of agitation and aeration as mentioned in table 1 and used to construct a regression model eq 2 for k la with agitation and aeration using matlab 2020b 2 y α 0 α 1 x 1 α 2 x 2 α 12 x 1 x 2 where x 1 and x 2 are coded values of agitation and aeration and y is k la model was analysed for best fit using anova and significance of parameters were checked by t test this model is used to predict the combinations of agitation and aeration for the optimal k la obtained from caffeine degradation model 2 6 self directing optimization by simplex method in self directing optimization the simplex moves towards optimum condition based on previous outcomes for a three variable system the simplex forms tetrahedron and hence requires four set of experiments for predicting new points 25 based on the preliminary experiments initial parameter range has been setup for biomass agitation and aeration as 0 05 to 0 2 g l 100 to 300 rpm and 0 5 to 2 vvm respectively and degradation studies were performed till the caffeine degradation is complete the simplex method of optimization was carried out starting with initial four set of experiments with combination of biomass aeration and agitation table 1 caffeine degradation rate and biomass specific growth rate were calculated from supernatant and cell pellet from samples collected from bioreactor respectively worst point is determined based on lowest caffeine degradation rate among last 4 data points and it is treated as rw the other three best parameters are mapped as rb1 rb2 and rb3 thus the following equation eq 3 is used to determine the next values for each parameter 3 r new 2 r b 1 r b 2 r b 3 3 r w 2 7 regression model development and statistical analysis number of experiments are less to accommodate all three variables in model hence k la is used to replace aeration and agitation a regression model eq 4 was developed to establish the relationship of initial biomass and k la with caffeine degradation using matlab 2020b 4 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 12 x 1 x 2 where x 1 x 2 and y are biomass k la and caffeine respectively all inputs data from first four runs were coded between 1 to 1 and normalised for rest of the runs caffeine degradation rate is fed as output anova was performed to check the model fit and significance of coefficients were established by t test 18 the optimal condition for maximum caffeine degradation was determined by maximizing the regression model experiment was conducted at model predicted optimum parameters to compare caffeine degradation rate 2 8 analytical methods caffeine was measured using shimadzu hplc with reverse phase hypersil ods c18 column as stationary phase and temperature maintained at 30 c mobile phase used was 30 methanol in ultrapure water filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filter with photodiode array as detector and response measured at 254 nm cell density was calculated from absorbance at 600 nm using double beam shimadzu uv visible spectrophotometer where 0 75 g l of biomass gives 1 optical density od polyphenol were estimated as per the protocol mentioned by angayarkanni et al and the protocol is given in detail in supplementary file fig s1 26 chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod and total organic content toc were measured by standard protocol mentioned in apha standards for wastewater quality assessment 3 results and discussion 3 1 self directed optimization for caffeine degradation in bioreactor based on preliminary results the initial four experiments run 1 to run 4 were set up with combinations of each parameter s high and low values as mentioned in table 1 among the first four runs run 1 0 05 g l 100 rpm 2 vvm gave the lowest caffeine degradation rate of 8 56 mg l h in 12 h the highest caffeine degradation obtained was 15 10 mg l h in run 4 at 0 2 g l 300 rpm 0 5 vvm combination in which complete degradation happened in 6 h as run 1 yielded less caffeine degradation rate it is considered as the worst point and new values for variables were determined from the other three runs and assigned as run 5 run 5 degraded caffeine at 14 96 mg l h is not significantly different from the previous best run 15 10 mg l h hence run 3 was considered the worst response among the last four runs 9 67 mg l h and new parameter values were determined and run 6 was conducted run 6 0 383 g l 210 rpm 1 16 vvm gave the highest caffeine degradation of 16 73 mg l h in 6 h the self directing optimization was stopped when the degradation rate reduces with the next run run 7 15 4 mg l h the highest caffeine degradation rate 16 73 mg l h was obtained at 210 rpm and 1 16 vvm and with an initial biomass of 0 383 g l hplc analysis showed caffeine content in synthetic wastewater as 100 10 mg l before treatment caffeine degradation rate increases with increase in initial biomass from 0 05 g l to 0 2 g l fig 1a increase in caffeine degradation is due to the increase in the amount of induced cells which contains caffeine degrading enzymes caffeine degrading enzymes are unique enzymes which has been found in caffeine degrading organism caffeine oxidase caffeine dehydrogenase and caffeine demethylases are the three types of enzymes involved in caffeine degradation earlier reports shows that pseudomonas sp contains caffeine demethylases caffeine demethylases are position specific n methylxanthine demethylases which sequentially demethylates caffeine to theobromine 7 methylxanthine and xanthine respectively 27 highest caffeine degradation 16 73 mg l h was observed when specific growth rate was lowest 0 120 h 1 and it decreased with increase in specific growth rate table 1 for runs with biomass greater than 0 05 g l cell mass tends to increase without any lag from the start of experiments and reaches stationary phase fig 1b in cases with lower initial biomass 0 05 g l initial caffeine degradation was very less and it was directly associated with the growth of organism suggesting that caffeine as major source of carbon and nitrogen for cell growth this is supported by our earlier reports which showed pseudomonas sp grown solely on caffeine as substrate which also fits well with substrate inhibition models luong double exponential and yano and koga 2 28 coffee beans tend to have sucrose in the range of 7 3 to 11 4 w w which contributes to 90 of total low molecular weight sugars 29 sucrose can enhance the caffeine degradation and hence the wastewater can naturally enhance the caffeine demethylation production in growing cells 30 caffeine degradation in pseudomonas sp is an oxidative demethylation process which requires molecular oxygen for the process 31 reactor studies has showed the direct correlation of dissolved oxygen and caffeine degradation when pseudomonas sp grown in cas medium 32 as induced cells contains n methylxanthine demethylases which carry out caffeine degradation through oxidative demethylation it requires one molecular oxygen for each demethylation in caffeine degradation process 33 also do is crucial for all aerobic processes and the results shows its decrease with the growth as well as caffeine degradation fig 1c in all runs the do reaches back to 100 after caffeine degrades completely except run 5 due to no aeration in run 5 caffeine degradation and biomass growth can be linked to the dissolved oxygen present in air saturated wastewater an increase in k la also favours the caffeine degradation rate synthetic wastewater was alkaline with a ph of 8 7 0 3 which is in accordance with earlier reports 11 there is no significant change in the ph before and after treatments fig 1d in previous report we have shown that the caffeine degradation by induced cells is unaffected by varying ph of wastewater from acidic to alkaline since the cells were induced at optimal condition the enzymes for caffeine degradation are available to carry out the reaction at various phs at constant degradation rate however synthetic wastewater with lower ph affected the cell growth 34 polyphenol analysis showed that the treatment has no effect in reduction in its content fig s2 3 2 effect of treatment of cod bod and toc removal from wastewater cod bod are the basic determinants of wastewater quality and all treatments are focussed to reduce its contents analysis showed that synthetic wastewater contains cod and bod values of 4960 160 mg l and 1410 21 mg l respectively toc in synthetic coffee wastewater was 2524 26 mg l in run 4 where initial biomass of 0 2 g l agitation of 300 rpm aeration of 2 vvm 82 92 and 82 of cod bod and toc were removed respectively fig 2 percentage removal of cod bod and toc were higher at initial runs and tends to approach maximum till run 4 and decreased after every run till run 7 low level combinations of initial biomass agitation and aeration 0 05 g l 100 rpm 0 5 vvm gave lowest cod and bod removal of 18 and 30 respectively hence experimental results showed a better overall treatment at 0 2 g l biomass 300 rpm and 2 vvm the experimental results showed that cod bod and toc removal are influenced by all three factors several factors such as low dissolved oxygen levels higher shear stress and less reaction time could have influenced the overall reduction in removal efficiency after run 4 few studies on reduction of wastewater parameters by mixed cultures have been reported mixed culture of serratia marcescenes acetobacter indonesiensis and cornebacterium flavescens showed to reduce 60 cod and 85 bod in coffee processing wastewater in 9 days 35 another mixed culture of pseudomonas fluorescence and escherichia coli reduced 88 42 and 81 92 of cod and bod in 6 days 36 bacterial consortium of enterobacter ludwigi enterobacter aerogenes enterobacter cloacae and bacillus cereus showed an efficiency of 48 7 cod removal 37 cheng et al has showed that activated sludge from membrane bioreactor has reduced cod up to 90 in hydraulic retention time of 5 days 38 our treatment methodology has reduced cod bod which is comparable to existing microbial methods in 6 h indicating that it is highly efficient 3 3 development of regression model for caffeine degradation in synthetic coffee wastewater 3 3 1 k la correlation with agitation and aeration since the available data points are 7 developing a regression model for three variables and their interaction effect is not feasible as degrees of freedom becomes zero in residual calculation hence a combined term k la was used to replace the effect of aeration and agitation the experimentally calculated k la and aeration and agitation values from all 7 data points were correlated using following equation eq 5 5 y 43 1790 1 2842 x 1 14 7175 x 2 50 5856 x 1 x 2 where y is k la h 1 and x 1 and x 2 are coded values for agitation and aeration model fit was analysed by anova table 2 which showed p value of 0 018 which shows significance in 95 confidence interval significance of each parameter and their interaction was determined by t test table 3 individual contributions of parameters are not significant but their interaction effect is significant at p value 0 01 this model is used to predict the combinations of aeration and agitation for optimal k la value determined from caffeine degradation model k la is property which changes with type of impellor agitation and aeration rates temperature pressure and viscosity of the liquid 39 so experimental specific determination will be helpful in predicting the relationship between k la and the influential parameters modelling of k la with respect to varying temperature different impellor designs and number of impellors have been established using exponential models and a slight variation in exponents value will largely affects the outcome 40 41 on other hand regression models contains constant that accounts for contributions from unaccounted parameters in the model 42 3 3 2 regression model for caffeine degradation regression model was developed with initial biomass and k la values to predict caffeine degradation computationally model was fitted by least square method with experimental data to obtain coefficients and the complete model was obtained eq 6 6 y 11 3246 2 4972 x 1 3 0132 x 2 2 1394 x 1 x 2 where y is caffeine degradation rate mg l h and x 1 and x 2 are coded values of biomass and k la biomass and k la coefficients show that they are positively correlated to the caffeine degradation however the interaction effect is negatively correlated anova was performed to check the fit of model and it shows the p value of 0 008 adjusted r 2 value of 0 95 table 4 significance of the parameters were checked where all coefficients and constants contribute significantly to the model at the level of p value 0 01 table 5 to determine the maxima optimum for caffeine degradation the derivative of model is solved using matlab and optimum biomass and k la values were found to be 0 23 g l and 64 26 h 1 respectively 3d surface plot and contour plot show the relationship of caffeine degradation rate with initial biomass concentration and k la values fig 3 the optima maxima obtained from the contour plot is matching with the derived optimal values it shows that increase in biomass and k la increases caffeine degradation rate and at higher concentrations of initial biomass the variation in k la contributes comparatively lesser than initial biomass on caffeine degradation in specified regime data also suggest that at higher biomass concentration specific growth rate is less and hence oxygen consumed are channelised to caffeine degradation than to growth of microorganism to determine the agitation and aeration values at 64 26 h 1 agitation of 300 rpm was chosen and corresponding aeration value of 1 6 vvm is found using k la correlation predicted model works well for synthetic wastewater treatment with the initial caffeine content of 100 10 mg l the model predicted maximum caffeine degradation of 15 2 mg l h was experimentally validated in which caffeine degraded completely in 7 h at 15 4 mg l h when experiment conducted at 400 rpm and 1 1 vvm for the same k la 64 26 the caffeine degradation was found to be 16 9 mg l h which was achieved in 6 h maximum degradation rate achieved from simplex optimization run 6 0 383 g l 210 rpm 1 16 vvm is comparable with maximum degradation rate achieved from validation of model deviation of 1 3 and 11 7 was observed for first and second validation which could be contributed by variation in the initial caffeine levels occurs during synthetic wastewater preparation 4 conclusion scale up of synthetic wastewater treatment was successfully done to 1 l pilot scale reactor with a maximum caffeine degradation of 16 73 mg l h obtained by self directing optimization maximum cod bod and toc reduction of 82 92 and 82 respectively was obtained at initial biomass of 0 2 g l 300 rpm and 2 vvm a regression model was developed to predict the caffeine degradation rate from biomass and k la values agitation and aeration were correlated with k la through a regression model for synthetic coffee wastewater a combination of 0 23 g l 400 rpm and 1 1 vvm was optimal for caffeine degradation from the regression model which showed 16 9 mg l h it is the first ever report on the development of a model for caffeine degradation from wastewater also our treatment can serve as fastest treatment process with complete caffeine degradation and maximum cod bod and toc reduction of 82 92 and 82 respectively hence applying this treatment strategy has

where 0 75 g l of biomass gives 1 optical density od polyphenol were estimated as per the protocol mentioned by angayarkanni et al and the protocol is given in detail in supplementary file fig s1 26 chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod and total organic content toc were measured by standard protocol mentioned in apha standards for wastewater quality assessment 3 results and discussion 3 1 self directed optimization for caffeine degradation in bioreactor based on preliminary results the initial four experiments run 1 to run 4 were set up with combinations of each parameter s high and low values as mentioned in table 1 among the first four runs run 1 0 05 g l 100 rpm 2 vvm gave the lowest caffeine degradation rate of 8 56 mg l h in 12 h the highest caffeine degradation obtained was 15 10 mg l h in run 4 at 0 2 g l 300 rpm 0 5 vvm combination in which complete degradation happened in 6 h as run 1 yielded less caffeine degradation rate it is considered as the worst point and new values for variables were determined from the other three runs and assigned as run 5 run 5 degraded caffeine at 14 96 mg l h is not significantly different from the previous best run 15 10 mg l h hence run 3 was considered the worst response among the last four runs 9 67 mg l h and new parameter values were determined and run 6 was conducted run 6 0 383 g l 210 rpm 1 16 vvm gave the highest caffeine degradation of 16 73 mg l h in 6 h the self directing optimization was stopped when the degradation rate reduces with the next run run 7 15 4 mg l h the highest caffeine degradation rate 16 73 mg l h was obtained at 210 rpm and 1 16 vvm and with an initial biomass of 0 383 g l hplc analysis showed caffeine content in synthetic wastewater as 100 10 mg l before treatment caffeine degradation rate increases with increase in initial biomass from 0 05 g l to 0 2 g l fig 1a increase in caffeine degradation is due to the increase in the amount of induced cells which contains caffeine degrading enzymes caffeine degrading enzymes are unique enzymes which has been found in caffeine degrading organism caffeine oxidase caffeine dehydrogenase and caffeine demethylases are the three types of enzymes involved in caffeine degradation earlier reports shows that pseudomonas sp contains caffeine demethylases caffeine demethylases are position specific n methylxanthine demethylases which sequentially demethylates caffeine to theobromine 7 methylxanthine and xanthine respectively 27 highest caffeine degradation 16 73 mg l h was observed when specific growth rate was lowest 0 120 h 1 and it decreased with increase in specific growth rate table 1 for runs with biomass greater than 0 05 g l cell mass tends to increase without any lag from the start of experiments and reaches stationary phase fig 1b in cases with lower initial biomass 0 05 g l initial caffeine degradation was very less and it was directly associated with the growth of organism suggesting that caffeine as major source of carbon and nitrogen for cell growth this is supported by our earlier reports which showed pseudomonas sp grown solely on caffeine as substrate which also fits well with substrate inhibition models luong double exponential and yano and koga 2 28 coffee beans tend to have sucrose in the range of 7 3 to 11 4 w w which contributes to 90 of total low molecular weight sugars 29 sucrose can enhance the caffeine degradation and hence the wastewater can naturally enhance the caffeine demethylation production in growing cells 30 caffeine degradation in pseudomonas sp is an oxidative demethylation process which requires molecular oxygen for the process 31 reactor studies has showed the direct correlation of dissolved oxygen and caffeine degradation when pseudomonas sp grown in cas medium 32 as induced cells contains n methylxanthine demethylases which carry out caffeine degradation through oxidative demethylation it requires one molecular oxygen for each demethylation in caffeine degradation process 33 also do is crucial for all aerobic processes and the results shows its decrease with the growth as well as caffeine degradation fig 1c in all runs the do reaches back to 100 after caffeine degrades completely except run 5 due to no aeration in run 5 caffeine degradation and biomass growth can be linked to the dissolved oxygen present in air saturated wastewater an increase in k la also favours the caffeine degradation rate synthetic wastewater was alkaline with a ph of 8 7 0 3 which is in accordance with earlier reports 11 there is no significant change in the ph before and after treatments fig 1d in previous report we have shown that the caffeine degradation by induced cells is unaffected by varying ph of wastewater from acidic to alkaline since the cells were induced at optimal condition the enzymes for caffeine degradation are available to carry out the reaction at various phs at constant degradation rate however synthetic wastewater with lower ph affected the cell growth 34 polyphenol analysis showed that the treatment has no effect in reduction in its content fig s2 3 2 effect of treatment of cod bod and toc removal from wastewater cod bod are the basic determinants of wastewater quality and all treatments are focussed to reduce its contents analysis showed that synthetic wastewater contains cod and bod values of 4960 160 mg l and 1410 21 mg l respectively toc in synthetic coffee wastewater was 2524 26 mg l in run 4 where initial biomass of 0 2 g l agitation of 300 rpm aeration of 2 vvm 82 92 and 82 of cod bod and toc were removed respectively fig 2 percentage removal of cod bod and toc were higher at initial runs and tends to approach maximum till run 4 and decreased after every run till run 7 low level combinations of initial biomass agitation and aeration 0 05 g l 100 rpm 0 5 vvm gave lowest cod and bod removal of 18 and 30 respectively hence experimental results showed a better overall treatment at 0 2 g l biomass 300 rpm and 2 vvm the experimental results showed that cod bod and toc removal are influenced by all three factors several factors such as low dissolved oxygen levels higher shear stress and less reaction time could have influenced the overall reduction in removal efficiency after run 4 few studies on reduction of wastewater parameters by mixed cultures have been reported mixed culture of serratia marcescenes acetobacter indonesiensis and cornebacterium flavescens showed to reduce 60 cod and 85 bod in coffee processing wastewater in 9 days 35 another mixed culture of pseudomonas fluorescence and escherichia coli reduced 88 42 and 81 92 of cod and bod in 6 days 36 bacterial consortium of enterobacter ludwigi enterobacter aerogenes enterobacter cloacae and bacillus cereus showed an efficiency of 48 7 cod removal 37 cheng et al has showed that activated sludge from membrane bioreactor has reduced cod up to 90 in hydraulic retention time of 5 days 38 our treatment methodology has reduced cod bod which is comparable to existing microbial methods in 6 h indicating that it is highly efficient 3 3 development of regression model for caffeine degradation in synthetic coffee wastewater 3 3 1 k la correlation with agitation and aeration since the available data points are 7 developing a regression model for three variables and their interaction effect is not feasible as degrees of freedom becomes zero in residual calculation hence a combined term k la was used to replace the effect of aeration and agitation the experimentally calculated k la and aeration and agitation values from all 7 data points were correlated using following equation eq 5 5 y 43 1790 1 2842 x 1 14 7175 x 2 50 5856 x 1 x 2 where y is k la h 1 and x 1 and x 2 are coded values for agitation and aeration model fit was analysed by anova table 2 which showed p value of 0 018 which shows significance in 95 confidence interval significance of each parameter and their interaction was determined by t test table 3 individual contributions of parameters are not significant but their interaction effect is significant at p value 0 01 this model is used to predict the combinations of aeration and agitation for optimal k la value determined from caffeine degradation model k la is property which changes with type of impellor agitation and aeration rates temperature pressure and viscosity of the liquid 39 so experimental specific determination will be helpful in predicting the relationship between k la and the influential parameters modelling of k la with respect to varying temperature different impellor designs and number of impellors have been established using exponential models and a slight variation in exponents value will largely affects the outcome 40 41 on other hand regression models contains constant that accounts for contributions from unaccounted parameters in the model 42 3 3 2 regression model for caffeine degradation regression model was developed with initial biomass and k la values to predict caffeine degradation computationally model was fitted by least square method with experimental data to obtain coefficients and the complete model was obtained eq 6 6 y 11 3246 2 4972 x 1 3 0132 x 2 2 1394 x 1 x 2 where y is caffeine degradation rate mg l h and x 1 and x 2 are coded values of biomass and k la biomass and k la coefficients show that they are positively correlated to the caffeine degradation however the interaction effect is negatively correlated anova was performed to check the fit of model and it shows the p value of 0 008 adjusted r 2 value of 0 95 table 4 significance of the parameters were checked where all coefficients and constants contribute significantly to the model at the level of p value 0 01 table 5 to determine the maxima optimum for caffeine degradation the derivative of model is solved using matlab and optimum biomass and k la values were found to be 0 23 g l and 64 26 h 1 respectively 3d surface plot and contour plot show the relationship of caffeine degradation rate with initial biomass concentration and k la values fig 3 the optima maxima obtained from the contour plot is matching with the derived optimal values it shows that increase in biomass and k la increases caffeine degradation rate and at higher concentrations of initial biomass the variation in k la contributes comparatively lesser than initial biomass on caffeine degradation in specified regime data also suggest that at higher biomass concentration specific growth rate is less and hence oxygen consumed are channelised to caffeine degradation than to growth of microorganism to determine the agitation and aeration values at 64 26 h 1 agitation of 300 rpm was chosen and corresponding aeration value of 1 6 vvm is found using k la correlation predicted model works well for synthetic wastewater treatment with the initial caffeine content of 100 10 mg l the model predicted maximum caffeine degradation of 15 2 mg l h was experimentally validated in which caffeine degraded completely in 7 h at 15 4 mg l h when experiment conducted at 400 rpm and 1 1 vvm for the same k la 64 26 the caffeine degradation was found to be 16 9 mg l h which was achieved in 6 h maximum degradation rate achieved from simplex optimization run 6 0 383 g l 210 rpm 1 16 vvm is comparable with maximum degradation rate achieved from validation of model deviation of 1 3 and 11 7 was observed for first and second validation which could be contributed by variation in the initial caffeine levels occurs during synthetic wastewater preparation 4 conclusion scale up of synthetic wastewater treatment was successfully done to 1 l pilot scale reactor with a maximum caffeine degradation of 16 73 mg l h obtained by self directing optimization maximum cod bod and toc reduction of 82 92 and 82 respectively was obtained at initial biomass of 0 2 g l 300 rpm and 2 vvm a regression model was developed to predict the caffeine degradation rate from biomass and k la values agitation and aeration were correlated with k la through a regression model for synthetic coffee wastewater a combination of 0 23 g l 400 rpm and 1 1 vvm was optimal for caffeine degradation from the regression model which showed 16 9 mg l h it is the first ever report on the development of a model for caffeine degradation from wastewater also our treatment can serve as fastest treatment process with complete caffeine degradation and maximum cod bod and toc reduction of 82 92 and 82 respectively hence applying this treatment strategy has

13256,pollution from plastics and their slow degradation are current problems that require urgent solutions the natural degradation of plastics leads to its fragmentation resulting not only in microplastics mps but also in nanoplastics nps in recent years research and monitoring of mps and nps concentrations has increased the monitoring of their concentrations in the environment sampling sites detection and quantification methods are not standardised due to the inherent properties of the materials and the origin of the samples which tends to make the comparison of data between different studies difficult in this study we developed an h2o2 enzyme protocol for the extraction of mps from sludge based on existing analytical methods in the literature from sampling to quantification and detection our laboratory study consists of four protocols used to verify mps recovery from doped sludge samples containing three polymers polypropylene polyethylene terephthalate and nylon to emphasise the relevance of the optimal protocol a triplicate test was performed for each of these protocols all of them using sieve fractions between 100 and 500 μm while isoporous polycarbonate membranes were used for the filtration of the samples the percentage polymer distribution of h2o2 enzyme protocol was similar to the control 42 8 49 38 2 83 16 11 31 with some limitations for the larger fraction data collection was carried out by optical visualisation and chemical identification using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to record polymer spectra obtained for potential interpretation finally a test was conducted to try all protocols on a real sludge from a local plant to confirm their efficiency graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microplastics mps recovery rate sewage sludge organic matter om h2o2 enzyme protocol 1 introduction plastics had been used very extensively since the end of the 19th century benefitting from their low cost plastics are integral to packaging 39 7 construction 19 8 automotive 10 1 electrical electronic equipment 6 2 home and sporting goods 4 1 agriculture 3 4 and other areas 16 7 1 by 2050 some 12 000 mt of plastic waste will have been dumped or introduced into nature 2 the damage to the environment from plastics is not only limited to their ubiquity but also to their sorption of pollutants 3 4 sludge is loaded with fibres released from laundry products 5 and microbeads from hygiene products 6 subsequently such sludge is being used as a soil amendment and any hazardous chemical compound it contains might carry a significantly high tumour risk 7 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considered nest for microplastics mps 8 11 after a long purification process persistent mps leave the water matrix to end up into the sludge fibres as major components in sludge require urgent analytical development so that synthetic and natural fibres can be distinguished 5 12 13 resulting from population growth sanitation discharges are constantly increasing in spain decree 1620 2007 on wastewater discharge did not set specific limit values for domestic discharges in relation to polymeric compounds in andalusia decree 73 2012 approved waste regulation with a double objective namely the valuation of waste and the benefits of agriculture in line with the european strategy for a sustainable bioeconomy by converting waste streams into value added products to improve production and efficiency in the sustainable use of resources treated sewage sludge remains waste until it is actually placed in the ground and must be treated and applied by the bodies designated by law to do so the spanish regulation decree aaa 1072 2013 on the use of sewage sludge in agriculture does not consider that mps from sewage sludge can accumulate on agricultural land therefore studies are needed to confirm the existence of these particles in these soils typically once the sludge samples are being dried sieved separated by density and filtered they are finally visualised through the electron microscopy followed by fourier transform infrared ft ir analysis the aim of this study is to propose an h2o2 enzyme battery protocol as an alternative for the extraction of mps from a reference sludge doped with a mixture of the most common polymers previously identified in wwtps this protocol was established in comparison with three other existing protocols all applied to a real sludge from a local wwtp in order to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed protocol 2 materials and methods considering that there is no standardised method for the analysis of mps we present here the methods used in previous research for the recovery and identification of mps in sewage sludge matrices the most commonly used methods by the authors can be classified in the following order a digestion of organic matter om b flotation c filtration a as a part of sample processing the organic remnants stuck to mps obstruct visual identification and the need for digestion varies depending on the quantity of biological waste in every sample up to 99 om hurley et al 14 as seen on the previous studies they have cited om digestion protocols by using fenton s reagent heated at 75 c within a short time frame 15 or only h2o2 in a process referred to as wet peroxidation 9 16 where mostly the plastic fragments remain unchanged or likely being slightly compressed after wet peroxidation in the other hand several authors 17 19 reported that the om h2o2 exposure time as well as the incubation temperature helped the process to get rid of the majority of organic matter recovering so the maximum of mps cole et al 20 there are some researches carried out over but by using an acidic digestion 21 24 the time when others performed an alkaline attack instead 8 25 28 löder et al 28 combined a surfactant sds followed by enzymes mixture and finished with a double h2o2 exposure b to reduce the weight of the mp particles and separate them by density from intrusive ones different salt saturated solutions can be used to collect the supernatants for further filtration such as nacl 1 2 g cm 3 which is often used for floating and elutriation since is inexpensive and environmentally friendly with high reagent grades and is recommended by noaa 29 c after the density is being done it comes the filtration phase which requires high levels of cleanliness and attention afterward the supernatants are kept in the separation funnels 30 for 24 h can be versed on different types of filters table 1 the most common method for analysing mps in solid samples e g 14 employs an om removal procedure followed by density separation to isolate microplastic particles based on the review of the existing literature 8 20 28 32 35 37 41 45 in this study three main protocols for the removal of om from complex and organic rich environmental samples have been tested using different digestion agents based on the literature along with the proposed protocol all protocols were executed over the same matrix of reference sludge doped with virgin polymers for two mp sizes that predominate in sludge f1 100 ϕ 500 μm and f2 500 μm ϕ 5000 μm 2 1 preparation of doped sludge to check the possible influence of mp particle size in the sludge extraction process two tests have undertaken as for the mp doped sludge matrices with different sizes f1 and f2 a reference sludge ielab 0301 enriched with particles of pp pet and nylon purchased from sigma aldrich germany was used so that the mps were representative in terms of the real shapes presented in sludge the mps were previously ground sieved through stainless steel meshes for each size and characterized physically then optically using an optical carl zeiss axio imager m1m stereomicroscope at 10 magnification equipped with infinity analyze software package for each test two damp mixtures of sludge in addition to mps with a digital magnetic stirrer from ovan were applied f1 f2 tests 30 g dw of sludge 0 01 g of each polymer previously sieved each protocol was prepared in triplicate and controlled by blanks the same weight of mps with reagents without sludge a control sample was also made for each size same weight of mps without reagents nor sludge to verify the effect of the reagents on virgin mps the dye rose bengal was applied directly to the polymers previously retained on f1 and f2 kept in weighing scoops and emptied with ultrapure water on the filters the dyed filters were then photographed at led using the optical microscopy 2 2 comparison of protocols 2 g of wet sludge were used for each protocol prepared in triplicate with both f1 and f2 right after the om removal the preparations triplicates were subjected to a density separation ahead of the filtration a schematic illustration elucidating the experimental protocols is provided in fig 1 2 2 1 om removal 2 2 1 1 protocol 1 p1 using a modified procedure adapted from cole et al 20 where each sample was disrupted mechanically via ultrasonication sonics vibra cell the sludge sample was afterword incubated in 30 ml of h2o2 30 to digest the om for 8 h at 50 c and 20 rpm later additional h2o2 was added to react overnight owing to bleaching character while heating 38 each sample was held to stirring thereafter 6 ml of hcl 96 were added at 50 c for 30 min and then 60 c during the next 30 min the subsequent rise in temperature was to shorten the reaction limit by affecting directly the enthalpy of the reaction the hcl addition was carried out in a fume hood and the beaker was uncovered to fully release the hcl 2 2 1 2 protocol 2 p2 an n hexane trial was implemented since shim et al 35 picked it as a suitable solvent for the staining condition consequently similar to protocol 1 the sample went through ultrasonication h2o2 30 was used for 8 h at 50 c and 20 rpm checked hourly to boost hydroxyl radicals the beaker was kept under stirring until the 6 ml of n hexane 95 is being completely evaporated at 65 c heated for 1 h 2 2 1 3 protocol 3 p3 the sample was exposed to 5 ml of hemicellulase from aspergillus niger sigma aldrich germany at 50 c and kept under slight stirring for 24 h h2o2 20 ml 30 was added at a mild temperature of 30 c all the undesirable material was filtered through the sieve corresponding to the sample with f1 and f2 treated separately and rinsed with a large volume of ultrapure water the retained material was rinsed back into the sample beaker the addition of 5 ml of hemicellulase was repeated to ensure a better decomposition of remaining cellulose a final overnight oxidation step using h2o2 was beneficial to bleach the material left in the beaker 38 the end of the effervescence confirmed the total removal of om the density separation could be excluded in this case 2 2 1 4 protocol 4 p4 according to the protocol with a large sequence of enzymes 26 28 the sludge sample was treated with 60 ml of sds vwr chemicals european commission as a surfactant prior to digestion exposed at 50 c due to sds the sample became foamy each following incubation phase required 24 h of interaction with coverage and stirring and every used enzyme contributed gently to solubilising one biological component α amylase 5 ml from bacillus sp sigma aldrich was added at 50 c with stirring at 20 rpm next the supernatant was exposed to 5 ml of hemicellulase at 50 c and stirring at 20 rpm h2o2 was then applied 20 ml 30 the rich fraction of broken saccharide bonds cellulose and lichenin was drained through the sieve with abundant rinsing f1 and f2 at this point in the investigation based on the work of löder et al 28 and mintenig et al 26 we opted for an aloe vera leaf gel which has been promoted for its antifungal activity the seeked layer was the mucilaginous gel consisted of 99 5 water and 0 5 enzymes 46 in conjunction with the above our sample was exposed to 2 ml of aloe vera gel to wrap the range of mps and bind them to settle separately as an upper array with a dim glow due to their viscous surface thereafter 5 ml of chitinase incubation phase was selected based on the protocol of löder et al 28 and mintenig et al 26 chitinase was extracted from natural rice according to doukani 47 as described in the supplementary data it is evident that none of the mps remains susceptible to overlapping dense substances throughout the digestion which enter the focus sieve directly for density separation the lower aqueous phase remaining in the beaker was drained and the walls of the beaker were thoroughly rinsed to return all particles cleanly to the beaker 2 2 2 flotation after the om digestion have subsided the lability of the polymer granular aggregate retrieval became clear the condition to be met is to select a non instigating salt solution to the particle shape change hence by adopting nuelle et al 18 0 05 m nai beaker we manage to induce buoyancy of the mps all over the up cited protocols in front of covering and incubating for 24 48 h 2 2 3 filtration as a consequence of the distinct existing filters the used ones initially were acetate plus discs 47 mmø 0 8 μm whatman this type was chosen to be the as a tailored filter that led to mp entrapment a cellulose nitrate membrane filter 45 mmø 0 8 μm sartorius in an uneven comparison was not successful because of its coarseness even when collecting it with a pair of tweezers and storing it in a petri dish it might become permanently chapped thereby affecting the integrity of the mps filtration by a pc membrane 47 mmø 0 8 μm isopore as an alternative by reason of its transparent nature was smoothly ideal and innocuous to gather mps for easy visualisation other authors have deemed it suited to retain even glass fibres 39 for this reason the pc membrane was used over all our protocols instead of acetate plus with prevention of the onset of filter blackening by dint of the nai absorbed all supernatants were then dropped on the filters and get dried for 2 h at 40 c 2 3 identification and characterisation of extracted mps the filters with the trapped mps were microscopically examined the polymer features were identified with ft ir spectroscopy using a perkinelmer spectrum 100 ft ir spectrometer 48 49 the measuring parameters for the micro transmission mode were as follows 50 μm spot 16 scans resolution of 4 cm 1 spectral range of 4000 650 cm 1 using spectrum software and by comparing with standard spectra in the library set only matches with a search score of 0 7 were admitted 50 2 4 quality control to have a maximum likelihood estimation of airborne microfibres or any possible background plastic contamination laboratory blanks i e negative controls were included in all steps of sample processing placed as empty beakers alongside the beakers containing actual samples and processed using the same methodology used for the sludge samples other preventive measures that were maintained included rinsing all glassware three times with ultrapure water before use as well as working under laminar flow hood cleaning all equipment with 96 alcohol throughout the process whence the microscopic examination of controls showed no evidence of suspected contamination 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of reagents on polymeric particles to verify possible effects of the reagents on the structure of the virgin polymers in the different protocols the mp particles were quantified in the blanks mps with reagents without sludge 1 2 3 or 4 are blanks referring to their corresponding protocol respectively the samples controls mps without reagents have been settled to check the reagents medium effect upon the quantification of mps it gives a total of 496 particles blanks besides 142 particles controls accordingly the control sample contained more pet than pp and finally nylon 3 1 1 physicals changes fig 2 shows the micrograph 10 images of selected plastic particles before left and after right treatment for both f1 and f2 small pitting in the surfaces of pp and pet was observed because they were previously ground as mentioned in the methodology it is noticed that the applied reagents did not affect the irregularities of particles but it seems that the optical stereomicroscope revealed a soiling of their surfaces in b2 this effect was pronounced in the sludge tests p1 and p2 compared to p3 and p4 which cleaned the particles better hence the effect of hemicellulase combined with peroxide p3 and enzyme succession p4 had a greater cleaning effect on mps which positions them as better protocols 3 1 2 particle count table 2 a shows the number of particles quantified for each polymer in each of the protocols for both fractions f1 and f2 together with the controls quantification so that the evaluation criteria were based on the number of particles before and after the experiments as mass concentration alone did not give a change using these data the percentages of each polymer type in the total number b percent abundance were determined to calculate the standard deviation c compared to the corresponding control resulting in the efficiency of each type based on the lower percentage deviations the most efficient protocol was chosen as it is closer to the percentage of particles to be found in the controls all tested protocols have shown the percentage deviation within each polymers type which means that no protocol identified as 100 of the reference polymers by fraction size and unleashing through the smallest one f1 where the blanks 1 2 and 4 identified particles that were not present intruders other than the reference polymers that might be caused not just by doped mps reagents intolerance but even if the reagents were mps tolerated the energy of activation might be impeded with steric hindrance too seeing the high molecular weight of polymers as occurred in the study of al azzawi et al 16 when doping pet subjected to a koh protocol this interference did not occur in b3 which also well quantified pp and pet standard deviation 0 although nylon has not been accurately identified similar to 14 when asserting the severe oxidative effect 30 in the polymer structure in what concerns the major fraction f2 b4 again picked out four main particles butyl stearate bromoheptadecane vinylidene chloride and l glyceraldehyde exogenous form with respect to f1 it is believed that the reagents used have altered the structures of the polymers which become more accessible to the biomaterials due to their chemical environment thus interfering with the ft ir spectrum 51 nevertheless their standard deviation was close to the control values 1 0 9 b3 presented a distribution quite similar to what found in the control hence it showed the highest standard deviations 33 0 9 14 6 5 a particular case occurred with nylon for f1 where b1 identified a similar nylon percentage as to the control sample and the absorbance peaks resembled the nylons in the spectral library nylon 6 polycaprolactam nylon 6 6 nylon 6 9 nylon 6 12 etc the blank samples of the other protocols 2 3 and 4 obtained worse extraction percentages than b1 in contrast no protocol was able to quantify the appropriate particle count for nylon in the major fraction f2 with all of these protocols underestimating and obtaining worse results in terms of their standard deviations better results were harvested for the particles pp and pet especially in the minor fraction f1 as they were quantified with 30 2 9 40 3 8 especially for b3 deviations of 0 in the major fraction f2 pp was better identified as in p3 while p4 gave better results for pet to summarize the effect of the different reagents on the mps it turns out that p3 only identifies the polymers used with a higher precision than the other protocols while p4 given its veracity it is preferable to discard it furthermore pet and pp in that order were the best identified polymers coinciding with the distribution percentage of the blanks in b2 b3 and b4 except for b1 where pp predominated and finally nylon p3 was the method that gave the best results for identifying these three polymers to endorse the efficiency of the different protocols 24 spiked sludge samples were subjected to the four protocols on this basis it was verifiedthatp3 was still the most efficient for the detection quantification and identification of mps 3 2 microplastic extraction efficiency from doped sludge samples fig 3 shows the results of the percentages of the mps analysed in each protocol for both fractions f1 and f2 3 2 1 p1 the order of mp abundance in protocol 1 was pp pet nylon others the f1 particles were quantified more accurately than the larger f2 particles for example the recovery percentage of pet matched that of the blank in the small sized particles for f2 on the other hand the slightly compressed pet particles when viewed microscopically strongly degraded into free radical polymerization induced ethylene 52 53 and catalytically born toluene under the milder conditions of the hot hcl used 54 this kind of pet clumping also occurred in the study by karami et al 23 furthermore the presence of butyl stearate confirmed the ineffectiveness of p1 in the om clean up p1 overestimated pp quantification for both sizes and underestimated nylon although surprisingly it retained the aliphatic nature of nylon 6 polycaprolactam as well as contributed intrusive particles 3 2 2 p2 a good percentage distribution of polymers was observed in the blank and control results pet pp nylon but an overestimation of pp was observed for the doped sludge sample the rest in both fractions the values were significantly underestimated 27 8 33 27 6 11 11 15 14 3 2 31 with p doped pet particles and polyacetylene due to possible polymerization in hexane 55 nylon was split into diaminohexane monomers under the action of the polymer hydrolysis and a neomenthol diastereomer as another component of the polymer gel matrix which could be used as an auxiliary solution in an amount of 0 15 by weight 56 as well as being an intrusive component others moreover the worst values were again for f2 it is suggested that the aliphatic nature of nylon not only has been conserved but also has jumped to nylon 11 polyundecanamide and may be confused with pp which has been overestimated as the chemical process affecting mps can alter its spectral properties 57 58 leading to complex spectra 59 60 3 2 3 p3 under p3 all polymer types showed good recoveries both for the blanks and for the sludge percentage polymer distribution similar to the control 42 8 49 38 2 83 16 11 31 with some limitations for the larger fraction a slight loss of nylon mean of 17 for f2 should not be overlooked otherwise the h2o2 enzyme protocol alone exceeded expectations compared to the other protocols as it did not contribute to the formation of components other than the pioneers p3 was the most effective om remover and the natural reference nylon preservative details of the protocol and the blank and control recovery rates set can be found in supplementary data fig 1 3 2 4 p4 the efficiency of this protocol has already been questioned because the sequence of the enzymes altered the particle spectra and thwarted identification with ft ir spectroscopy 59 60 although this protocol was applied to doped sludge it quantified the percentage of pp and pet more satisfactorily compared to the blank with better results for the smallest fraction in contrast the major fraction overestimated pp and underestimated pet associated with its decomposition into vdc 1 1 dichloroethylene which can form a peroxide in the presence of air or oxygen 61 furthermore the aliphatic nature of nylon deteriorated on many occasions when the undergoing thermal properties is not being held to the correct pitch 14 62 63 in addition the protocol again identified four intrusive components nylon was again difficult to detect lower recovery percentages of the three polymers as also revealed by the blank method confirming that the reagents themselves can vary the structures of the infrared spectra 14 according to the results p1 was the smallest fraction 31 of the items analysed pet and is the predominant fraction in the analysis of wastewater and sewage sludge 41 64 this reveals the importance of this study even with the overestimation of pp and the misidentification of nylon besides p2 in sludge exhibited the poorest results with a 3 nylon extraction and pet 28 lower than their respective blanks again it is believed that the contamination on the surface of the particles exposed to p1 and p2 caused scattering of the reflected infrared light therefore ft ir detection was unattainable 19 65 furthermore polymer speciation results were more relevant after p3 without penetrating polymers in contrast to p4 where there were intruders 3 2 5 spectral changes the main objective of the spectral study was to show the morphological and chemical properties of the extracted mps post treatment the pp spectra of f1 and f2 were right in phase with the reference spectrum all particles were successfully matched with a satisfactory hit quality index of 0 96 all subsamples exhibited high intensities in f1 and f2 and clearly identified pet slight changes were observed in nylon spectra due to the vibrational frequencies of its variant aliphatic forms 66 for f1 p1 generated a third order peak at 2868 cm 1 possibly associated with variations in the polymer structure of the virgin pp the lowest intensity belonged to p2 the bands at 1167 and 997 cm 1 corresponding to ch bending in comparison with the pp control as a result of the ease of bending ch more likely than stretching or compressing frequencies were not seen in the b1 b2 and p2 spectra in the major fraction p1 gave lesser spectral sensitivity with both peaks at 808 and 899 cm 1 related to b1 indicating the presence of stretching vibrations p2 altered the ft ir spectra in the range 1500 1560 cm 1 probably due to the development of a white outer layer throughout pp in contrast b2 with the highest intensity revealed that all functional characteristic groups were much better conserved p3 and b3 in both fractions reliably were in line with the control spectra whereas the p4 spectra in both fractions was consistent but in b4 of the smallest fraction some peaks in the fingerprint region have appeared 14 60 the main characteristics of the pet bands were all in phase with the control particularly for p4 only p2 in both fractions showed an anomaly at wavelengths of 1032 and 1026 cm 1 assigned to co stretching 67 the peaks of nylon in f1 were identical to those of the control especially p3 and p1 b2 with the lowest intensity showed fewer overlapping component peaks as also found in the study by tagg et al 19 which maybe attributed to the probable mixture of biogenic matter and non organic debris on the pc filter otherwise the nylon peaks in f2 were wider than the control peaks in the fingerprint region due to the presence of hydrogen bonding in the structure unusual vibrations were shown for p2 corresponded to an absorption band at 1743 cm 1 and carbonyl stretching at 1709 cm 1 68 unexpected carbonyl group formation in b4 was also detected denoting that the nylon has been oxidized or even deteriorated 69 it can be concluded that p1 retained less of the pp polymer structure in both fractions compared to the other protocols which was consistent with b1 f1 and f2 but relevant to the identification of similar nylon to the control p2 responded poorly in f1 and altered the pp and nylon spectra in f2 p3 gave reasonable response spectra for pp pet and nylon in both fractions p4 showed undesirable peaks for nylon identification in agreement with its blank otherwise it largely retained the structure of pet to test the different protocols with real sludge samples were taken from a wastewater treatment plant in the province as test media 3 3 application of protocols to real sludge 3 3 1 study site the wwtp is located in prado del rey cádiz spain with an inlet flow rate of 9119 h e and a design population of 6 770 h e this wwtp takes in charge a primary and a secondary treatments ultraviolet disinfection and chlorination with a surface area of 49 km2 and a population density of 123 4 inhabitants km2 with geographical coordinates of 36 47 n and 5 33 w as schematically provided in the map fig 4 3 3 2 pre treatment sludge sampling was performed in april 2019 prior to sample processing each 2 g of sludge was passed through f1 and f2 to assure split homogeneity within two separated subsamples since the last inspections indicated that they are the most contaminated and common fractions to get rid of a likely contamination the sieves with trapped particles were immediately transferred to 50 ml beakers and stored negative controls were opted during all steps of sample processing to ensure quality 3 3 3 data analysis mps with various shapes in the sludge samples were microscopically observed and categorized as fragments spheres filaments flakes and fibres by xu et al 70 fig 5 the most preponderant observed mp forms were fibres and fragments followed by filaments and flakes after the visual evaluation the particle typology was derived by ft ir spectroscopy due to the large number of subsamples 240 particles were randomly selected and examined where 37 were plastics accounting for 62 consisting of nine types of plastics they were poly vinyl stearate pvs pp pet polyvinyl chloride pvc nylon poly cyclohexanedimethylene terephthalate pct poly butylene terephthalate pbt poly butyl methacrylate pbma and high density polyethylene hdpe the fragments mostly made up of pp pet pvc and pct probably derived from packaging clothing and wire rope the fibres were mainly nylon while the flakes were pbma and hdpe which may have come from pipe sealing it is suspected that pvs filament yarns are liberated from cutlery the efficiency of the protocols used in preparing sludge samples for mp analysis is shown in fig 6 p1 and p2 presented joint hdpe pp and pct in f1 p2 outperformed p1 in detecting pct otherwise in f2 p1confirmed pvc and pet instead of only hdpe and is the only detector of pbt p1 and p2 in f1 detected 29 biogenics belonging to food derivatives l glyceraldehyde in unnatural form and hormones cis androsterone and juvenile hormone which were discarded because we were more interested in the polymeric speciation p3 identified more mps and represented the target polymers of this study pp pet and nylon with a satisfactory search result although p1 checked pet and p2 detected pct hdpe better than p3 opposed to p4 which detected only two particles through f1 and f2 hence it is suggested that the range loss of mps was extended 4 conclusion for the all blanks and the four triplicates of doped real sludge samples tested in this study only one benchmark extraction protocol was suitable to obtain a conceivable mp overview while noting that the methods were tested with spiked samples and the risk of missing mps during microscopic visualisation prior to ft ir identification was high this investigation led to the following conclusions 1 compared to the control tests all protocols in doped sludge detected the highest percentage of pet followed by pp and finally nylon p1 and p2 resulted in damage and finally the eventual destruction of pet and nylon the polymer speciation results after p3 were more relevant without intruding polymers than the other protocols as with p4 the sequence of enzymes interfered with the particle spectra and made identification with ft ir spectroscopy tougher 2 chemical analysis measuring vibrational excitation was considered as an additional benefit of our experimental approach to this type of mp hazard study 3 all protocols in real sludge gave different reported results p1 detected six plastic types versus p2 with three matched types as given hdpe pp pct plus cellulosic biopolymer p3 detected three more plastic types compared to p1 and p2 but it did not cause any physical or spectral changes conversely to these latter thus p4 could have been met if the enzymes that are supposed to be used were timeframe reasonable and economically accessible 4 mp recuperation with p3 based on hemicellulase and h2o2 was more efficient there was no large fluctuation in mp number nor interference caused by the reaction reagents thus the optimal extraction method for mps in sewage sludge is suggested to be digested with hemicellulase at 50 c followed by bleaching with h2o2 conclusively in the short run it is recommended to optimize the p3 so as to claim a faster and

13256,pollution from plastics and their slow degradation are current problems that require urgent solutions the natural degradation of plastics leads to its fragmentation resulting not only in microplastics mps but also in nanoplastics nps in recent years research and monitoring of mps and nps concentrations has increased the monitoring of their concentrations in the environment sampling sites detection and quantification methods are not standardised due to the inherent properties of the materials and the origin of the samples which tends to make the comparison of data between different studies difficult in this study we developed an h2o2 enzyme protocol for the extraction of mps from sludge based on existing analytical methods in the literature from sampling to quantification and detection our laboratory study consists of four protocols used to verify mps recovery from doped sludge samples containing three polymers polypropylene polyethylene terephthalate and nylon to emphasise the relevance of the optimal protocol a triplicate test was performed for each of these protocols all of them using sieve fractions between 100 and 500 μm while isoporous polycarbonate membranes were used for the filtration of the samples the percentage polymer distribution of h2o2 enzyme protocol was similar to the control 42 8 49 38 2 83 16 11 31 with some limitations for the larger fraction data collection was carried out by optical visualisation and chemical identification using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to record polymer spectra obtained for potential interpretation finally a test was conducted to try all protocols on a real sludge from a local plant to confirm their efficiency graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microplastics mps recovery rate sewage sludge organic matter om h2o2 enzyme protocol 1 introduction plastics had been used very extensively since the end of the 19th century benefitting from their low cost plastics are integral to packaging 39 7 construction 19 8 automotive 10 1 electrical electronic equipment 6 2 home and sporting goods 4 1 agriculture 3 4 and other areas 16 7 1 by 2050 some 12 000 mt of plastic waste will have been dumped or introduced into nature 2 the damage to the environment from plastics is not only limited to their ubiquity but also to their sorption of pollutants 3 4 sludge is loaded with fibres released from laundry products 5 and microbeads from hygiene products 6 subsequently such sludge is being used as a soil amendment and any hazardous chemical compound it contains might carry a significantly high tumour risk 7 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considered nest for microplastics mps 8 11 after a long purification process persistent mps leave the water matrix to end up into the sludge fibres as major components in sludge require urgent analytical development so that synthetic and natural fibres can be distinguished 5 12 13 resulting from population growth sanitation discharges are constantly increasing in spain decree 1620 2007 on wastewater discharge did not set specific limit values for domestic discharges in relation to polymeric compounds in andalusia decree 73 2012 approved waste regulation with a double objective namely the valuation of waste and the benefits of agriculture in line with the european strategy for a sustainable bioeconomy by converting waste streams into value added products to improve production and efficiency in the sustainable use of resources treated sewage sludge remains waste until it is actually placed in the ground and must be treated and applied by the bodies designated by law to do so the spanish regulation decree aaa 1072 2013 on the use of sewage sludge in agriculture does not consider that mps from sewage sludge can accumulate on agricultural land therefore studies are needed to confirm the existence of these particles in these soils typically once the sludge samples are being dried sieved separated by density and filtered they are finally visualised through the electron microscopy followed by fourier transform infrared ft ir analysis the aim of this study is to propose an h2o2 enzyme battery protocol as an alternative for the extraction of mps from a reference sludge doped with a mixture of the most common polymers previously identified in wwtps this protocol was established in comparison with three other existing protocols all applied to a real sludge from a local wwtp in order to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed protocol 2 materials and methods considering that there is no standardised method for the analysis of mps we present here the methods used in previous research for the recovery and identification of mps in sewage sludge matrices the most commonly used methods by the authors can be classified in the following order a digestion of organic matter om b flotation c filtration a as a part of sample processing the organic remnants stuck to mps obstruct visual identification and the need for digestion varies depending on the quantity of biological waste in every sample up to 99 om hurley et al 14 as seen on the previous studies they have cited om digestion protocols by using fenton s reagent heated at 75 c within a short time frame 15 or only h2o2 in a process referred to as wet peroxidation 9 16 where mostly the plastic fragments remain unchanged or likely being slightly compressed after wet peroxidation in the other hand several authors 17 19 reported that the om h2o2 exposure time as well as the incubation temperature helped the process to get rid of the majority of organic matter recovering so the maximum of mps cole et al 20 there are some researches carried out over but by using an acidic digestion 21 24 the time when others performed an alkaline attack instead 8 25 28 löder et al 28 combined a surfactant sds followed by enzymes mixture and finished with a double h2o2 exposure b to reduce the weight of the mp particles and separate them by density from intrusive ones different salt saturated solutions can be used to collect the supernatants for further filtration such as nacl 1 2 g cm 3 which is often used for floating and elutriation since is inexpensive and environmentally friendly with high reagent grades and is recommended by noaa 29 c after the density is being done it comes the filtration phase which requires high levels of cleanliness and attention afterward the supernatants are kept in the separation funnels 30 for 24 h can be versed on different types of filters table 1 the most common method for analysing mps in solid samples e g 14 employs an om removal procedure followed by density separation to isolate microplastic particles based on the review of the existing literature 8 20 28 32 35 37 41 45 in this study three main protocols for the removal of om from complex and organic rich environmental samples have been tested using different digestion agents based on the literature along with the proposed protocol all protocols were executed over the same matrix of reference sludge doped with virgin polymers for two mp sizes that predominate in sludge f1 100 ϕ 500 μm and f2 500 μm ϕ 5000 μm 2 1 preparation of doped sludge to check the possible influence of mp particle size in the sludge extraction process two tests have undertaken as for the mp doped sludge matrices with different sizes f1 and f2 a reference sludge ielab 0301 enriched with particles of pp pet and nylon purchased from sigma aldrich germany was used so that the mps were representative in terms of the real shapes presented in sludge the mps were previously ground sieved through stainless steel meshes for each size and characterized physically then optically using an optical carl zeiss axio imager m1m stereomicroscope at 10 magnification equipped with infinity analyze software package for each test two damp mixtures of sludge in addition to mps with a digital magnetic stirrer from ovan were applied f1 f2 tests 30 g dw of sludge 0 01 g of each polymer previously sieved each protocol was prepared in triplicate and controlled by blanks the same weight of mps with reagents without sludge a control sample was also made for each size same weight of mps without reagents nor sludge to verify the effect of the reagents on virgin mps the dye rose bengal was applied directly to the polymers previously retained on f1 and f2 kept in weighing scoops and emptied with ultrapure water on the filters the dyed filters were then photographed at led using the optical microscopy 2 2 comparison of protocols 2 g of wet sludge were used for each protocol prepared in triplicate with both f1 and f2 right after the om removal the preparations triplicates were subjected to a density separation ahead of the filtration a schematic illustration elucidating the experimental protocols is provided in fig 1 2 2 1 om removal 2 2 1 1 protocol 1 p1 using a modified procedure adapted from cole et al 20 where each sample was disrupted mechanically via ultrasonication sonics vibra cell the sludge sample was afterword incubated in 30 ml of h2o2 30 to digest the om for 8 h at 50 c and 20 rpm later additional h2o2 was added to react overnight owing to bleaching character while heating 38 each sample was held to stirring thereafter 6 ml of hcl 96 were added at 50 c for 30 min and then 60 c during the next 30 min the subsequent rise in temperature was to shorten the reaction limit by affecting directly the enthalpy of the reaction the hcl addition was carried out in a fume hood and the beaker was uncovered to fully release the hcl 2 2 1 2 protocol 2 p2 an n hexane trial was implemented since shim et al 35 picked it as a suitable solvent for the staining condition consequently similar to protocol 1 the sample went through ultrasonication h2o2 30 was used for 8 h at 50 c and 20 rpm checked hourly to boost hydroxyl radicals the beaker was kept under stirring until the 6 ml of n hexane 95 is being completely evaporated at 65 c heated for 1 h 2 2 1 3 protocol 3 p3 the sample was exposed to 5 ml of hemicellulase from aspergillus niger sigma aldrich germany at 50 c and kept under slight stirring for 24 h h2o2 20 ml 30 was added at a mild temperature of 30 c all the undesirable material was filtered through the sieve corresponding to the sample with f1 and f2 treated separately and rinsed with a large volume of ultrapure water the retained material was rinsed back into the sample beaker the addition of 5 ml of hemicellulase was repeated to ensure a better decomposition of remaining cellulose a final overnight oxidation step using h2o2 was beneficial to bleach the material left in the beaker 38 the end of the effervescence confirmed the total removal of om the density separation could be excluded in this case 2 2 1 4 protocol 4 p4 according to the protocol with a large sequence of enzymes 26 28 the sludge sample was treated with 60 ml of sds vwr chemicals european commission as a surfactant prior to digestion exposed at 50 c due to sds the sample became foamy each following incubation phase required 24 h of interaction with coverage and stirring and every used enzyme contributed gently to solubilising one biological component α amylase 5 ml from bacillus sp sigma aldrich was added at 50 c with stirring at 20 rpm next the supernatant was exposed to 5 ml of hemicellulase at 50 c and stirring at 20 rpm h2o2 was then applied 20 ml 30 the rich fraction of broken saccharide bonds cellulose and lichenin was drained through the sieve with abundant rinsing f1 and f2 at this point in the investigation based on the work of löder et al 28 and mintenig et al 26 we opted for an aloe vera leaf gel which has been promoted for its antifungal activity the seeked layer was the mucilaginous gel consisted of 99 5 water and 0 5 enzymes 46 in conjunction with the above our sample was exposed to 2 ml of aloe vera gel to wrap the range of mps and bind them to settle separately as an upper array with a dim glow due to their viscous surface thereafter 5 ml of chitinase incubation phase was selected based on the protocol of löder et al 28 and mintenig et al 26 chitinase was extracted from natural rice according to doukani 47 as described in the supplementary data it is evident that none of the mps remains susceptible to overlapping dense substances throughout the digestion which enter the focus sieve directly for density separation the lower aqueous phase remaining in the beaker was drained and the walls of the beaker were thoroughly rinsed to return all particles cleanly to the beaker 2 2 2 flotation after the om digestion have subsided the lability of the polymer granular aggregate retrieval became clear the condition to be met is to select a non instigating salt solution to the particle shape change hence by adopting nuelle et al 18 0 05 m nai beaker we manage to induce buoyancy of the mps all over the up cited protocols in front of covering and incubating for 24 48 h 2 2 3 filtration as a consequence of the distinct existing filters the used ones initially were acetate plus discs 47 mmø 0 8 μm whatman this type was chosen to be the as a tailored filter that led to mp entrapment a cellulose nitrate membrane filter 45 mmø 0 8 μm sartorius in an uneven comparison was not successful because of its coarseness even when collecting it with a pair of tweezers and storing it in a petri dish it might become permanently chapped thereby affecting the integrity of the mps filtration by a pc membrane 47 mmø 0 8 μm isopore as an alternative by reason of its transparent nature was smoothly ideal and innocuous to gather mps for easy visualisation other authors have deemed it suited to retain even glass fibres 39 for this reason the pc membrane was used over all our protocols instead of acetate plus with prevention of the onset of filter blackening by dint of the nai absorbed all supernatants were then dropped on the filters and get dried for 2 h at 40 c 2 3 identification and characterisation of extracted mps the filters with the trapped mps were microscopically examined the polymer features were identified with ft ir spectroscopy using a perkinelmer spectrum 100 ft ir spectrometer 48 49 the measuring parameters for the micro transmission mode were as follows 50 μm spot 16 scans resolution of 4 cm 1 spectral range of 4000 650 cm 1 using spectrum software and by comparing with standard spectra in the library set only matches with a search score of 0 7 were admitted 50 2 4 quality control to have a maximum likelihood estimation of airborne microfibres or any possible background plastic contamination laboratory blanks i e negative controls were included in all steps of sample processing placed as empty beakers alongside the beakers containing actual samples and processed using the same methodology used for the sludge samples other preventive measures that were maintained included rinsing all glassware three times with ultrapure water before use as well as working under laminar flow hood cleaning all equipment with 96 alcohol throughout the process whence the microscopic examination of controls showed no evidence of suspected contamination 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of reagents on polymeric particles to verify possible effects of the reagents on the structure of the virgin polymers in the different protocols the mp particles were quantified in the blanks mps with reagents without sludge 1 2 3 or 4 are blanks referring to their corresponding protocol respectively the samples controls mps without reagents have been settled to check the reagents medium effect upon the quantification of mps it gives a total of 496 particles blanks besides 142 particles controls accordingly the control sample contained more pet than pp and finally nylon 3 1 1 physicals changes fig 2 shows the micrograph 10 images of selected plastic particles before left and after right treatment for both f1 and f2 small pitting in the surfaces of pp and pet was observed because they were previously ground as mentioned in the methodology it is noticed that the applied reagents did not affect the irregularities of particles but it seems that the optical stereomicroscope revealed a soiling of their surfaces in b2 this effect was pronounced in the sludge tests p1 and p2 compared to p3 and p4 which cleaned the particles better hence the effect of hemicellulase combined with peroxide p3 and enzyme succession p4 had a greater cleaning effect on mps which positions them as better protocols 3 1 2 particle count table 2 a shows the number of particles quantified for each polymer in each of the protocols for both fractions f1 and f2 together with the controls quantification so that the evaluation criteria were based on the number of particles before and after the experiments as mass concentration alone did not give a change using these data the percentages of each polymer type in the total number b percent abundance were determined to calculate the standard deviation c compared to the corresponding control resulting in the efficiency of each type based on the lower percentage deviations the most efficient protocol was chosen as it is closer to the percentage of particles to be found in the controls all tested protocols have shown the percentage deviation within each polymers type which means that no protocol identified as 100 of the reference polymers by fraction size and unleashing through the smallest one f1 where the blanks 1 2 and 4 identified particles that were not present intruders other than the reference polymers that might be caused not just by doped mps reagents intolerance but even if the reagents were mps tolerated the energy of activation might be impeded with steric hindrance too seeing the high molecular weight of polymers as occurred in the study of al azzawi et al 16 when doping pet subjected to a koh protocol this interference did not occur in b3 which also well quantified pp and pet standard deviation 0 although nylon has not been accurately identified similar to 14 when asserting the severe oxidative effect 30 in the polymer structure in what concerns the major fraction f2 b4 again picked out four main particles butyl stearate bromoheptadecane vinylidene chloride and l glyceraldehyde exogenous form with respect to f1 it is believed that the reagents used have altered the structures of the polymers which become more accessible to the biomaterials due to their chemical environment thus interfering with the ft ir spectrum 51 nevertheless their standard deviation was close to the control values 1 0 9 b3 presented a distribution quite similar to what found in the control hence it showed the highest standard deviations 33 0 9 14 6 5 a particular case occurred with nylon for f1 where b1 identified a similar nylon percentage as to the control sample and the absorbance peaks resembled the nylons in the spectral library nylon 6 polycaprolactam nylon 6 6 nylon 6 9 nylon 6 12 etc the blank samples of the other protocols 2 3 and 4 obtained worse extraction percentages than b1 in contrast no protocol was able to quantify the appropriate particle count for nylon in the major fraction f2 with all of these protocols underestimating and obtaining worse results in terms of their standard deviations better results were harvested for the particles pp and pet especially in the minor fraction f1 as they were quantified with 30 2 9 40 3 8 especially for b3 deviations of 0 in the major fraction f2 pp was better identified as in p3 while p4 gave better results for pet to summarize the effect of the different reagents on the mps it turns out that p3 only identifies the polymers used with a higher precision than the other protocols while p4 given its veracity it is preferable to discard it furthermore pet and pp in that order were the best identified polymers coinciding with the distribution percentage of the blanks in b2 b3 and b4 except for b1 where pp predominated and finally nylon p3 was the method that gave the best results for identifying these three polymers to endorse the efficiency of the different protocols 24 spiked sludge samples were subjected to the four protocols on this basis it was verifiedthatp3 was still the most efficient for the detection quantification and identification of mps 3 2 microplastic extraction efficiency from doped sludge samples fig 3 shows the results of the percentages of the mps analysed in each protocol for both fractions f1 and f2 3 2 1 p1 the order of mp abundance in protocol 1 was pp pet nylon others the f1 particles were quantified more accurately than the larger f2 particles for example the recovery percentage of pet matched that of the blank in the small sized particles for f2 on the other hand the slightly compressed pet particles when viewed microscopically strongly degraded into free radical polymerization induced ethylene 52 53 and catalytically born toluene under the milder conditions of the hot hcl used 54 this kind of pet clumping also occurred in the study by karami et al 23 furthermore the presence of butyl stearate confirmed the ineffectiveness of p1 in the om clean up p1 overestimated pp quantification for both sizes and underestimated nylon although surprisingly it retained the aliphatic nature of nylon 6 polycaprolactam as well as contributed intrusive particles 3 2 2 p2 a good percentage distribution of polymers was observed in the blank and control results pet pp nylon but an overestimation of pp was observed for the doped sludge sample the rest in both fractions the values were significantly underestimated 27 8 33 27 6 11 11 15 14 3 2 31 with p doped pet particles and polyacetylene due to possible polymerization in hexane 55 nylon was split into diaminohexane monomers under the action of the polymer hydrolysis and a neomenthol diastereomer as another component of the polymer gel matrix which could be used as an auxiliary solution in an amount of 0 15 by weight 56 as well as being an intrusive component others moreover the worst values were again for f2 it is suggested that the aliphatic nature of nylon not only has been conserved but also has jumped to nylon 11 polyundecanamide and may be confused with pp which has been overestimated as the chemical process affecting mps can alter its spectral properties 57 58 leading to complex spectra 59 60 3 2 3 p3 under p3 all polymer types showed good recoveries both for the blanks and for the sludge percentage polymer distribution similar to the control 42 8 49 38 2 83 16 11 31 with some limitations for the larger fraction a slight loss of nylon mean of 17 for f2 should not be overlooked otherwise the h2o2 enzyme protocol alone exceeded expectations compared to the other protocols as it did not contribute to the formation of components other than the pioneers p3 was the most effective om remover and the natural reference nylon preservative details of the protocol and the blank and control recovery rates set can be found in supplementary data fig 1 3 2 4 p4 the efficiency of this protocol has already been questioned because the sequence of the enzymes altered the particle spectra and thwarted identification with ft ir spectroscopy 59 60 although this protocol was applied to doped sludge it quantified the percentage of pp and pet more satisfactorily compared to the blank with better results for the smallest fraction in contrast the major fraction overestimated pp and underestimated pet associated with its decomposition into vdc 1 1 dichloroethylene which can form a peroxide in the presence of air or oxygen 61 furthermore the aliphatic nature of nylon deteriorated on many occasions when the undergoing thermal properties is not being held to the correct pitch 14 62 63 in addition the protocol again identified four intrusive components nylon was again difficult to detect lower recovery percentages of the three polymers as also revealed by the blank method confirming that the reagents themselves can vary the structures of the infrared spectra 14 according to the results p1 was the smallest fraction 31 of the items analysed pet and is the predominant fraction in the analysis of wastewater and sewage sludge 41 64 this reveals the importance of this study even with the overestimation of pp and the misidentification of nylon besides p2 in sludge exhibited the poorest results with a 3 nylon extraction and pet 28 lower than their respective blanks again it is believed that the contamination on the surface of the particles exposed to p1 and p2 caused scattering of the reflected infrared light therefore ft ir detection was unattainable 19 65 furthermore polymer speciation results were more relevant after p3 without penetrating polymers in contrast to p4 where there were intruders 3 2 5 spectral changes the main objective of the spectral study was to show the morphological and chemical properties of the extracted mps post treatment the pp spectra of f1 and f2 were right in phase with the reference spectrum all particles were successfully matched with a satisfactory hit quality index of 0 96 all subsamples exhibited high intensities in f1 and f2 and clearly identified pet slight changes were observed in nylon spectra due to the vibrational frequencies of its variant aliphatic forms 66 for f1 p1 generated a third order peak at 2868 cm 1 possibly associated with variations in the polymer structure of the virgin pp the lowest intensity belonged to p2 the bands at 1167 and 997 cm 1 corresponding to ch bending in comparison with the pp control as a result of the ease of bending ch more likely than stretching or compressing frequencies were not seen in the b1 b2 and p2 spectra in the major fraction p1 gave lesser spectral sensitivity with both peaks at 808 and 899 cm 1 related to b1 indicating the presence of stretching vibrations p2 altered the ft ir spectra in the range 1500 1560 cm 1 probably due to the development of a white outer layer throughout pp in contrast b2 with the highest intensity revealed that all functional characteristic groups were much better conserved p3 and b3 in both fractions reliably were in line with the control spectra whereas the p4 spectra in both fractions was consistent but in b4 of the smallest fraction some peaks in the fingerprint region have appeared 14 60 the main characteristics of the pet bands were all in phase with the control particularly for p4 only p2 in both fractions showed an anomaly at wavelengths of 1032 and 1026 cm 1 assigned to co stretching 67 the peaks of nylon in f1 were identical to those of the control especially p3 and p1 b2 with the lowest intensity showed fewer overlapping component peaks as also found in the study by tagg et al 19 which maybe attributed to the probable mixture of biogenic matter and non organic debris on the pc filter otherwise the nylon peaks in f2 were wider than the control peaks in the fingerprint region due to the presence of hydrogen bonding in the structure unusual vibrations were shown for p2 corresponded to an absorption band at 1743 cm 1 and carbonyl stretching at 1709 cm 1 68 unexpected carbonyl group formation in b4 was also detected denoting that the nylon has been oxidized or even deteriorated 69 it can be concluded that p1 retained less of the pp polymer structure in both fractions compared to the other protocols which was consistent with b1 f1 and f2 but relevant to the identification of similar nylon to the control p2 responded poorly in f1 and altered the pp and nylon spectra in f2 p3 gave reasonable response spectra for pp pet and nylon in both fractions p4 showed undesirable peaks for nylon identification in agreement with its blank otherwise it largely retained the structure of pet to test the different protocols with real sludge samples were taken from a wastewater treatment plant in the province as test media 3 3 application of protocols to real sludge 3 3 1 study site the wwtp is located in prado del rey cádiz spain with an inlet flow rate of 9119 h e and a design population of 6 770 h e this wwtp takes in charge a primary and a secondary treatments ultraviolet disinfection and chlorination with a surface area of 49 km2 and a population density of 123 4 inhabitants km2 with geographical coordinates of 36 47 n and 5 33 w as schematically provided in the map fig 4 3 3 2 pre treatment sludge sampling was performed in april 2019 prior to sample processing each 2 g of sludge was passed through f1 and f2 to assure split homogeneity within two separated subsamples since the last inspections indicated that they are the most contaminated and common fractions to get rid of a likely contamination the sieves with trapped particles were immediately transferred to 50 ml beakers and stored negative controls were opted during all steps of sample processing to ensure quality 3 3 3 data analysis mps with various shapes in the sludge samples were microscopically observed and categorized as fragments spheres filaments flakes and fibres by xu et al 70 fig 5 the most preponderant observed mp forms were fibres and fragments followed by filaments and flakes after the visual evaluation the particle typology was derived by ft ir spectroscopy due to the large number of subsamples 240 particles were randomly selected and examined where 37 were plastics accounting for 62 consisting of nine types of plastics they were poly vinyl stearate pvs pp pet polyvinyl chloride pvc nylon poly cyclohexanedimethylene terephthalate pct poly butylene terephthalate pbt poly butyl methacrylate pbma and high density polyethylene hdpe the fragments mostly made up of pp pet pvc and pct probably derived from packaging clothing and wire rope the fibres were mainly nylon while the flakes were pbma and hdpe which may have come from pipe sealing it is suspected that pvs filament yarns are liberated from cutlery the efficiency of the protocols used in preparing sludge samples for mp analysis is shown in fig 6 p1 and p2 presented joint hdpe pp and pct in f1 p2 outperformed p1 in detecting pct otherwise in f2 p1confirmed pvc and pet instead of only hdpe and is the only detector of pbt p1 and p2 in f1 detected 29 biogenics belonging to food derivatives l glyceraldehyde in unnatural form and hormones cis androsterone and juvenile hormone which were discarded because we were more interested in the polymeric speciation p3 identified more mps and represented the target polymers of this study pp pet and nylon with a satisfactory search result although p1 checked pet and p2 detected pct hdpe better than p3 opposed to p4 which detected only two particles through f1 and f2 hence it is suggested that the range loss of mps was extended 4 conclusion for the all blanks and the four triplicates of doped real sludge samples tested in this study only one benchmark extraction protocol was suitable to obtain a conceivable mp overview while noting that the methods were tested with spiked samples and the risk of missing mps during microscopic visualisation prior to ft ir identification was high this investigation led to the following conclusions 1 compared to the control tests all protocols in doped sludge detected the highest percentage of pet followed by pp and finally nylon p1 and p2 resulted in damage and finally the eventual destruction of pet and nylon the polymer speciation results after p3 were more relevant without intruding polymers than the other protocols as with p4 the sequence of enzymes interfered with the particle spectra and made identification with ft ir spectroscopy tougher 2 chemical analysis measuring vibrational excitation was considered as an additional benefit of our experimental approach to this type of mp hazard study 3 all protocols in real sludge gave different reported results p1 detected six plastic types versus p2 with three matched types as given hdpe pp pct plus cellulosic biopolymer p3 detected three more plastic types compared to p1 and p2 but it did not cause any physical or spectral changes conversely to these latter thus p4 could have been met if the enzymes that are supposed to be used were timeframe reasonable and economically accessible 4 mp recuperation with p3 based on hemicellulase and h2o2 was more efficient there was no large fluctuation in mp number nor interference caused by the reaction reagents thus the optimal extraction method for mps in sewage sludge is suggested to be digested with hemicellulase at 50 c followed by bleaching with h2o2 conclusively in the short run it is recommended to optimize the p3 so as to claim a faster and

13257,per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are among the most recalcitrant chemicals ever manufactured and are associated with substantial global environmental challenges pfas removal performance of granular activated carbon gac and ion exchange resin ix was evaluated and compared using a segmented column system with full scale media under continuous flow conditions results from the pfas breakthrough analysis established via column operation under different empty bed contact times ebcts was used to characterize the mass transfer zone mtz of multiple pfass and evaluate optimum ebcts for gac and ix treatment the height of the mtz corresponded to pfas chain length and functional group where the poorly removed short chain perfluoro carboxylic acids exhibited the longest mtz elongated pfas mtzs justified longer ebcts required for treatment of short chain pfaas compared to long chain pfaas for gac and ix in addition a cost sensitivity analysis was employed to demonstrate how unit media cost changeout frequency and treatment goal feasibility dictated annual operation and maintenance o m costs associated with gac and ix installations ix was found to the most cost effective adsorbent for the removal of long and short chain pfass compared to gac results from the cost analysis indicated that adsorbent selection was the most critical factor dictating treatment cost with marginal impact from unit media cost or expected changeout frequency graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pfas adsorption activated carbon ion exchange cost analysis 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass have gained considerable attention due to their occurrence and persistence in the environment recalcitrance in treatment systems and probable negative toxicological impacts 1 4 the discharge of pfas for more than 50 years from commercial and industrial applications in the form of carpet treatments packaging apparel oil production and aqueous film forming foam afff has led to occurrence of pfas in water supplies across the county at concentrations ranging from ng l to μg l levels 2 5 9 pfass consist of a broad group of highly persistent and soluble contaminants that are highly stable and resistant to environmental degradation due to strong cf bonds in their chemical structure 2 10 12 the most notable class of pfass are perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas which are often described as either short chained pfaas c6 for sulfonic acids c8 for carboxylic acids or long chained pfaas c6 for sulfonic acids c8 for carboxylic acids 13 15 long chain pfaas are associated with potential adverse health effects from human exposure which has resulted in the united states environmental protection agency u s epa implementing a health advisory limit of 70 ng l for perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa combined 16 19 historical use of pfoa and pfos in afff formulations and manufacturing has led to widespread occurrence in the environment and driven chemical manufacturers to switch to short chain alternative pfaas in the last twenty years 3 18 20 21 as research continues in establishing the abundance and toxicological impacts of short chain pfaa contamination evaluating treatment of short chain compounds is critical with regulations emerging at the state level 15 22 24 pfas contaminated sites and source waters are often complex with various pfaas present short chain vs long chain as well as disparate environmental conditions including background water constituents such as natural organic matter and co contaminants that may impact treatment efficacy 25 27 these factors combined with everchanging pfas treatment goals set at increasingly lower concentrations has resulted in substantial challenges for effective pfas treatment adsorption technologies such as granular activated carbon gac and ion exchange resin ix have emerged as easily accessible and effective methods for the removal of pfaas at low levels of contamination 7 28 32 past research has demonstrated that gac is effective at removing long chain pfas but is less effective for short chain pfas 29 33 34 despite the rapid breakthrough of short chain pfas by gac ease of operation low unit media cost and consistent pfas and co contaminant adsorption has resulted in gac being one of the most commonly implemented technologies for the treatment of pfaa contaminated groundwater 35 36 ix has recently been touted as a superior adsorbent over gac for pfaa removal due to ix regeneration capabilities greater effectiveness in removing short chain pfaas and overall higher sorption capacity relative to gac 6 11 28 29 although gac and ix have emerged as leading technologies for pfas treatment there is a lack of direct gac and ix treatment comparisons using data generated from continuous flow column systems column studies that utilize full scale media may better represent full scale breakthrough performance due to similarities in operating conditions such as sorbent size water quality and empty bed contact time ebct 26 37 38 however continuous flow column systems are constrained by cost and time typically exhibit longer breakthrough periods larger system footprints and higher water requirements compared to batch experiments 14 26 long term column tests are needed to generate pfas treatability data and calculate adsorption capacities of gac and ix for long and short chain pfaas to evaluate treatment longevity and cost a major objective for the implementation of adsorbent technologies is to improve system longevity which can be accomplished by refining system operation and media selection one of the most important parameters in the design of adsorption systems is ebct which has been previously shown to impact pfaa removal 39 40 however studies related to the influence of ebct on adsorption performance have been either restricted to small scale tests with ground gac or lack discussion connecting pfaa chain length and functional group to ebct dependent adsorption lead lag adsorption system configurations i e two contactors in series are often instituted to extend ebct thereby providing additional treatment capacity to protect against premature breakthrough and achieve higher adsorbent utilization within each column 41 reducing the ebct of an adsorption contactor system has been shown to negatively impact removal performance for various micropollutants particularly those with slow adsorption kinetics and large mass transfer zones mtz while previous work has discussed how an elongated mtz beyond the length of the column results in the rapid breakthrough of micropollutants including pfas the authors are not aware of any studies which have calculated the discrete height of the mtz for pfas in gac and ix system 39 42 the potential impact of ebct and mtz height on adsorption capacity are manifested in treatment cost i e poor adsorbent utilization from short ebcts or high capital cost from long ebcts an understanding of the impact of operating conditions such as ebct and the fundamental adsorption boundaries of the mtz is critical to improving treatment longevity and reducing treatment costs associated with gac and ix treatment although adsorption capacity is one of the most common justifications for media selection in academic literature treatment cost is likely the deciding factor in media selection in technology adoption and there is dearth of cost comparisons between gac and ix for pfaa treatment comparison of treatment costs for adsorption systems is difficult as the adsorption capacity calculations that dictate changeout frequency and therefore treatment cost are often constrained by system conditions such as water quality and pfaa concentration despite these challenges employing treatment cost as a method of media selection may become even more important as long chain legacy pfaas namely pfos and pfoa are phased out and replaced with short chain pfaas thereby changing treatment targets and media selection criteria 20 43 44 the authors are not aware of any previous studies investigating the impact of ebct and cost on the treatment of long and short chain pfaas using gac and ix in continuous flow column study with full scale media the objective of this study was to utilize gac and ix in a continuous flow column system containing full scale media to derive the adsorption capacity of each adsorbent for short and long chain pfaas the impact of ebct on pfaa adsorption was investigated by operating multiple columns in series to determine how operating conditions dictate the treatment capabilities of gac and ix adsorption capacity values were compiled into a cost analysis to calculate annual treatment cost using gac and ix based on various treatment targets 2 materials and methods 2 1 bench scale column system a system consisting of six columns each 91 cm 3 ft tall and 2 5 cm 1 in in diameter for a total column volume of 0 46 l was constructed according to fig 1 and operated in downflow configuration to assess the impact of ebct on treatment columns were separated into three 1 ft segments with sampling ports between each segment columns were loaded with dry media so that the ebct through any single gac column was 3 min and through any single ix column was 1 min thus totaling 9 min of ebct for three columns in series filled with gac and a total of 3 min of ebct for three columns in series filled with ix fig 1 the gac bed depth in a single column segment was 27 cm while the ix bed depth in a single column segment was 10 cm during operation a constant flow of 46 ml min through each column was maintained via constant head reservoir fed by a 946 l 250 gal tank connected to a pump which fed the reservoir 2 2 activated carbons and ion exchange resins prior to use the gac product f400 calgon carbon corporation pittsburgh pa was rinsed with deionized water and aerated before being oven dried at 120 c for 24 h after drying the gac was sieved no 200 to remove fines before being loaded into the columns calres 2301 a macroporus strong base anion exchange resin in cl form was obtained

5300 dv perkinelmer fremont ca 2 4 source waters operation of the column system consumed nearly 132 l 35 gals of contaminated water per day which required the preparation of simulated afff impacted water on a weekly basis batches of pfas contaminated water were made using dechlorinated using sodium metabisulfite tap water spiked with afff in a 946 l 250 gals storage tank selected water quality parameters for the synthetic water including organic carbon content and ionic constituents are summarized in table 1 influent pfaa concentrations were measured approximately twice per month over the 18 month experiment and are summarized by the average pfaa concentration with standard deviation n 33 shown in table 2 with pfos pfhxs and pfbs representing the dominant pfaas while concentrations of pfaas in the synthetic water were higher than typically found in groundwater 47 48 these concentrations are consistent with water collected in close proximity to fire fighting training areas or military bases that have historically employed pfos based afff formulations 49 51 2 5 cost analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed to compare operation and maintenance o m cost for gac and ix installations to evaluate treatment cost to 10 or 50 breakthrough as dependent on media selection and treatment goals o m costs were derived using influent pfaa concentrations table 2 and the calculated adsorption capacity for that pfaa at 10 breakthrough were used to develop a yearly changeout frequency based on media usage rate the number of changeout events in a year were used to determine the yearly media mobilization and disposal costs annual o m cost components included unit media costs based on changeout frequency mobilization fees and disposal and analytical costs and were calculated from information gathered from a variety of sources including unit cost models from the us epa and industry partners more information of the cost analysis inputs is provided in the sd

represented by c c0 for individual pfaas was tracked as a function of water treated for individual gac and ix column segments in addition individual pfaa influent and effluent concentrations were measured for each column segment to calculate adsorption capacity μg pfaa adsorbed per g adsorbent using eq 1 at specific c c0 thresholds to compare the effectiveness of each adsorbent and assess impact of ebct on performance 1 pfaa influent t pfaa effluent t mass adsorbent adsorption capacity was selected as a comparison metric to normalize the adsorption performance of gac and ix for each pfaa as performance may be biased in other metrics due to differences in the size of the bed volumes in gac and ix columns 3 results and discussion 3 1 effectiveness of gac and ix for removal of long chain pfaas 3 1 1 long chain pfaa removal by gac and ix is chain length and functional group dependent the breakthrough of pfhxs pfoa and pfos with gac operated at 3 6 and 9 min of ebct and with ix at 1 2 and 3 min of ebct as a function of adsorption capacity are provided in fig 2 the primary difference between gac and ix is exemplified by the treatment of long chain pfaas where ix substantially outperformed gac based on adsorption capacity and subsequent levels of breakthrough contributions of multiple removal mechanisms such as hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions facilitate the higher pfas adsorption capacities observed for ix while the adsorption capacity of gac is driven primarily by hydrophobic interactions 7 36 52 pfoa removal observed during ix treatment was substantially lower than removal of pfhxs or pfos these findings are in agreement with other studies which have observed better removal efficiency of long chain pfsas relative to long chain pfcas by ix adsorption under continuous flow operating conditions 11 38 the level of electrostatic interaction associated with the functional group sulfonic versus carboxylic group of the pfaa has been shown to influence the substantially higher adsorption capacity of sulfonates relative to carboxylates for ix resin 11 38 chain length dependent breakthrough was also observed in both gac and ix treatment as evidenced by higher c c0 breakthrough values at lower adsorption capacities seen for pfhxs compared to pfos 100 pfhxs breakthrough was observed for gac at roughly 175 μg g capacity while only 50 pfos breakthrough for gac occurred much later at approximately 900 μg g breakthrough as a function of pfaa chain length has been discussed in literature and is explained by the lower solubility stronger hydrophobic interactions and competitive sorption affects associated with longer chain length pfaas 3 9 13 53 54 higher adsorption capacities for ix as well as the chain length and functional group dependent breakthrough for both adsorbents are consistent with the findings in other gac and ix studies 44 53 55 the ix and gac products employed in this study were among the highest performing products in their respective adsorbent classes as demonstrated in previous adsorbent screening studies 37 52 observed variability in breakthrough behavior fig 2 is likely the result of minor experimental and analytical error associated with operation of the column system and sample analysis over 18 months the adsorption capacities of pfaas with gac and ix treatment observed in fig 2 were generally higher than those reported in other continuous flow column studies which describe capacity values in the low μg g range 11 37 higher adsorption capacity values reported in this study may be due to the lack of competing adsorbates in the spiked drinking water matrix coupled with the high influent pfas concentration dominated by long chain pfsas previous work from mccleaf et al 38 stated that prolonged loading of pfaas onto gac and ix at capacity values into the tens of micrograms pfaa per gram adsorbent range may result in agglomeration of long chain pfaas on the adsorbent surface which can facilitate greater removal capacity with more hydrophobic adsorption sites for pfas attachment gac and ix pfaa adsorption effectiveness quantified in this study is expected to be different than for the treatment of more complex water matrices with higher concentrations of doc and anions competing for adsorption sites 3 1 2 impact of ebct on treatment of long chain pfaas by gac and ix a regression model was employed to fit breakthrough curves and calculate the mass adsorbed of each pfaa by each column segment at 10 breakthrough c c0 the 10 threshold served as the breakpoint in consideration of an idealized breakthrough profile where beyond the 10 c c0 value there is an exponential increase in the effluent concentration and potential for unsatisfactory effluent water quality 56 the mass adsorbed at 10 breakthrough for pfoa pfhxs and pfos are shown in fig 3 it should be noted that although the 10 breakthrough for pfos was not achieved in the 2nd and 3rd ix column segments the 10 breakthrough value extrapolated from the regression approach was still employed for comparison the mass of pfoa pfhxs and pfos adsorbed by gac as shown in fig 3 increased substantially as ebct increased from 3 to 6 min while a smaller incremental increase was observed as ebct was extended to 9 min the mass of pfhxs adsorbed after 6 min of gac contact time was 3 more than the mass adsorbed after 3 min of ebct this 3 increase in mass adsorbed resulting from a doubled media depth indicates that the height of mtz extends beyond the bed depth of a single column segment the improved performance of pfhxs adsorption is related to the containment of the mtz within 2 column segments 6 min ebct compared to the diminished performance of a single column segment 3 min ebct with a partially contained mtz the development of the mtz through multiple segments was identified in the comparison of ebcts where adsorbent loading was highest and the incremental gain in the mass of pfas adsorbed between segments was maximized an evaluation of mtz focusing on the 90 and 10 breakthrough values for pfoa and pfhxs on gac is provided in sd the mtz extended beyond the bed depth of the first gac segment where 3 min of ebct proved to be insufficient for the diffusion of the larger pfaas into the pore structure of the gac the mtz heights for pfoa and pfhxs were measured to be approximately 33 cm and 29 cm respectively which are both greater than the media depth in the first column segment high gac adsorption affinity for pfos inhibited a mtz characterization due to its inability to reach 90 breakthrough for pfos in all three gac segments however previous work investigating other contaminants highlighted the pivotal role of influent concentration in connection to adsorption capacity where a higher concentration gradient can result in higher adsorbent saturation rates with a increasing mass transfer driving force 57 60 this suggests that pfos will have the shortest mtz as a due to its relatively dominant influent concentration and high adsorption affinity the mtz height for all pfaas reaching 90 breakthrough in each gac ix segment is listed in table s3 and s4 similar to the adsorption performance observed for gac a substantial increase in the mass of long chain pfaas i e pfoa pfhxs adsorbed was observed for ix as ebct was increased from 1 to 2 min a further increase in ebct did not result in a comparable improvement in removal performance the reduced adsorption efficacy observed for long chain pfaas by ix at 1 min of ebct relative to longer ebcts may be due to the mtz not being contained within a single column segment which was observed for the gac columns the height of the mtz for the long chain pfaas studied including pfos was not calculated for the ix columns as 90 breakthrough threshold was not met due to high sorption affinity overall these results suggest that 6 min ebct for gac along with 2 min ebct for ix are the minimum contact time required in achieving effective long chain pfas adsorption longer ebct exceeding 6 min for gac and 2 min for ix may still be required to meet treatment thresholds for other pfaas 3 2 effectiveness of gac and ix for removal of short chain pfaas 3 2 1 short chain pfaa removal by gac and ix is chain length and functional group dependent the removal of short chain pfaas by gac and ix tracked through the three columns segments is shown by breakthrough curves as a function of adsorption capacity in fig 4 breakthrough curves presented in fig 4 indicate lower gac and ix adsorption capacities for short chain pfaas relative to the long chain pfaas fig 2 fig 4 also illustrates the differences in adsorption performance between pfsas and pfcas for gac and ix as both adsorbents demonstrated better removal of the 3 chain pfprs than the 7 chain pfhpa pfhpa was adsorbed less readily than the 6 chain pfhxa which is consistent with results reported in liu et al 37 this deviation from chain length dependent breakthrough was likely attributed to the roughly 3 5 greater initial concentration of pfhxa relative to pfhpa as previously stated a lower influent concentration can reduce adsorption capacity due to a lower mass transfer driving force as confirmed in the treatment of long chain pfaas the overall adsorption performance of ix was higher than that of gac ix demonstrated considerably less removal of the short chain pfcas pfpea pfhxa pfhpa compared to the removal of pfsas with equal or shorter chain lengths while less pronounced compared to ix gac exhibited declining capacities for short chain pfcas as depicted in figs 2 and 4 differences in the adsorption capacity 1 order of magnitude for gac and ix adsorption of long and short chain pfaas may significantly impact overall treatment cost capital and o m cost when changeout frequency is influenced by breakthrough of short chain pfaas section 3 3 3 2 2 impact of ebct on treatment of short chain pfaas by gac and ix in addition to performance discrepancies in adsorption of short chain pfsas and pfcas optimizing the ebct for ix and gac systems is a challenging task typically short chain pfaas are not the primary treatment target due to lower relative abundance in the environment and bioaccumulation potential compared to long chain pfaas 15 36 therefore there is limited knowledge of how adsorption capacity of individual short chain pfaa is impacted by ebct 11 39 40 61 the presented data in fig 5 shows the mass of short chain pfaas adsorbed as a function of ebct at 10 breakthrough using same regression approach summarized in section 3 1 unlike the adsorption performance demonstrated for long chain pfaas gac is ineffective in adsorption of short chain pfaas at ebcts less than 9 min with the extension of ebct from 6 to 9 min for gac there was an increase in the mass of short chain pfsa adsorbed the increased ebct resulted in an improvement of pfprs and pfpes adsorption by more than 3 5 folds removal of short chain pfcas by gac was also inefficient after 3 and 6 min of ebct this behavior may be related to a combination of factors including an elongated mtz and competing adsorbates such as long chain pfsas which are present in much higher concentrations and more readily adsorbed the average height of the mtz in the gac column for short chain pfcas was calculated at 44 cm si section 2 6 this height is approximately 33 greater than the height of the mtz calculated for gac treatment of pfoa given a gac column bed depth of 27 cm the mtz of short chain pfcas would extend to approximately 1 5 bed depths resulting in relatively fast breakthrough for 6 min of ebct as a result of the elongated mtz to the 1 5 bed depths the majority of short chain pfca mass absorbed in the system occurred after 6 min of ebct differences in hydrophobicity between long and short chain pfaas are reflected in the mtz height with shorter mtzs for more hydrophobic long chain pfaas and longer mtzs for more hydrophilic short chain pfaas in addition competitive adsorbates with high adsorption affinity long chain pfaas can displace short chain pfaas thereby elongating the mtz the velocity of the mtz for each pfaa is a function of adsorption strength 62 hydrophilic short chain pfaas move faster through the adsorbent bed to reach unsaturated layers creating a longer mtz only to be displaced when stronger adsorbing pfas reach the same layers 62 63 overlapping mtzs for numerous pfaas is suspected due to the dynamics of a multi solute adsorption system creating challenges in determining breakthrough time and adsorption capacity for short chain pfaas characterization of the mtz in ix treatment was more challenging with higher adsorption affinity for short chain pfaas conclusive trends related to the height of the mtz in the adsorption of short chain pfaas by ix were not identified due to high ix adsorption performance in the treatment of pfhxa pfhpa pfprs pfbs and pfpes however mtz calculations were computed for the adsorption of pfpea as it was the only pfaa to reach the 90 breakthrough threshold in all segments of ix the height of the mtz for pfpea was calculated to be approximately 18 cm in height which is almost two full 10 cm bed depths despite the absence of mtz calculations for ix treatment of a broader collection of short chain pfaas it is expected that an ebct of 3 min is effective for short chain pfaa removal with the mtz of the poorest adsorbing short chain pfaa contained within the 30 cm of total ix bed depth it can be inferred that other short chain pfaas which are more readily adsorbed will have shorter mtzs and also be contained within 3 min of ebct in comparison of the mass adsorbed for each short chain pfaa as a function of ebct fig 5 3 min ebct resulted in the highest incremental increase in mass adsorbed for all short chain pfaas except pfhpa between each of the ebcts tested it is important to note that while gac adsorbed a higher total mass of pfpea and pfhpa relative to ix the capacity of gac for these pfaas was still lower than ix due to differences in the mass of adsorbent loaded into each column i e higher mass of gac in each column segment than ix adsorption of short chain pfsas by ix was superior to gac as 3 min of ebct with ix adsorbed more mass of pfprs pfbs and pfpes than 9 min of ebct with gac additional research is needed to determine if further extension of ebct may promote the treatment of short chain pfaas by gac and ix longer mtzs for short chain pfaas in gac and ix systems indicates that additional lag vessels and increased ebct can elongate breakthrough time and maximize adsorption 3 3 cost analysis comparison of gac and ix in the remediation of pfas contaminated water supplies the adsorption capacity of gac and ix is a proxy for media changeout frequency and therefore operating costs influent pfaa concentrations and calculated adsorption capacity values presented in previous sections were used to inform a costing analysis to evaluate the sensitivity of treatment variables such as adsorbent selection unit media cost and changeout frequency on the computed costs of treatment ebcts of 9 and 3 min were used to calculate the cost of gac and ix respectively these ebcts were chosen based on results from section 3 2 which suggest that sufficient short and long chain pfas removal with gac and ix corresponds to ebcts of at least 9 min for gac and 3 min for ix a summary of the o m cost for gac and ix treatment installations using the performance data shown in table s1 in the sd results of the cost sensitivity analysis are presented in fig 6a to demonstrate how unit media cost and changeout frequency contribute to the levelized media cost cost per unit volume of water produced for gac and ix treatment selection in a 3 8 106 l day 1 mgd design flow scenario in the calculation of costs provided in fig 6a media changeout corresponds to the predicted adsorption capacity at 10 breakthrough of pfoa fig 6b shows how different treatment targets 10 or 50 breakthrough of either pfhxa or pfoa and changing adsorption performance dictate the levelized o m cost of each media selection breakthrough of either pfhxa or pfoa were selected as treatment goals representing changeout based on short chain pfaas and long chain pfaas respectively pfoa and pfhxa signify long and short chain pfaas which have national regulatory interest while also being less readily adsorbed than other pfaas pfos pfbs in the same structure subclass 24 64 65 a short chain pfaa breakthrough threshold of 50 was selected to account for differences in adsorption affinity in the present study as well as short chain pfaa half lives and environmental quality standards 66 67 inspection of the specific components of o m cost for gac and ix treatment indicates that replacement media cost is the dominant contributor of o m cost table s2 replacement media cost for gac and ix is related to unit media cost in kg as well as changeout frequency and can be considered a surrogate for adsorption capacity according to calculations pfaa treatment by ix has roughly 16 fold longer changeout period than gac and is at least 20 less expensive given by levelized media cost at all unit price points evaluated relative to average performing gac which requires roughly a changeout every other month fig 6a however there are scenarios in which gac was shown to be a more cost effective than ix a breakeven point scenario between gac and ix would require an increase in gac performance by 25 to achieve fewer changeouts or a decrease in unit cost to less than 2 75 kg coupled with a decline in ix performance or a subsequent increase in ix unit cost to greater than 20 35 kg this cost analysis indicates that for both ix and gac levelized media costs are more sensitive to changeout frequency function of adsorption capacity than unit media cost and therefore in the scenario described above ix with higher adsorption capacity was the more cost effective adsorbent while average unit media costs for ix were calculated to be 6 5 times more expensive than gac the adsorption capacity of ix for pfoa was nearly 10 fold higher which dictated the large disparity in levelized media cost regardless of unit price in addition to unit media price changes in treatment goals were also analyzed relative to o m costs fig 6b shows how different treatment goals e g 10 50 breakthrough of short or long chain pfaas affects the levelized o m cost m3 of gac and ix adsorption systems unit costs for gac and ix assumed in fig 6b were 2 75 kg and 17 60 kg respectively as was consistent unit cost estimates provided by franke et al 68 cost curves in fig 6b indicate that ix is a more cost effective treatment option for short and long chain treatment targets the diminished adsorption capacity for pfhxa relative to pfoa for both gac and ix is expressed in the higher levelized o m cost for 10 breakthrough short chain treatment goals this increased cost is due to more frequent changeouts of gac and ix expected for the treatment of short chain pfaas the substantial increase in cost incurred for changeout based on 10 breakthrough of short chain pfaas suggests that higher allowable effluent levels for short chain pfaas may be appropriate given the difficulty in removing short chain pfaas relative to long chain pfaas a 3rd pair of lines convey this alternative treatment standard where a treatment goal with a 50 breakthrough threshold has a more comparable cost to a long chain treatment goal a capacity scaled treatment target for short chain pfaas seems to have gained early popularity with a few states adopting short chain pfaa guidelines which are 10 or more times higher than long chain limits for example minnesota has adopted a pfbs standard of 2000 ng l which is more than 100 higher than the 15 ng l pfos standard 69 some of the limitations of the sensitivity approach used to calculate costs in fig 6 are tied to the two factors that appear to be least influential in o m cost spent media disposal and analytical costs table s1 future iterations of the cost analysis may have disposal and analytical costs play a bigger role in cost analyses as impending regulations increase testing requirements and restrict disposal of spent material in municipal landfills disposal options are currently not well developed for spent pfas adsorbents such as gac and ix which are typically stockpiled at landfills for disposal 70 cost calculations presented in fig 6 are expected to be water type dependent and determining the cost of treating more complex water types with high levels of doc and anions is an area of active research another factor that was not considered in media selection was the treatment capacity of gac for other contaminants of concern compared to a more pfaa selective ix product which may influence treatment decisions at co contaminated sites 3 4 conclusion results from this study suggest that treatment longevity for short chain pfaa treatment by gac and ix may require ebcts beyond 9 and 3 min respectively through additional lag vessels or larger media beds depending on treatment goals maintaining low levels of short chain pfaas breakthrough can be challenging with substantially lower adsorption capacity from gac and ix for short chain pfaas compared to long chain pfaas the rapid short chain pfaa breakthrough in gac and ix applications should be reflected in treatment goals long vs short chain to avoid high changeout frequency with respect to these treatment limitations full scale units will need to be configured with more redundancy to create longer ebcts and provide insurance against rapid short chain pfca breakthrough 11 61 given the performance deficiencies for both adsorbents in the treatment of pfcas and short chain pfaas regions with contaminated water supplies dominated by these pfaas types should expect higher adsorbent media changeout frequency if short chain pfaas are targeted in future regulatory framework while changing regulatory targets may increase the annual treatment cost consideration of results presented in section 3 3 reveals that ix is more cost effective than gac in meeting short and long chain treatment targets another driver of annual o m costs for pfas treatment is media selection where it was demonstrated that achieving fewer changeouts or purchasing low cost gac product may not offset the higher adsorption capacity of ix as contaminated water supplies continued to be discovered optimization of mature adsorption technologies such as gac and ix for the treatment of complex water sources is critical step in driving down the cost of pfas remediation declaration of competing

13257,per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are among the most recalcitrant chemicals ever manufactured and are associated with substantial global environmental challenges pfas removal performance of granular activated carbon gac and ion exchange resin ix was evaluated and compared using a segmented column system with full scale media under continuous flow conditions results from the pfas breakthrough analysis established via column operation under different empty bed contact times ebcts was used to characterize the mass transfer zone mtz of multiple pfass and evaluate optimum ebcts for gac and ix treatment the height of the mtz corresponded to pfas chain length and functional group where the poorly removed short chain perfluoro carboxylic acids exhibited the longest mtz elongated pfas mtzs justified longer ebcts required for treatment of short chain pfaas compared to long chain pfaas for gac and ix in addition a cost sensitivity analysis was employed to demonstrate how unit media cost changeout frequency and treatment goal feasibility dictated annual operation and maintenance o m costs associated with gac and ix installations ix was found to the most cost effective adsorbent for the removal of long and short chain pfass compared to gac results from the cost analysis indicated that adsorbent selection was the most critical factor dictating treatment cost with marginal impact from unit media cost or expected changeout frequency graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pfas adsorption activated carbon ion exchange cost analysis 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass have gained considerable attention due to their occurrence and persistence in the environment recalcitrance in treatment systems and probable negative toxicological impacts 1 4 the discharge of pfas for more than 50 years from commercial and industrial applications in the form of carpet treatments packaging apparel oil production and aqueous film forming foam afff has led to occurrence of pfas in water supplies across the county at concentrations ranging from ng l to μg l levels 2 5 9 pfass consist of a broad group of highly persistent and soluble contaminants that are highly stable and resistant to environmental degradation due to strong cf bonds in their chemical structure 2 10 12 the most notable class of pfass are perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas which are often described as either short chained pfaas c6 for sulfonic acids c8 for carboxylic acids or long chained pfaas c6 for sulfonic acids c8 for carboxylic acids 13 15 long chain pfaas are associated with potential adverse health effects from human exposure which has resulted in the united states environmental protection agency u s epa implementing a health advisory limit of 70 ng l for perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa combined 16 19 historical use of pfoa and pfos in afff formulations and manufacturing has led to widespread occurrence in the environment and driven chemical manufacturers to switch to short chain alternative pfaas in the last twenty years 3 18 20 21 as research continues in establishing the abundance and toxicological impacts of short chain pfaa contamination evaluating treatment of short chain compounds is critical with regulations emerging at the state level 15 22 24 pfas contaminated sites and source waters are often complex with various pfaas present short chain vs long chain as well as disparate environmental conditions including background water constituents such as natural organic matter and co contaminants that may impact treatment efficacy 25 27 these factors combined with everchanging pfas treatment goals set at increasingly lower concentrations has resulted in substantial challenges for effective pfas treatment adsorption technologies such as granular activated carbon gac and ion exchange resin ix have emerged as easily accessible and effective methods for the removal of pfaas at low levels of contamination 7 28 32 past research has demonstrated that gac is effective at removing long chain pfas but is less effective for short chain pfas 29 33 34 despite the rapid breakthrough of short chain pfas by gac ease of operation low unit media cost and consistent pfas and co contaminant adsorption has resulted in gac being one of the most commonly implemented technologies for the treatment of pfaa contaminated groundwater 35 36 ix has recently been touted as a superior adsorbent over gac for pfaa removal due to ix regeneration capabilities greater effectiveness in removing short chain pfaas and overall higher sorption capacity relative to gac 6 11 28 29 although gac and ix have emerged as leading technologies for pfas treatment there is a lack of direct gac and ix treatment comparisons using data generated from continuous flow column systems column studies that utilize full scale media may better represent full scale breakthrough performance due to similarities in operating conditions such as sorbent size water quality and empty bed contact time ebct 26 37 38 however continuous flow column systems are constrained by cost and time typically exhibit longer breakthrough periods larger system footprints and higher water requirements compared to batch experiments 14 26 long term column tests are needed to generate pfas treatability data and calculate adsorption capacities of gac and ix for long and short chain pfaas to evaluate treatment longevity and cost a major objective for the implementation of adsorbent technologies is to improve system longevity which can be accomplished by refining system operation and media selection one of the most important parameters in the design of adsorption systems is ebct which has been previously shown to impact pfaa removal 39 40 however studies related to the influence of ebct on adsorption performance have been either restricted to small scale tests with ground gac or lack discussion connecting pfaa chain length and functional group to ebct dependent adsorption lead lag adsorption system configurations i e two contactors in series are often instituted to extend ebct thereby providing additional treatment capacity to protect against premature breakthrough and achieve higher adsorbent utilization within each column 41 reducing the ebct of an adsorption contactor system has been shown to negatively impact removal performance for various micropollutants particularly those with slow adsorption kinetics and large mass transfer zones mtz while previous work has discussed how an elongated mtz beyond the length of the column results in the rapid breakthrough of micropollutants including pfas the authors are not aware of any studies which have calculated the discrete height of the mtz for pfas in gac and ix system 39 42 the potential impact of ebct and mtz height on adsorption capacity are manifested in treatment cost i e poor adsorbent utilization from short ebcts or high capital cost from long ebcts an understanding of the impact of operating conditions such as ebct and the fundamental adsorption boundaries of the mtz is critical to improving treatment longevity and reducing treatment costs associated with gac and ix treatment although adsorption capacity is one of the most common justifications for media selection in academic literature treatment cost is likely the deciding factor in media selection in technology adoption and there is dearth of cost comparisons between gac and ix for pfaa treatment comparison of treatment costs for adsorption systems is difficult as the adsorption capacity calculations that dictate changeout frequency and therefore treatment cost are often constrained by system conditions such as water quality and pfaa concentration despite these challenges employing treatment cost as a method of media selection may become even more important as long chain legacy pfaas namely pfos and pfoa are phased out and replaced with short chain pfaas thereby changing treatment targets and media selection criteria 20 43 44 the authors are not aware of any previous studies investigating the impact of ebct and cost on the treatment of long and short chain pfaas using gac and ix in continuous flow column study with full scale media the objective of this study was to utilize gac and ix in a continuous flow column system containing full scale media to derive the adsorption capacity of each adsorbent for short and long chain pfaas the impact of ebct on pfaa adsorption was investigated by operating multiple columns in series to determine how operating conditions dictate the treatment capabilities of gac and ix adsorption capacity values were compiled into a cost analysis to calculate annual treatment cost using gac and ix based on various treatment targets 2 materials and methods 2 1 bench scale column system a system consisting of six columns each 91 cm 3 ft tall and 2 5 cm 1 in in diameter for a total column volume of 0 46 l was constructed according to fig 1 and operated in downflow configuration to assess the impact of ebct on treatment columns were separated into three 1 ft segments with sampling ports between each segment columns were loaded with dry media so that the ebct through any single gac column was 3 min and through any single ix column was 1 min thus totaling 9 min of ebct for three columns in series filled with gac and a total of 3 min of ebct for three columns in series filled with ix fig 1 the gac bed depth in a single column segment was 27 cm while the ix bed depth in a single column segment was 10 cm during operation a constant flow of 46 ml min through each column was maintained via constant head reservoir fed by a 946 l 250 gal tank connected to a pump which fed the reservoir 2 2 activated carbons and ion exchange resins prior to use the gac product f400 calgon carbon corporation pittsburgh pa was rinsed with deionized water and aerated before being oven dried at 120 c for 24 h after drying the gac was sieved no 200 to remove fines before being loaded into the columns calres 2301 a macroporus strong base anion exchange resin in cl form was obtained

5300 dv perkinelmer fremont ca 2 4 source waters operation of the column system consumed nearly 132 l 35 gals of contaminated water per day which required the preparation of simulated afff impacted water on a weekly basis batches of pfas contaminated water were made using dechlorinated using sodium metabisulfite tap water spiked with afff in a 946 l 250 gals storage tank selected water quality parameters for the synthetic water including organic carbon content and ionic constituents are summarized in table 1 influent pfaa concentrations were measured approximately twice per month over the 18 month experiment and are summarized by the average pfaa concentration with standard deviation n 33 shown in table 2 with pfos pfhxs and pfbs representing the dominant pfaas while concentrations of pfaas in the synthetic water were higher than typically found in groundwater 47 48 these concentrations are consistent with water collected in close proximity to fire fighting training areas or military bases that have historically employed pfos based afff formulations 49 51 2 5 cost analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed to compare operation and maintenance o m cost for gac and ix installations to evaluate treatment cost to 10 or 50 breakthrough as dependent on media selection and treatment goals o m costs were derived using influent pfaa concentrations table 2 and the calculated adsorption capacity for that pfaa at 10 breakthrough were used to develop a yearly changeout frequency based on media usage rate the number of changeout events in a year were used to determine the yearly media mobilization and disposal costs annual o m cost components included unit media costs based on changeout frequency mobilization fees and disposal and analytical costs and were calculated from information gathered from a variety of sources including unit cost models from the us epa and industry partners more information of the cost analysis inputs is provided in the sd the cost calculations presented in this study correspond to a retrofitted 3 78 106 l day 1mgd drinking water treatment plant 2 6 derivation of performance comparison metrics pfaa breakthrough data represented by c c0 for individual pfaas was tracked as a function of water treated for individual gac and ix column segments in addition individual pfaa influent and effluent concentrations were measured for each column segment to calculate adsorption capacity μg pfaa adsorbed per g adsorbent using eq 1 at specific c c0 thresholds to compare the effectiveness of each adsorbent and assess impact of ebct on performance 1 pfaa influent t pfaa effluent t mass adsorbent adsorption capacity was selected as a comparison metric to normalize the adsorption performance of gac and ix for each pfaa as performance may be biased in other metrics due to differences in the size of the bed volumes in gac and ix columns 3 results and discussion 3 1 effectiveness of gac and ix for removal of long chain pfaas 3 1 1 long chain pfaa removal by gac and ix is chain length and functional group dependent the breakthrough of pfhxs pfoa and pfos with gac operated at 3 6 and 9 min of ebct and with ix at 1 2 and 3 min of ebct as a function of adsorption capacity are provided in fig 2 the primary difference between gac and ix is exemplified by the treatment of long chain pfaas where ix substantially outperformed gac based on adsorption capacity and subsequent levels of breakthrough contributions of multiple removal mechanisms such as hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions facilitate the higher pfas adsorption capacities observed for ix while the adsorption capacity of gac is driven primarily by hydrophobic interactions 7 36 52 pfoa removal observed during ix treatment was substantially lower than removal of pfhxs or pfos these findings are in agreement with other studies which have observed better removal efficiency of long chain pfsas relative to long chain pfcas by ix adsorption under continuous flow operating conditions 11 38 the level of electrostatic interaction associated with the functional group sulfonic versus carboxylic group of the pfaa has been shown to influence the substantially higher adsorption capacity of sulfonates relative to carboxylates for ix resin 11 38 chain length dependent breakthrough was also observed in both gac and ix treatment as evidenced by higher c c0 breakthrough values at lower adsorption capacities seen for pfhxs compared to pfos 100 pfhxs breakthrough was observed for gac at roughly 175 μg g capacity while only 50 pfos breakthrough for gac occurred much later at approximately 900 μg g breakthrough as a function of pfaa chain length has been discussed in literature and is explained by the lower solubility stronger hydrophobic interactions and competitive sorption affects associated with longer chain length pfaas 3 9 13 53 54 higher adsorption capacities for ix as well as the chain length and functional group dependent breakthrough for both adsorbents are consistent with the findings in other gac and ix studies 44 53 55 the ix and gac products employed in this study were among the highest performing products in their respective adsorbent classes as demonstrated in previous adsorbent screening studies 37 52 observed variability in breakthrough behavior fig 2 is likely the result of minor experimental and analytical error associated with operation of the column system and sample analysis over 18 months the adsorption capacities of pfaas with gac and ix treatment observed in fig 2 were generally higher than those reported in other continuous flow column studies which describe capacity values in the low μg g range 11 37 higher adsorption capacity values reported in this study may be due to the lack of competing adsorbates in the spiked drinking water matrix coupled with the high influent pfas concentration dominated by long chain pfsas previous work from mccleaf et al 38 stated that prolonged loading of pfaas onto gac and ix at capacity values into the tens of micrograms pfaa per gram adsorbent range may result in agglomeration of long chain pfaas on the adsorbent surface which can facilitate greater removal capacity with more hydrophobic adsorption sites for pfas attachment gac and ix pfaa adsorption effectiveness quantified in this study is expected to be different than for the treatment of more complex water matrices with higher concentrations of doc and anions competing for adsorption sites 3 1 2 impact of ebct on treatment of long chain pfaas by gac and ix a regression model was employed to fit breakthrough curves and calculate the mass adsorbed of each pfaa by each column segment at 10 breakthrough c c0 the 10 threshold served as the breakpoint in consideration of an idealized breakthrough profile where beyond the 10 c c0 value there is an exponential increase in the effluent concentration and potential for unsatisfactory effluent water quality 56 the mass adsorbed at 10 breakthrough for pfoa pfhxs and pfos are shown in fig 3 it should be noted that although the 10 breakthrough for pfos was not achieved in the 2nd and 3rd ix column segments the 10 breakthrough value extrapolated from the regression approach was still employed for comparison the mass of pfoa pfhxs and pfos adsorbed by gac as shown in fig 3 increased substantially as ebct increased from 3 to 6 min while a smaller incremental increase was observed as ebct was extended to 9 min the mass of pfhxs adsorbed after 6 min of gac contact time was 3 more than the mass adsorbed after 3 min of ebct this 3 increase in mass adsorbed resulting from a doubled media depth indicates that the height of mtz extends beyond the bed depth of a single column segment the improved performance of pfhxs adsorption is related to the containment of the mtz within 2 column segments 6 min ebct compared to the diminished performance of a single column segment 3 min ebct with a partially contained mtz the development of the mtz through multiple segments was identified in the comparison of ebcts where adsorbent loading was highest and the incremental gain in the mass of pfas adsorbed between segments was maximized an evaluation of mtz focusing on the 90 and 10 breakthrough values for pfoa and pfhxs on gac is provided in sd the mtz extended beyond the bed depth of the first gac segment where 3 min of ebct proved to be insufficient for the diffusion of the larger pfaas into the pore structure of the gac the mtz heights for pfoa and pfhxs were measured to be approximately 33 cm and 29 cm respectively which are both greater than the media depth in the first column segment high gac adsorption affinity for pfos inhibited a mtz characterization due to its inability to reach 90 breakthrough for pfos in all three gac segments however previous work investigating other contaminants highlighted the pivotal role of influent concentration in connection to adsorption capacity where a higher concentration gradient can result in higher adsorbent saturation rates with a increasing mass transfer driving force 57 60 this suggests that pfos will have the shortest mtz as a due to its relatively dominant influent concentration and high adsorption affinity the mtz height for all pfaas reaching 90 breakthrough in each gac ix segment is listed in table s3 and s4 similar to the adsorption performance observed for gac a substantial increase in the mass of long chain pfaas i e pfoa pfhxs adsorbed was observed for ix as ebct was increased from 1 to 2 min a further increase in ebct did not result in a comparable improvement in removal performance the reduced adsorption efficacy observed for long chain pfaas by ix at 1 min of ebct relative to longer ebcts may be due to the mtz not being contained within a single column segment which was observed for the gac columns the height of the mtz for the long chain pfaas studied including pfos was not calculated for the ix columns as 90 breakthrough threshold was not met due to high sorption affinity overall these results suggest that 6 min ebct for gac along with 2 min ebct for ix are the minimum contact time required in achieving effective long chain pfas adsorption longer ebct exceeding 6 min for gac and 2 min for ix may still be required to meet treatment thresholds for other pfaas 3 2 effectiveness of gac and ix for removal of short chain pfaas 3 2 1 short chain pfaa removal by gac and ix is chain length and functional group dependent the removal of short chain pfaas by gac and ix tracked through the three columns segments is shown by breakthrough curves as a function of adsorption capacity in fig 4 breakthrough curves presented in fig 4 indicate lower gac and ix adsorption capacities for short chain pfaas relative to the long chain pfaas fig 2 fig 4 also illustrates the differences in adsorption performance between pfsas and pfcas for gac and ix as both adsorbents demonstrated better removal of the 3 chain pfprs than the 7 chain pfhpa pfhpa was adsorbed less readily than the 6 chain pfhxa which is consistent with results reported in liu et al 37 this deviation from chain length dependent breakthrough was likely attributed to the roughly 3 5 greater initial concentration of pfhxa relative to pfhpa as previously stated a lower influent concentration can reduce adsorption capacity due to a lower mass transfer driving force as confirmed in the treatment of long chain pfaas the overall adsorption performance of ix was higher than that of gac ix demonstrated considerably less removal of the short chain pfcas pfpea pfhxa pfhpa compared to the removal of pfsas with equal or shorter chain lengths while less pronounced compared to ix gac exhibited declining capacities for short chain pfcas as depicted in figs 2 and 4 differences in the adsorption capacity 1 order of magnitude for gac and ix adsorption of long and short chain pfaas may significantly impact overall treatment cost capital and o m cost when changeout frequency is influenced by breakthrough of short chain pfaas section 3 3 3 2 2 impact of ebct on treatment of short chain pfaas by gac and ix in addition to performance discrepancies in adsorption of short chain pfsas and pfcas optimizing the ebct for ix and gac systems is a challenging task typically short chain pfaas are not the primary treatment target due to lower relative abundance in the environment and bioaccumulation potential compared to long chain pfaas 15 36 therefore there is limited knowledge of how adsorption capacity of individual short chain pfaa is impacted by ebct 11 39 40 61 the presented data in fig 5 shows the mass of short chain pfaas adsorbed as a function of ebct at 10 breakthrough using same regression approach summarized in section 3 1 unlike the adsorption performance demonstrated for long chain pfaas gac is ineffective in adsorption of short chain pfaas at ebcts less than 9 min with the extension of ebct from 6 to 9 min for gac there was an increase in the mass of short chain pfsa adsorbed the increased ebct resulted in an improvement of pfprs and pfpes adsorption by more than 3 5 folds removal of short chain pfcas by gac was also inefficient after 3 and 6 min of ebct this behavior may be related to a combination of factors including an elongated mtz and competing adsorbates such as long chain pfsas which are present in much higher concentrations and more readily adsorbed the average height of the mtz in the gac column for short chain pfcas was calculated at 44 cm si section 2 6 this height is approximately 33 greater than the height of the mtz calculated for gac treatment of pfoa given a gac column bed depth of 27 cm the mtz of short chain pfcas would extend to approximately 1 5 bed depths resulting in relatively fast breakthrough for 6 min of ebct as a result of the elongated mtz to the 1 5 bed depths the majority of short chain pfca mass absorbed in the system occurred after 6 min of ebct differences in hydrophobicity between long and short chain pfaas are reflected in the mtz height with shorter mtzs for more hydrophobic long chain pfaas and longer mtzs for more hydrophilic short chain pfaas in addition competitive adsorbates with high adsorption affinity long chain pfaas can displace short chain pfaas thereby elongating the mtz the velocity of the mtz for each pfaa is a function of adsorption strength 62 hydrophilic short chain pfaas move faster through the adsorbent bed to reach unsaturated layers creating a longer mtz only to be displaced when stronger adsorbing pfas reach the same layers 62 63 overlapping mtzs for numerous pfaas is suspected due to the dynamics of a multi solute adsorption system creating challenges in determining breakthrough time and adsorption capacity for short chain pfaas characterization of the mtz in ix treatment was more challenging with higher adsorption affinity for short chain pfaas conclusive trends related to the height of the mtz in the adsorption of short chain pfaas by ix were not identified due to high ix adsorption performance in the treatment of pfhxa pfhpa pfprs pfbs and pfpes however mtz calculations were computed for the adsorption of pfpea as it was the only pfaa to reach the 90 breakthrough threshold in all segments of ix the height of the mtz for pfpea was calculated to be approximately 18 cm in height which is almost two full 10 cm bed depths despite the absence of mtz calculations for ix treatment of a broader collection of short chain pfaas it is expected that an ebct of 3 min is effective for short chain pfaa removal with the mtz of the poorest adsorbing short chain pfaa contained within the 30 cm of total ix bed depth it can be inferred that other short chain pfaas which are more readily adsorbed will have shorter mtzs and also be contained within 3 min of ebct in comparison of the mass adsorbed for each short chain pfaa as a function of ebct fig 5 3 min ebct resulted in the highest incremental increase in mass adsorbed for all short chain pfaas except pfhpa between each of the ebcts tested it is important to note that while gac adsorbed a higher total mass of pfpea and pfhpa relative to ix the capacity of gac for these pfaas was still lower than ix due to differences in the mass of adsorbent loaded into each column i e higher mass of gac in each column segment than ix adsorption of short chain pfsas by ix was superior to gac as 3 min of ebct with ix adsorbed more mass of pfprs pfbs and pfpes than 9 min of ebct with gac additional research is needed to determine if further extension of ebct may promote the treatment of short chain pfaas by gac and ix longer mtzs for short chain pfaas in gac and ix systems indicates that additional lag vessels and increased ebct can elongate breakthrough time and maximize adsorption 3 3 cost analysis comparison of gac and ix in the remediation of pfas contaminated water supplies the adsorption capacity of gac and ix is a proxy for media changeout frequency and therefore operating costs influent pfaa concentrations and calculated adsorption capacity values presented in previous sections were used to inform a costing analysis to evaluate the sensitivity of treatment variables such as adsorbent selection unit media cost and changeout frequency on the computed costs of treatment ebcts of 9 and 3 min were used to calculate the cost of gac and ix respectively these ebcts were chosen based on results from section 3 2 which suggest that sufficient short and long chain pfas removal with gac and ix corresponds to ebcts of at least 9 min for gac and 3 min for ix a summary of the o m cost for gac and ix treatment installations using the performance data shown in table s1 in the sd results of the cost sensitivity analysis are presented in fig 6a to demonstrate how unit media cost and changeout frequency contribute to the levelized media cost cost per unit volume of water produced for gac and ix treatment selection in a 3 8 106 l day 1 mgd design flow scenario in the calculation of costs provided in fig 6a media changeout corresponds to the predicted adsorption capacity at 10 breakthrough of pfoa fig 6b shows how different treatment targets 10 or 50 breakthrough of either pfhxa or pfoa and changing adsorption performance dictate the levelized o m cost of each media selection breakthrough of either pfhxa or pfoa were selected as treatment goals representing changeout based on short chain pfaas and long chain pfaas respectively pfoa and pfhxa signify long and short chain pfaas which have national regulatory interest while also being less readily adsorbed than other pfaas pfos pfbs in the same structure subclass 24 64 65 a short chain pfaa breakthrough threshold of 50 was selected to account for differences in adsorption affinity in the present study as well as short chain pfaa half lives and environmental quality standards 66 67 inspection of the specific components of o m cost for gac and ix treatment indicates that replacement media cost is the dominant contributor of o m cost table s2 replacement media cost for gac and ix is related to unit media cost in kg as well as changeout frequency and can be considered a surrogate for adsorption capacity according to calculations pfaa treatment by ix has roughly 16 fold longer changeout period than gac and is at least 20 less expensive given by levelized media cost at all unit price points evaluated relative to average performing gac which requires roughly a changeout every other month fig 6a however there are scenarios in which gac was shown to be a more cost effective than ix a breakeven point scenario between gac and ix would require an increase in gac performance by 25 to achieve fewer changeouts or a decrease in unit cost to less than 2 75 kg coupled with a decline in ix performance or a subsequent increase in ix unit cost to greater than 20 35 kg this cost analysis indicates that for both ix and gac levelized media costs are more sensitive to changeout frequency function of adsorption capacity than unit media cost and therefore in the scenario described above ix with higher adsorption capacity was the more cost effective adsorbent while average unit media costs for ix were calculated to be 6 5 times more expensive than gac the adsorption capacity of ix for pfoa was nearly 10 fold higher which dictated the large disparity in levelized media cost regardless of unit price in addition to unit media price changes in treatment goals were also analyzed relative to o m costs fig 6b shows how different treatment goals e g 10 50 breakthrough of short or long chain pfaas affects the levelized o m cost m3 of gac and ix adsorption systems unit costs for gac and ix assumed in fig 6b were 2 75 kg and 17 60 kg respectively as was consistent unit cost estimates provided by franke et al 68 cost curves in fig 6b indicate that ix is a more cost effective treatment option for short and long chain treatment targets the diminished adsorption capacity for pfhxa relative to pfoa for both gac and ix is expressed in the higher levelized o m cost for 10 breakthrough short chain treatment goals this increased cost is due to more frequent changeouts of gac and ix expected for the treatment of short chain pfaas the substantial increase in cost incurred for changeout based on 10 breakthrough of short chain pfaas suggests that higher allowable effluent levels for short chain pfaas may be appropriate given the difficulty in removing short chain pfaas relative to long chain pfaas a 3rd pair of lines convey this alternative treatment standard where a treatment goal with a 50 breakthrough threshold has a more comparable cost to a long chain treatment goal a capacity scaled treatment target for short chain pfaas seems to have gained early popularity with a few states adopting short chain pfaa guidelines which are 10 or more times higher than long chain limits for example minnesota has adopted a pfbs standard of 2000 ng l which is more than 100 higher than the 15 ng l pfos standard 69 some of the limitations of the sensitivity approach used to calculate costs in fig 6 are tied to the two factors that appear to be least influential in o m cost spent media disposal and analytical costs table s1 future iterations of the cost analysis may have disposal and analytical costs play a bigger role in cost analyses as impending regulations increase testing requirements and restrict disposal of spent material in municipal landfills disposal options are currently not well developed for spent pfas adsorbents such as gac and ix which are typically stockpiled at landfills for disposal 70 cost calculations presented in fig 6 are expected to be water type dependent and determining the cost of treating more complex water types with high levels of doc and anions is an area of active research another factor that was not considered in media selection was the treatment capacity of gac for other contaminants of concern compared to a more pfaa selective ix product which may influence treatment decisions at co contaminated sites 3 4 conclusion results from this study suggest that treatment longevity for short chain pfaa treatment by gac and ix may require ebcts beyond 9 and 3 min respectively through additional lag vessels or larger media beds depending on treatment goals maintaining low levels of short chain pfaas breakthrough can be challenging with substantially lower adsorption capacity from gac and ix for short chain pfaas compared to long chain pfaas the rapid short chain pfaa breakthrough in gac and ix applications should be reflected in treatment goals long vs short chain to avoid high changeout frequency with respect to these treatment limitations full scale units will need to be configured with more redundancy to create longer ebcts and provide insurance against rapid short chain pfca breakthrough 11 61 given the performance deficiencies for both adsorbents in the treatment of pfcas and short chain pfaas regions with contaminated water supplies dominated by these pfaas types should expect higher adsorbent media changeout frequency if short chain pfaas are targeted in future regulatory framework while changing regulatory targets may increase the annual treatment cost consideration of results presented in section 3 3 reveals that ix is more cost effective than gac in meeting short and long chain treatment targets another driver of annual o m costs for pfas treatment is media selection where it was demonstrated that achieving fewer changeouts or purchasing low cost gac product may not offset the higher adsorption capacity of ix as contaminated water supplies continued to be discovered optimization of mature adsorption technologies such as gac and ix for the treatment of complex water sources is critical step in driving down the cost of pfas remediation declaration of competing

13258,this work examined the effects of biochar bc and a plastic carrier pc on nitrification of activated sludge as in the presence of antibiotic ciprofloxacin cip it was found that 5 mg l cip significantly inhibited both ammonium and nitrite oxidation by 75 while the addition of pc into a reactor showed no effects on the fate of cip the addition of bc substantially decreased cip concentrations in the reactor thereby significantly reducing the cip mediated inhibition on the nitrification performance 16s rrna gene based community profiling revealed a significant change in the structure of the nitrifying community in the presence of cip while nitrosomonas oligotropha and nitrospira sp were significantly inhibited by cip they recovered with the bc addition batch experiments were performed to determine removal routes of cip in the bc dosed reactor while no significant removal of cip occurred via abiotic routes such as volatilization photolysis and hydrolysis cip was removed primarily by adsorption to bc and co metabolic biodegradation by the nitrifying community the first order removal rate constant of cip was 0 63 d 1 in the nitrifying condition which was increased to 0 86 d 1 with the bc addition overall this study suggests that bc can be a promising additive into environmental bioprocesses for mitigating antibiotic toxicity and enhancing nutrient removal performance in the presence of high antibiotic loads keywords nitrification wastewater treatment activated sludge biochar antibiotic ciprofloxacin 1 introduction excessive levels of nitrogen compounds in natural surface water can lead to eutrophication harmful algal blooms the release of toxins and oxygen depletion full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps thus aim to remove nitrogen compounds from wastewater before discharging the treated wastewater into natural waterways ammonium is the most common nitrogen compound 90 in typical wastewater environments 1 many wwtps treat ammonium using a conventional two step biological nitrogen removal process involving microbial nitrification and denitrification nitrification occurs in aerobic tanks where ammonium is oxidized to nitrate while denitrification involves converting nitrate to nitrogen gas in anoxic tanks the nitrification denitrification process is one of the oldest and most widely used nitrogen treatment options 2 toxic chemical substances in wastewater influents can affect the performance of biological nutrient removal processes nitrification is generally more sensitive to environmental stressors than other ecosystem functions of biological wastewater processes such as denitrification and organic matter removal ciprofloxacin cip is a fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics that has been widely used for several decades in both human and veterinary medicine as a result cip is ubiquitous in many aquatic environments particularly wastewater cip can be found at various levels in wastewater reaching up to 31 mg l 3 in pharmaceutical wastewaters thus greatly exceeding toxicity thresholds e g hundreds of μg l 4 5 many previous studies have reported inhibitory effects of cip on ecosystem functions within biological wastewater treatment systems cip disrupts core heterotrophic members of aerobic activated sludge as thus decreasing overall organic matter removal activity 6 8 cip also interferes with methane production and volatile fatty acid metabolism during anaerobic digestion 9 a wealth of data on the effects of cip on heterotrophic activity is available whereas much less is known about autotrophic nitrification processes while several studies have provided phenotypic descriptions of cip mediated disruptions to nitrifying bioreactors 10 13 toxicity thresholds the degree and type of inhibition phenotypes and the nitrifying organisms subject to inhibition substantially differed between these studies nitrospira an important group of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob is found to be increased in relative abundance upon cip in some studies 11 12 which conflicts with another study showing its decrease with cip 13 this might be because nitrospira consists of two functionally distinct groups one that carries out nitrite oxidation and another that is involved in the complete oxidation of ammonium to nitrate comammox however which nitrospira responds to cip mediated disruption has not been addressed in previous studies in addition ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob are made up of diverse species members that differ significantly in their ammonium catabolic capacity 14 what species are particularly sensitive to cip and how the sensitivity affects the overall nitrification performance remain to be clearly elucidated more importantly while previous studies have primarily focused on the effects and fate of cip in nitrifying bioprocesses there has been little focus on developing a technical means to reduce cip mediated functional disruption this is of great practical significance because nitrification is an essential unit process in many full scale municipal industrial wwtps thus an effective treatment means would offer operational benefits e g enhanced nutrient removal rate and performance stability for wwtps treating high loadings of toxic chemicals this study aimed to elucidate the inhibitory effects of cip on nitrification performance by determining the specific bacterial species populations affected by the inhibitory consequences further the effects of adding a plastic carrier and a biochar additive to the nitrifying bioreactor on nitrification performance were systematically tested biofilm wastewater treatment systems are often associated with enhanced nitrification activity presumably due to the prolonged retention of slow growing nitrifiers a plastic carrier pc is often used in biofilm systems because additional biomass can grow on the surface of the carrier 15 which helps the retention of nitrifiers and increases nitrification biochar bc is a carbon rich material generated from thermal degradation in the absence of oxygen i e pyrolysis while bc has been commonly used as a soil additive to enhance soil fertility and health recent studies have reported the use of bc as a microbial carrier in various water wastewater treatment systems due to its large surface area and porosity 16 to test the effects of the two additives our study established several sets of nitrifying bioreactors with and without the additives time course functional performances of bioreactors associated with nitrogen and cip were monitored over a month in addition batch experiments were performed to provide a mechanistic description of the effects of the additive on controlling the fate of nitrogen and cip 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis was conducted to identify the key nitrifying populations that were strongly inhibited by cip but that recovered with use of the additives overall the present study was designed to provide mechanistic insights into the effects of cip mediated toxicity on nitrifying as and implications for devising a means for treating toxic chemical wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1

mobile phase consisted of 25 mm nah2po4 at a ph of 2 5 in phosphoric acid that was mixed with acetonitrile 82 18 v v volatile suspended solids vss and chemical oxygen demand cod were determined according to the standard methods 17 nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations were determined using a dr 5000 uv vis spectrophotometer following the manufacturer s protocol kaldnes k1 a biofilm carrier made of high density polyethylene 7 mm in length that is widely used in various wastewater treatment systems 15 was used as the pc the bc derived from the mulberry tree was purchased from yougi industry co ltd korea the bc was sieved with a 4 7 mm mesh washed using deionized water and dried in an oven for 24 h at 105 c the bc surface was pretreated to remove debris and impurities using nitric acid for 12 h and neutralized with sodium hydroxide as described in a previous study 7 the specific surface area of bc and pc was about 600 m2 l 7 and 0 5 m2 l 18 respectively 2 2 bioreactor development as inocula were taken from the aeration tank of a local municipal wwtp in gyeonggi province korea four sets of laboratory bioreactors were established by introducing the same as inocula 3 g vss l one reactor set designated as n was operated with the ammonium feed while another nc was operated using the ammonium feed and cip the other two reactors fed with the ammonium feed and cip were dosed with the pc ncpc and bc ncbc respectively at a 30 filling ratio fig s1 the filling ratio was chosen considering a typical range 20 50 of additives in bioreactors 19 the four reactor sets were aerated using air diffusers maintaining dissolved oxygen levels of 3 4 mg l as described previously 20 21 the bioreactors had a 1 l working volume and were operated in sequencing batch mode with a feed cycle of 3 5 days as described previously 22 one feed cycle consisted of four stages 1 filling 10 min 2 reaction almost 3 5 days excluding filling settling and decanting 3 settling 30 min and 4 decanting 10 min after the settling period 0 5 l of clear supernatant was withdrawn and filled with the ammonium feed for n or the cip containing ammonium feed for nc ncpc and ncbc 2 3 assessment of the fate of nitrogen compounds and cip to determine the removal pathways for cip seven experimental conditions abiotic abiotic pc abiotic bc inactive active c active nc and active nc bc were established in batch glass flasks table s1 the abiotic condition had no biomass inoculation or additives while the abiotic pc and abiotic bc conditions contained pc and bc respectively at a 30 filling ratio in addition to the suspended biomass aggregated biomass was observed on the surface of the bc in the ncbc reactor both active nc and active nc bc were inoculated with the combined biomass both suspended and attached taken from the ncbc bioreactor active nc bc was also supplemented with bc 30 filling ratio taken from the ncbc bioreactor and the combined biomass the inactive condition was inoculated with the combined biomass that had been autoclaved active c was supplemented with cip acting as the sole carbon nitrogen and energy source for microbial growth the other six conditions were supplemented with 85 mg l of nh4 n while active c was with no ammonium 5 mg l of cip was added to all glass flasks cip removal rates were calculated using the first order rate constant equation as detailed in 23 to investigate the fate of nitrogen compounds four experimental conditions pcammonium bcammonium bcnitrite and bcnitrate were set up in batch flasks pcammonium and bcammonium were supplemented with the ammonium feed i e 85 mg nh4 n with no nitrite or nitrate supplementation while bcnitrite and bcnitrate were supplemented with nitrite and nitrate respectively instead of ammonium for each condition the three nitrogen species were monitored for a period of 80 h 2 4 16s rrna gene sequence analysis mixed liquor suspension samples from the nc ncbc and n reactors were taken once at steady state reached on day 39 because the ncbc contained both suspended and attached biomass the attached biomass ncbc a was sampled separately from the suspended biomass ncbc s the attached biofilm was detached from the bc surfaces pores using vortexing 30 s followed by sonication 1 min 7 dna extraction from the samples was conducted using a dneasy powersoil kit qiagen carlsbad ca usa the hypervariable v3 v5 region of 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified and subjected to miseq sequencing as previously performed 24 the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequence data were analyzed using a miseq sop pipeline 25 as described previously 24 26 raw reads were pre filtered using the default quality control chimera sequences were excluded using chimera vserach and the remaining sequences were taxonomically classified using classify seqs operational taxonomic units otus were determined using a 97 similarity threshold with opticlust 3 results and discussion 3 1 differential fate of nitrogen compounds and cip in bioreactors four sets of bioreactors inoculated using the same as inocula were set up with the ammonium feed 170 mg l nh4 n resulting in 0 02 kg nh4 n m3 d of ammonium loading rate three sets were fed with cip in addition to the ammonium feed these contained no additives nc bc ncbc or pc ncpc one reactor n which was run in triplicate n1 n2 and n3 was fed with the ammonium feed without cip as a control the n reactors displayed an almost complete ammonium uptake efficiency aue over the entire operation period 98 on average the nc ncbc and ncpc reactors received 1 mg l of cip for the first seven days for which no acute toxicity on the aue was observed the cip influent loading was then increased to 5 mg l from day 7 leading to differences in the nitrification performance of the three cip fed bioreactors effluent nh4 n concentrations in the nc and ncpc reactors rapidly increased to 85 86 mg l at day 11 and eventually to 122 140 mg l at days 28 39 the nh4 n concentrations in the effluent of the ncbc reactor gradually increased from day 18 indicating a longer response time to the increased cip loading and reached 24 31 mg l at days 28 39 much lower than those in the nc and ncpc reactors fig 1 shows the aue and nitrate generation efficiency nge for the four reactors at a steady state days 28 39 it can be observed that 5 mg l cip reduced the aue and nge of the nc and ncpc reactors by 75 76 compared to that of the n reactors representing a significant disruption to both nitritation and nitratation in contrast the reduction 15 16 of the aue and nge in the ncbc reactor was less than the nc and ncpc reactors suggesting the mitigation of the cip perturbations on nitrification performance with the addition of bc the cip removal rate differed between the three cip fed reactors it was highest for the ncbc reactor 89 followed by the ncpc 11 6 and nc 8 2 reactors the reduced levels of cip observed in the effluents of the ncbc reactor fig 1c were associated with its high nitrification performance compared with the nc and ncpc reactors these results implied that the bc likely mitigated cip toxicity in the ncbc reactor resulting in higher nitrification rates in the presence of cip previous studies have documented the inhibitory effects of cip on biological nitrification in different experimental settings 0 35 mg l cip has been found to inhibit ammonium oxidation activity in a submerged biofilter system with pvc carriers 10 the ammonium uptake of as in batch experiments was reduced in the presence of 0 4 10 mg l cip 11 in addition 0 1 5 0 mg l cip was reported to lead to the accumulation of ammonium and nitrite in a sequencing batch reactor suggesting the inhibition of both nitritation and nitratation activities within the suspended microbial community 12 0 2 2 mg l cip had a negative effect on denitrifying activity with a 15 20 reduction in total nitrogen removal 13 though there was no observable toxic effect on nitrifying activity these previous studies have thus documented varying degrees of cip toxicity in relation to nitrification likely due to differences in the environmental conditions between the experiments such as inoculum source growth type e g suspended or attached and reactor configuration in the present study the cip loading had a significant inhibitory effect on both nitritation and nitratation fig 1 but the cip concentration used here 5 mg l exceeded the no effect concentration as high as 2 mg l previously reported in 27 the difference in the nitrification performance between the reactors fig 1 highlighted the need to further investigate the diversity and structure of the nitrifying community responsible for both ammonium and nitrite oxidation which is addressed in the following section 3 2 effect of cip on the structure of the nitrifying community the 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis revealed nine major phyla 1 on average across all reactors among which proteobacteria 48 5 bacteroidetes 19 8 armatimonadetes 6 3 acidobacteria 5 7 and nitrospirae 4 2 were the dominant members fig s2 a total of 21 major families 1 on average were identified across the reactors fig s3 xanthomonadaceae 15 5 chitinophagaceae 6 1 nitrosomonadaceae 5 4 flavobacteriaceae 4 5 and nitrospiraceae 4 2 accounted for the major fraction of the community the analysis revealed a total of four genera that were functionally associated with nitrification via ammonium oxidation nitrosomonas and nitrosospira nitrite oxidation nitrobacter and nitrite oxidation or comammox nitrospira fig s4 nitrosomonas 7 7 on average and nitrospira 4 3 were found to be dominant in all nitrifying reactor communities n nc ncbc a and ncbc s unlike nitrobacter and nitrosospira 0 02 fig 2 describes the change in the structure of the nitrifying microbial communities in the four bioreactors while the communities in the n reactors that received no cip clustered closely 0 88 of bray curtis similarity index as shown in fig s5 the communities of the cip fed reactors differed in their structures the three cip fed microbial communities were located outside of the 95 confidence ellipse suggesting that cip had a profound impact on shaping the community structure the pairwise community similarity was 0 29 0 02 for n vs nc 0 18 0 02 for n vs ncbc a and 0 33 0 04 for n vs ncbc s fig s5 a similarity percentage simper analysis was conducted to identify the taxa that primarily contributed to the distinction between the communities two genera nitrosomonas and nitrospira were found to be relatively more important in discriminating the cip fed communities from the n communities while nitrobacter and nitrosospira explained less than 10 of the difference the presence of cip substantially decreased the relative abundances of nitrospira in the nc by 50 and ncbc a by 45 communities though these abundances increased in the ncbc s community many bacterial genera are capable of catabolizing ammonium e g nitrosomonas nitrosospira nitrosococcus nitrosolobus and nitrosovibrio and nitrite e g nitrospira nitrobacter nitrospina and nitrococcus as their sole energy source for growth phylogenetically diverse nitrifiers inhabit a variety of natural environments such as soil freshwater and seawater the four nitrifying reactors enriched nitrosomonas and nitrospira which are also representative nitrifiers in many wastewater associated systems e g as 22 the relative abundances of nitrosomonas 0 8 and nitrospira 3 8 observed in the n communities were comparable to those of aob 1 3 and nob 4 0 in full scale wwtps 28 a concentration of 50 mg kg cip has been shown to disrupt nitritation activity in surface soil 29 in that study a phospholipid fatty acid analysis i e phenotype based characterization revealed that cip decreased the ratio of bacteria to fungi particularly decreasing gram negative bacteria than gram positive bacteria other previous studies have employed genotype based methods e g high throughput sequencing to identify which nitrifiers are most responsive to cip loadings the reduced nitrification performance observed in a submerged biofilter system exposed to cip was associated with a reduction in the relative abundance of the genus nitrosomonas from 43 to 3 4 10 cip exposure has also been reported to significantly decrease the relative abundance of the family nitrosomonadaceae and the genus nitrospira in as leading to a disruption to the ammonium and nitrite oxidation capabilities respectively 11 12 in contrast no significant reduction in the genus nitrospira in as exposed to 0 2 2 mg l cip was observed 13 the significant reduction of nitrospira in the nc and ncbc a community observed in the present study was in good agreement with the reduced nitratation performance and consistent with its previously reported sensitivity to cip 11 12 since the nitrifying groups nitrosomonas and nitrospira consist of many functionally distinguished species the intrapopulation structure was examined further three otus otu00005 otu00995 and otu00871 were phylogenetically affiliated with nitrospira fig s6 otu00005 which is closely related to candidatus nitrospira defluvii was dominant in all nitrifying communities nitrospira includes nob that are involved in the second step of nitrification i e nitratation and comammox which are involved in the complete oxidation of ammonium to nitrate otu00005 was found to be closely related to canonical nob 99 sequence similarity to candidatus nitrospira defluvii than to comammox e g 94 similarity to nitrospira sp enr4 93 to candidatus nitrospira nitrosa and 93 to candidatus nitrospira nitrificans strongly suggesting that otu00005 has a functional role in oxidizing nitrite nine otus relative abundance 0 7 affiliated with nitrosomonas are presented in fig 3 showing dynamic changes in the structure of the nitrosomonas community at the species level n communis otu00119 and n oligotropha otu00013 otu00143 and otu00303 were dominant in the n reactors while the populations associated with n eutropha otu00096 otu00076 otu00032 and otu00430 and n europaea otu00040 increased their relative abundance in the three cip fed communities although n oligotropha which was dominant in the n communities was significantly reduced in the nc community it recovered with the addition of bc while the relative abundance of the total nitrosomonas genus was increased in the nc reactor n oligotropha was significantly decreased the toxic effect caused in the nc reactor where n oligotropha decreased was substantially mitigated by the addition of bc in the ncbc reactor where n oligotropha recovered hence the experimentally observed difference in nitritation activity nc vs n and ncbc was likely associated with the disruption of the n oligotropha population rather than the total nitrosomonas genus these results collectively implied that n oligotrophic might have higher nitritation activity than other populations e g n europaea and n eutropha and thus might play a key role in controlling the overall nitritation efficiency aob members differ in their nitritation catabolic capacities e g variation in the half saturation constants for ammonium and growth characteristics 14 hence we performed additional experiments to determine the ammonium uptake activity of the two nitrifying communities taken from the n and ncbc reactors at a steady state fig s7 the ammonium uptake rates differed between the two communities at the given range of cip 2 5 to 10 mg l the differences in the aue of the aob populations likely resulted from the enrichment of aob members with potentially different ammonium oxidation capabilities however since there are limited data available for the intracellular responses of nitrosomonas in the presence of toxic chemicals such as cip we suggest that further genomic and phenotypic investigations be conducted to determine the nitritation versatility of nitrosomonas 3 3 mechanisms controlling the fate of cip in the presence of bc the high removal rate of cip in the ncbc reactor observed with the substantial recovery in its nitrification performance motivated us to examine the mechanisms controlling the fate of cip in the bc dosed reactor pollutant removal in environmental bioprocesses with additives can occur via many removal routes including biodegradation adsorption to the additives and or biomass and other abiotic pathways such as evaporation hydrolysis and photolysis to gain insights into the major routes for cip removal in the bioreactors the fate of cip was assessed for different experimental batch conditions fig 4a no significant change in cip levels was observed in the abiotic condition suggesting that the abiotic routes for cip removal e g volatilization and or physicochemical decay were negligible it was found that 28 34 of the cip in the inactive and active c conditions disappeared within an hour after which it did not change further these results suggested that a certain proportion of cip removal was due to biosorption over 88 of the cip disappeared in the presence of bc abiotic bc while no detectable change in the cip level was observed with the addition of pc abiotic pc these results suggested that bc had a key role in the removal of cip via direct adsorption onto the bc surface both suspended and attached biomass were taken from the ncbc reactor at day 39 and used to assess their contribution to cip removal fig 4b the cip concentration in the active nc condition fell to 0 42 0 28 0 14 and 0 11 mg l after 1 4 42 and 84 h the high cip removal rate was evidence of the biological breakdown of cip by the nitrifying community the cip concentration in the active nc bc condition was 0 28 0 14 0 10 and 0 05 mg l after 1 4 42 and 84 h showing that the addition of bc led to the faster and more significant cip removal overall our systematic assessment suggested that cip removal was primarily due to i biological degradation under nitrifying conditions and ii direct sequestration by the bc mediated adsorption the differential fate of cip experimentally observed in the seven different conditions provided quantitative insights into the primary routes for cip removal particularly highlighting the role of bc as an adsorptive additive the negligible loss of cip through abiotic pathways such as evaporation and photohydrolytic reactions was in good agreement with its physicochemical properties e g its low henry s constant and long term stability under normal sunlight 30 the removal of cip in the inactive and abiotic bc conditions could have been due to sorption to biomass and bc respectively the biomass concentration 3 g vss l and the loss of cip 1 47 mg l in the inactive condition suggested a sorption capacity of about 0 49 mg cip g vss the biosorption capacity of raw as is 0 88 2 0 mg cip g vss at 2 5 5 mg l of cip 7 the biosorption capacity observed in the inactive condition was lower than the previous estimate for raw as this was likely because the biomass was sampled from the bioreactor at a steady state and thus the cip had already been adsorbed to some extent the present study revealed that the cip adsorption capacity of bc was about three times greater than that of the biomass fig 4a a previous study has reported that hardwood derived bc shows significantly faster 1 3 22 times and greater about four times cip adsorption than that of raw as 7 this combined with the results of the present study suggested that the bc mediated adsorptive cip removal could outperform biosorption in the ncbc reactor cip removal was high under nitrifying conditions with a removal rate of 95 after 80 h aob possess ammonia monooxygenase amo responsible for nitritation the amo enzyme has a broad spectrum of substrates oxidizing various micropollutants i e co metabolism as well as ammonium aob present ammonium oxidizing activity within minutes to the addition of ammonium and its maximum activity is reached within an hour 31 biotransformation of a variety of micropollutants is highly correlated with nitrification in as communities 32 highlighting the significance of amo mediated co metabolic biotransformation accordingly the results from the present and previous studies collectively suggested that the higher cip removal occurring during the first four hours in active nc than that in active c was likely attributable to co metabolism in the nitrifying conditions heterotrophic members of as show 0 01 0 08 d 1 of first order cip removal rate constants 7 33 the first order removal rate constant measured in the nitrifying condition active nc was 0 63 d 1 fig 4b which was higher than that of the heterotrophs the addition of bc further increased cip removal 0 86 d 1 which was more pronounced at 4 20 h fig 4b these results supported the important role of bc in rapidly sequestering cip within several hours although several organisms such as bacteria fungi and algae are known to degrade cip via primary and or secondary co metabolism by heterotrophic bacteria and microalgae biological breakdown can take days 7 20 27 given the typical hydraulic retention time e g 10h for wastewater in as processes 34 a biological means alone may not be sufficient to achieve satisfactory removals of cip during the typical retention time our results therefore suggest that a hybrid process that combines biological e g biodegradation in as processes and physicochemical methods e g the bc addition as demonstrated in this study would offer great potential for retrofitting existing wwtps to enhance their treatment performance in removing various micropollutants 3 4 effects of pc and bc on nitrification performance the effect of the addition of pc and bc on the fate of nitrogen compounds was examined as purchased pc and pretreated bc were added to batch flasks the batch tests were performed with a 30 filling ratio and the other conditions were identical to those in the bioreactors fig 5a shows the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in the flask containing pc and nh4 pcammonium no significant change in the two nitrogen compounds was observed in pcammonium fig 5b presents the fate of the nitrogen compounds in the flask containing bc and nh4 bcammonium showing a rapid decrease in nh4 n over 4 h of particular interest was the appearance of 7 5 mg l no3 n over 80 h although it was not initially present in the flask two additional batch tests were conducted in glass flasks supplemented with bc and no2 bcnitrite and bc and no3 bcnitrate fig 5c and 5d respectively the formation of no3 n was also observed in the aqueous phase fig 5d with no detectable change in no2 n fig 5c the results suggested that the addition of bc strongly affected the fate of nh4 and no3 although the pc had no detectable influence the substantial removal of nh4 with the addition of bc occurred rapidly within 4 h previous studies have reported a variable nh4 adsorption capacity for bc with a mean of 11 mg nh4 n g 1 for example the maximum adsorption qmax reported by other studies has been 3 6 mg nh4 n g with sawdust 1 2 mg nh4 n g giant reed and 14 27 mg nh4 n g sesame straw 35 the nh4 adsorption capacity by the bc shown in fig 5b was about 0 8 mg nh4 n g this relatively lower adsorption capacity might be related to the size of the bc particles in the reactors the specific surface area is one of the most important parameters for an adsorbent in terms of its adsorption capacity 36 medium sized bc particles have a diameter of less than 1 mm while the bc used in this study had a particle size of 4 7 mm the surface to volume ratio of large bc particles e g 5 mm diameter is about 10 times lower than that of typical bc particles e g 0 5 mm diameter the lower nh4 n adsorption capacity of the bc used in this study was thus likely due to its large particle size the abiotic formation of no3 rather than from the biological transformation of ammonium i e nitrification was of particular note our results suggested that the formation of no3 likely resulted from its indigenous release from the bc into the aqueous solution previous studies have reported that bc has minimal or no significant nitrite adsorption capacity twelve types of bc derived from wheat straw corn straw and peanut shells have been shown to sorb substantial amounts of ammonium and that while the bc did not sorb nitrate some bc types released nitrate into the water 37 little or no nitrate adsorption has also been observed with the majority of bc derived from various feedstocks 38 bc has a net negative surface charge that effectively facilitates its interaction with cationic species e g ammonium ion within a solution 1 electrostatic repulsion occurs between nitrate and the bc surface which prevents nitrate adsorption onto the bc as experimentally observed in the present and previous studies although the batch tests showed the effects of bc on the fate of nitrogen compounds the bc addition alone could not explain the amount of ammonium uptake and nitrate formation observable in the ncbc reactor we thus examined the fate of the nitrogen compounds using suspended biomass and biofilm taken from the ncbc reactor on day 39 in batch experiments fig 6 the abiotic condition was run in the absence of biomass while the active nc and inactive conditions were supplemented with live and autoclaved biomass respectively the active nc condition decreased nh4 over time fig 6a with the production of no3 fig 6b while there was no detectable no2 a gradual conversion of ammonium to nitrate occurring in the active nc condition was not observed in the abiotic and inactive conditions the nitrification performance in the active nc condition was clear evidence for the major role of the biomass in the removal of ammonium and the formation of nitrate in the ncbc reactor although bc affected the fate of nitrogen compounds to some extent the almost full removal of ammonium and complete conversion to nitrate in the ncbc reactor was likely facilitated by nitrifiers not the bc a previous study reports 3 3 mg nh4 g vss h of aue on average in 10 full scale wwtps the aue value varied upon seasonal fluctuations ranging from 1 to 4 mg nh4 g vss h 28 the lowest aue was observed during winter close to 1 mg nh4 gvss h likely resulting from the low temperature sensitivity of nitrifiers the aue measured 0 89 mg nh4 gvss h measured in the active nc setting was comparable to that found in the full scale wwtps during winter 28 the low au activity measured in the present study was due at least in part to cip as a remaining antibiotic stressor 0 25 mg l in the mixed liquor despite the certain amount of cip removal by the bc addition fig 1b and 4b 3 5 implications of bc for biological nutrient processes biological nitrogen removal is an essential unit process in many full scale wwtps that treat municipal wastewater the cip removal efficiency of full scale wwtps is highly variable and often unpredictable given the biodegradability as estimated by the biodegradation constant and sorption potential as measured by the adsorption desorption distribution coefficient of cip a previous study has suggested that up to 1 g l of cip in influents can be partially treated 40 removal using conventional full scale as processes under typical operating conditions e g 12 h of hydraulic retention and 10 15 days of solid retention time 8 following the micropollutant degradation simulation model 39 laboratory experiments using aerobic as bioreactors have confirmed poor 20 removal at 0 5 mg l of cip 8 given the ecotoxicity thresholds e g up to hundreds of μg l for cip and its highly fluctuating concentrations in wastewater influents e g up to tens of mg l detected conventional wwtps employing as processes alone may be incapable of reducing cip levels to satisfactory levels 6 studies have shown improved cip removal performance using advanced treatment options for example 70 cip removal is achieved in full scale membrane bioreactor systems 40 in addition the use of two up flow biological processes an aerated filter and a sludge bed can remove up to 79 and 90 of cip respectively 41 despite the high removal rate from the aqueous phase the primary removal route about 70 80 is associated with sorption to suspended and or attached sludge biomass 40 the transfer of cip to waste sludge may result in other issues including the operational failure of post treatment processes e g the anaerobic digestion of waste sludge and ecosystem damage at biosolid amended sites a previous study has reported that cip at a concentration of 0 5 mg l can be toxic to essential metabolic stages in the anaerobic digestion process e g fermentation and methanogenesis by inhibiting acetogenic bacteria and aceticlastic methanogens 9 because bc has a cip adsorption capacity that is much higher than that of as the addition of bc to biological systems removes cip from both ww effluent and waste sludge thus reducing the levels of cip in aquatic ecosystems and waste sludge biosolid associated environments since bc additives have a finite adsorption capacity bc would be replaced or regenerated using various physicochemical methods as typical adsorbents e g activated carbon overall our results suggest that bc is a promising additive for engineered biological systems leading to enhanced nitrification performance in the presence of cip outstanding cip removal compared to other advanced systems e g membrane bioreactors and potential proactive mitigation of ecological risks in sludge processing and biosolid associated environments 4 conclusion exposure to 5 mg l cip significantly disrupted the ammonium and nitrite oxidation performance of as cip inhibited nitrification with significant reductions in the relative abundances of n oligotropha and nitrospira the bc addition into as substantially recovered both nitrification performance and the nitrifying bacteria inhibited by cip cip in the ncbc reactor was removed primarily via adsorption to the bc and co metabolic biodegradation by nitrifying bacteria bc

13258,this work examined the effects of biochar bc and a plastic carrier pc on nitrification of activated sludge as in the presence of antibiotic ciprofloxacin cip it was found that 5 mg l cip significantly inhibited both ammonium and nitrite oxidation by 75 while the addition of pc into a reactor showed no effects on the fate of cip the addition of bc substantially decreased cip concentrations in the reactor thereby significantly reducing the cip mediated inhibition on the nitrification performance 16s rrna gene based community profiling revealed a significant change in the structure of the nitrifying community in the presence of cip while nitrosomonas oligotropha and nitrospira sp were significantly inhibited by cip they recovered with the bc addition batch experiments were performed to determine removal routes of cip in the bc dosed reactor while no significant removal of cip occurred via abiotic routes such as volatilization photolysis and hydrolysis cip was removed primarily by adsorption to bc and co metabolic biodegradation by the nitrifying community the first order removal rate constant of cip was 0 63 d 1 in the nitrifying condition which was increased to 0 86 d 1 with the bc addition overall this study suggests that bc can be a promising additive into environmental bioprocesses for mitigating antibiotic toxicity and enhancing nutrient removal performance in the presence of high antibiotic loads keywords nitrification wastewater treatment activated sludge biochar antibiotic ciprofloxacin 1 introduction excessive levels of nitrogen compounds in natural surface water can lead to eutrophication harmful algal blooms the release of toxins and oxygen depletion full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps thus aim to remove nitrogen compounds from wastewater before discharging the treated wastewater into natural waterways ammonium is the most common nitrogen compound 90 in typical wastewater environments 1 many wwtps treat ammonium using a conventional two step biological nitrogen removal process involving microbial nitrification and denitrification nitrification occurs in aerobic tanks where ammonium is oxidized to nitrate while denitrification involves converting nitrate to nitrogen gas in anoxic tanks the nitrification denitrification process is one of the oldest and most widely used nitrogen treatment options 2 toxic chemical substances in wastewater influents can affect the performance of biological nutrient removal processes nitrification is generally more sensitive to environmental stressors than other ecosystem functions of biological wastewater processes such as denitrification and organic matter removal ciprofloxacin cip is a fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics that has been widely used for several decades in both human and veterinary medicine as a result cip is ubiquitous in many aquatic environments particularly wastewater cip can be found at various levels in wastewater reaching up to 31 mg l 3 in pharmaceutical wastewaters thus greatly exceeding toxicity thresholds e g hundreds of μg l 4 5 many previous studies have reported inhibitory effects of cip on ecosystem functions within biological wastewater treatment systems cip disrupts core heterotrophic members of aerobic activated sludge as thus decreasing overall organic matter removal activity 6 8 cip also interferes with methane production and volatile fatty acid metabolism during anaerobic digestion 9 a wealth of data on the effects of cip on heterotrophic activity is available whereas much less is known about autotrophic nitrification processes while several studies have provided phenotypic descriptions of cip mediated disruptions to nitrifying bioreactors 10 13 toxicity thresholds the degree and type of inhibition phenotypes and the nitrifying organisms subject to inhibition substantially differed between these studies nitrospira an important group of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob is found to be increased in relative abundance upon cip in some studies 11 12 which conflicts with another study showing its decrease with cip 13 this might be because nitrospira consists of two functionally distinct groups one that carries out nitrite oxidation and another that is involved in the complete oxidation of ammonium to nitrate comammox however which nitrospira responds to cip mediated disruption has not been addressed in previous studies in addition ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob are made up of diverse species members that differ significantly in their ammonium catabolic capacity 14 what species are particularly sensitive to cip and how the sensitivity affects the overall nitrification performance remain to be clearly elucidated more importantly while previous studies have primarily focused on the effects and fate of cip in nitrifying bioprocesses there has been little focus on developing a technical means to reduce cip mediated functional disruption this is of great practical significance because nitrification is an essential unit process in many full scale municipal industrial wwtps thus an effective treatment means would offer operational benefits e g enhanced nutrient removal rate and performance stability for wwtps treating high loadings of toxic chemicals this study aimed to elucidate the inhibitory effects of cip on nitrification performance by determining the specific bacterial species populations affected by the inhibitory consequences further the effects of adding a plastic carrier and a biochar additive to the nitrifying bioreactor on nitrification performance were systematically tested biofilm wastewater treatment systems are often associated with enhanced nitrification activity presumably due to the prolonged retention of slow growing nitrifiers a plastic carrier pc is often used in biofilm systems because additional biomass can grow on the surface of the carrier 15 which helps the retention of nitrifiers and increases nitrification biochar bc is a carbon rich material generated from thermal degradation in the absence of oxygen i e pyrolysis while bc has been commonly used as a soil additive to enhance soil fertility and health recent studies have reported the use of bc as a microbial carrier in various water wastewater treatment systems due to its large surface area and porosity 16 to test the effects of the two additives our study established several sets of nitrifying bioreactors with and without the additives time course functional performances of bioreactors associated with nitrogen and cip were monitored over a month in addition batch experiments were performed to provide a mechanistic description of the effects of the additive on controlling the fate of nitrogen and cip 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis was conducted to identify the key nitrifying populations that were strongly inhibited by cip but that recovered with use of the additives overall the present study was designed to provide mechanistic insights into the effects of cip mediated toxicity on nitrifying as and implications for devising a means for treating toxic chemical wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1

made of high density polyethylene 7 mm in length that is widely used in various wastewater treatment systems 15 was used as the pc the bc derived from the mulberry tree was purchased from yougi industry co ltd korea the bc was sieved with a 4 7 mm mesh washed using deionized water and dried in an oven for 24 h at 105 c the bc surface was pretreated to remove debris and impurities using nitric acid for 12 h and neutralized with sodium hydroxide as described in a previous study 7 the specific surface area of bc and pc was about 600 m2 l 7 and 0 5 m2 l 18 respectively 2 2 bioreactor development as inocula were taken from the aeration tank of a local municipal wwtp in gyeonggi province korea four sets of laboratory bioreactors were established by introducing the same as inocula 3 g vss l one reactor set designated as n was operated with the ammonium feed while another nc was operated using the ammonium feed and cip the other two reactors fed with the ammonium feed and cip were dosed with the pc ncpc and bc ncbc respectively at a 30 filling ratio fig s1 the filling ratio was chosen considering a typical range 20 50 of additives in bioreactors 19 the four reactor sets were aerated using air diffusers maintaining dissolved oxygen levels of 3 4 mg l as described previously 20 21 the bioreactors had a 1 l working volume and were operated in sequencing batch mode with a feed cycle of 3 5 days as described previously 22 one feed cycle consisted of four stages 1 filling 10 min 2 reaction almost 3 5 days excluding filling settling and decanting 3 settling 30 min and 4 decanting 10 min after the settling period 0 5 l of clear supernatant was withdrawn and filled with the ammonium feed for n or the cip containing ammonium feed for nc ncpc and ncbc 2 3 assessment of the fate of nitrogen compounds and cip to determine the removal pathways for cip seven experimental conditions abiotic abiotic pc abiotic bc inactive active c active nc and active nc bc were established in batch glass flasks table s1 the abiotic condition had no biomass inoculation or additives while the abiotic pc and abiotic bc conditions contained pc and bc respectively at a 30 filling ratio in addition to the suspended biomass aggregated biomass was observed on the surface of the bc in the ncbc reactor both active nc and active nc bc were inoculated with the combined biomass both suspended and attached taken from the ncbc bioreactor active nc bc was also supplemented with bc 30 filling ratio taken from the ncbc bioreactor and the combined biomass the inactive condition was inoculated with the combined biomass that had been autoclaved active c was supplemented with cip acting as the sole carbon nitrogen and energy source for microbial growth the other six conditions were supplemented with 85 mg l of nh4 n while active c was with no ammonium 5 mg l of cip was added to all glass flasks cip removal rates were calculated using the first order rate constant equation as detailed in 23 to investigate the fate of nitrogen compounds four experimental conditions pcammonium bcammonium bcnitrite and bcnitrate were set up in batch flasks pcammonium and bcammonium were supplemented with the ammonium feed i e 85 mg nh4 n with no nitrite or nitrate supplementation while bcnitrite and bcnitrate were supplemented with nitrite and nitrate respectively instead of ammonium for each condition the three nitrogen species were monitored for a period of 80 h 2 4 16s rrna gene sequence analysis mixed liquor suspension samples from the nc ncbc and n reactors were taken once at steady state reached on day 39 because the ncbc contained both suspended and attached biomass the attached biomass ncbc a was sampled separately from the suspended biomass ncbc s the attached biofilm was detached from the bc surfaces pores using vortexing 30 s followed by sonication 1 min 7 dna extraction from the samples was conducted using a dneasy powersoil kit qiagen carlsbad ca usa the hypervariable v3 v5 region of 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified and subjected to miseq sequencing as previously performed 24 the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequence data were analyzed using a miseq sop pipeline 25 as described previously 24 26 raw reads were pre filtered using the default quality control chimera sequences were excluded using chimera vserach and the remaining sequences were taxonomically classified using classify seqs operational taxonomic units otus were determined using a 97 similarity threshold with opticlust 3 results and discussion 3 1 differential fate of nitrogen compounds and cip in bioreactors four sets of bioreactors inoculated using the same as inocula were set up with the ammonium feed 170 mg l nh4 n resulting in 0 02 kg nh4 n m3 d of ammonium loading rate three sets were fed with cip in addition to the ammonium feed these contained no additives nc bc ncbc or pc ncpc one reactor n which was run in triplicate n1 n2 and n3 was fed with the ammonium feed without cip as a control the n reactors displayed an almost complete ammonium uptake efficiency aue over the entire operation period 98 on average the nc ncbc and ncpc reactors received 1 mg l of cip for the first seven days for which no acute toxicity on the aue was observed the cip influent loading was then increased to 5 mg l from day 7 leading to differences in the nitrification performance of the three cip fed bioreactors effluent nh4 n concentrations in the nc and ncpc reactors rapidly increased to 85 86 mg l at day 11 and eventually to 122 140 mg l at days 28 39 the nh4 n concentrations in the effluent of the ncbc reactor gradually increased from day 18 indicating a longer response time to the increased cip loading and reached 24 31 mg l at days 28 39 much lower than those in the nc and ncpc reactors fig 1 shows the aue and nitrate generation efficiency nge for the four reactors at a steady state days 28 39 it can be observed that 5 mg l cip reduced the aue and nge of the nc and ncpc reactors by 75 76 compared to that of the n reactors representing a significant disruption to both nitritation and nitratation in contrast the reduction 15 16 of the aue and nge in the ncbc reactor was less than the nc and ncpc reactors suggesting the mitigation of the cip perturbations on nitrification performance with the addition of bc the cip removal rate differed between the three cip fed reactors it was highest for the ncbc reactor 89 followed by the ncpc 11 6 and nc 8 2 reactors the reduced levels of cip observed in the effluents of the ncbc reactor fig 1c were associated with its high nitrification performance compared with the nc and ncpc reactors these results implied that the bc likely mitigated cip toxicity in the ncbc reactor resulting in higher nitrification rates in the presence of cip previous studies have documented the inhibitory effects of cip on biological nitrification in different experimental settings 0 35 mg l cip has been found to inhibit ammonium oxidation activity in a submerged biofilter system with pvc carriers 10 the ammonium uptake of as in batch experiments was reduced in the presence of 0 4 10 mg l cip 11 in addition 0 1 5 0 mg l cip was reported to lead to the accumulation of ammonium and nitrite in a sequencing batch reactor suggesting the inhibition of both nitritation and nitratation activities within the suspended microbial community 12 0 2 2 mg l cip had a negative effect on denitrifying activity with a 15 20 reduction in total nitrogen removal 13 though there was no observable toxic effect on nitrifying activity these previous studies have thus documented varying degrees of cip toxicity in relation to nitrification likely due to differences in the environmental conditions between the experiments such as inoculum source growth type e g suspended or attached and reactor configuration in the present study the cip loading had a significant inhibitory effect on both nitritation and nitratation fig 1 but the cip concentration used here 5 mg l exceeded the no effect concentration as high as 2 mg l previously reported in 27 the difference in the nitrification performance between the reactors fig 1 highlighted the need to further investigate the diversity and structure of the nitrifying community responsible for both ammonium and nitrite oxidation which is addressed in the following section 3 2 effect of cip on the structure of the nitrifying community the 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis revealed nine major phyla 1 on average across all reactors among which proteobacteria 48 5 bacteroidetes 19 8 armatimonadetes 6 3 acidobacteria 5 7 and nitrospirae 4 2 were the dominant members fig s2 a total of 21 major families 1 on average were identified across the reactors fig s3 xanthomonadaceae 15 5 chitinophagaceae 6 1 nitrosomonadaceae 5 4 flavobacteriaceae 4 5 and nitrospiraceae 4 2 accounted for the major fraction of the community the analysis revealed a total of four genera that were functionally associated with nitrification via ammonium oxidation nitrosomonas and nitrosospira nitrite oxidation nitrobacter and nitrite oxidation or comammox nitrospira fig s4 nitrosomonas 7 7 on average and nitrospira 4 3 were found to be dominant in all nitrifying reactor communities n nc ncbc a and ncbc s unlike nitrobacter and nitrosospira 0 02 fig 2 describes the change in the structure of the nitrifying microbial communities in the four bioreactors while the communities in the n reactors that received no cip clustered closely 0 88 of bray curtis similarity index as shown in fig s5 the communities of the cip fed reactors differed in their structures the three cip fed microbial communities were located outside of the 95 confidence ellipse suggesting that cip had a profound impact on shaping the community structure the pairwise community similarity was 0 29 0 02 for n vs nc 0 18 0 02 for n vs ncbc a and 0 33 0 04 for n vs ncbc s fig s5 a similarity percentage simper analysis was conducted to identify the taxa that primarily contributed to the distinction between the communities two genera nitrosomonas and nitrospira were found to be relatively more important in discriminating the cip fed communities from the n communities while nitrobacter and nitrosospira explained less than 10 of the difference the presence of cip substantially decreased the relative abundances of nitrospira in the nc by 50 and ncbc a by 45 communities though these abundances increased in the ncbc s community many bacterial genera are capable of catabolizing ammonium e g nitrosomonas nitrosospira nitrosococcus nitrosolobus and nitrosovibrio and nitrite e g nitrospira nitrobacter nitrospina and nitrococcus as their sole energy source for growth phylogenetically diverse nitrifiers inhabit a variety of natural environments such as soil freshwater and seawater the four nitrifying reactors enriched nitrosomonas and nitrospira which are also representative nitrifiers in many wastewater associated systems e g as 22 the relative abundances of nitrosomonas 0 8 and nitrospira 3 8 observed in the n communities were comparable to those of aob 1 3 and nob 4 0 in full scale wwtps 28 a concentration of 50 mg kg cip has been shown to disrupt nitritation activity in surface soil 29 in that study a phospholipid fatty acid analysis i e phenotype based characterization revealed that cip decreased the ratio of bacteria to fungi particularly decreasing gram negative bacteria than gram positive bacteria other previous studies have employed genotype based methods e g high throughput sequencing to identify which nitrifiers are most responsive to cip loadings the reduced nitrification performance observed in a submerged biofilter system exposed to cip was associated with a reduction in the relative abundance of the genus nitrosomonas from 43 to 3 4 10 cip exposure has also been reported to significantly decrease the relative abundance of the family nitrosomonadaceae and the genus nitrospira in as leading to a disruption to the ammonium and nitrite oxidation capabilities respectively 11 12 in contrast no significant reduction in the genus nitrospira in as exposed to 0 2 2 mg l cip was observed 13 the significant reduction of nitrospira in the nc and ncbc a community observed in the present study was in good agreement with the reduced nitratation performance and consistent with its previously reported sensitivity to cip 11 12 since the nitrifying groups nitrosomonas and nitrospira consist of many functionally distinguished species the intrapopulation structure was examined further three otus otu00005 otu00995 and otu00871 were phylogenetically affiliated with nitrospira fig s6 otu00005 which is closely related to candidatus nitrospira defluvii was dominant in all nitrifying communities nitrospira includes nob that are involved in the second step of nitrification i e nitratation and comammox which are involved in the complete oxidation of ammonium to nitrate otu00005 was found to be closely related to canonical nob 99 sequence similarity to candidatus nitrospira defluvii than to comammox e g 94 similarity to nitrospira sp enr4 93 to candidatus nitrospira nitrosa and 93 to candidatus nitrospira nitrificans strongly suggesting that otu00005 has a functional role in oxidizing nitrite nine otus relative abundance 0 7 affiliated with nitrosomonas are presented in fig 3 showing dynamic changes in the structure of the nitrosomonas community at the species level n communis otu00119 and n oligotropha otu00013 otu00143 and otu00303 were dominant in the n reactors while the populations associated with n eutropha otu00096 otu00076 otu00032 and otu00430 and n europaea otu00040 increased their relative abundance in the three cip fed communities although n oligotropha which was dominant in the n communities was significantly reduced in the nc community it recovered with the addition of bc while the relative abundance of the total nitrosomonas genus was increased in the nc reactor n oligotropha was significantly decreased the toxic effect caused in the nc reactor where n oligotropha decreased was substantially mitigated by the addition of bc in the ncbc reactor where n oligotropha recovered hence the experimentally observed difference in nitritation activity nc vs n and ncbc was likely associated with the disruption of the n oligotropha population rather than the total nitrosomonas genus these results collectively implied that n oligotrophic might have higher nitritation activity than other populations e g n europaea and n eutropha and thus might play a key role in controlling the overall nitritation efficiency aob members differ in their nitritation catabolic capacities e g variation in the half saturation constants for ammonium and growth characteristics 14 hence we performed additional experiments to determine the ammonium uptake activity of the two nitrifying communities taken from the n and ncbc reactors at a steady state fig s7 the ammonium uptake rates differed between the two communities at the given range of cip 2 5 to 10 mg l the differences in the aue of the aob populations likely resulted from the enrichment of aob members with potentially different ammonium oxidation capabilities however since there are limited data available for the intracellular responses of nitrosomonas in the presence of toxic chemicals such as cip we suggest that further genomic and phenotypic investigations be conducted to determine the nitritation versatility of nitrosomonas 3 3 mechanisms controlling the fate of cip in the presence of bc the high removal rate of cip in the ncbc reactor observed with the substantial recovery in its nitrification performance motivated us to examine the mechanisms controlling the fate of cip in the bc dosed reactor pollutant removal in environmental bioprocesses with additives can occur via many removal routes including biodegradation adsorption to the additives and or biomass and other abiotic pathways such as evaporation hydrolysis and photolysis to gain insights into the major routes for cip removal in the bioreactors the fate of cip was assessed for different experimental batch conditions fig 4a no significant change in cip levels was observed in the abiotic condition suggesting that the abiotic routes for cip removal e g volatilization and or physicochemical decay were negligible it was found that 28 34 of the cip in the inactive and active c conditions disappeared within an hour after which it did not change further these results suggested that a certain proportion of cip removal was due to biosorption over 88 of the cip disappeared in the presence of bc abiotic bc while no detectable change in the cip level was observed with the addition of pc abiotic pc these results suggested that bc had a key role in the removal of cip via direct adsorption onto the bc surface both suspended and attached biomass were taken from the ncbc reactor at day 39 and used to assess their contribution to cip removal fig 4b the cip concentration in the active nc condition fell to 0 42 0 28 0 14 and 0 11 mg l after 1 4 42 and 84 h the high cip removal rate was evidence of the biological breakdown of cip by the nitrifying community the cip concentration in the active nc bc condition was 0 28 0 14 0 10 and 0 05 mg l after 1 4 42 and 84 h showing that the addition of bc led to the faster and more significant cip removal overall our systematic assessment suggested that cip removal was primarily due to i biological degradation under nitrifying conditions and ii direct sequestration by the bc mediated adsorption the differential fate of cip experimentally observed in the seven different conditions provided quantitative insights into the primary routes for cip removal particularly highlighting the role of bc as an adsorptive additive the negligible loss of cip through abiotic pathways such as evaporation and photohydrolytic reactions was in good agreement with its physicochemical properties e g its low henry s constant and long term stability under normal sunlight 30 the removal of cip in the inactive and abiotic bc conditions could have been due to sorption to biomass and bc respectively the biomass concentration 3 g vss l and the loss of cip 1 47 mg l in the inactive condition suggested a sorption capacity of about 0 49 mg cip g vss the biosorption capacity of raw as is 0 88 2 0 mg cip g vss at 2 5 5 mg l of cip 7 the biosorption capacity observed in the inactive condition was lower than the previous estimate for raw as this was likely because the biomass was sampled from the bioreactor at a steady state and thus the cip had already been adsorbed to some extent the present study revealed that the cip adsorption capacity of bc was about three times greater than that of the biomass fig 4a a previous study has reported that hardwood derived bc shows significantly faster 1 3 22 times and greater about four times cip adsorption than that of raw as 7 this combined with the results of the present study suggested that the bc mediated adsorptive cip removal could outperform biosorption in the ncbc reactor cip removal was high under nitrifying conditions with a removal rate of 95 after 80 h aob possess ammonia monooxygenase amo responsible for nitritation the amo enzyme has a broad spectrum of substrates oxidizing various micropollutants i e co metabolism as well as ammonium aob present ammonium oxidizing activity within minutes to the addition of ammonium and its maximum activity is reached within an hour 31 biotransformation of a variety of micropollutants is highly correlated with nitrification in as communities 32 highlighting the significance of amo mediated co metabolic biotransformation accordingly the results from the present and previous studies collectively suggested that the higher cip removal occurring during the first four hours in active nc than that in active c was likely attributable to co metabolism in the nitrifying conditions heterotrophic members of as show 0 01 0 08 d 1 of first order cip removal rate constants 7 33 the first order removal rate constant measured in the nitrifying condition active nc was 0 63 d 1 fig 4b which was higher than that of the heterotrophs the addition of bc further increased cip removal 0 86 d 1 which was more pronounced at 4 20 h fig 4b these results supported the important role of bc in rapidly sequestering cip within several hours although several organisms such as bacteria fungi and algae are known to degrade cip via primary and or secondary co metabolism by heterotrophic bacteria and microalgae biological breakdown can take days 7 20 27 given the typical hydraulic retention time e g 10h for wastewater in as processes 34 a biological means alone may not be sufficient to achieve satisfactory removals of cip during the typical retention time our results therefore suggest that a hybrid process that combines biological e g biodegradation in as processes and physicochemical methods e g the bc addition as demonstrated in this study would offer great potential for retrofitting existing wwtps to enhance their treatment performance in removing various micropollutants 3 4 effects of pc and bc on nitrification performance the effect of the addition of pc and bc on the fate of nitrogen compounds was examined as purchased pc and pretreated bc were added to batch flasks the batch tests were performed with a 30 filling ratio and the other conditions were identical to those in the bioreactors fig 5a shows the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in the flask containing pc and nh4 pcammonium no significant change in the two nitrogen compounds was observed in pcammonium fig 5b presents the fate of the nitrogen compounds in the flask containing bc and nh4 bcammonium showing a rapid decrease in nh4 n over 4 h of particular interest was the appearance of 7 5 mg l no3 n over 80 h although it was not initially present in the flask two additional batch tests were conducted in glass flasks supplemented with bc and no2 bcnitrite and bc and no3 bcnitrate fig 5c and 5d respectively the formation of no3 n was also observed in the aqueous phase fig 5d with no detectable change in no2 n fig 5c the results suggested that the addition of bc strongly affected the fate of nh4 and no3 although the pc had no detectable influence the substantial removal of nh4 with the addition of bc occurred rapidly within 4 h previous studies have reported a variable nh4 adsorption capacity for bc with a mean of 11 mg nh4 n g 1 for example the maximum adsorption qmax reported by other studies has been 3 6 mg nh4 n g with sawdust 1 2 mg nh4 n g giant reed and 14 27 mg nh4 n g sesame straw 35 the nh4 adsorption capacity by the bc shown in fig 5b was about 0 8 mg nh4 n g this relatively lower adsorption capacity might be related to the size of the bc particles in the reactors the specific surface area is one of the most important parameters for an adsorbent in terms of its adsorption capacity 36 medium sized bc particles have a diameter of less than 1 mm while the bc used in this study had a particle size of 4 7 mm the surface to volume ratio of large bc particles e g 5 mm diameter is about 10 times lower than that of typical bc particles e g 0 5 mm diameter the lower nh4 n adsorption capacity of the bc used in this study was thus likely due to its large particle size the abiotic formation of no3 rather than from the biological transformation of ammonium i e nitrification was of particular note our results suggested that the formation of no3 likely resulted from its indigenous release from the bc into the aqueous solution previous studies have reported that bc has minimal or no significant nitrite adsorption capacity twelve types of bc derived from wheat straw corn straw and peanut shells have been shown to sorb substantial amounts of ammonium and that while the bc did not sorb nitrate some bc types released nitrate into the water 37 little or no nitrate adsorption has also been observed with the majority of bc derived from various feedstocks 38 bc has a net negative surface charge that effectively facilitates its interaction with cationic species e g ammonium ion within a solution 1 electrostatic repulsion occurs between nitrate and the bc surface which prevents nitrate adsorption onto the bc as experimentally observed in the present and previous studies although the batch tests showed the effects of bc on the fate of nitrogen compounds the bc addition alone could not explain the amount of ammonium uptake and nitrate formation observable in the ncbc reactor we thus examined the fate of the nitrogen compounds using suspended biomass and biofilm taken from the ncbc reactor on day 39 in batch experiments fig 6 the abiotic condition was run in the absence of biomass while the active nc and inactive conditions were supplemented with live and autoclaved biomass respectively the active nc condition decreased nh4 over time fig 6a with the production of no3 fig 6b while there was no detectable no2 a gradual conversion of ammonium to nitrate occurring in the active nc condition was not observed in the abiotic and inactive conditions the nitrification performance in the active nc condition was clear evidence for the major role of the biomass in the removal of ammonium and the formation of nitrate in the ncbc reactor although bc affected the fate of nitrogen compounds to some extent the almost full removal of ammonium and complete conversion to nitrate in the ncbc reactor was likely facilitated by nitrifiers not the bc a previous study reports 3 3 mg nh4 g vss h of aue on average in 10 full scale wwtps the aue value varied upon seasonal fluctuations ranging from 1 to 4 mg nh4 g vss h 28 the lowest aue was observed during winter close to 1 mg nh4 gvss h likely resulting from the low temperature sensitivity of nitrifiers the aue measured 0 89 mg nh4 gvss h measured in the active nc setting was comparable to that found in the full scale wwtps during winter 28 the low au activity measured in the present study was due at least in part to cip as a remaining antibiotic stressor 0 25 mg l in the mixed liquor despite the certain amount of cip removal by the bc addition fig 1b and 4b 3 5 implications of bc for biological nutrient processes biological nitrogen removal is an essential unit process in many full scale wwtps that treat municipal wastewater the cip removal efficiency of full scale wwtps is highly variable and often unpredictable given the biodegradability as estimated by the biodegradation constant and sorption potential as measured by the adsorption desorption distribution coefficient of cip a previous study has suggested that up to 1 g l of cip in influents can be partially treated 40 removal using conventional full scale as processes under typical operating conditions e g 12 h of hydraulic retention and 10 15 days of solid retention time 8 following the micropollutant degradation simulation model 39 laboratory experiments using aerobic as bioreactors have confirmed poor 20 removal at 0 5 mg l of cip 8 given the ecotoxicity thresholds e g up to hundreds of μg l for cip and its highly fluctuating concentrations in wastewater influents e g up to tens of mg l detected conventional wwtps employing as processes alone may be incapable of reducing cip levels to satisfactory levels 6 studies have shown improved cip removal performance using advanced treatment options for example 70 cip removal is achieved in full scale membrane bioreactor systems 40 in addition the use of two up flow biological processes an aerated filter and a sludge bed can remove up to 79 and 90 of cip respectively 41 despite the high removal rate from the aqueous phase the primary removal route about 70 80 is associated with sorption to suspended and or attached sludge biomass 40 the transfer of cip to waste sludge may result in other issues including the operational failure of post treatment processes e g the anaerobic digestion of waste sludge and ecosystem damage at biosolid amended sites a previous study has reported that cip at a concentration of 0 5 mg l can be toxic to essential metabolic stages in the anaerobic digestion process e g fermentation and methanogenesis by inhibiting acetogenic bacteria and aceticlastic methanogens 9 because bc has a cip adsorption capacity that is much higher than that of as the addition of bc to biological systems removes cip from both ww effluent and waste sludge thus reducing the levels of cip in aquatic ecosystems and waste sludge biosolid associated environments since bc additives have a finite adsorption capacity bc would be replaced or regenerated using various physicochemical methods as typical adsorbents e g activated carbon overall our results suggest that bc is a promising additive for engineered biological systems leading to enhanced nitrification performance in the presence of cip outstanding cip removal compared to other advanced systems e g membrane bioreactors and potential proactive mitigation of ecological risks in sludge processing and biosolid associated environments 4 conclusion exposure to 5 mg l cip significantly disrupted the ammonium and nitrite oxidation performance of as cip inhibited nitrification with significant reductions in the relative abundances of n oligotropha and nitrospira the bc addition into as substantially recovered both nitrification performance and the nitrifying bacteria inhibited by cip cip in the ncbc reactor was removed primarily via adsorption to the bc and co metabolic biodegradation by nitrifying bacteria bc

13259,cathode plays an important role on the oxygen reduction reaction orr reactivity in the microbial fuel cell integrated electrocatalytic process for the effective degradation of organic pollutants comparative study of caffeine and phenol as the organic pollutants in the cathodic chamber was investigated in terms of removal efficiency and bioelectricity generation results revealed that the highest removal efficiency of phenol 96 89 1 26 and maximum power density 33 37 4 62 mw m 2 were attained by copper ii oxide loaded carbon felt cuo cf cathode besides the removal efficiency of phenol was nearly 12 fold higher 24 85 1 36 using cuo cf cathode compared with that of caffeine 2 14 0 36 at the first 24 h the effect of carbon based cathode materials on the mineralization of caffeine in the cathodic chamber was evaluated using carbon felt cf and carbon plate cp both cuo cp and bare cp cathodes surpassed cuo cf and bare cf cathodes in the chemical oxygen demand cod removal and bioelectricity generation higher crystallinity nature and electrical conductivity 3 57 105 ω 1 m 1 of cp compared with that of amorphous structure and lower electrical conductivity of bare cf 3 33 104 ω 1 m 1 contributed to higher orr reactivity and efficient transport of electrons for bioelectricity generation the cod removal efficiency of synthetic wastewater in the anodic chamber and bioelectricity generation of this integrated system were affected by the types of organic pollutants and carbon based cathode materials in the cathodic chamber graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microbial fuel cell caffeine degradation phenol degradation carbon based cathode materials oxygen reduction reaction 1 introduction caffeine and phenol are the common emerging pollutants present in the wastewater plants this is due to the high consumption and continuous discharge from pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries into the rivers several wastewater treatments such as flocculation adsorption and membrane filtration have been used to remove these emerging pollutants however these methods are less efficient due to several drawbacks such as high amount of sludge production special absorbent materials and additional handling respectively consequently the operating cost is increased 1 therefore development of alternative methods for treatment of caffeine and phenol has gained tremendous attention worldwide microbial fuel cell mfc has been intensively utilized over the last decade as a promising and sustainable technology with minimum energy consumption in wastewater treatment mfc is an energy conversion device which able to harvest electric energy directly from organic matters in the presence of electrogenic bacteria while simultaneously perform pollutant removal in the anodic chamber the oxidation process of organic substrates by the microbes produces carbon dioxide protons and electrons 2 the electrons produced during the oxidation process will flow from anode to cathode through the external circuit and being reduced when reacted with protons and oxygen thus produced electricity 3 mfc has attracted considerable interests among the researchers in recent years due to its specific advantages in the application of wastewater treatment in comparison with conventional electrochemical cell mfc does not require external energy supply for system operation besides mfc works in the treatment of low concentration substrates at temperatures below 20 c where anaerobic digestion technology fails to function 4 the selection of the electrode material is crucial for the operational cost and efficiency of mfcs as the performance of mfc directly depends on the kinetics of the electrode reactions within the fuel cell and the electrodes contribute to a significant portion on the total cost of mfc 5 different electrode materials cause significant effects on the electron transfer electrode resistance and the rate of electrode surface reaction 6 hence development of high performing cost effective cathodes is vital in the practical application of mfc since cathode is one of the major key factors which limits the overall process efficiency of mfc a wide variety of materials have been examined as cathodes in mfcs including carbon cloth carbon paper and carbon felt cf 5 carbon based materials are reliable materials that often applied as electrodes the use of carbon based materials has significantly improved the mfc performance and it extremely reduces the cost of mfc system due to its flexibility in size and shape 3 some metal based materials with high electrical conductivity such as stainless steel mesh nickel mesh and nickel foam are more cost effective compared to the carbon based materials however the low cathode potentials will cause corrosion problem and finally lead to poor performance 7 this revealed that instability of the metal based electrode materials may limit their applications in mfcs the oxygen reduction reaction orr is a fundamental process occurring on the cathode an efficient electrocatalyst is essential to increase the rate of orr for enhanced performances of system in terms of power generation and pollutant removal slow kinetic of cathode reactions usually hinders the power generation in mfc cathodes based on platinum pt catalysts were heavily applied in mfcs and recent studies have compared the performance of pt catalysts on activated carbon cathodes and carbon cloth based cathodes 8 since pt is expensive other alternative catalysts such as palladium manganese oxide and cobalt oxide 9 were developed as these materials are more economic than pt and less hazardous to environment copper ii oxide cuo appears as an alternative orr catalyst due to its high catalytic activity low cost and simple synthesis method cuo exhibited high stability in the aqueous environment at room temperature and high efficiency in the water oxidation 10 these advantages contributed to the great potential of cuo in the electrochemical applications such as heterogeneous catalyst and sensor in this study different organic pollutants caffeine and phenol were treated in the cathodic chamber using cf effect of these organic pollutants on the removal efficiency and bioelectricity generation were explored in addition comparative study of cuo loaded on two different carbon based cathode materials carbon plate cp and cf for orr in mfcs was investigated the effects and differences of these carbon based cathode materials on bioelectricity generation and pollutant treatment were evaluated in terms of power generation and chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency of caffeine in the cathodic chamber 2 material and methods 2 1 materials caffeine

chloride hexahydrate mgcl2 6h2o from hmbg were analytical grade and used without further purification 2 2 anodic chamber the plastic biofilm carriers were inoculated in the mixed culture sludge collected from wastewater treatment plant of a rubber gloves manufacturing factory before used as supporting media in the anodic chamber the anodic chamber which filled with inoculated plastic biofilm carriers was fed up with 1 0 l synthetic wastewater made up of 0 375 g l 1 ch3coona 3 40 g l 1 k2hpo4 4 00 g l 1 kh2po4 0 31 g l 1 nh4cl 0 13 g l 1 kcl 0 116 g l 1 nacl and 0 10 g l 1 mgcl2 6h2o and sealed to maintain the anaerobic condition 2 3 cathodic chamber 2 3 1 fabrication of cathode using different methods the synthesis of cuo powder was carried out accordingly to our previous study 11 a cf sg 222 maido corporation japan and a commercial cp in the dimension of 9 5 cm were used as the substrates of cathode for fabrication of cuo cf and cuo loaded carbon plate cuo cp electrodes respectively both materials were ultrasonically cleaned by using deionized water and ethanol respectively and then dried in an oven at 60 c before loading of cuo as catalysts 2 3 1 1 fabrication of cuo cf cathode the synthesized cuo powder was heat treated in a furnace at 300 c for 2 h then the carbon paste was applied on the cleaned cf and a blade was used to ensure the homogeneous smear of carbon paste on the cf after that the cf with applied carbon paste was intermediately pressed down onto the heat treated cuo powder and this process was repeated several times to make sure the cf was fully covered with cuo powder the cuo cf cathode was dried at the room temperature for 24 h 2 3 1 2 fabrication of cuo cp cathode cuo cp electrode was fabricated by using the immobilization method the cp was immersed into the cuo suspension which was prepared by dispersing 1 00 g of synthesized cuo powder in 100 00 ml of ethanol and ultrasonicated for 30 min then the fabricated cathode was dried in an oven at 60 c for 2 h and subsequently heated in a furnace at 300 c for 2 h 2 3 1 3 characterization of cathode the phase composition crystal structure and surface morphology of bare and cuo loaded cathodes were determined using x ray diffractometer xrd from shimadzu xd 6000 and scanning electron microscopy sem from jeol jsm 6460la respectively 2 4 mfc construction and operation the schematic diagram of the double chambered mfc reactor is demonstrated in fig 1 it was constructed by assembling two acrylic plates with the same dimension of 10 cm l 10 cm w 20 cm h with the net volume of 1 40 l both anodic and cathodic chambers were separated by nafion 117 pem ion power inc usa which was treated using h2o2 and h2so4 according to the method as reported by ghasemi et al 12 cfs in the dimension of 9 5 cm were used as anode and cathode copper wires were utilized to connect the anode to the cathode across an external resistor of 1 kω the synthetic wastewater was the medium in the anodic chamber while 20 mg l 1 of organic pollutants caffeine and phenol was treated in the cathodic chamber the system was operated in fed batch mode at ambient temperature for 168 h per cycle the effects of organic pollutants and carbon based cathode materials in the cathodic chamber were examined under aeration condition the cathodic chamber was continuously aerated with air by using aeration stone and aeration pump caffeine and phenol were chosen to evaluate the effect of organic pollutants in the cathodic chamber on the removal efficiency and bioelectricity generation by using cf the comparative study of cod removal efficiency and power performance between different carbon based cathode materials cf and cp for mineralization of caffeine was carried out the conditions of the studies are summarized in table 1 2 5 evaluation of mfc performance the voltage output across the external resistance was recorded by using a data logger midi logger gl820 graphtec china the external resistance was varied from 20 kω to 10 ω using a resistor box to perform the polarization study the power density pd mw m 2 of the system was calculated as shown in eq 1 1 p d vi a where v is voltage output in volt v i is the current in ampere a and a is the area of cathode 0 0045 m2 the half cell potentials of the anode and cathode were measured using a reference electrode ag agcl for the evaluation of different cathode materials on the performance of mfc system the internal resistance of the system was calculated based on the slope of the half cell potential of anode and cathode samples were collected from the anodic and cathodic chambers daily for analysis of cod and dissolved oxygen do the cod and do concentration were measured using hach dr 2800 hach usa and bante980 benchtop do meter china respectively the cod analysis methods of synthetic wastewater and caffeine are the reactor digestion and spectrometric methods the samples were centrifuged by using centrifuge cence l500 china at 4200 rpm for 10 mins before digestion the samples were digested under strongly acidic dichromate solution at 150 c for 2 h and cooling down at room temperature for 1 h the blank was prepared using distilled water and digested under strongly acidic dichromate solution the blank was then inserted in the cell holder of a hach 2800 spectrophotometer to set blank the spectrophotometer after that the cod values of the samples were measured using spectrophotometer the cod removal efficiency code of synthetic wastewater and caffeine were evaluated by using formula 2 cod e c 0 c t c 0 100 where c0 is the initial cod concentration in mg l 1 and ct is the cod concentration at certain reaction time t h in mg l 1 photometry is the method that used to measure the concentration of caffeine and phenol with the aid of ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer from mesu lab instruments me uv1300 the calibration was prepared using a series of standard solutions of caffeine and phenol in the range of 0 10 20 30 and 40 mg l 1 the absorbance of all standard caffeine and phenol solutions at a maximum wavelength of 284 and 281 nm respectively were measured using a photometric mode a quantitative calibration curve of the absorbance of the standard solutions based on the lambert beer s law was produced as a reference to determine the concentration of the caffeine and phenol the removal efficiencies re of caffeine and phenol were calculated based on eq 3 3 r e d 0 d t d t 100 where d0 is the initial concentration of caffeine and phenol in mg l 1 and dt is the concentration of caffeine and phenol at certain reaction time t h in mg l 1 the kinetic study was carried out to investigate the removal rate of caffeine and phenol and cod removal rate constant of caffeine using pseudo first order kinetic model 13 the coulombic efficiency ce was obtained using the ratio of total recovered coulombs to the theoretical produced coulombs from the substrate 14 4 ce c p c t 100 where cp is the total coulombs in c and calculated by using formula 5 c p i dt where i is the current in ampere a the theoretical amount of coulombs produced from organic matter ct c was evaluated using formula eq 6 6 c t fbv cod m where f is the faraday s constant 96 485c mol 1 b is the number of moles of electrons generated per mol of substrate v is the volume of substrate in l cod is the change in cod concentration over one batch in g l 1 and m is the molecular weight of substrate in g mol 1 all mfc experiments were repeated three times the results were averaged and the measure of variability of the experiments was presented by using standard deviation error bars 3 results and discussion 3 1 anodic chamber cod of the samples in the anodic chamber was measured every 24 h until 168 h for every batch and was demonstrated in fig 2 cod removal efficiency increased as a function of time due to the continuous consumption of organic substrate by microbes the cod removal efficiency increased sharply during the first 24 h due to higher consumption of organic substrate during initial operation previous study by oon et al reported that cod removal efficiency was governed by the metabolism of microbes in the anodic chamber 15 the oxidation of acetate fuels by microbes contributed to the drastic decrease of the cod concentration microbial oxidation is the main reaction that occurred in the anodic chamber as shown in eq 7 7 ch 3 coo 2h 2 o 2co 2 7h 8e the oxidation of acetate produced electrons and protons these electrons and protons will be transferred to the cathode through pem and external circuit respectively the cod removal efficiencies of anodic chamber when phenol and caffeine were treated in the cathodic chamber by using cuo cf cathode were 80 84 3 01 and 70 37 2 46 respectively similar trends were observed when bare cf cathode was utilized to treat phenol and caffeine in the cathodic chamber with 60 16 3 85 and 55 94 3 33 respectively the cod removal efficiency in the anodic chamber when phenol treated in the cathodic chamber was slightly higher 10 47 and 4 22 than caffeine using cuo cf and bare cf cathodes respectively based on fig 2 higher cod removal efficiency in the anodic chamber was obtained for bare cp and cuo cp cathodes 61 56 2 80 and 75 55 3 39 as compared with that of bare cf and cuo cf cathodes 55 94 3 33 and 70 37 2 46 when used for the treatment of caffeine in the cathodic chamber this phenomenon could be due to the orr reactivity of the cp was higher than cf this higher orr reactivity contributed to higher demand of protons and electrons and thus increased the stimulation of electrochemical active bacteria to consume substrate and transfer the electrons to the anode through oxidation process these higher electrons and protons generated and transferred to the cathode through external circuit and pem respectively could react with oxygen to produce hydroxyl radicals oh through orr for the cleavage of caffeine molecules in the cathodic chamber besides orr reactivity dependent on the electrical conductivity of electrode the electrical conductivity of cp 3 57 105 ω 1 m 1 was higher than cf 3 33 104 ω 1 m 1 led to higher orr reactivity table s2 this higher electrical conductivity of cp was advantageous for the reduction of the ohmic resistance as well as the internal resistance of a system which could facilitate the transfer of protons and electrons from anode to the cathode and thus higher current generation was achieved consequently the higher current generation stimulated the microbial oxidation for electron transfer at anode besides the presence of cuo as cathodic catalyst enhanced the orr in the cathodic chamber and thus increased the electrons received by the cathode due to the higher microbial oxidation in the anodic chamber ce is a measure for the fraction of electrons obtained from microbial oxidation of organic substrate in the anodic chamber that ends up as electrical current 14 the ces for all batches were presented in table 2 the ce for mfc with cuo cf for treatment of phenol 3 64 0 24 was higher than caffeine 3 00 0 15 this might be due to the molecular structure of phenol was smaller than caffeine as shown in table s1 thus higher fraction of electrons contributed to the power generation instead for degradation of organic pollutants cf 1 71 0 06 has lower ce than cp 2 36 0 14 due to cf possessed lower oxygen reduction rate than cp and less favorable for the organic matter to be consumed for electricity generation 16 lower ce indicated lower amount of acetate oxidized to electrons thus lower power was generated competitive processes such as fermentation and methanogenesis as well as bacteria growth led to lower ce obtained in the mfc system 15 3 2 effect of different organic pollutants fig 3 displays the pollutants removal efficiency in the cathodic chamber of mfc by using bare cf and cuo cf cathodes caffeine and phenol were used to investigate the influence of chemical structure on the removal efficiency of organic pollutants in this study in the mfc with bare cf cathode results showed that removal efficiency of phenol 24 85 1 36 was almost 12 times higher than caffeine 2 14 0 36 besides the removal efficiency of phenol after 48 h was 43 23 1 18 which could only be attained for treatment of caffeine at 120 h this phenomenon occurred due to the molecular structure of phenol was significantly smaller than caffeine phenol mainly consists of one hydroxyl group bonded to the aromatic ring while caffeine is a purine alkaloid that is made up of an imidazole ring 5 member ring with 2 nitrogen atoms fused to a pyrimidine ring 6 member ring with 2 nitrogen atoms as shown in table s1 hence the simple molecular structure of phenol contributed to its ease degradation as compared with that of caffeine with a complex structure similar study was reported by oon et al the complexity of molecular structure significantly influenced the decolorisation efficiency and bioelectricity generation of the constructed wetland mfc system 17 the results showed that the decolorization efficiency and power density of monoazo dye acid red 18 96 1 58 mw m 2 was approximately 1 6 fold higher than that of diazo dye congo red 60 1 02 mw m 2 this can be ascribed to the higher the number of the azo bond present in the structure more electrons were required to cleave the azo bond linkage of congo red as compared with that of acid red besides the molecule bonding will affect the degradation of a particular compound hydrogen bonding is a fundamental of chemical structure and reactivity the existence of different amount of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors in a particular molecule associated to the different intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions 18 caffeine possesses three hydrogen bond acceptors with two carbonyl oxygens and one basic nitrogen as shown in table s1 the interaction of hydrogen bond acceptors caused the well behaved hydrogen bonds to water molecules which contributed to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding 19 the presence of three hydrogen bond acceptors in the caffeine contributed to a stronger hydrogen bonding thus caffeine was difficult to be degraded than phenol 20 alternatively phenol acted as hydrogen bond donor with the presence of oh group in its structure increased the rate of reaction and decreased the stability of benzene ring in addition hydrogen bond has significant influence on the solubility the solubility of phenol was 81 higher than caffeine the higher the solubility the easier the molecules to be degraded and dissolved in water hence the removal efficiency of phenol 90 15 0 79 was greater than caffeine 85 23 1 59 at the end of 168 h similar trend can be observed for the application of catalyst on cf the removal efficiency of phenol 67 10 0 83 was significantly greater than the caffeine 25 11 1 22 at first 24 h the application of cuo on cf elevated the orr reactivity in the cathodic chamber and led to rapid oxygen reduction rate for the degradation of phenol and caffeine in the electrocatalytic degradation of phenol wang et al reported that a direct electron transfer process occurred between the electrode surface active layer and the phenol 21 phenol was adsorbed on the electrode surface and degraded by hydroxyl radicals oh and further decomposed into small molecular acids such as maleic fumaric and oxalic acids carbon dioxide and water 22 the degradation mechanism of phenol can be hypothesized and summarized as follows 8 phenol oh catechol hydroquinone 9 catechol hydroquinone oh benzoquinone 10 benzoquinone oh maleic acid fumaric acid 11 maleic acid fumaric acid oh oxalic acid 12 oxalic acid oh carbon dioxide water based on fig 4 a the uv region from 243 nm to 302 nm in the uv vis spectrum of caffeine was attributed to the n π electronic transition of caffeine 23 the main absorption peak of caffeine located at 284 nm was referred to the co chromophore absorption of caffeine 24 in phenol π π transition contributed to the two absorption peaks at 205 nm and 281 nm as displayed in fig 4 b which corresponded to cyclohexane and benzene respectively 25 in fig 4 b the absorption peak of phenol reached nearly at the baseline at 168 h however the absorption peak of caffeine still can be seen obviously as demonstrated in fig 4 a this result indicated that longer time was taken by bare cf cathode to remove caffeine compared with phenol this finding was compatible with the results of removal efficiency obtained in this study fig 3 in addition a drastic decrease in the absorption peak of caffeine and phenol after 24 h under the presence of cuo catalyst can be observed as shown in fig 4 c and d respectively this could be due to the presence of catalyst enhanced the oxygen reduction rate in the cathodic chamber and led to efficient electron transfer for the degradation of phenol and caffeine under the presence of cuo catalyst the removal efficiency of caffeine was nearly 15 lower than that of phenol due to the presence of electron withdrawing groups in caffeine such as methyl groups in the pyrimidine ring restrain the ring opening 26 hence caffeine was hard to be degraded as compared to phenol in contrast to caffeine the strong electron donating group oh group in phenol aided in activating the benzene ring towards electrophilic attack and weakening the conjugated effect in phenol which led to the ease of degradation of phenol 27 there are several factors influence the bioelectricity generation in mfc for instance types of organic pollutants in the cathodic chamber and presence of catalyst on the cathode the electricity performance of mfc for treatment of caffeine and phenol was presented in table 2 as shown in table 2 both bare cf and cuo cf cathodes demonstrated better performance in electricity generation when phenol acted as model pollutant as compared with that of caffeine in the cathodic chamber results showed that the maximum voltage output vmax obtained for mfc system in the decreasing order as follows cuo cf phenol 335 30 7 25 mv cuo cf caffeine 323 80 6 55 mv bare cf phenol 171 90 4 73 mv bare cf caffeine 142 20 3 82 mv the voltage output performance of mfc was consistent with the cod removal efficiency in the anodic chamber fig 2 cuo cf cathode used for treatment of phenol possessed the highest cod removal efficiency in the anodic chamber which indicated that higher amount of acetate was utilized for the generation of electrons besides mfc with bare cf cathode produced two times larger maximum power density pmax when phenol was treated in the cathodic chamber as compared with that of caffeine this phenomenon could be due to the presence of more electrophilic and nucleophilic functional groups in caffeine than phenol thus more electrons were utilized for removal of caffeine than electricity generation initially the electrons reacted with the oxygen and protons to generate the hydrogen peroxide h2o2 as shown in eq 13 then the reduction of h2o2 through one electron pathway produced oh and hydroxide ions oh eq 14 13 o 2 2h 2e h 2 o 2 14 h 2 o 2 e oh oh subsequently the oh attacked the c4c5 double bond and decomposed caffeine to the weak acidic groups such as dimethylparabanic acid the proposed mechanism for caffeine degradation as follows 28 15 caffeine oh dimethylparabanic acid 16 dimethylparabanic acid oh di n hydroxymethyl parabanic acid another study by rosal et al also reported that caffeine could be degraded by oxygen free radicals and h2o2 which attacked at the nucleophilic c 8 position of the imidazole ring and formed 1 3 7 trimethyluric acid theophyline and other n demethylated products such as 1 3 dimethyluric acid and 6 amino 5 n formylmethyl amino 1 3 dimethyl uracil 29 in addition the presence of electron donating groups carbonyl groups co induced the caffeine molecule to be nucleophilic hence resisting caffeine to be reduced this was in accordance with the removal rate of caffeine where removal rate of bare cf cathode for treatment of phenol 0 0119 0 0006 h 1 was 13 20 times than that of caffeine 0 0009 0 0002 h 1 at the first 24 h table s3 in the study by oon et al it was reported that the electron releasing groups caused the opposite effect pushing electrons towards the redox active centre azo bond 13 therefore reactive green 19 is more nucleophilic and causing it less feasible to be reduced than reactive red 120 the decolourisation rate of reactive green 19 was 0 028 h 1 slightly higher than that of reactive red 120 0 021 h 1 the degradation process of organic pollutants in the cathodic chamber was affected by the orr on the cathode the reduction potential and electron transfer number played an important role on the orr reduction potential is a tendency of a chemical species to be reduced by gaining an electron the more positive reduction potential of cuo cf cathode at any current density than that of bare cf contributed to higher affinity for electrons and tendency to be reduced fig s2 these higher affinity for electrons increased the number of electron transfer from anode to the cuo cf cathode and thus higher orr rate in the cathodic chamber produced more oh for decomposition of the caffeine molecules into di n hydroxymethyl parabanic acid a lower reducing potential of bare cf led to lower number of electrons transferred to the bare cf and thus hindered the orr on the cathode as well as decreased the production of oh for the cleavage of caffeine these results were compatible with the 13 33 times higher removal rate of caffeine by cuo cf 0 0120 0 0005 h 1 which contributed to 25 11 1 22 of removal efficiency of caffeine as compared with that of bare cf 0 0009 0 0002 h 1 with 2 14 0 36 at 24 h besides the internal resistance of bare cf 993 62 ω was 2 fold higher than that of cuo cf 502 80 ω which restricted the electron transferred from anode to the cathode hence less reduction of h2o2 to produce the oh which used to decompose the caffeine molecules similar finding was reported by wu et al in which different electrode potential significantly affected the production rate of h2o2 for the degradation of organic 30 another study by yu et al the production of h2o2 was varied with different electrode materials due to variation in the electron transfer number 31 wang et al also reported that electron transfer number quantitatively reflected the reaction kinetics and selectivity of orr pathways 32 the higher electron transfer number contributed to higher current density and thus higher reaction kinetics could be obtained this phenomenon could be observed in the treatment of phenol in which cuo cf 0 0463 0 0027 h 1 yielded a higher jsc of 257 33 4 00 ma m 2 which contributed to higher removal rate of phenol as compared with that of bare cf 0 0119 0 0006 h 1 with jsc of 73 33 4 44 ma m 2 cuo catalyst played a crucial role on the power generation performance of mfc mfc system with cuo cf cathode produced the highest pmax and short circuit current density jsc 33 37 4 62 mw m 2 and 257 33 4 00 ma m 2 for treatment of phenol the pmax and jsc decreased to 10 01 1 50 mw m 2 and 73 33 4 44 ma m 2 which was nearly 30 lower than the case for treatment of phenol using bare cf cathode in the absence of cuo catalyst this could be due to the internal resistance in restraint of power generation in mfc as the higher internal resistance will consume higher amount of power production similar finding has been reported by oon et al in which mfc with lower internal resistance was able to generate larger power during optimal condition 15 the presence of cuo catalyst enhanced the oxygen reduction rate and contributed to the higher number of electrons transferred from anode to the cathode for electricity generation cuo catalyst on the surface of cf was beneficial to reduce the activation overpotential and produce higher kinetics oxygen reduction the removal rates of phenol and caffeine at 48 h increased about 75 16 and 91 45 respectively which indicated higher kinetics of oxygen reduction rate in the cathodic chamber as compared to bare cf cathode 3 3 effect of carbon based cathode materials on mineralization of caffeine the efficiency of two different carbon based cathode materials which are cf and cp on the mineralization of caffeine have been evaluated through cod analysis results revealed that cp surpassed cf in the mineralization of caffeine as shown in fig 5 bare cp could achieve up to 90 of cod removal at the end of 168 h when bare cf was used as cathode the cod removal efficiency was inferior to others it could only reach up to 81 at the end of 168 h this implied that bare cf cathode yielded low electrochemical reaction activity which caused a relatively low removal rate of caffeine 33 this could be explained by the fact that the efficacy of the cathode strongly depends on the reduction kinetics of terminal electron acceptors such as oxygen 34 the cathodic reduction of oxygen is an electrochemical phenomenon occurred on the surface of cathode thus the surface morphology of cathode plays a crucial role in the reduction kinetics of oxygen fig 6 a i and b i demonstrate the surface morphology of bare cf and bare cp at various magnifications cf has carbon fiber networks with smooth surface caused poor oxygen adsorption for reduction reactions in contrast with cf the porous and flaky structure on cp could provide a rough surface that favoured the oxygen diffusion and adsorption which contributed to the high activity for orr hence the difference in the surface morphologies of cf and cp led to different orr kinetics in the cathodic chamber besides two fold higher cod removal efficiency was obtained by bare cp compared with that of cf at 96 h since cp exhibited better electrical properties than cf higher electrical conductivity of cp 3 57 105 ω 1 m 1 than cf 3 33 104 ω 1 m 1 contributed to higher catalytic activity thus higher orr reactivity attained by bare cp the high electrical conductivity of cp beneficial for the efficient transport of electrons for the electrochemical reduction process of oxygen and improve the overall electrochemical performance bare carbon based materials showed slow orr kinetics for the degradation of caffeine in the cathodic chamber thus cuo as the cathodic catalyst was loaded on cf and cp respectively to improve the orr reactivity the results showed that more than 80 cod removal efficiency attained by cuo cp and cuo cf that was 60 greater than bare cp and cf which only reached the cod removal efficiency below 20 at 72 h the presence of micron size particles on the surface of the cuo cf and cuo cp as shown in fig 6 a ii and 6 b ii indicated the successful attachment of cuo particles on the surface of cf and cp this denoted that the presence of cuo catalyst had enhanced the oxygen reduction rate consequently higher cod removal efficiency could be attained this was compatible with the study by sawant et al which reported that the addition of catalyst was beneficial to reduce the activation losses in the cathode and enhance the orr kinetics by decreasing the energy barrier or increasing the orr interface area 35 another study of martin et al demonstrated that the total cathodic resistance of carbon electrode was relatively higher than that of manganese iii oxide iron iii oxide and platinum electrode due to the carbon electrode exhibited higher overpotential and lower activity for orr 36 in the study by zhou et al also reported that different cathode materials contributed to different number of electron transfer and charge transfer resistance on the cathode 6 yu et al discovered that the orr catalyzed by cuo nanoparticles operated with two and four electrons pathways while cuo nanoparticles graphene nanosheets electrode mainly operated with four electrons pathway through the rotating ring disk electrode analysis 31 the application of cuo improved the catalytic activity of bare cf and cp due to cuo may have requisite levels of oxygen vacancies and high availability of active sites on the catalyst which could provide excellent catalytic activity for the orr 37 38 previous study by zhang et al reported that two oxygen fitting peaks were located at around 530 30 and 531 80 ev in a high resolution x ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectrum represented the co existence of both lattice oxygen and chemically adsorbed oxygen in cuo respectively 39 this result indicated that cuo possessed an excellent ability to transport the surface lattice oxygen in a redox environment which was highly active for orr the oxygen was transferred from the lattice to the interface of catalyst and electrode then the resulting lattice oxygen vacancies on cuo were filled by the dissociative adsorbed oxygen and thus the orr promoted due to the higher oxygen diffusion and adsorption on the surface of the cuo furthermore cuo acted as active sites that increased the adsorption of oxygen containing substances on surface of substrate and thus enhanced the orr activity by increased the electron transfer efficiency 40 on the other hand cuo cp exhibited the highest cod removal efficiency 96 26 1 31 at the end of 168 h which was slightly higher than cuo cf 93 48 0 14 however cuo cp cathode 50 76 1 72 achieved 2 5 fold higher cod removal efficiency as compared with that of cuo cf cathode 20 30 1 32 at the first 24 h this could be due to the higher catalytic activity of cuo cp cathode accelerated the oxygen reduction rate in the cathodic chamber which could be attested by the kinetic study the results of the kinetic study revealed that cod removal rate constant of caffeine of cuo cp 0 0256 0 0023 h 1 was nearly three times greater than cuo cf 0 0094 0 0011 h 1 at the first 24 h as shown in table s3 the catalytic activity was related to the crystal structure and surface morphology of cathode in this study the cod removal efficiency can be strongly supported by the xrd and sem results based on fig 5 there is significant difference in the cod removal efficiency between bare cf and cp as compared with that of cuo cf and cuo cp the cod removal efficiency of bare cp was relatively higher than that of bare cf along the 168 h operation bare cp achieved two fold higher cod removal efficiency 47 05 4 76 as compared with that of bare cf 23 53 1 16 at 96 h this phenomenon could be due to the difference in the crystallinity of cf and cp as shown in xrd patterns the xrd results indicated that cp has a high crystalline nature structure while cf has an amorphous structure the intensity of the most intense characteristic peak located at 20 to 30 which referred to carbon in the bare cp fig 7 b was obviously higher than bare cf fig 7 a hence higher crystallinity of bare cp resulted in better catalytic performance compared to that of bare cf and aided in the cod removal nevertheless only slight difference in the cod removal efficiency obtained by cuo cf and cuo cp could be observed in fig 5 this implied that the cod removal efficiency was strongly influenced and dominated by the cuo catalytic activity which led to trivial difference in the cod removal efficiency between cuo cp and cuo cf besides the sem image as shown in fig 6 b ii depicted the rough surface of cuo cp cathode which covered with densely packed cuo particles this could provide more active sites for the electrocatalytic degradation of caffeine however smooth surface of the fiber in cf with less cuo particles attached on the surface could lead to relatively low catalytic activity of cuo cf cathode fig 6 a ii thus higher oxygen diffusion and adsorption on the surface of cuo cp than cuo cf lead to higher number of electrons transferred from the anode to the cathode and reacted with oxygen through the four electrons pathway eq 17 17 o 2 4h 4e 2h 2 o then adsorbed oxygen molecules o was produced on the active site of the cuo catalyst and endured sequential bond cleavage and reduction this was consistent with the finding of yap et al which reported that the oxygen molecules adsorbed on the catalyst surface and encountered an electron transfer to produce the active species such as oh and h2o2 11 this was evidenced by the do concentration in the cathodic chamber with cuo cp as cathode which was significantly lower compared with that of cuo cf as cathode along the 168 h operation as displayed in fig s1 lower do concentration indicated more oxygen was consumed in the cuo cp cathodic chamber due to higher orr occurred at cuo cp this could be explained by the fact that the oxygen molecules adsorbed on cuo cp and these oxygen oxygen bonds were decomposed to give adsorbed oxygen atoms the absorbed oxygen atoms then reduced by electrons to produce the active species such as oh and h2o2 for the cleavage of caffeine besides morphology of carbon based cathode materials the high orr catalytic activity was influenced by their electrical conductivity 35 the higher electrical conductivity of cp 3 57 105 ω 1 m 1 could provide higher catalytic activity on the cathode surface in the cathodic chamber by reducing the ohmic loss and mass transport loss of oxygen and thus resulted in a lower internal resistance as compared with cf 3 33 104 ω 1 m 1 41 fig s2 demonstrated the half cell potential of anode and cathode for different cathode materials used in mfc system under the variation of external resistance from 20 kω to 10 ω based on fig s2 cuo cp cathode exhibited higher potential that that of cuo cf bare cp and bare cf cathode at any current density this phenomenon could be due to the internal resistance of cuo cp 436 09 ω was relatively lower than that of other cathodes this lower internal resistance contributed to less restriction of electron passage to the cathode and thus higher jsc 253 33 17 78 ma m 2 was obtained internal resistance is one of the electrochemical limitations on the mfc efficacy which is greatly affected by the ohmic kinetic and transport limitation the results indicated that the application of cuo on cp or cf was beneficial to reduce the internal resistance up to 17 65 and 49 40 respectively this could be explained by the fact that the application of cuo on cathode surface could decrease the activation barrier for the orr to occur as well as increased the activation reaction rates on the anode and cathode electrodes in addition more positive reduction potential of cuo cp cathode contributed to higher affinity for electrons and tendency to be reduced thus higher electrons transfer rate to the cuo cp cathode resulted in a higher orr as well as power generation besides the anode potential increased with the current density as shown in fig s2 this might be due to the proton consumption for orr formed a concentration gradient that moved the protons towards the cathode and thus the proton concentration in the anodic chamber was reduced this phenomenon promoted the dissociation of hydrogen to provide more protons for the power demand 42 the increment in the anode potential at higher current density also led to the limitation of mass transport and hindered the electron transfer ability of electrochemical active bacteria to the cathode and thus lower removal efficiency of caffeine and power output were attained among the cathodes the performance of bare cf was the lowest in terms of removal efficiency 85 23 1 59 and pmax 4 70 0 66 mw m 2 due to highest internal resistance of bare cf 993 62 ω the internal resistance of bare cp 529 53 ω was relatively lower than the bare cf 993 62 ω due to higher electrical conductivity of cp 3 57 105 ω 1 m 1 allowed higher electron transfer from anode to the cathode and thus enhanced the orr kinetic in the cathodic chamber hence higher pmax 28 75 1 18 mw m 2 was obtained a correlation between the carbon based cathode materials and the bioelectricity generation was found to be similar to the trend of the cod removal efficiency the pmax of this study decreased in the order of cuo cp 28 75 1 18 mw m 2 cuo cf 26 07 1 90 mw m 2 cp 13 86 0 64 mw m 2 cf 4 70 0 66 mw m 2 almost three times greater pmax was achieved by bare cp as compared with that of bare cf this could be related to the better electrical properties of cp as compared to that of cf the electrical conductivity of bare cp 3 57 105 ω 1 m 1 was 8 fold higher than cf 3 33 104 ω 1 m 1 and thus contributed to the sufficient velocity of the electron transfer for orr the cuo catalyst enhanced the orr and accelerated the degradation of caffeine which led to more cleavage of caffeine to release more electrons into the system and thus diminishing the internal resistance and increasing the pmax of the system this phenomenon was attested when five times greater pmax was obtained using cuo cf compared with that of bare cf similar phenomenon could be observed for cuo cp where the pmax was two times greater than that of bare cp this could be explained by the effective potential acting at the catalytic site which depends on the electrical conductivity of the cathode the application of cuo catalyst enhanced the orr reactivity in the cathodic chamber and thus more oxygen was required for the orr to occur this rapid oxygen reduction rate led to higher number of electrons transferred from anode and collected by the cathode for electricity generation similar finding was reported by bhowmick et al in which the coating of cobalt oxide and iron oxide on the activated carbon ac increased the maximum volumetric power density from 2 95 w m 3 bare ac to 6 62 w m 3 and 5 06 w m 3 respectively 43 another study by merino jimenez et al reported the use of carbon cloth cf and stainless stain as cathode for investigation of the effect of carbon based materials and application of ac catalyst layer on bare cathodes 44 the results revealed that the addition of the ac layer on the stainless steel contributed to the highest power output of 62 μw nevertheless cf with ac layer obtained the lowest power output 41 μw this could be attributed to the higher electrical conductivity of stainless steel in the study by mashkour and rahimnejad different carbon based materials such as graphite carbon cloth carbon paper and carbon nanotube platinum cnt pt coated carbon paper were applied as cathodes for the treatment of actual wastewater in the cathodic chamber 45 the carbon paper electrode modified by cnt pt generated six times higher power 16 26 mw m 2 as compared with that of bare carbon paper 2 76 mw m 2 this was owing to the distribution of high electrical conductivity of the platinum and the high active surface area of the carbon nanotube on the surface of the carbon paper provided a desirable conductive porous surface for the rapid reaction between the electrons and oxygen 45 4 conclusion in conclusion the effects of organic pollutants and carbon based cathode materials on the pollutants removal efficiency and bioelectricity generation were evaluated using mfc integrated electrocatalytic process results revealed that higher removal efficiency of phenol compared with that of caffeine was achieved by bare cf and cuo cf cathodes this indicated that phenol was more susceptible to degradation compared with that of caffeine the presence of methyl groups in the pyrimidine ring restrained the ring opening of caffeine molecule and was hard to be degraded compared with that of phenol mfc with cuo cf cathode generated 1 28 times higher pmax 33 37 4 62 mw m 2 for the treatment of phenol than caffeine 26 07 1 90 mw m 2 in the cathodic chamber the catalytic activity of cathode significantly affected the mineralization of caffeine and bioelectricity generation which was related to the crystal structure and surface morphology of cathode the cod removal efficiency attained by bare cp cathode at 96 h was two times higher compared with that of bare cf cathode which mainly attributed to the high crystallinity nature of cp and amorphous structure of cf cuo cp cathode 50 76 1 72 achieved 2 5 fold higher cod removal efficiency compared with that of cuo cf cathode 20 30 1 32 at the first 24 h the rough surface of cuo cp cathode which covered with densely packed cuo particles provided more active site for the electrocatalytic degradation of caffeine the removal rate of caffeine by cuo cp cathode was almost 63 28 higher compared with that of cuo cf cathode cuo cp and cuo cf cathodes possessed 80 higher cod removal efficiency compared with that of bare cp and cf cathodes due to the cuo catalyst enhanced orr and accelerated the degradation of

13259,cathode plays an important role on the oxygen reduction reaction orr reactivity in the microbial fuel cell integrated electrocatalytic process for the effective degradation of organic pollutants comparative study of caffeine and phenol as the organic pollutants in the cathodic chamber was investigated in terms of removal efficiency and bioelectricity generation results revealed that the highest removal efficiency of phenol 96 89 1 26 and maximum power density 33 37 4 62 mw m 2 were attained by copper ii oxide loaded carbon felt cuo cf cathode besides the removal efficiency of phenol was nearly 12 fold higher 24 85 1 36 using cuo cf cathode compared with that of caffeine 2 14 0 36 at the first 24 h the effect of carbon based cathode materials on the mineralization of caffeine in the cathodic chamber was evaluated using carbon felt cf and carbon plate cp both cuo cp and bare cp cathodes surpassed cuo cf and bare cf cathodes in the chemical oxygen demand cod removal and bioelectricity generation higher crystallinity nature and electrical conductivity 3 57 105 ω 1 m 1 of cp compared with that of amorphous structure and lower electrical conductivity of bare cf 3 33 104 ω 1 m 1 contributed to higher orr reactivity and efficient transport of electrons for bioelectricity generation the cod removal efficiency of synthetic wastewater in the anodic chamber and bioelectricity generation of this integrated system were affected by the types of organic pollutants and carbon based cathode materials in the cathodic chamber graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microbial fuel cell caffeine degradation phenol degradation carbon based cathode materials oxygen reduction reaction 1 introduction caffeine and phenol are the common emerging pollutants present in the wastewater plants this is due to the high consumption and continuous discharge from pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries into the rivers several wastewater treatments such as flocculation adsorption and membrane filtration have been used to remove these emerging pollutants however these methods are less efficient due to several drawbacks such as high amount of sludge production special absorbent materials and additional handling respectively consequently the operating cost is increased 1 therefore development of alternative methods for treatment of caffeine and phenol has gained tremendous attention worldwide microbial fuel cell mfc has been intensively utilized over the last decade as a promising and sustainable technology with minimum energy consumption in wastewater treatment mfc is an energy conversion device which able to harvest electric energy directly from organic matters in the presence of electrogenic bacteria while simultaneously perform pollutant removal in the anodic chamber the oxidation process of organic substrates by the microbes produces carbon dioxide protons and electrons 2 the electrons produced during the oxidation process will flow from anode to cathode through the external circuit and being reduced when reacted with protons and oxygen thus produced electricity 3 mfc has attracted considerable interests among the researchers in recent years due to its specific advantages in the application of wastewater treatment in comparison with conventional electrochemical cell mfc does not require external energy supply for system operation besides mfc works in the treatment of low concentration substrates at temperatures below 20 c where anaerobic digestion technology fails to function 4 the selection of the electrode material is crucial for the operational cost and efficiency of mfcs as the performance of mfc directly depends on the kinetics of the electrode reactions within the fuel cell and the electrodes contribute to a significant portion on the total cost of mfc 5 different electrode materials cause significant effects on the electron transfer electrode resistance and the rate of electrode surface reaction 6 hence development of high performing cost effective cathodes is vital in the practical application of mfc since cathode is one of the major key factors which limits the overall process efficiency of mfc a wide variety of materials have been examined as cathodes in mfcs including carbon cloth carbon paper and carbon felt cf 5 carbon based materials are reliable materials that often applied as electrodes the use of carbon based materials has significantly improved the mfc performance and it extremely reduces the cost of mfc system due to its flexibility in size and shape 3 some metal based materials with high electrical conductivity such as stainless steel mesh nickel mesh and nickel foam are more cost effective compared to the carbon based materials however the low cathode potentials will cause corrosion problem and finally lead to poor performance 7 this revealed that instability of the metal based electrode materials may limit their applications in mfcs the oxygen reduction reaction orr is a fundamental process occurring on the cathode an efficient electrocatalyst is essential to increase the rate of orr for enhanced performances of system in terms of power generation and pollutant removal slow kinetic of cathode reactions usually hinders the power generation in mfc cathodes based on platinum pt catalysts were heavily applied in mfcs and recent studies have compared the performance of pt catalysts on activated carbon cathodes and carbon cloth based cathodes 8 since pt is expensive other alternative catalysts such as palladium manganese oxide and cobalt oxide 9 were developed as these materials are more economic than pt and less hazardous to environment copper ii oxide cuo appears as an alternative orr catalyst due to its high catalytic activity low cost and simple synthesis method cuo exhibited high stability in the aqueous environment at room temperature and high efficiency in the water oxidation 10 these advantages contributed to the great potential of cuo in the electrochemical applications such as heterogeneous catalyst and sensor in this study different organic pollutants caffeine and phenol were treated in the cathodic chamber using cf effect of these organic pollutants on the removal efficiency and bioelectricity generation were explored in addition comparative study of cuo loaded on two different carbon based cathode materials carbon plate cp and cf for orr in mfcs was investigated the effects and differences of these carbon based cathode materials on bioelectricity generation and pollutant treatment were evaluated in terms of power generation and chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency of caffeine in the cathodic chamber 2 material and methods 2 1 materials caffeine

collected from wastewater treatment plant of a rubber gloves manufacturing factory before used as supporting media in the anodic chamber the anodic chamber which filled with inoculated plastic biofilm carriers was fed up with 1 0 l synthetic wastewater made up of 0 375 g l 1 ch3coona 3 40 g l 1 k2hpo4 4 00 g l 1 kh2po4 0 31 g l 1 nh4cl 0 13 g l 1 kcl 0 116 g l 1 nacl and 0 10 g l 1 mgcl2 6h2o and sealed to maintain the anaerobic condition 2 3 cathodic chamber 2 3 1 fabrication of cathode using different methods the synthesis of cuo powder was carried out accordingly to our previous study 11 a cf sg 222 maido corporation japan and a commercial cp in the dimension of 9 5 cm were used as the substrates of cathode for fabrication of cuo cf and cuo loaded carbon plate cuo cp electrodes respectively both materials were ultrasonically cleaned by using deionized water and ethanol respectively and then dried in an oven at 60 c before loading of cuo as catalysts 2 3 1 1 fabrication of cuo cf cathode the synthesized cuo powder was heat treated in a furnace at 300 c for 2 h then the carbon paste was applied on the cleaned cf and a blade was used to ensure the homogeneous smear of carbon paste on the cf after that the cf with applied carbon paste was intermediately pressed down onto the heat treated cuo powder and this process was repeated several times to make sure the cf was fully covered with cuo powder the cuo cf cathode was dried at the room temperature for 24 h 2 3 1 2 fabrication of cuo cp cathode cuo cp electrode was fabricated by using the immobilization method the cp was immersed into the cuo suspension which was prepared by dispersing 1 00 g of synthesized cuo powder in 100 00 ml of ethanol and ultrasonicated for 30 min then the fabricated cathode was dried in an oven at 60 c for 2 h and subsequently heated in a furnace at 300 c for 2 h 2 3 1 3 characterization of cathode the phase composition crystal structure and surface morphology of bare and cuo loaded cathodes were determined using x ray diffractometer xrd from shimadzu xd 6000 and scanning electron microscopy sem from jeol jsm 6460la respectively 2 4 mfc construction and operation the schematic diagram of the double chambered mfc reactor is demonstrated in fig 1 it was constructed by assembling two acrylic plates with the same dimension of 10 cm l 10 cm w 20 cm h with the net volume of 1 40 l both anodic and cathodic chambers were separated by nafion 117 pem ion power inc usa which was treated using h2o2 and h2so4 according to the method as reported by ghasemi et al 12 cfs in the dimension of 9 5 cm were used as anode and cathode copper wires were utilized to connect the anode to the cathode across an external resistor of 1 kω the synthetic wastewater was the medium in the anodic chamber while 20 mg l 1 of organic pollutants caffeine and phenol was treated in the cathodic chamber the system was operated in fed batch mode at ambient temperature for 168 h per cycle the effects of organic pollutants and carbon based cathode materials in the cathodic chamber were examined under aeration condition the cathodic chamber was continuously aerated with air by using aeration stone and aeration pump caffeine and phenol were chosen to evaluate the effect of organic pollutants in the cathodic chamber on the removal efficiency and bioelectricity generation by using cf the comparative study of cod removal efficiency and power performance between different carbon based cathode materials cf and cp for mineralization of caffeine was carried out the conditions of the studies are summarized in table 1 2 5 evaluation of mfc performance the voltage output across the external resistance was recorded by using a data logger midi logger gl820 graphtec china the external resistance was varied from 20 kω to 10 ω using a resistor box to perform the polarization study the power density pd mw m 2 of the system was calculated as shown in eq 1 1 p d vi a where v is voltage output in volt v i is the current in ampere a and a is the area of cathode 0 0045 m2 the half cell potentials of the anode and cathode were measured using a reference electrode ag agcl for the evaluation of different cathode materials on the performance of mfc system the internal resistance of the system was calculated based on the slope of the half cell potential of anode and cathode samples were collected from the anodic and cathodic chambers daily for analysis of cod and dissolved oxygen do the cod and do concentration were measured using hach dr 2800 hach usa and bante980 benchtop do meter china respectively the cod analysis methods of synthetic wastewater and caffeine are the reactor digestion and spectrometric methods the samples were centrifuged by using centrifuge cence l500 china at 4200 rpm for 10 mins before digestion the samples were digested under strongly acidic dichromate solution at 150 c for 2 h and cooling down at room temperature for 1 h the blank was prepared using distilled water and digested under strongly acidic dichromate solution the blank was then inserted in the cell holder of a hach 2800 spectrophotometer to set blank the spectrophotometer after that the cod values of the samples were measured using spectrophotometer the cod removal efficiency code of synthetic wastewater and caffeine were evaluated by using formula 2 cod e c 0 c t c 0 100 where c0 is the initial cod concentration in mg l 1 and ct is the cod concentration at certain reaction time t h in mg l 1 photometry is the method that used to measure the concentration of caffeine and phenol with the aid of ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer from mesu lab instruments me uv1300 the calibration was prepared using a series of standard solutions of caffeine and phenol in the range of 0 10 20 30 and 40 mg l 1 the absorbance of all standard caffeine and phenol solutions at a maximum wavelength of 284 and 281 nm respectively were measured using a photometric mode a quantitative calibration curve of the absorbance of the standard solutions based on the lambert beer s law was produced as a reference to determine the concentration of the caffeine and phenol the removal efficiencies re of caffeine and phenol were calculated based on eq 3 3 r e d 0 d t d t 100 where d0 is the initial concentration of caffeine and phenol in mg l 1 and dt is the concentration of caffeine and phenol at certain reaction time t h in mg l 1 the kinetic study was carried out to investigate the removal rate of caffeine and phenol and cod removal rate constant of caffeine using pseudo first order kinetic model 13 the coulombic efficiency ce was obtained using the ratio of total recovered coulombs to the theoretical produced coulombs from the substrate 14 4 ce c p c t 100 where cp is the total coulombs in c and calculated by using formula 5 c p i dt where i is the current in ampere a the theoretical amount of coulombs produced from organic matter ct c was evaluated using formula eq 6 6 c t fbv cod m where f is the faraday s constant 96 485c mol 1 b is the number of moles of electrons generated per mol of substrate v is the volume of substrate in l cod is the change in cod concentration over one batch in g l 1 and m is the molecular weight of substrate in g mol 1 all mfc experiments were repeated three times the results were averaged and the measure of variability of the experiments was presented by using standard deviation error bars 3 results and discussion 3 1 anodic chamber cod of the samples in the anodic chamber was measured every 24 h until 168 h for every batch and was demonstrated in fig 2 cod removal efficiency increased as a function of time due to the continuous consumption of organic substrate by microbes the cod removal efficiency increased sharply during the first 24 h due to higher consumption of organic substrate during initial operation previous study by oon et al reported that cod removal efficiency was governed by the metabolism of microbes in the anodic chamber 15 the oxidation of acetate fuels by microbes contributed to the drastic decrease of the cod concentration microbial oxidation is the main reaction that occurred in the anodic chamber as shown in eq 7 7 ch 3 coo 2h 2 o 2co 2 7h 8e the oxidation of acetate produced electrons and protons these electrons and protons will be transferred to the cathode through pem and external circuit respectively the cod removal efficiencies of anodic chamber when phenol and caffeine were treated in the cathodic chamber by using cuo cf cathode were 80 84 3 01 and 70 37 2 46 respectively similar trends were observed when bare cf cathode was utilized to treat phenol and caffeine in the cathodic chamber with 60 16 3 85 and 55 94 3 33 respectively the cod removal efficiency in the anodic chamber when phenol treated in the cathodic chamber was slightly higher 10 47 and 4 22 than caffeine using cuo cf and bare cf cathodes respectively based on fig 2 higher cod removal efficiency in the anodic chamber was obtained for bare cp and cuo cp cathodes 61 56 2 80 and 75 55 3 39 as compared with that of bare cf and cuo cf cathodes 55 94 3 33 and 70 37 2 46 when used for the treatment of caffeine in the cathodic chamber this phenomenon could be due to the orr reactivity of the cp was higher than cf this higher orr reactivity contributed to higher demand of protons and electrons and thus increased the stimulation of electrochemical active bacteria to consume substrate and transfer the electrons to the anode through oxidation process these higher electrons and protons generated and transferred to the cathode through external circuit and pem respectively could react with oxygen to produce hydroxyl radicals oh through orr for the cleavage of caffeine molecules in the cathodic chamber besides orr reactivity dependent on the electrical conductivity of electrode the electrical conductivity of cp 3 57 105 ω 1 m 1 was higher than cf 3 33 104 ω 1 m 1 led to higher orr reactivity table s2 this higher electrical conductivity of cp was advantageous for the reduction of the ohmic resistance as well as the internal resistance of a system which could facilitate the transfer of protons and electrons from anode to the cathode and thus higher current generation was achieved consequently the higher current generation stimulated the microbial oxidation for electron transfer at anode besides the presence of cuo as cathodic catalyst enhanced the orr in the cathodic chamber and thus increased the electrons received by the cathode due to the higher microbial oxidation in the anodic chamber ce is a measure for the fraction of electrons obtained from microbial oxidation of organic substrate in the anodic chamber that ends up as electrical current 14 the ces for all batches were presented in table 2 the ce for mfc with cuo cf for treatment of phenol 3 64 0 24 was higher than caffeine 3 00 0 15 this might be due to the molecular structure of phenol was smaller than caffeine as shown in table s1 thus higher fraction of electrons contributed to the power generation instead for degradation of organic pollutants cf 1 71 0 06 has lower ce than cp 2 36 0 14 due to cf possessed lower oxygen reduction rate than cp and less favorable for the organic matter to be consumed for electricity generation 16 lower ce indicated lower amount of acetate oxidized to electrons thus lower power was generated competitive processes such as fermentation and methanogenesis as well as bacteria growth led to lower ce obtained in the mfc system 15 3 2 effect of different organic pollutants fig 3 displays the pollutants removal efficiency in the cathodic chamber of mfc by using bare cf and cuo cf cathodes caffeine and phenol were used to investigate the influence of chemical structure on the removal efficiency of organic pollutants in this study in the mfc with bare cf cathode results showed that removal efficiency of phenol 24 85 1 36 was almost 12 times higher than caffeine 2 14 0 36 besides the removal efficiency of phenol after 48 h was 43 23 1 18 which could only be attained for treatment of caffeine at 120 h this phenomenon occurred due to the molecular structure of phenol was significantly smaller than caffeine phenol mainly consists of one hydroxyl group bonded to the aromatic ring while caffeine is a purine alkaloid that is made up of an imidazole ring 5 member ring with 2 nitrogen atoms fused to a pyrimidine ring 6 member ring with 2 nitrogen atoms as shown in table s1 hence the simple molecular structure of phenol contributed to its ease degradation as compared with that of caffeine with a complex structure similar study was reported by oon et al the complexity of molecular structure significantly influenced the decolorisation efficiency and bioelectricity generation of the constructed wetland mfc system 17 the results showed that the decolorization efficiency and power density of monoazo dye acid red 18 96 1 58 mw m 2 was approximately 1 6 fold higher than that of diazo dye congo red 60 1 02 mw m 2 this can be ascribed to the higher the number of the azo bond present in the structure more electrons were required to cleave the azo bond linkage of congo red as compared with that of acid red besides the molecule bonding will affect the degradation of a particular compound hydrogen bonding is a fundamental of chemical structure and reactivity the existence of different amount of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors in a particular molecule associated to the different intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions 18 caffeine possesses three hydrogen bond acceptors with two carbonyl oxygens and one basic nitrogen as shown in table s1 the interaction of hydrogen bond acceptors caused the well behaved hydrogen bonds to water molecules which contributed to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding 19 the presence of three hydrogen bond acceptors in the caffeine contributed to a stronger hydrogen bonding thus caffeine was difficult to be degraded than phenol 20 alternatively phenol acted as hydrogen bond donor with the presence of oh group in its structure increased the rate of reaction and decreased the stability of benzene ring in addition hydrogen bond has significant influence on the solubility the solubility of phenol was 81 higher than caffeine the higher the solubility the easier the molecules to be degraded and dissolved in water hence the removal efficiency of phenol 90 15 0 79 was greater than caffeine 85 23 1 59 at the end of 168 h similar trend can be observed for the application of catalyst on cf the removal efficiency of phenol 67 10 0 83 was significantly greater than the caffeine 25 11 1 22 at first 24 h the application of cuo on cf elevated the orr reactivity in the cathodic chamber and led to rapid oxygen reduction rate for the degradation of phenol and caffeine in the electrocatalytic degradation of phenol wang et al reported that a direct electron transfer process occurred between the electrode surface active layer and the phenol 21 phenol was adsorbed on the electrode surface and degraded by hydroxyl radicals oh and further decomposed into small molecular acids such as maleic fumaric and oxalic acids carbon dioxide and water 22 the degradation mechanism of phenol can be hypothesized and summarized as follows 8 phenol oh catechol hydroquinone 9 catechol hydroquinone oh benzoquinone 10 benzoquinone oh maleic acid fumaric acid 11 maleic acid fumaric acid oh oxalic acid 12 oxalic acid oh carbon dioxide water based on fig 4 a the uv region from 243 nm to 302 nm in the uv vis spectrum of caffeine was attributed to the n π electronic transition of caffeine 23 the main absorption peak of caffeine located at 284 nm was referred to the co chromophore absorption of caffeine 24 in phenol π π transition contributed to the two absorption peaks at 205 nm and 281 nm as displayed in fig 4 b which corresponded to cyclohexane and benzene respectively 25 in fig 4 b the absorption peak of phenol reached nearly at the baseline at 168 h however the absorption peak of caffeine still can be seen obviously as demonstrated in fig 4 a this result indicated that longer time was taken by bare cf cathode to remove caffeine compared with phenol this finding was compatible with the results of removal efficiency obtained in this study fig 3 in addition a drastic decrease in the absorption peak of caffeine and phenol after 24 h under the presence of cuo catalyst can be observed as shown in fig 4 c and d respectively this could be due to the presence of catalyst enhanced the oxygen reduction rate in the cathodic chamber and led to efficient electron transfer for the degradation of phenol and caffeine under the presence of cuo catalyst the removal efficiency of caffeine was nearly 15 lower than that of phenol due to the presence of electron withdrawing groups in caffeine such as methyl groups in the pyrimidine ring restrain the ring opening 26 hence caffeine was hard to be degraded as compared to phenol in contrast to caffeine the strong electron donating group oh group in phenol aided in activating the benzene ring towards electrophilic attack and weakening the conjugated effect in phenol which led to the ease of degradation of phenol 27 there are several factors influence the bioelectricity generation in mfc for instance types of organic pollutants in the cathodic chamber and presence of catalyst on the cathode the electricity performance of mfc for treatment of caffeine and phenol was presented in table 2 as shown in table 2 both bare cf and cuo cf cathodes demonstrated better performance in electricity generation when phenol acted as model pollutant as compared with that of caffeine in the cathodic chamber results showed that the maximum voltage output vmax obtained for mfc system in the decreasing order as follows cuo cf phenol 335 30 7 25 mv cuo cf caffeine 323 80 6 55 mv bare cf phenol 171 90 4 73 mv bare cf caffeine 142 20 3 82 mv the voltage output performance of mfc was consistent with the cod removal efficiency in the anodic chamber fig 2 cuo cf cathode used for treatment of phenol possessed the highest cod removal efficiency in the anodic chamber which indicated that higher amount of acetate was utilized for the generation of electrons besides mfc with bare cf cathode produced two times larger maximum power density pmax when phenol was treated in the cathodic chamber as compared with that of caffeine this phenomenon could be due to the presence of more electrophilic and nucleophilic functional groups in caffeine than phenol thus more electrons were utilized for removal of caffeine than electricity generation initially the electrons reacted with the oxygen and protons to generate the hydrogen peroxide h2o2 as shown in eq 13 then the reduction of h2o2 through one electron pathway produced oh and hydroxide ions oh eq 14 13 o 2 2h 2e h 2 o 2 14 h 2 o 2 e oh oh subsequently the oh attacked the c4c5 double bond and decomposed caffeine to the weak acidic groups such as dimethylparabanic acid the proposed mechanism for caffeine degradation as follows 28 15 caffeine oh dimethylparabanic acid 16 dimethylparabanic acid oh di n hydroxymethyl parabanic acid another study by rosal et al also reported that caffeine could be degraded by oxygen free radicals and h2o2 which attacked at the nucleophilic c 8 position of the imidazole ring and formed 1 3 7 trimethyluric acid theophyline and other n demethylated products such as 1 3 dimethyluric acid and 6 amino 5 n formylmethyl amino 1 3 dimethyl uracil 29 in addition the presence of electron donating groups carbonyl groups co induced the caffeine molecule to be nucleophilic hence resisting caffeine to be reduced this was in accordance with the removal rate of caffeine where removal rate of bare cf cathode for treatment of phenol 0 0119 0 0006 h 1 was 13 20 times than that of caffeine 0 0009 0 0002 h 1 at the first 24 h table s3 in the study by oon et al it was reported that the electron releasing groups caused the opposite effect pushing electrons towards the redox active centre azo bond 13 therefore reactive green 19 is more nucleophilic and causing it less feasible to be reduced than reactive red 120 the decolourisation rate of reactive green 19 was 0 028 h 1 slightly higher than that of reactive red 120 0 021 h 1 the degradation process of organic pollutants in the cathodic chamber was affected by the orr on the cathode the reduction potential and electron transfer number played an important role on the orr reduction potential is a tendency of a chemical species to be reduced by gaining an electron the more positive reduction potential of cuo cf cathode at any current density than that of bare cf contributed to higher affinity for electrons and tendency to be reduced fig s2 these higher affinity for electrons increased the number of electron transfer from anode to the cuo cf cathode and thus higher orr rate in the cathodic chamber produced more oh for decomposition of the caffeine molecules into di n hydroxymethyl parabanic acid a lower reducing potential of bare cf led to lower number of electrons transferred to the bare cf and thus hindered the orr on the cathode as well as decreased the production of oh for the cleavage of caffeine these results were compatible with the 13 33 times higher removal rate of caffeine by cuo cf 0 0120 0 0005 h 1 which contributed to 25 11 1 22 of removal efficiency of caffeine as compared with that of bare cf 0 0009 0 0002 h 1 with 2 14 0 36 at 24 h besides the internal resistance of bare cf 993 62 ω was 2 fold higher than that of cuo cf 502 80 ω which restricted the electron transferred from anode to the cathode hence less reduction of h2o2 to produce the oh which used to decompose the caffeine molecules similar finding was reported by wu et al in which different electrode potential significantly affected the production rate of h2o2 for the degradation of organic 30 another study by yu et al the production of h2o2 was varied with different electrode materials due to variation in the electron transfer number 31 wang et al also reported that electron transfer number quantitatively reflected the reaction kinetics and selectivity of orr pathways 32 the higher electron transfer number contributed to higher current density and thus higher reaction kinetics could be obtained this phenomenon could be observed in the treatment of phenol in which cuo cf 0 0463 0 0027 h 1 yielded a higher jsc of 257 33 4 00 ma m 2 which contributed to higher removal rate of phenol as compared with that of bare cf 0 0119 0 0006 h 1 with jsc of 73 33 4 44 ma m 2 cuo catalyst played a crucial role on the power generation performance of mfc mfc system with cuo cf cathode produced the highest pmax and short circuit current density jsc 33 37 4 62 mw m 2 and 257 33 4 00 ma m 2 for treatment of phenol the pmax and jsc decreased to 10 01 1 50 mw m 2 and 73 33 4 44 ma m 2 which was nearly 30 lower than the case for treatment of phenol using bare cf cathode in the absence of cuo catalyst this could be due to the internal resistance in restraint of power generation in mfc as the higher internal resistance will consume higher amount of power production similar finding has been reported by oon et al in which mfc with lower internal resistance was able to generate larger power during optimal condition 15 the presence of cuo catalyst enhanced the oxygen reduction rate and contributed to the higher number of electrons transferred from anode to the cathode for electricity generation cuo catalyst on the surface of cf was beneficial to reduce the activation overpotential and produce higher kinetics oxygen reduction the removal rates of phenol and caffeine at 48 h increased about 75 16 and 91 45 respectively which indicated higher kinetics of oxygen reduction rate in the cathodic chamber as compared to bare cf cathode 3 3 effect of carbon based cathode materials on mineralization of caffeine the efficiency of two different carbon based cathode materials which are cf and cp on the mineralization of caffeine have been evaluated through cod analysis results revealed that cp surpassed cf in the mineralization of caffeine as shown in fig 5 bare cp could achieve up to 90 of cod removal at the end of 168 h when bare cf was used as cathode the cod removal efficiency was inferior to others it could only reach up to 81 at the end of 168 h this implied that bare cf cathode yielded low electrochemical reaction activity which caused a relatively low removal rate of caffeine 33 this could be explained by the fact that the efficacy of the cathode strongly depends on the reduction kinetics of terminal electron acceptors such as oxygen 34 the cathodic reduction of oxygen is an electrochemical phenomenon occurred on the surface of cathode thus the surface morphology of cathode plays a crucial role in the reduction kinetics of oxygen fig 6 a i and b i demonstrate the surface morphology of bare cf and bare cp at various magnifications cf has carbon fiber networks with smooth surface caused poor oxygen adsorption for reduction reactions in contrast with cf the porous and flaky structure on cp could provide a rough surface that favoured the oxygen diffusion and adsorption which contributed to the high activity for orr hence the difference in the surface morphologies of cf and cp led to different orr kinetics in the cathodic chamber besides two fold higher cod removal efficiency was obtained by bare cp compared with that of cf at 96 h since cp exhibited better electrical properties than cf higher electrical conductivity of cp 3 57 105 ω 1 m 1 than cf 3 33 104 ω 1 m 1 contributed to higher catalytic activity thus higher orr reactivity attained by bare cp the high electrical conductivity of cp beneficial for the efficient transport of electrons for the electrochemical reduction process of oxygen and improve the overall electrochemical performance bare carbon based materials showed slow orr kinetics for the degradation of caffeine in the cathodic chamber thus cuo as the cathodic catalyst was loaded on cf and cp respectively to improve the orr reactivity the results showed that more than 80 cod removal efficiency attained by cuo cp and cuo cf that was 60 greater than bare cp and cf which only reached the cod removal efficiency below 20 at 72 h the presence of micron size particles on the surface of the cuo cf and cuo cp as shown in fig 6 a ii and 6 b ii indicated the successful attachment of cuo particles on the surface of cf and cp this denoted that the presence of cuo catalyst had enhanced the oxygen reduction rate consequently higher cod removal efficiency could be attained this was compatible with the study by sawant et al which reported that the addition of catalyst was beneficial to reduce the activation losses in the cathode and enhance the orr kinetics by decreasing the energy barrier or increasing the orr interface area 35 another study of martin et al demonstrated that the total cathodic resistance of carbon electrode was relatively higher than that of manganese iii oxide iron iii oxide and platinum electrode due to the carbon electrode exhibited higher overpotential and lower activity for orr 36 in the study by zhou et al also reported that different cathode materials contributed to different number of electron transfer and charge transfer resistance on the cathode 6 yu et al discovered that the orr catalyzed by cuo nanoparticles operated with two and four electrons pathways while cuo nanoparticles graphene nanosheets electrode mainly operated with four electrons pathway through the rotating ring disk electrode analysis 31 the application of cuo improved the catalytic activity of bare cf and cp due to cuo may have requisite levels of oxygen vacancies and high availability of active sites on the catalyst which could provide excellent catalytic activity for the orr 37 38 previous study by zhang et al reported that two oxygen fitting peaks were located at around 530 30 and 531 80 ev in a high resolution x ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectrum represented the co existence of both lattice oxygen and chemically adsorbed oxygen in cuo respectively 39 this result indicated that cuo possessed an excellent ability to transport the surface lattice oxygen in a redox environment which was highly active for orr the oxygen was transferred from the lattice to the interface of catalyst and electrode then the resulting lattice oxygen vacancies on cuo were filled by the dissociative adsorbed oxygen and thus the orr promoted due to the higher oxygen diffusion and adsorption on the surface of the cuo furthermore cuo acted as active sites that increased the adsorption of oxygen containing substances on surface of substrate and thus enhanced the orr activity by increased the electron transfer efficiency 40 on the other hand cuo cp exhibited the highest cod removal efficiency 96 26 1 31 at the end of 168 h which was slightly higher than cuo cf 93 48 0 14 however cuo cp cathode 50 76 1 72 achieved 2 5 fold higher cod removal efficiency as compared with that of cuo cf cathode 20 30 1 32 at the first 24 h this could be due to the higher catalytic activity of cuo cp cathode accelerated the oxygen reduction rate in the cathodic chamber which could be attested by the kinetic study the results of the kinetic study revealed that cod removal rate constant of caffeine of cuo cp 0 0256 0 0023 h 1 was nearly three times greater than cuo cf 0 0094 0 0011 h 1 at the first 24 h as shown in table s3 the catalytic activity was related to the crystal structure and surface morphology of cathode in this study the cod removal efficiency can be strongly supported by the xrd and sem results based on fig 5 there is significant difference in the cod removal efficiency between bare cf and cp as compared with that of cuo cf and cuo cp the cod removal efficiency of bare cp was relatively higher than that of bare cf along the 168 h operation bare cp achieved two fold higher cod removal efficiency 47 05 4 76 as compared with that of bare cf 23 53 1 16 at 96 h this phenomenon could be due to the difference in the crystallinity of cf and cp as shown in xrd patterns the xrd results indicated that cp has a high crystalline nature structure while cf has an amorphous structure the intensity of the most intense characteristic peak located at 20 to 30 which referred to carbon in the bare cp fig 7 b was obviously higher than bare cf fig 7 a hence higher crystallinity of bare cp resulted in better catalytic performance compared to that of bare cf and aided in the cod removal nevertheless only slight difference in the cod removal efficiency obtained by cuo cf and cuo cp could be observed in fig 5 this implied that the cod removal efficiency was strongly influenced and dominated by the cuo catalytic activity which led to trivial difference in the cod removal efficiency between cuo cp and cuo cf besides the sem image as shown in fig 6 b ii depicted the rough surface of cuo cp cathode which covered with densely packed cuo particles this could provide more active sites for the electrocatalytic degradation of caffeine however smooth surface of the fiber in cf with less cuo particles attached on the surface could lead to relatively low catalytic activity of cuo cf cathode fig 6 a ii thus higher oxygen diffusion and adsorption on the surface of cuo cp than cuo cf lead to higher number of electrons transferred from the anode to the cathode and reacted with oxygen through the four electrons pathway eq 17 17 o 2 4h 4e 2h 2 o then adsorbed oxygen molecules o was produced on the active site of the cuo catalyst and endured sequential bond cleavage and reduction this was consistent with the finding of yap et al which reported that the oxygen molecules adsorbed on the catalyst surface and encountered an electron transfer to produce the active species such as oh and h2o2 11 this was evidenced by the do concentration in the cathodic chamber with cuo cp as cathode which was significantly lower compared with that of cuo cf as cathode along the 168 h operation as displayed in fig s1 lower do concentration indicated more oxygen was consumed in the cuo cp cathodic chamber due to higher orr occurred at cuo cp this could be explained by the fact that the oxygen molecules adsorbed on cuo cp and these oxygen oxygen bonds were decomposed to give adsorbed oxygen atoms the absorbed oxygen atoms then reduced by electrons to produce the active species such as oh and h2o2 for the cleavage of caffeine besides morphology of carbon based cathode materials the high orr catalytic activity was influenced by their electrical conductivity 35 the higher electrical conductivity of cp 3 57 105 ω 1 m 1 could provide higher catalytic activity on the cathode surface in the cathodic chamber by reducing the ohmic loss and mass transport loss of oxygen and thus resulted in a lower internal resistance as compared with cf 3 33 104 ω 1 m 1 41 fig s2 demonstrated the half cell potential of anode and cathode for different cathode materials used in mfc system under the variation of external resistance from 20 kω to 10 ω based on fig s2 cuo cp cathode exhibited higher potential that that of cuo cf bare cp and bare cf cathode at any current density this phenomenon could be due to the internal resistance of cuo cp 436 09 ω was relatively lower than that of other cathodes this lower internal resistance contributed to less restriction of electron passage to the cathode and thus higher jsc 253 33 17 78 ma m 2 was obtained internal resistance is one of the electrochemical limitations on the mfc efficacy which is greatly affected by the ohmic kinetic and transport limitation the results indicated that the application of cuo on cp or cf was beneficial to reduce the internal resistance up to 17 65 and 49 40 respectively this could be explained by the fact that the application of cuo on cathode surface could decrease the activation barrier for the orr to occur as well as increased the activation reaction rates on the anode and cathode electrodes in addition more positive reduction potential of cuo cp cathode contributed to higher affinity for electrons and tendency to be reduced thus higher electrons transfer rate to the cuo cp cathode resulted in a higher orr as well as power generation besides the anode potential increased with the current density as shown in fig s2 this might be due to the proton consumption for orr formed a concentration gradient that moved the protons towards the cathode and thus the proton concentration in the anodic chamber was reduced this phenomenon promoted the dissociation of hydrogen to provide more protons for the power demand 42 the increment in the anode potential at higher current density also led to the limitation of mass transport and hindered the electron transfer ability of electrochemical active bacteria to the cathode and thus lower removal efficiency of caffeine and power output were attained among the cathodes the performance of bare cf was the lowest in terms of removal efficiency 85 23 1 59 and pmax 4 70 0 66 mw m 2 due to highest internal resistance of bare cf 993 62 ω the internal resistance of bare cp 529 53 ω was relatively lower than the bare cf 993 62 ω due to higher electrical conductivity of cp 3 57 105 ω 1 m 1 allowed higher electron transfer from anode to the cathode and thus enhanced the orr kinetic in the cathodic chamber hence higher pmax 28 75 1 18 mw m 2 was obtained a correlation between the carbon based cathode materials and the bioelectricity generation was found to be similar to the trend of the cod removal efficiency the pmax of this study decreased in the order of cuo cp 28 75 1 18 mw m 2 cuo cf 26 07 1 90 mw m 2 cp 13 86 0 64 mw m 2 cf 4 70 0 66 mw m 2 almost three times greater pmax was achieved by bare cp as compared with that of bare cf this could be related to the better electrical properties of cp as compared to that of cf the electrical conductivity of bare cp 3 57 105 ω 1 m 1 was 8 fold higher than cf 3 33 104 ω 1 m 1 and thus contributed to the sufficient velocity of the electron transfer for orr the cuo catalyst enhanced the orr and accelerated the degradation of caffeine which led to more cleavage of caffeine to release more electrons into the system and thus diminishing the internal resistance and increasing the pmax of the system this phenomenon was attested when five times greater pmax was obtained using cuo cf compared with that of bare cf similar phenomenon could be observed for cuo cp where the pmax was two times greater than that of bare cp this could be explained by the effective potential acting at the catalytic site which depends on the electrical conductivity of the cathode the application of cuo catalyst enhanced the orr reactivity in the cathodic chamber and thus more oxygen was required for the orr to occur this rapid oxygen reduction rate led to higher number of electrons transferred from anode and collected by the cathode for electricity generation similar finding was reported by bhowmick et al in which the coating of cobalt oxide and iron oxide on the activated carbon ac increased the maximum volumetric power density from 2 95 w m 3 bare ac to 6 62 w m 3 and 5 06 w m 3 respectively 43 another study by merino jimenez et al reported the use of carbon cloth cf and stainless stain as cathode for investigation of the effect of carbon based materials and application of ac catalyst layer on bare cathodes 44 the results revealed that the addition of the ac layer on the stainless steel contributed to the highest power output of 62 μw nevertheless cf with ac layer obtained the lowest power output 41 μw this could be attributed to the higher electrical conductivity of stainless steel in the study by mashkour and rahimnejad different carbon based materials such as graphite carbon cloth carbon paper and carbon nanotube platinum cnt pt coated carbon paper were applied as cathodes for the treatment of actual wastewater in the cathodic chamber 45 the carbon paper electrode modified by cnt pt generated six times higher power 16 26 mw m 2 as compared with that of bare carbon paper 2 76 mw m 2 this was owing to the distribution of high electrical conductivity of the platinum and the high active surface area of the carbon nanotube on the surface of the carbon paper provided a desirable conductive porous surface for the rapid reaction between the electrons and oxygen 45 4 conclusion in conclusion the effects of organic pollutants and carbon based cathode materials on the pollutants removal efficiency and bioelectricity generation were evaluated using mfc integrated electrocatalytic process results revealed that higher removal efficiency of phenol compared with that of caffeine was achieved by bare cf and cuo cf cathodes this indicated that phenol was more susceptible to degradation compared with that of caffeine the presence of methyl groups in the pyrimidine ring restrained the ring opening of caffeine molecule and was hard to be degraded compared with that of phenol mfc with cuo cf cathode generated 1 28 times higher pmax 33 37 4 62 mw m 2 for the treatment of phenol than caffeine 26 07 1 90 mw m 2 in the cathodic chamber the catalytic activity of cathode significantly affected the mineralization of caffeine and bioelectricity generation which was related to the crystal structure and surface morphology of cathode the cod removal efficiency attained by bare cp cathode at 96 h was two times higher compared with that of bare cf cathode which mainly attributed to the high crystallinity nature of cp and amorphous structure of cf cuo cp cathode 50 76 1 72 achieved 2 5 fold higher cod removal efficiency compared with that of cuo cf cathode 20 30 1 32 at the first 24 h the rough surface of cuo cp cathode which covered with densely packed cuo particles provided more active site for the electrocatalytic degradation of caffeine the removal rate of caffeine by cuo cp cathode was almost 63 28 higher compared with that of cuo cf cathode cuo cp and cuo cf cathodes possessed 80 higher cod removal efficiency compared with that of bare cp and cf cathodes due to the cuo catalyst enhanced orr and accelerated the degradation of
