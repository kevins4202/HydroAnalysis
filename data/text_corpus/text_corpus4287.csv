21435,this work presents the moonwec a new device for wave energy conversion this new concept encompasses several working principles as the heaving point absorber the oscillating water column and the overtopping the development of the new wec has been carried out through numerical modelling three main parts of the device have been simulated a hollow floating structure a central moonpool and a calm mooring system all the parts of the model have been coupled to obtained the general behaviour of the device under the effect of irregular sea states the device has been designed according to the mediterranean sea wave climate its dimensioning aims to maximize the power absorption by tuning both device and moonpool natural periods with the identified prevailing sea states six mooring system configurations have been tested in order to obtain a stable safe and yet effective behaviour finally performance indicators have been drawn to assess power production in two selected locations in the mediterranean sea keywords new concept wec mediterranean sea moonpool calm resonant 1 introduction above 2 3 of the planet surface is covered by oceans and approximately half of the world s population lives within a 100 km from the coast this alone should place wave energy among the most promising energy sources within renewables furthermore wave energy flux is higher than its main renewable competitors i e 5 and 20 times denser than wind and solar energy respectively see twidell and weir 2015 according to møork et al 2010 the annual global wave energy potential is over 32 000 twh yr and the harvesting potential could easily cover 20 of world s electricity demand however waves are not distributed uniformly throughout the oceans the wave climate of a particular area basically depends on the meteo climatic conditions and on the geographical characteristics of such area higher wave energy fluxes are found from middle to high latitudes for both hemispheres in open oceans reason for that is the high prevalence of winds at those latitudes and the long fetches on the one hand there is a predominance of higher fluxes in the western coasts of the continents given that the global circulation pattern mainly generates westerlies on the other hand shielded areas such as the baltic and mediterranean seas have much lower average fluxes than open oceans despite being located at the correct latitudes this is due to their typically small fetches studies conducted by møork et al 2010 arinaga and cheung 2012 gunn and stock williams 2012 endorse what stated in the previous paragraph and allows to set numbers to wave energy potential wave energy fluxes can reach 120 kw m in the antarctic ocean but on average range between 40 80 kw m in open ocean areas at the right latitudes in the european atlantic coasts average wave power grows from 30 kw m off portugal to 75 kw m in scotland to later get back to 30 kw m if continuing northwards to the norwegian coasts see clément et al 2002 mollison and pontes 1992 in the mediterranean sea the average wave energy flux is 3 kw m however it strongly varies depending on the geographical location liberti et al 2013 there are two areas with significant higher average wave energy fluxes the region between the balearic islands and sardinia and the channel of sicily account with 15 kw m and 10 kw m respectively the former results in an average of 90 mwh m of wave energy reaching the west coast of sardinia every year furthermore a study conducted by vicinanza et al 2011 based on the analysis of the wave measuring buoys from the italian national network and comprising over 18 years of data records determined that the two most energetic italian locations are alghero in sardinia and mazara del vallo in sicily with 9 1 kw m and 4 7 kw m respectively according to these numbers seems reasonable to think that wave energy exploitation can be feasible in some areas of the mediterranean sea even more if one realizes that storms at this location are far less destructive than those occurring in other regions such as the north sea thus reducing the threat for wave energy converters survivability despite wave energy conversion not fully reaching the commercial stage yet is not a young discipline yoshio masuda 1925 2009 conceived the oscillating water column owc converter concept by the late 1970s masuda deployed at open sea the first large scale wec the kaimei meanwhile other precursors such as mccormick mccormick 1974 salter salter 1974 budall and falnes falnes and budal 1978 were also developing novel technologies and approaches such as self rectifying turbines the duck or control strategies to increase the devices efficiency all that was fuelled when the british government developed and ambitious r d program on wave energy respectively however in the 1980s due to oil price stabilization and a change of government policy the british wave energy program came to a halt setting a closing date for the first generation of waves energy converters twenty years later the european commission decided to include wave energy in their r d programme on renewable energies giving birth to the second generation of wecs such as the limpet prototype built in the island of islay scotland whittaker et al 2006 the pico prototype in the azores islands portugal or the first integrated in breakwater wec array which was installed in the port of mutriku spain also in the mediterranean sea several wec prototypes reached the trl 6 8 pisacane et al 2018 there were also less successful technologies that did not reach the commercialization stage or that soon after deploying their first commercial devices did not resist the hardships of extreme storms marine environment poses a huge challenge to engineering wecs are usually fine tuned machines that work under very demanding conditions loads of extreme waves can reach 50 times those of the working regime hence the design of a machine that needs to work for certain specifications but survive for not frequent but very different ones in the long term some other effects such as fatigue corrosion and bio fouling also add up to the technical difficulties to overcome in order to develop a successful system these are all well known and studied phenomena by the offshore industry the main obstacle is to overcome them at a reasonable cost that permits such technology to be competitive in a market where the majority of the competitors do not have bear with such adversities however technology develops fast and together with past experiences have allowed to reduce costs monetary and time wise by half with respect to the big projects carried out at the beginning of the 2000s as no uniformity has been attained yet different ways to catalogue the ever increasing number of devices have been established efficiency of the wec depends on a large number of conditions a recent review paper aderinto and li 2019 presents the theoretical efficiency defined as the ratio of the power absorbed by the wec to the available power in the ocean wave front before transferring to the pto system ranges between 5 to 55 with an average at approximatively 20 recently several technologies have been studied and developed to specifically match the mediterranean wave climates a study by bozzi et al 2013a b miquel et al 2014 2017 bozzi et al 2017 optimized a heaving point absorber with linear generator inspired in the seabased device engström et al 2009 for typical waves found offshore the italian coasts after conducting analysis on wave generationa and absorption miquel et al 2018 two variants of the device were modelled the effect the surge dof has on the power absorption was studied and device interferences when installed in farms were investigated concluding that at its optimal each device could produce up to 15 mwh y furthermore a few initiatives are prospering to bring wave energy conversion in italy the world s first full scale prototype of a breakwater integrated overtopping wec was installed at the harbour of naples and it is currently undergoing testing at a trl6 vicinanza et al 2014 the iswec bracco et al 2011 is a floating point absorber that converts the wave induced pitching motion of the hull into electricity through a gyroscope coupled to an electric generator full scale prototype tests were carried out off the coasts of pantelleria island with a device rated power of 100 k w the iswec point absorber reached now the second installation mattiazzo 2019 also an attenuator device is being tested in marina di pisa and currently injecting electricity into the italian national grid the device called h24 50v2 has been developed by 40south energy it is composed by two bodies located one on top of the other and the waves induce a surging motion to the upper body while the lower one is fixed to the seabed in shallow waters in addition there are also two other devices currently being tested at the port of civitavecchia the wavesax peviani et al 2017 developed by rse is a compact size oscillating water column wec it can easily be installed in vertical wall breakwaters it is expected to produce 6 8 mwh y per unit and its main trait is that the wells turbine is directly installed in the water column the other device is the well known rewec3 boccotti 2007 an u shaped owc wec currently is undergoing the test phase with 17 caissons built with and an expected electricity production of 5 7 mwh m y to sum up there is a wide variety of wecs at different development stages accounting with different shapes sizes and working principles competing against each other unlike the case of large wind turbines one could say that for wave energy conversion the race is still open this article presents a new concept of wave energy converter specifically designed for mediterranean wave climates in the next section the concept will be introduced and described in detail afterwards the mathematical model that describes the device behaviour the numerical methods and simulation conditions will be defined finally the results obtained from the numerical simulations will be presented and substantial conclusions around them will be drawn 2 the concept the moonwec has been originally inspired by the oxyflux antonini et al 2012 2015 2016a b a downwelling device to artificially oxygenate anoxic waters this concept cannot fit in any of the previous classification systems as such but at the same it could suit more than one simultaneously the novelty of moonwec is that encompasses distinct working principles as formulated in the previous section it is composed by two bodies a floating structure and a pto possibly a wells turbine the floater has a hollow cylinder with its axis coincident to the structure s vertical axis when placed into the water this cylinder is filled creating what is commonly known as a moonpool when set under the action of waves not only the structure is excited but so is the moonpool creating a third virtual body the moonpool then behaves similarly to a rigid body thus being able to reach the resonant state if well tuned the energy conversion is supposed to be carried out by taking advantage of the relative motion between the floating structure and the moonpool in order to maximize that relative motion both bodies need to be resonating synchronously with completely opposite phases the moonwec which is thought to be deployed offshore is moored to the seabed through a particular catenary system commonly known as calm system catenary systems are specially suitable for heaving wecs since they mainly block other degrees of freedom while releasing the heave mode free and thus not interfering with energy conversion motion fig 1 shows a cross section of the device the lower plate is a damping disk which aims to introduce a phase lag between the floating structure and the moonpool oscillatory motions furthermore the bi conical upper shape is meant to enhance structure amplitude motion such shape could also stimulate the overtopping effect acting as ramp for waves to climb up the structure and discharge a certain amount of water within the moonpool it all depends on the cone s aperture a closed and steeper cone will decrease the amount of overtopping whereas a flatter and more open cone will have the opposite effect to sum up the moonwec can be considered a point absorber with oscillating body in heave and oscillating water column as major working principles this study focuses on the structure and floating oscillating water column dynamics leaving the overtopping principle for future investigations 3 numerical modelling in this section the mathematical modelling describing the wec s dynamics and the numerical methods applied to simulate them will be thoroughly illustrated a model based on the potential flow theory that follows a lagrangian approach has been developed mainly using the coding commercial software matlab fig 2 illustrates the working scheme of the potential flow model which follows the classical modelling architecture i e the model receives a series of inputs afterwards these inputs are processed in the model core and turned into a series of outputs the input parameters of the model can be divided into three categories the first class is related to the environmental conditions which are defined by data files mainly containing time series of water surface elevation and water particle velocities the second input class refers to the device properties whether it be its geometrical definition the mechanical attributes and the mooring system characteristics finally the last type of inputs are the so called hydrodynamic parameters the purpose of which is to link the environmental conditions to the body behaviour each set of inputs has a specific module within the model core modules can communicate enabling an efficient coupling the model then releases a series of outputs from different nature on the one hand the kinematics of the device which consent to study its response to certain conditions on the other hand the averaged powers for that particular environmental conditions are also gathered allowing to build the so called power matrix capacity factor capture width ratio annual production and other performance indicators the first type of inputs derived from the sea conditions are defined as regular or irregular waves based on the airy theory airy 1845 in order to obtain irregular wave time series the josnwap spectrum has been employed with a peak enhancement parameter equal to γ 3 3 as it best represents the wave properties given at the mediterranean sea archetti et al 2011 in order to minimize the density energy losses when performing the inverse fourier transform f 1 the following discretization of the spectrum has been chosen f 0 δ f 3 f p where δ f 1 t e f p is the spectrum s peak frequency and t e is the total time of the wave record achieving a univocal correlation between the frequency and time domain nevertheless since the spectrum is being truncated at f c o 3 f p there is always a loss of energy related to missing tail of the spectrum 3 f p an algorithm applying energy compensation used by miquel et al 2017 has been implemented it is based on the ratio between the theoretical m 0 and the value that comes from the numerical integration of the truncated spectrum the second kind of inputs are the physical parameters of the device and mooring system that includes the structure mass and tensor of inertia shapes volumes and areas as for the mooring system the inputs are the number and type of lines which includes their linear weight minimum breaking load mbl drag coefficient and their working setup structure fixing point water depth line length and horizontal anchoring point distance the last type of inputs are the so called hydrodynamic parameters i e the excitation force coefficient the radiation damping coefficient and the added mass the first explains the action of waves upon the structure and the second and third the result of moving a body in a fluid to compute such parameters the boundary element method bem based on the potential flow theory has been applied an open source code named nemoh babarit and delhommeau 2015 and developed at the lheea laboratory in the ecole centrale de nantes france has been chosen to obtain the hydrodynamic parameters furthermore nemoh comes with a suite including also a mesher and a matlab toolbox providing the inertia tensor of the body and the hydrostatic restoring matrix fig 3 illustrates the moonwec surface upon which the body boundary condition is computed by the bem method note that for computational efficiency reasons only half of the body is used taking advantage of the moonwec s axisymmetric geometry properties within the model core the dynamic module deals with the inertial forces related to the device structure the hydrodynamic module processes the forces interacting with the flow and the mooring module handles the effect of the mooring system afterwards altogether is plugged into the general equation of motion which is expressed in terms of the newton s second law f m a each dof of the system has its own equation of motion since the dynamics of a certain dof influence another dof dynamics different equations of motions may be linked by coupling coefficients therefore when the system has more than one dof the equations of motion are written in the matrix form having a dimension according to the number of modelled dof and forming a state space system with three variables position velocity and acceleration linked by time as a result the equation of motion system becomes a system of ordinary differential equations ode which has been solved following a runge kutta scheme of the fifth order the moonwec has been modelled as a two body system with four dofs the first body is the floating structure of the device due to its symmetry the body dynamics have been restricted to a single plane freeing it to move in the surge heave and pitch modes the second body is the water entrained in the moonpool orifice which has been allowed to move freely only along the symmetry axis of the floating structure fig 4 presents the schematic of the moonwec used to model the device dynamics it has a fixed coordinate system with its origin placed at the device centre of gravity g the axis x y define the surge and heave modes respectively and the rotation in pitch is described through θ a moving reference system ξ σ is set to account for the dynamics of the moonpool being the axis ξ co linear with the symmetry axis of the moonwec following the notation in fig 4 eq 1 defines the governing expressions for the moonwec structure despite being a matrix system for clarity all dof have been reported separately 1 m x m x x m x θ m x θ θ f e x t f r x t f r x θ t f d x t f m o o r x f m p x m y m y y f e y t f r

wave excitation forces f r t are the radiation damping forces f d t are the viscous drag forces f h t is the hydrostatic restoring force f m o o r t are the forces exerted by the mooring system and f m p and m m p are the forces and moment that the moonpool applies to the moonwec structure the hydrostatic restoring force based on the archimedes principle yields the buoyant effect as if it was a linear spring f h k h z where k h is the hydrostatic stiffness matrix provided by nemoh s toolbox and z is the displacement of the body from the equilibrium position in a generic dof besides the wave excitation and radiation forces have been obtained from the frequency coefficients e ω and r ω given by bem method 2 f e t 2 π 0 e ω cos ω t d ω f e t f e t η t 3 k t 2 π 0 r ω cos ω t d ω f r t k t z t m z t where z t and z t are the body velocity and acceleration respectively η t is the free surface elevation at the device axis and f e t and k t are the impulse response functions used as kernels for the convolutions such convolutions when applying the constant delay force the numeric algorithm to run in a fixed time step which is equal or proportional to the delay as a result a substantial increase of the simulations computational costs is obtained nevertheless two alternative methods have been used for the wave excitation force the fact that η t is fully determined and known in advance at any given time allows to integrate it numerically regardless the chosen time step this is not the case for the radiation damping component as z t is one of the state variables and thus an unknown to solve it the prony s approximation is adopted consisting of the substitution of the radiation damping force by a series of virtual state variables f r d i 1 n i i t allows the algorithm to run in a variable time step more details on the prony s method are given in diemer 1987 hauer et al 1990 hauer 1991 this solution is not free and a computational cost is paid due to the increase of the system dimension to be integrated however the gain of getting rid of the fixed time step is larger and the overall balance in computational efficiency is positive to ensure the maximum efficiency it is important to choose the minimum number of state variables that have a good approximation of the radiation force that delivers numerical stability it has been observed that 6 extra i i provide an excellent fitting without overloading excessively the system the last component of the hydrodynamic forces accounts for the fluid viscous effects the drag force is formulated as part of the morison equation and for moving bodies in oscillatory flows yields 4 f d 1 2 ρ c d a d u z u z where ρ is the sea water density u is the water particle velocities z is the body velocity a d is the cross sectional area of the body perpendicular to the flow direction and c d is the drag coefficient in this study the drag force has been decomposed according to the motion direction and the structure part when looking at figure fig 1 three main parts can be identified the upper double cone the central cylinder and the bottom disc hence three sets of a d and c d have been used to compute three drag forces each one acting on a separate part many drag coefficient values are available in literature in this study values from empirical experiments provided by sadraey 2011 have been used to account for the dynamic behaviour of the calm mooring system a single formula is not enough and rather a procedure is needed its response is highly non linear mainly due to the high inertia and drag of the lines due to the size of the lines the induced effect on the device behaviour may not be neglected hence both the dynamic response of the structure and chains must be coupled fig 5 shows both a scheme of a floating platform calm system and a zoom of a catenary line the expression of the mooring force for a single line is shown in eq 5 5 f m o o r t 0 c d l x m c x c where t 0 is the horizontal tension at the equilibrium position c d l is the linearized drag coefficient of the line m c is the mass of the chain and x c is the acceleration of the chain to be added to matrix system shown in eq 1 the shape equations for a catenary line are 6 β p t β h cosh β l 1 β l sinh 1 β l e f f l e f f l t l l where β is called the shape parameter t is the static tension of the chain p is its linear weight h is the water depth l is the horizontal distance from the fairlead in the structure and the point o where the chain lies on the seabed and l e f f is the effective length of suspended chain see fig 5 in these expressions l l e f f and t are unknown variables eq 6 can be manipulated to obtain 7 7 cosh β h 2 2 β h β l t l β h 1 0 as this relation cannot be solved analytically an iterative process based on a newton raphson algorithm of the form zwillinger 2011 has been implemented using eq 7 as the control function f β j an iterative step of β j 1 β j f β j f β j and stop condition of β j 1 β j τ where τ is the tolerance after having found t the chain acceleration needs to be found for the ode describing the dynamics of the platform calm system from fig 5 the position of the chain can be derived and by applying the second time derivate the acceleration of the chain is yielded 8 x c l x β h y l e f f x c x β h y l e f f 2 β y l e f f β y l e f f however the chain acceleration x c depends also on t which in turn depends on the floating structure position x y and thus on the structure acceleration x y as well this makes so that an integration variable of the ode system representing the systems dynamics has a direct dependency on another integration variable x c x y violating the variable independence rule for ode resolution an approximation method of x c is adopted to tackle this issue this method proposed by esmailzhade and goodarzi 2001 addresses the problematic by substituting the shape function of the catenary line by a taylor expansion series to the second order this allows to embed the mooring system within the moonwecs equations of motion without needing to account the chain s acceleration explicitly the results of the taylor expansion and further integration to the equation of motion yield the following expression for the mooring force 9 f m o o r m e q x c d l x a 2 f y 6 d y 2 x e x 3 c x y g y where 10 a p 2 φ ξ f p ξ ψ 2 η φ ξ 3 e p ξ ψ 2

equation 1 only the influence of the moonpool on the moonwec dynamics defined through f m p is to be accounted such forces since their origin is purely inertial are computed by means of the newton s second law f m m p a m where m m p is the moonpool mass and m is the centre of gravity of the moonpool as shown in fig 4 moonpool dynamics can be approximated as a floating cylinder with varying draft b g ξ as first demonstrated by aalbers 1984 hence m s position is not constant with respect to the moonwec varying along the ξ axis thus to compute the acceleration its position must be found first this is done by applying the definition of centre of mass to g m 11 g m b g 2 ξ 2 2 b g ξ now taking the centre of gravity of the structure as reference and projecting g m onto the x y axes the coordinates of the point m are obtained subsequently the time derivative of such coordinates is applied twice to find the acceleration however the inertial forces need to be projected onto the axis σ to obtain the component that has an effective influence to the moonwec structure finally an utter projection of f σ back to the axes x y yields the forces f m p x and f m p y in the correct reference system finally the moment created by the force f σ due to the distance between both gravity centres g m is obtained 12 f σ ρ s m p b g ξ x y θ 2 ξ ξ θ b g 2 ξ 2 2 θ ξ θ 2 θ 2 θ 1 b g ξ ξ ξ θ ξ θ 1 13

the small angle hypothesis the full procedure can be found in annex a the water motion inside a moonpool can be derived by using the deformable control volume approach as the moonpool changes in size over time liu et al 2014 gupta et al 2007 hence the mass conservation condition must be fulfilled 14 s ρ v m p v s n d a d m m p d t where ρ is the water density v m p is the velocity of the water flowing through the control surface v s is the velocity of the floating structure and m m p is the moonpool mass note that v m p v s is the relative velocity v r between the moonpool and the floating structure from the moonpool reference frame the equation of motion of a moonpool is obtained by applying newton s second law by means of the equation momentum for a deformable control volume as written in hansen 1967 15 f d d t c v v ρ d δ c s v ρ v r n d a g m m p p i s m p where v is the fluid velocity in the control volume c v v r is the relative fluid velocity flowing across the control surface s m p g is the gravity acceleration and p i is the pressure acting on the upper side of the c s see fig 4 the force acting on the lower side of the c s can be expressed as follows 16 f o p o s m p f h f e f c f r f d where f h f e f r f d and f c have already been described in previous paragraphs and are expressed through equations 2 4 and 13 respectively the pressure difference between the two sides of the control surface is the cause of the fluid acceleration the following step is to derive the momentum equation of a deformable volume written in eq 15 decomposing it for the axes x and y as f f x f y where v turns into v x and v y the horizontal and vertical velocities of the surface point of the moonpool p x p y p finally as the moonpool axes are ξ σ the forces f x f y are re projected accordingly however the surface of the moonwec is considered impermeable and thus the motion is restricted only in the ξ direction hence only the ξ projection has been carried out yielding f ξ after an extensive mathematical manipulation of equations 14 16 detailedly shown in annex b the expressions reporting the inner and outer pressures of the c s p i and p o are yielded 17 p i f ξ s m p ρ g b g ξ ρ b g ξ x θ y ξ θ 2 ξ g p o ρ g y b g p r a d p e p d the balance between the pressure of the two faces of the control surface s m p is what drives the motion of the moonpool and since there is no physical obstacle within both sides of s m p one can say that p i p o 0 obtaining the following moonpool equation of motion 18 18 p i p o s m p f ξ ρ g s m p y b g f d f r f e ρ s m p b g ξ m ξ ξ x θ y f e ξ η 1 2 c d ξ s m p x θ ξ 2 k ξ x θ ξ ρ s m p b g ξ θ 2 ξ g g y b g m ξ θ x y where m ξ is the added mass coefficient of the moonpool c d ξ is its drag coefficient assumed to be equal to an equivalent cylinder drag coefficient and k ξ and f e ξ are the impulse response functions of the wave radiation and excitation respectively as seen on the previous paragraphs the moonpool is free to move along the ξ axis the potential model was validated through the comparison with experimental data for a simplified case of a moored floating cylinder under regular waves and for the free decay test gaeta et al 2020 the experiments were performed at the laboratory of hydraulic engineering of the university of bologna italy the global dynamic response of the floating cylinder anchored at the bottom through four catenaries was obtained by implementing a videography analysis which provided surge heave and pitch motions under the tested conditions the model results obtained for the case of free heave decay shows a good agreement with the laboratory data reaching errors in the estimation of the natural frequency of around 0 75 4 dimensioning optimization the dimensioning tuning and optimization of the moonwec can be subdivided into three categories corresponding to each physical part of the device firstly the moonpool is dimensioned afterwards the floating structure is designed assuring its compliance with the desired conditions hence resonance is achieved simultaneously and out of phase with the moonpool finally the mooring system is dimensioned and tuned in order to modify as little as possible the device dynamics for the working conditions while preventing it from drifting away as shown in sphaier et al 2007 the natural frequency expression of a system ω 0 k m can be derived into ω 0 g d for the case of a moonpool in heave where k and m are the elasticity and mass of the system g is the gravity acceleration and d is the moonpool draft knowing that the moonpool has to resonate for sea states around t p 6 s typical of sea states at the considered study sites as will be explained later derivation of the moonpool draft and in turn also the structure draft is direct yielding d 9 m having determined on a first attempt the dimensions of the moonpool the structure wrapping the moonpool has to be sized according to the required natural frequency in first approach this is done by applying the fourier transform of the linearized equation of motion 1 thus obtaining the frequency domain equation of motion 19 f e x 0 ω 2 m a i ω b k h where ω is the frequency of the monochromatic wave exciting the structure m is the mass matrix of the system a is the added mass matrix b is the radiation damping matrix k h is the hydrostatic stiffness matrix f e is the excitation force coefficient vector and x 0 is the rao which reflects the unitary response of the system as the draft of the structure is fixed by the moonpool constraint the shape and diameter of the structure are the only variables left to modify the structure has a cone shape on top in order to guarantee a smooth transition in the free surface region also a damping plate has been installed at the bottom to tune the phase of the device this effect however cannot be modelled in the frequency domain as the drag introduced by the plate is non linear therefore the diameter of the body is the parameter upon which the rao sensitivity analysis has been executed table 1 reports the resonant response peak frequency in heave of several structures with different diameters it is observed that for a diameter of 5 m the structure has a natural frequency of ω 0 1 08 rad s which practically coincides with most frequent ω p 1 05 rad s for the selected locations of alghero and mazara del vallo once the preliminary frequency domain design has been completed more detailed time domain analysis must be carried out to properly account for the non linear effects first step is to perform the decay or free oscillation tests this response measured over the time gives the information about the natural period of the system and its damping the chosen initial state of the device is i s x 0 z 0 θ 0 0 1 0 15 using the si units note that null initial displacement has been set for the horizontal dimension it is meaningless to test the surge mode when no mooring system has been introduced since the device will not have a reaction force aiming to bring it back to the equilibrium position the dynamic response over time of the system is shown in fig 6 for the modelled dofs fourier analysis is adopted to highlight the natural frequencies of the system results are reported in fig 7 no anomalies are observed in fig 6 the heave and pitch modes show symmetrical oscillations damped at different rates the moonpool has an offset of the mean oscillatory position to comply with coordinate system introduced in fig 1 and thus showing coordinate ξ the surge mode shows small oscillations which are the result of the cross radiation effect surge pitch finally it assumes a resting position different than zero confirming the lack of a mooring system the frequency domain analysis shown in fig 7 reveals the natural frequencies of the system these show very good agreement with the frequency domain tests in the case of the heave and moonpool modes 1 1 rad s the pitch mode also shows a peak at 0 2 rad s such frequency corresponds to a very long wave practically at the limit of the linear wave theory thereby for survivability the dynamics of the device at that particular frequency must be studied despite the decay test provides full description of the natural device s frequencies the identification of the phase shift between the device and the moonpool cannot be achieved to such purpose the forced oscillation tests are carried out by bringing the device under the action of a monochromatic wave of h 0 5 m and t 6 s in fig 8 the device heave displacement and the absolute and relative to the structure moonpool displacements are plotted after performing the phase analysis of the responses with respect to the free surface the delays found for the structure the absolute and relative displacements of the moonpool are respectively δ h 38 3 δ m a 151 8 and δ m r 185 9 that makes a relative delay between the structure and the relative motion of the moonpool of δ r δ m r δ h 147 6 up to this point the dimensioning of the moonpool and the floating structure is completed and seen to be working as expected as far as the mooring system is concerned six configurations with different number of lines have been studied four with two lines one per side of the structure and another two with four lines two per side of the structure on the geometric layout of the line see fig 5 only three parameters can be predefined the total length of the line l t l e f f d the horizontal distance between the structure and the anchoring point l and the vertical distance from the fair lead to the sea bottom h according to he et al 2017 the chain length is set in proportion to the water depth and it usually ranges from 3 to 6 times the depth 3 h l t 6 h in order to minimize the line weight a total length of l t 3 h has been set taking into account that the water depth is 50 m then l t 150 m within the two line variants two are linked to the structure at its base and the other two at the cog quote the four line variants are both bonded to the structure in the same manner the lower fair leads are placed at the base and the upper ones at the edge of the top cone coinciding with the still water level at rest finally two different anchoring points have been set one at a horizontal distance l 120 m and the other at l 135 m fig 9 illustrates the different variants the physical properties of the lines have been selected according to the guidelines presented in dnv gl 2010 the spiral strand steel wire ropes have been chosen owing to their superior properties more precisely a model having a nominal diameter 76 mm a minimum breaking load of 5647 k n and a submerged nominal weight of 23 8 k g m subsequently decay tests of the full system device and mooring have been carried out for each of the six variants and results have been studied as expected the response in heave suffers very little variation with respect to the calm configuration having a natural period around t 0 6 s and a rao about 4 on the other hand the mooring system increases the stiffness of the system for the pitch mode changing its natural period t 0 and r a o notably to provide an effective comparison the results have been summarized in table 2 also for the unmoored system named variant 0 the left side states the main characteristics of the chosen mooring configurations described in the previous paragraph including the maximum displacements before the lines go slack and taut furthermore the natural periods and raos of the overall system in pitch are shown whereas a general reduction of the natural period in pitch with respect to the variant 0 is detected no clear trend is observed for the rao with strong variations depending on the mooring configuration through the results presented in table 2 variant 3 is identified as the most convenient with the combination of the second most reduced rao even more than that of variant 0 and the largest natural period t 0 28 75 s the closest to variant 0 too the aim is to minimize the pitch mode to avoid some undesired effects such as mathieu resonance horizontal induced loads in the structure sloshing or uneven flow in the moonpool hence mooring system variant 3 has been selected as the optimal mooring configuration for the moonwec 5 results in the following paragraphs a thorough study of the behaviour of variant 3 is presented following the same procedure as with the unmoored device variant 0 firstly the analysis shows the free decay tests this time including the surge mode figs 10 and 11 show the results in the time and frequency domains respectively it is revealed that the heave mode and the moonpool maintain the same response as in the unmoored device for pitch mode a minimal variation of the natural frequency is observed with respect to the device with no mooring passing from t 0 p 31 25 s to t 0 p 28 75 s the surge mode presents a strong correlation with the pitch mode presenting a peak at the pitch s natural frequency and a very low natural frequency meaning that the device tends to set back to the equilibrium position in a slow and smooth way as no relevant differences are detected for the heave mode the forced oscillation analysis has been carried out with a monochromatic wave with a period equal to the pitch s natural period fig 12 shows the expected behaviours a large peak for the pitch mode as it is resonating a unitary response of the heave mode as the wave period is far larger than its natural period and a damped response for the surge mode since its natural period is larger than the wave s period the moonpool presents no response for such frequency meaning that it moves accordingly with the floating structure and hence no relative motion is generated a small perturbation is detected at the moonpool natural period given by the cross correlation with the pitch mode finally the device performance is simulated for the range of sea states characterizing the wave climate given at the selected locations alghero and mazara del vallo in the western coasts of sardinia and sicily respectively that range comprehends waves from 3 to 12 s of peak period and 0 5 to 4 5 m of significant wave height the length of the simulations is set to 1000 waves per sea state as it is considered that the energy of the jonswap spectrum is fully represented by such length fig 13 shows the non dimensional spectra of the device displacements in all modes under four irregular waves with h m 0 1 m and t p ranging from 4 to 10 s normalization has been carried out according to the peak parameters of the wave spectra the wavelength for the surge the tangent of wave steepness in r a d for the pitch and the wave amplitude for the heave and moonpool modes results show the expected behaviour for all modes surge displacements are reduced when compared to the wavelength proving the desired effect of the mooring system of keeping the device in place a very similar trend is observed for the pitch mode as the mooring closely links both modes as already seen in figs 10 and 11 the heave mode presents resonance around the device natural frequency and as foreseen following the free water surface for larger peak periods c d in fig 13 and damping its response for lower peak periods a in fig 13 finally the moonpool mode presents a very interesting behaviour not only by having a larger response which means that the out phasing of the system works but also being able to keep an amplification factor of 3 even if the simulated sea state lies well over the natural period of the device fig 14 displays an extract of the time series of figure fig 13 b showing the dynamics of the system in si units to provide a better physical awareness to fig 13 finally the power captured by the wec is to be estimated while some pto systems have been considered this study focuses on the amount of mechanic power hold in the moonpool by its relative motion with respect to the floating structure hereinafter referred to as net power following the notation from fig 4 the net power is calculated with the classic relation p t f m p t ξ t where f m p t is the moonpool equivalent force obtained from the 2nd newton s law f m p t m m p t ξ t where m m p t is the moonpool mass which is time varying due to the deformable volume condition and computed as m m p t ρ g s m p b g ξ t being ρ the sea water density and g the gravity acceleration subsequently for each simulated sea state the instantaneous power has been computed following the above described procedure and the average value has been placed in the net power matrix a bi variate matrix with respect to the significant wave height and the peak period furthermore the capture width ratio which is the ratio of the absorbed power and the wave energy flux has been computed in the non dimensional form using the moonpool diameter as non dimensionalizing parameter results are presented in figs 15 and 16 respectively in both figures the resonant region is clearly observed around t p 6 s the design resonant period confirming what the previous analysis stated in which power absorption by the moonpool is maximized under the most frequent conditions at alghero and mazara del vallo the moonwecs net rated power and maximum cwr amount to 18 k w and 90 respectively crossing these data with the wave climates at the selected location allows to obtain site specific performance indicators such as the annual energy production aep the average power absorption p the mean capture width ratio cwr and the capacity factor cf such indicators have been computed for the selected locations alghero and mazara del vallo and summarized in table 3 6 conclusions this paper aims to present a new device for wave energy conversion named the moonwec this new concept mixing several working principles is targeted to the mediterranean sea and its wave climate its technical feasibility is explored via numerical modelling a numerical model based on the potential flow theory has been set the code allows parallel computing and implements several tools to improve its computational efficiency the model simulates the response of the wec under the influence of irregular sea states in the time domain the moonwec is composed by three main elements a hollow floating structure a central moonpool and a calm mooring system all of them simulated dynamically the first step in the moonwec s development process consists in the determination of the general dimensions of the device through the frequency domain tests the optimal draft for which the moonpool resonates at the established period of t 6 s is d 9 m the draft of the moonpool is equivalent to the draft of the structure furthermore frequency domain tests also show that the external diameter of the structure must be 5 m in order to achieve resonance for that period time domain tests aimed to define more precisely the dimensional parameters of the device reveal good agreement with the results obtained in the frequency domain tests defining the natural periods of the device in heave and pitch t 0 h 6 s and t 0 p 31 5 s respectively whereas resonance in heave is the main dimensioning target resonance in pitch is a rather undesired effect extra elements such a disc at the bottom and a cone at the top have been added to the structure in order to create a phase lag between the structure and the moonpool by increasing the phase between the two parts of the device their relative motion is amplified thus maximizing the power absorption afterwards the mooring system of the device has been designed six different configurations have been tested a description of the different variants is provided in table 2 and fig 9 results show that all variants have very little influence on the heave mode also it is found that the most pre tensioned schemes reduce considerably the natural period in pitch taking it to a dangerous region where it may likely be excited during stormy events regarding the connection point to the structure the best performance is achieved when the mooring is attached at the level of the structure s cog having very little influence in the pitch mode as well however further investigation should be done in the future at that step since until now free surface elevation has been modelled according to the linear wave theory loads may increase drastically due to non linearity of waves and stormy free surfaces have a non linear behaviour as non linearity increases with steepness in fig 15 the net power is shown that is the wave energy absorbed by the moonpool which shows higher rates around the natural period in heave t 0 h 6 s and a rated power of 18 k w backing the design procedure followed until now furthermore the performance of the device in two of the most promising locations in the mediterranean sea alghero and mazara del vallo has been assessed as shown in table 3 these site specific indicators suggest electricity production is feasible since in the energy chain they represent the available power to the eventual pto system that effectively generates electricity currently few highly efficient pto s such as a wells turbine or an elastomeric material pto can be considered as future developments in this regard according to the world energy council enerdata the average electricity consumption of an italian household is 2 4 m w h y r hence a single moonwec could feed 15 households if deployed in arrays the moonwec could provide electricity to remote islands which lack of energy resources credit authorship contribution statement a m miquel conception and design of study acquisition of data analysis and or interpretation of data drafting the

previous paragraphs the moonpool is free to move along the ξ axis nevertheless the relative motion is blocked along the σ axis by means of the structure walls this exerts a considerable influence in the moonwec dynamics as stated in eq 1 through f m p x and f m p y such forces since their origin is purely inertial are computed by means of the newton s second law 20 f m m p a m where m m p is the moonpool mass which has been obtained from eq 31 and m is the centre of gravity of the moonpool as a result of the deformable volume condition the point m fig 4 is not static with respect to the moonwec and its position varies along the ξ axis thus to compute the acceleration its position must be found first this is done by applying the definition of centre of mass which is no other than a weighted average along the ξ axis yielding the following distance g m 21 g m b g 2 ξ 2 2 b g ξ now taking the centre of gravity of the structure as reference and projecting g m onto the x y axes the coordinates of the point m are obtained subsequently the time derivative of such coordinates is applied twice to find the acceleration and after some mathematical manipulation and the application of the small angle hypothesis the following relations are found 22 x m x b g 2 ξ 2 2 b g ξ sin θ y m y b g 2 ξ 2 2 b g ξ cos θ 23 d x m d t v x m x 1 b g ξ ξ ξ sin θ b g 2 ξ 2 2 ξ sin θ b g ξ cos θ θ d y

the axis σ to obtain the component that has an effective influence to the moonwec structure finally an utter projection of f σ back to the axes x y yields the forces f m p x and f m p y in the correct reference system 25 f x ρ s m p b g ξ a x m f y ρ s m p b g ξ a y m f σ f x cos θ f y sin θ f x f y θ 26 f σ ρ s m p b g ξ x y θ 2 ξ ξ θ b g 2 ξ 2 2 θ ξ θ 2 θ 2 θ 1 b g ξ ξ ξ θ ξ θ 1 27 f m p x f σ cos θ f σ f m p y f σ sin θ f σ θ ρ s m p b g ξ x θ b g 2 ξ 2 2 θ θ ξ θ θ 1 b g ξ finally there is only one term left to fully define the dynamic influence of the moonpool upon the moonwec it is the moment created by the force f σ due to the distance between both gravity centres g m obtained in eq 21 28 m m p g g m f σ annex b following the deformable volume approach we have that the mass conservation must be respected as stated in eq 14 reproduced here for clarity 29 s ρ v m p v s n d a d m m p d t realizing that v m p v s is the relative moonpool velocity v r and following the notation from fig 4 the left and right hand side of eq 29 can be rewritten respectively as 30 s ρ v r n d a ρ s m p v m p sin θ x v m p cos θ y sin θ cos θ 31 d m m p d t d d t ρ s m p b g ξ ρ s m p ξ where s m p is the area of the cs and b g is the distance from the cog of the structure to s note that the moonwec structure cog has been selected as the origin of the reference system recomposing equation 29 from eqs 30 and 31 applying the opportune mathematical simplifications and finally applying the small angle hypothesis for which sin θ θ and cos θ 1 the absolute velocity of the moonpool is yielded 32 v m p x θ y ξ where the on top of a variable expresses its time derivative d d t the following step is to derive the momentum equation of a deformable volume written in eq 15 and here decomposed for the axes x and y as f f x f y 33 f x d d t c v v x ρ d δ c s v x ρ v r n d a 34 f y d d t c v v y ρ d δ c s v y ρ v r n d a where c v and c s are the control volume and surface respectively v x and v y are the horizontal and vertical velocities of the surface point of the moonpool p x p y p which are derived from fig 4 35 x p x ξ sin θ v x d d t x p x ξ sin θ θ ξ cos θ 36 y p y ξ cos θ v y d d t y p y ξ cos θ θ ξ sin θ by taking each term of eqs 33 and 34 developing them separately and then reunifying them the final equations for f x and f y are obtained note that the

21435,this work presents the moonwec a new device for wave energy conversion this new concept encompasses several working principles as the heaving point absorber the oscillating water column and the overtopping the development of the new wec has been carried out through numerical modelling three main parts of the device have been simulated a hollow floating structure a central moonpool and a calm mooring system all the parts of the model have been coupled to obtained the general behaviour of the device under the effect of irregular sea states the device has been designed according to the mediterranean sea wave climate its dimensioning aims to maximize the power absorption by tuning both device and moonpool natural periods with the identified prevailing sea states six mooring system configurations have been tested in order to obtain a stable safe and yet effective behaviour finally performance indicators have been drawn to assess power production in two selected locations in the mediterranean sea keywords new concept wec mediterranean sea moonpool calm resonant 1 introduction above 2 3 of the planet surface is covered by oceans and approximately half of the world s population lives within a 100 km from the coast this alone should place wave energy among the most promising energy sources within renewables furthermore wave energy flux is higher than its main renewable competitors i e 5 and 20 times denser than wind and solar energy respectively see twidell and weir 2015 according to møork et al 2010 the annual global wave energy potential is over 32 000 twh yr and the harvesting potential could easily cover 20 of world s electricity demand however waves are not distributed uniformly throughout the oceans the wave climate of a particular area basically depends on the meteo climatic conditions and on the geographical characteristics of such area higher wave energy fluxes are found from middle to high latitudes for both hemispheres in open oceans reason for that is the high prevalence of winds at those latitudes and the long fetches on the one hand there is a predominance of higher fluxes in the western coasts of the continents given that the global circulation pattern mainly generates westerlies on the other hand shielded areas such as the baltic and mediterranean seas have much lower average fluxes than open oceans despite being located at the correct latitudes this is due to their typically small fetches studies conducted by møork et al 2010 arinaga and cheung 2012 gunn and stock williams 2012 endorse what stated in the previous paragraph and allows to set numbers to wave energy potential wave energy fluxes can reach 120 kw m in the antarctic ocean but on average range between 40 80 kw m in open ocean areas at the right latitudes in the european atlantic coasts average wave power grows from 30 kw m off portugal to 75 kw m in scotland to later get back to 30 kw m if continuing northwards to the norwegian coasts see clément et al 2002 mollison and pontes 1992 in the mediterranean sea the average wave energy flux is 3 kw m however it strongly varies depending on the geographical location liberti et al 2013 there are two areas with significant higher average wave energy fluxes the region between the balearic islands and sardinia and the channel of sicily account with 15 kw m and 10 kw m respectively the former results in an average of 90 mwh m of wave energy reaching the west coast of sardinia every year furthermore a study conducted by vicinanza et al 2011 based on the analysis of the wave measuring buoys from the italian national network and comprising over 18 years of data records determined that the two most energetic italian locations are alghero in sardinia and mazara del vallo in sicily with 9 1 kw m and 4 7 kw m respectively according to these numbers seems reasonable to think that wave energy exploitation can be feasible in some areas of the mediterranean sea even more if one realizes that storms at this location are far less destructive than those occurring in other regions such as the north sea thus reducing the threat for wave energy converters survivability despite wave energy conversion not fully reaching the commercial stage yet is not a young discipline yoshio masuda 1925 2009 conceived the oscillating water column owc converter concept by the late 1970s masuda deployed at open sea the first large scale wec the kaimei meanwhile other precursors such as mccormick mccormick 1974 salter salter 1974 budall and falnes falnes and budal 1978 were also developing novel technologies and approaches such as self rectifying turbines the duck or control strategies to increase the devices efficiency all that was fuelled when the british government developed and ambitious r d program on wave energy respectively however in the 1980s due to oil price stabilization and a change of government policy the british wave energy program came to a halt setting a closing date for the first generation of waves energy converters twenty years later the european commission decided to include wave energy in their r d programme on renewable energies giving birth to the second generation of wecs such as the limpet prototype built in the island of islay scotland whittaker et al 2006 the pico prototype in the azores islands portugal or the first integrated in breakwater wec array which was installed in the port of mutriku spain also in the mediterranean sea several wec prototypes reached the trl 6 8 pisacane et al 2018 there were also less successful technologies that did not reach the commercialization stage or that soon after deploying their first commercial devices did not resist the hardships of extreme storms marine environment poses a huge challenge to engineering wecs are usually fine tuned machines that work under very demanding conditions loads of extreme waves can reach 50 times those of the working regime hence the design of a machine that needs to work for certain specifications but survive for not frequent but very different ones in the long term some other effects such as fatigue corrosion and bio fouling also add up to the technical difficulties to overcome in order to develop a successful system these are all well known and studied phenomena by the offshore industry the main obstacle is to overcome them at a reasonable cost that permits such technology to be competitive in a market where the majority of the competitors do not have bear with such adversities however technology develops fast and together with past experiences have allowed to reduce costs monetary and time wise by half with respect to the big projects carried out at the beginning of the 2000s as no uniformity has been attained yet different ways to catalogue the ever increasing number of devices have been established efficiency of the wec depends on a large number of conditions a recent review paper aderinto and li 2019 presents the theoretical efficiency defined as the ratio of the power absorbed by the wec to the available power in the ocean wave front before transferring to the pto system ranges between 5 to 55 with an average at approximatively 20 recently several technologies have been studied and developed to specifically match the mediterranean wave climates a study by bozzi et al 2013a b miquel et al 2014 2017 bozzi et al 2017 optimized a heaving point absorber with linear generator inspired in the seabased device engström et al 2009 for typical waves found offshore the italian coasts after conducting analysis on wave generationa and absorption miquel et al 2018 two variants of the device were modelled the effect the surge dof has on the power absorption was studied and device interferences when installed in farms were investigated concluding that at its optimal each device could produce up to 15 mwh y furthermore a few initiatives are prospering to bring wave energy conversion in italy the world s first full scale prototype of a breakwater integrated overtopping wec was installed at the harbour of naples and it is currently undergoing testing at a trl6 vicinanza et al 2014 the iswec bracco et al 2011 is a floating point absorber that converts the wave induced pitching motion of the hull into electricity through a gyroscope coupled to an electric generator full scale prototype tests were carried out off the coasts of pantelleria island with a device rated power of 100 k w the iswec point absorber reached now the second installation mattiazzo 2019 also an attenuator device is being tested in marina di pisa and currently injecting electricity into the italian national grid the device called h24 50v2 has been developed by 40south energy it is composed by two bodies located one on top of the other and the waves induce a surging motion to the upper body while the lower one is fixed to the seabed in shallow waters in addition there are also two other devices currently being tested at the port of civitavecchia the wavesax peviani et al 2017 developed by rse is a compact size oscillating water column wec it can easily be installed in vertical wall breakwaters it is expected to produce 6 8 mwh y per unit and its main trait is that the wells turbine is directly installed in the water column the other device is the well known rewec3 boccotti 2007 an u shaped owc wec currently is undergoing the test phase with 17 caissons built with and an expected electricity production of 5 7 mwh m y to sum up there is a wide variety of wecs at different development stages accounting with different shapes sizes and working principles competing against each other unlike the case of large wind turbines one could say that for wave energy conversion the race is still open this article presents a new concept of wave energy converter specifically designed for mediterranean wave climates in the next section the concept will be introduced and described in detail afterwards the mathematical model that describes the device behaviour the numerical methods and simulation conditions will be defined finally the results obtained from the numerical simulations will be presented and substantial conclusions around them will be drawn 2 the concept the moonwec has been originally inspired by the oxyflux antonini et al 2012 2015 2016a b a downwelling device to artificially oxygenate anoxic waters this concept cannot fit in any of the previous classification systems as such but at the same it could suit more than one simultaneously the novelty of moonwec is that encompasses distinct working principles as formulated in the previous section it is composed by two bodies a floating structure and a pto possibly a wells turbine the floater has a hollow cylinder with its axis coincident to the structure s vertical axis when placed into the water this cylinder is filled creating what is commonly known as a moonpool when set under the action of waves not only the structure is excited but so is the moonpool creating a third virtual body the moonpool then behaves similarly to a rigid body thus being able to reach the resonant state if well tuned the energy conversion is supposed to be carried out by taking advantage of the relative motion between the floating structure and the moonpool in order to maximize that relative motion both bodies need to be resonating synchronously with completely opposite phases the moonwec which is thought to be deployed offshore is moored to the seabed through a particular catenary system commonly known as calm system catenary systems are specially suitable for heaving wecs since they mainly block other degrees of freedom while releasing the heave mode free and thus not interfering with energy conversion motion fig 1 shows a cross section of the device the lower plate is a damping disk which aims to introduce a phase lag between the floating structure and the moonpool oscillatory motions furthermore the bi conical upper shape is meant to enhance structure amplitude motion such shape could also stimulate the overtopping effect acting as ramp for waves to climb up the structure and discharge a certain amount of water within the moonpool it all depends on the cone s aperture a closed and steeper cone will decrease the amount of overtopping whereas a flatter and more open cone will have the opposite effect to sum up the moonwec can be considered a point absorber with oscillating body in heave and oscillating water column as major working principles this study focuses on the structure and floating oscillating water column dynamics leaving the overtopping principle for future investigations 3 numerical modelling in this section the mathematical modelling describing the wec s dynamics and the numerical methods applied to simulate them will be thoroughly illustrated a model based on the potential flow theory that follows a lagrangian approach has been developed mainly using the coding commercial software matlab fig 2 illustrates the working scheme of the potential flow model which follows the classical modelling architecture i e the model receives a series of inputs afterwards these inputs are processed in the model core and turned into a series of outputs the input parameters of the model can be divided into three categories the first class is related to the environmental conditions which are defined by data files mainly containing time series of water surface elevation and water particle velocities the second input class refers to the device properties whether it be its geometrical definition the mechanical attributes and the mooring system characteristics finally the last type of inputs are the so called hydrodynamic parameters the purpose of which is to link the environmental conditions to the body behaviour each set of inputs has a specific module within the model core modules can communicate enabling an efficient coupling the model then releases a series of outputs from different nature on the one hand the kinematics of the device which consent to study its response to certain conditions on the other hand the averaged powers for that particular environmental conditions are also gathered allowing to build the so called power matrix capacity factor capture width ratio annual production and other performance indicators the first type of inputs derived from the sea conditions are defined as regular or irregular waves based on the airy theory airy 1845 in order to obtain irregular wave time series the josnwap spectrum has been employed with a peak enhancement parameter equal to γ 3 3 as it best represents the wave properties given at the mediterranean sea archetti et al 2011 in order to minimize the density energy losses when performing the inverse fourier transform f 1 the following discretization of the spectrum has been chosen f 0 δ f 3 f p where δ f 1 t e f p is the spectrum s peak frequency and t e is the total time of the wave record achieving a univocal correlation between the frequency and time domain nevertheless since the spectrum is being truncated at f c o 3 f p there is always a loss of energy related to missing tail of the spectrum 3 f p an algorithm applying energy compensation used by miquel et al 2017 has been implemented it is based on the ratio between the theoretical m 0 and the value that comes from the numerical integration of the truncated spectrum the second kind of inputs are the physical parameters of the device and mooring system that includes the structure mass and tensor of inertia shapes volumes and areas as for the mooring system the inputs are the number and type of lines which includes their linear weight minimum breaking load mbl drag coefficient and their working setup structure fixing point water depth line length and horizontal anchoring point distance the last type of inputs are the so called hydrodynamic parameters i e the excitation force coefficient the radiation damping coefficient and the added mass the first explains the action of waves upon the structure and the second and third the result of moving a body in a fluid to compute such parameters the boundary element method bem based on the potential flow theory has been applied an open source code named nemoh babarit and delhommeau 2015 and developed at the lheea laboratory in the ecole centrale de nantes france has been chosen to obtain the hydrodynamic parameters furthermore nemoh comes with a suite including also a mesher and a matlab toolbox providing the inertia tensor of the body and the hydrostatic restoring matrix fig 3 illustrates the moonwec surface upon which the body boundary condition is computed by the bem method note that for computational efficiency reasons only half of the body is used taking advantage of the moonwec s axisymmetric geometry properties within the model core the dynamic module deals with the inertial forces related to the device structure the hydrodynamic module processes the forces interacting with the flow and the mooring module handles the effect of the mooring system afterwards altogether is plugged into the general equation of motion which is expressed in terms of the newton s second law f m a each dof of the system has its own equation of motion since the dynamics of a certain dof influence another dof dynamics different equations of motions may be linked by coupling coefficients therefore when the system has more than one dof the equations of motion are written in the matrix form having a dimension according to the number of modelled dof and forming a state space system with three variables position velocity and acceleration linked by time as a result the equation of motion system becomes a system of ordinary differential equations ode which has been solved following a runge kutta scheme of the fifth order the moonwec has been modelled as a two body system with four dofs the first body is the floating structure of the device due to its symmetry the body dynamics have been restricted to a single plane freeing it to move in the surge heave and pitch modes the second body is the water entrained in the moonpool orifice which has been allowed to move freely only along the symmetry axis of the floating structure fig 4 presents the schematic of the moonwec used to model the device dynamics it has a fixed coordinate system with its origin placed at the device centre of gravity g the axis x y define the surge and heave modes respectively and the rotation in pitch is described through θ a moving reference system ξ σ is set to account for the dynamics of the moonpool being the axis ξ co linear with the symmetry axis of the moonwec following the notation in fig 4 eq 1 defines the governing expressions for the moonwec structure despite being a matrix system for clarity all dof have been reported separately 1 m x m x x m x θ m x θ θ f e x t f r x t f r x θ t f d x t f m o o r x f m p x m y m y y f e y t f r

wave excitation forces f r t are the radiation damping forces f d t are the viscous drag forces f h t is the hydrostatic restoring force f m o o r t are the forces exerted by the mooring system and f m p and m m p are the forces and moment that the moonpool applies to the moonwec structure the hydrostatic restoring force based on the archimedes principle yields the buoyant effect as if it was a linear spring f h k h z where k h is the hydrostatic stiffness matrix provided by nemoh s toolbox and z is the displacement of the body from the equilibrium position in a generic dof besides the wave excitation and radiation forces have been obtained from the frequency coefficients e ω and r ω given by bem method 2 f e t 2 π 0 e ω cos ω t d ω f e t f e t η t 3 k t 2 π 0 r ω cos ω t d ω f r t k t z

for the convolutions such convolutions when applying the constant delay force the numeric algorithm to run in a fixed time step which is equal or proportional to the delay as a result a substantial increase of the simulations computational costs is obtained nevertheless two alternative methods have been used for the wave excitation force the fact that η t is fully determined and known in advance at any given time allows to integrate it numerically regardless the chosen time step this is not the case for the radiation damping component as z t is one of the state variables and thus an unknown to solve it the prony s approximation is adopted consisting of the substitution of the radiation damping force by a series of virtual state variables f r d i 1 n i i t allows the algorithm to run in a variable time step more details on the prony s method are given in diemer 1987 hauer et al 1990 hauer 1991 this solution is not free and a computational cost is paid due to the increase of the system dimension to be integrated however the gain of getting rid of the fixed time step is larger and the overall balance in computational efficiency is positive to ensure the maximum efficiency it is important to choose the minimum number of state variables that have a good approximation of the radiation force that delivers numerical stability it has been observed that 6 extra i i provide an excellent fitting without overloading excessively the system the last component of the hydrodynamic forces accounts for the fluid viscous effects the drag force is formulated as part of the morison equation and for moving bodies in oscillatory flows yields 4 f d 1 2 ρ c d a d u z u z where ρ is the sea water density u is the water particle velocities z is the body velocity a d is the cross sectional area of the body perpendicular to the flow direction and c d is the drag coefficient in this study the drag force has been decomposed according to the motion direction and the structure part when looking at figure fig 1 three main parts can be identified the upper double cone the central cylinder and the bottom disc hence three sets of a d and c d have been used to compute three drag forces each one acting on a separate part many drag coefficient values are available in literature in this study values from empirical experiments provided by sadraey 2011 have been used to account for the dynamic behaviour of the calm mooring system a single formula is not enough and rather a procedure is needed its response is highly non linear mainly due to the high inertia and drag of the lines due to the size of the lines the induced effect on the device behaviour may not be neglected hence both the dynamic response of the structure and chains must be coupled fig 5 shows both a scheme of a floating platform calm system and a zoom of a catenary line the expression of the mooring force for a single line is shown in eq 5 5 f m o o r t 0 c d l x m c x c where t 0 is the horizontal tension at the equilibrium position c d l is the linearized drag coefficient of the line m c is the mass of the chain and x c is the acceleration of the chain to be added to matrix system shown in eq 1 the shape equations for a catenary line are 6 β p t β h cosh β l 1 β l sinh 1 β l e f f l e f f l t l l where β is called the shape parameter t is the static tension of the chain p is its linear weight h is the water depth l is the horizontal distance from the fairlead in the structure and the point o where the chain lies on the seabed and l e f f is the effective length of suspended chain see fig 5 in these expressions l l e f f and t are unknown variables eq 6 can be manipulated to obtain 7 7 cosh β h 2 2 β h β l t l β h 1 0 as this relation cannot be solved analytically an iterative process based on a newton raphson algorithm of the form zwillinger 2011 has been implemented using eq 7 as the control function f β j an iterative step of β j 1 β j f β j f β j and stop condition of β j 1 β j τ where τ is the tolerance after having found t the chain acceleration needs to be found for the ode describing the dynamics of the platform calm system from fig 5 the position of the chain can be derived and by applying the second time derivate the acceleration of the chain is yielded 8 x c l x β h y l e f f x c x β h y l e f f 2 β y l e f f β y l e f f however the chain acceleration x c depends also on t which in turn depends on the floating structure position x y and thus on the structure acceleration x y as well this makes so that an integration variable of the ode system representing the systems dynamics has a direct dependency on another integration variable x c x y violating the variable independence rule for ode resolution an approximation method of x c is adopted to tackle this issue this method proposed by esmailzhade and goodarzi 2001 addresses the problematic by substituting the shape function of the catenary line by a taylor expansion series to the second order this allows to embed the mooring system within the moonwecs equations of motion without needing to account the chain s acceleration explicitly the results of the taylor expansion and further integration to the equation of motion yield the following expression for the mooring force 9 f m o o r m e q x c d l x a 2 f y 6 d y 2 x e x 3 c x y g y where 10 a p 2 φ ξ f p ξ ψ 2 η φ ξ 3 e p ξ ψ 2

equation 1 only the influence of the moonpool on the moonwec dynamics defined through f m p is to be accounted such forces since their origin is purely inertial are computed by means of the newton s second law f m m p a m where m m p is the moonpool mass and m is the centre of gravity of the moonpool as shown in fig 4 moonpool dynamics can be approximated as a floating cylinder with varying draft b g ξ as first demonstrated by aalbers 1984 hence m s position is not constant with respect to the moonwec varying along the ξ axis thus to compute the acceleration its position must be found first this is done by applying the definition of centre of mass to g m 11 g m b g 2 ξ 2 2 b g ξ now taking the centre of gravity of the structure as reference and projecting g m onto the x y axes the coordinates of the point m are obtained subsequently the time derivative of such coordinates is applied twice to find the acceleration however the inertial forces need to be projected onto the axis σ to obtain the component that has an effective influence to the moonwec structure finally an utter projection of f σ back to the axes x y yields the forces f m p x and f m p y in the correct reference system finally the moment created by the force f σ due to the distance between both gravity centres g m is obtained 12 f σ ρ s m p b g ξ x y θ 2 ξ ξ θ b g 2 ξ 2 2 θ ξ θ 2 θ 2 θ 1 b g ξ ξ ξ θ ξ θ 1 13

the small angle hypothesis the full procedure can be found in annex a the water motion inside a moonpool can be derived by using the deformable control volume approach as the moonpool changes in size over time liu et al 2014 gupta et al 2007 hence the mass conservation condition must be fulfilled 14 s ρ v m p v s n d a d m m p d t where ρ is the water density v m p is the velocity of the water flowing through the control surface v s is the velocity of the floating structure and m m p is the moonpool mass note that v m p v s is the relative velocity v r between the moonpool and the floating structure from the moonpool reference frame the equation of motion of a moonpool is obtained by applying newton s second law by means of the equation momentum for a deformable control volume as written in hansen 1967 15 f d d t c v v ρ d δ c s v ρ v r n d a g m m p p i s m p where v is the fluid velocity in the control volume c v v r is the relative fluid velocity flowing across the control surface s m p g is the gravity acceleration and p i is the pressure acting on the upper side of the c s see fig 4 the force acting on the lower side of the c s can be expressed as follows 16 f o p o s m p f h f e f c f r f d where f h f e f r f d and f c have already been described in previous paragraphs and are expressed through equations 2 4 and 13 respectively the pressure difference between the two sides of the control surface is the cause of the fluid acceleration the following step is to derive the momentum equation of a deformable volume written in eq 15 decomposing it for the axes x and y as f f x f y where v turns into v x and v y the horizontal and vertical velocities of the surface point of the moonpool p x p y p finally as the moonpool axes are ξ σ the forces f x f y are re projected accordingly however the surface of the moonwec is considered impermeable and thus the motion is restricted only in the ξ direction hence only the ξ projection has been carried out yielding f ξ after an extensive mathematical manipulation of equations 14 16 detailedly shown in annex b the expressions reporting the inner and outer pressures of the c s p i and p o are yielded 17 p i f ξ s m p ρ g b g ξ ρ b g ξ x θ y ξ θ 2 ξ g p o ρ g y b g p r a d p e p d the balance between the pressure of the two faces of the control surface s m p is what drives the motion of the moonpool and since there is no physical obstacle within both sides of s m p one can say that p i p o 0 obtaining the following moonpool equation of motion 18 18 p i p o s m p f ξ ρ g s m p y b g f d f r f e ρ s m p b g ξ m ξ ξ x θ y f e ξ η 1 2 c d ξ s m p x θ ξ 2 k ξ x θ ξ ρ s m p b g ξ θ 2 ξ g g y b g m ξ θ x y where m ξ is the added mass coefficient of the moonpool c d ξ is its drag coefficient assumed to be equal to an equivalent cylinder drag coefficient and k ξ and f e ξ are the impulse response functions of the wave radiation and excitation respectively as seen on the previous paragraphs the moonpool is free to move along the ξ axis the potential model was validated through the comparison with experimental data for a simplified case of a moored floating cylinder under regular waves and for the free decay test gaeta et al 2020 the experiments were performed at the laboratory of hydraulic engineering of the university of bologna italy the global dynamic response of the floating cylinder anchored at the bottom through four catenaries was obtained by implementing a videography analysis which provided surge heave and pitch motions under the tested conditions the model results obtained for the case of free heave decay shows a good agreement with the laboratory data reaching errors in the estimation of the natural frequency of around 0 75 4 dimensioning optimization the dimensioning tuning and optimization of the moonwec can be subdivided into three categories corresponding to each physical part of the device firstly the moonpool is dimensioned afterwards the floating structure is designed assuring its compliance with the desired conditions hence resonance is achieved simultaneously and out of phase with the moonpool finally the mooring system is dimensioned and tuned in order to modify as little as possible the device dynamics for the working conditions while preventing it from drifting away as shown in sphaier et al 2007 the natural frequency expression of a system ω 0 k m can be derived into ω 0 g d for the case of a moonpool in heave where k and m are the elasticity and mass of the system g is the gravity acceleration and d is the moonpool draft knowing that the moonpool has to resonate for sea states around t p 6 s typical of sea states at the considered study sites as will be explained later derivation of the moonpool draft and in turn also the structure draft is direct yielding d 9 m having determined on a first attempt the dimensions of the moonpool the structure wrapping the moonpool has to be sized according to the required natural frequency in first approach this is done by applying the fourier transform of the linearized equation of motion 1 thus obtaining the frequency domain equation of motion 19 f e x 0 ω 2 m a i ω b k h where ω is the frequency of the monochromatic wave exciting the structure m is the mass matrix of the system a is the added mass matrix b is the radiation damping matrix k h is the hydrostatic stiffness matrix f e is the excitation force coefficient vector and x 0 is the rao which reflects the unitary response of the system as the draft of the structure is fixed by the moonpool constraint the shape and diameter of the structure are the only variables left to modify the structure has a cone shape on top in order to guarantee a smooth transition in the free surface region also a damping plate has been installed at the bottom to tune the phase of the device this effect however cannot be modelled in the frequency domain as the drag introduced by the plate is non linear therefore the diameter of the body is the parameter upon which the rao sensitivity analysis has been executed table 1 reports the resonant response peak frequency in heave of several structures with different diameters it is observed that for a diameter of 5 m the structure has a natural frequency of ω 0 1 08 rad s which practically coincides with most frequent ω p 1 05 rad s for the selected locations of alghero and mazara del vallo once the preliminary frequency domain design has been completed more detailed time domain analysis must be carried out to properly account for the non linear effects first step is to perform the decay or free oscillation tests this response measured over the time gives the information about the natural period of the system and its damping the chosen initial state of the device is i s x 0 z 0 θ 0 0 1 0 15 using the si units note that null initial displacement has been set for the horizontal dimension it is meaningless to test the surge mode when no mooring system has been introduced since the device will not have a reaction force aiming to bring it back to the equilibrium position the dynamic response over time of the system is shown in fig 6 for the modelled dofs fourier analysis is adopted to highlight the natural frequencies of the system results are reported in fig 7 no anomalies are observed in fig 6 the heave and pitch modes show symmetrical oscillations damped at different rates the moonpool has an offset of the mean oscillatory position to comply with coordinate system introduced in fig 1 and thus showing coordinate ξ the surge mode shows small oscillations which are the result of the cross radiation effect surge pitch finally it assumes a resting position different than zero confirming the lack of a mooring system the frequency domain analysis shown in fig 7 reveals the natural frequencies of the system these show very good agreement with the frequency domain tests in the case of the heave and moonpool modes 1 1 rad s the pitch mode also shows a peak at 0 2 rad s such frequency corresponds to a very long wave practically at the limit of the linear wave theory thereby for survivability the dynamics of the device at that particular frequency must be studied despite the decay test provides full description of the natural device s frequencies the identification of the phase shift between the device and the moonpool cannot be achieved to such purpose the forced oscillation tests are carried out by bringing the device under the action of a monochromatic wave of h 0 5 m and t 6 s in fig 8 the device heave displacement and the absolute and relative to the structure moonpool displacements are plotted after performing the phase analysis of the responses with respect to the free surface the delays found for the structure the absolute and relative displacements of the moonpool are respectively δ h 38 3 δ m a 151 8 and δ m r 185 9 that makes a relative delay between the structure and the relative motion of the moonpool of δ r δ m r δ h 147 6 up to this point the dimensioning of the moonpool and the floating structure is completed and seen to be working as expected as far as the mooring system is concerned six configurations with different number of lines have been studied four with two lines one per side of the structure and another two with four lines two per side of the structure on the geometric layout of the line see fig 5 only three parameters can be predefined the total length of the line l t l e f f d the horizontal distance between the structure and the anchoring point l and the vertical distance from the fair lead to the sea bottom h according to he et al 2017 the chain length is set in proportion to the water depth and it usually ranges from 3 to 6 times the depth 3 h l t 6 h in order to minimize the line weight a total length of l t 3 h has been set taking into account that the water depth is 50 m then l t 150 m within the two line variants two are linked to the structure at its base and the other two at the cog quote the four line variants are both bonded to the structure in the same manner the lower fair leads are placed at the base and the upper ones at the edge of the top cone coinciding with the still water level at rest finally two different anchoring points have been set one at a horizontal distance l 120 m and the other at l 135 m fig 9 illustrates the different variants the physical properties of the lines have been selected according to the guidelines presented in dnv gl 2010 the spiral strand steel wire ropes have been chosen owing to their superior properties more precisely a model having a nominal diameter 76 mm a minimum breaking load of 5647 k n and a submerged nominal weight of 23 8 k g m subsequently decay tests of the full system device and mooring have been carried out for each of the six variants and results have been studied as expected the response in heave suffers very little variation with respect to the calm configuration having a natural period around t 0 6 s and a rao about 4 on the other hand the mooring system increases the stiffness of the system for the pitch mode changing its natural period t 0 and r a o notably to provide an effective comparison the results have been summarized in table 2 also for the unmoored system named variant 0 the left side states the main characteristics of the chosen mooring configurations described in the previous paragraph including the maximum displacements before the lines go slack and taut furthermore the natural periods and raos of the overall system in pitch are shown whereas a general reduction of the natural period in pitch with respect to the variant 0 is detected no clear trend is observed for the rao with strong variations depending on the mooring configuration through the results presented in table 2 variant 3 is identified as the most convenient with the combination of the second most reduced rao even more than that of variant 0 and the largest natural period t 0 28 75 s the closest to variant 0 too the aim is to minimize the pitch mode to avoid some undesired effects such as mathieu resonance horizontal induced loads in the structure sloshing or uneven flow in the moonpool hence mooring system variant 3 has been selected as the optimal mooring configuration for the moonwec 5 results in the following paragraphs a thorough study of the behaviour of variant 3 is presented following the same procedure as with the unmoored device variant 0 firstly the analysis shows the free decay tests this time including the surge mode figs 10 and 11 show the results in the time and frequency domains respectively it is revealed that the heave mode and the moonpool maintain the same response as in the unmoored device for pitch mode a minimal variation of the natural frequency is observed with respect to the device with no mooring passing from t 0 p 31 25 s to t 0 p 28 75 s the surge mode presents a strong correlation with the pitch mode presenting a peak at the pitch s natural frequency and a very low natural frequency meaning that the device tends to set back to the equilibrium position in a slow and smooth way as no relevant differences are detected for the heave mode the forced oscillation analysis has been carried out with a monochromatic wave with a period equal to the pitch s natural period fig 12 shows the expected behaviours a large peak for the pitch mode as it is resonating a unitary response of the heave mode as the wave period is far larger than its natural period and a damped response for the surge mode since its natural period is larger than the wave s period the moonpool presents no response for such frequency meaning that it moves accordingly with the floating structure and hence no relative motion is generated a small perturbation is detected at the moonpool natural period given by the cross correlation with the pitch mode finally the device performance is simulated for the range of sea states characterizing the wave climate given at the selected locations alghero and mazara del vallo in the western coasts of sardinia and sicily respectively that range comprehends waves from 3 to 12 s of peak period and 0 5 to 4 5 m of significant wave height the length of the simulations is set to 1000 waves per sea state as it is considered that the energy of the jonswap spectrum is fully represented by such length fig 13 shows the non dimensional spectra of the device displacements in all modes under four irregular waves with h m 0 1 m and t p ranging from 4 to 10 s normalization has been carried out according to the peak parameters of the wave spectra the wavelength for the surge the tangent of wave steepness in r a d for the pitch and the wave amplitude for the heave and moonpool modes results show the expected behaviour for all modes surge displacements are reduced when compared to the wavelength proving the desired effect of the mooring system of keeping the device in place a very similar trend is observed for the pitch mode as the mooring closely links both modes as already seen in figs 10 and 11 the heave mode presents resonance around the device natural frequency and as foreseen following the free water surface for larger peak periods c d in fig 13 and damping its response for lower peak periods a in fig 13 finally the moonpool mode presents a very interesting behaviour not only by having a larger response which means that the out phasing of the system works but also being able to keep an amplification factor of 3 even if the simulated sea state lies well over the natural period of the device fig 14 displays an extract of the time series of figure fig 13 b showing the dynamics of the system in si units to provide a better physical awareness to fig 13 finally the power captured by the wec is to be estimated while some pto systems have been considered this study focuses on the amount of mechanic power hold in the moonpool by its relative motion with respect to the floating structure hereinafter referred to as net power following the notation from fig 4 the net power is calculated with the classic relation p t f m p t ξ t where f m p t is the moonpool equivalent force obtained from the 2nd newton s law f m p t m m p t ξ t where m m p t is the moonpool mass which is time varying due to the deformable volume condition and computed as m m p t ρ g s m p b g ξ t being ρ the sea water density and g the gravity acceleration subsequently for each simulated sea state the instantaneous power has been computed following the above described procedure and the average value has been placed in the net power matrix a bi variate matrix with respect to the significant wave height and the peak period furthermore the capture width ratio which is the ratio of the absorbed power and the wave energy flux has been computed in the non dimensional form using the moonpool diameter as non dimensionalizing parameter results are presented in figs 15 and 16 respectively in both figures the resonant region is clearly observed around t p 6 s the design resonant period confirming what the previous analysis stated in which power absorption by the moonpool is maximized under the most frequent conditions at alghero and mazara del vallo the moonwecs net rated power and maximum cwr amount to 18 k w and 90 respectively crossing these data with the wave climates at the selected location allows to obtain site specific performance indicators such as the annual energy production aep the average power absorption p the mean capture width ratio cwr and the capacity factor cf such indicators have been computed for the selected locations alghero and mazara del vallo and summarized in table 3 6 conclusions this paper aims to present a new device for wave energy conversion named the moonwec this new concept mixing several working principles is targeted to the mediterranean sea and its wave climate its technical feasibility is explored via numerical modelling a numerical model based on the potential flow theory has been set the code allows parallel computing and implements several tools to improve its computational efficiency the model simulates the response of the wec under the influence of irregular sea states in the time domain the moonwec is composed by three main elements a hollow floating structure a central moonpool and a calm mooring system all of them simulated dynamically the first step in the moonwec s development process consists in the determination of the general dimensions of the device through the frequency domain tests the optimal draft for which the moonpool resonates at the established period of t 6 s is d 9 m the draft of the moonpool is equivalent to the draft of the structure furthermore frequency domain tests also show that the external diameter of the structure must be 5 m in order to achieve resonance for that period time domain tests aimed to define more precisely the dimensional parameters of the device reveal good agreement with the results obtained in the frequency domain tests defining the natural periods of the device in heave and pitch t 0 h 6 s and t 0 p 31 5 s respectively whereas resonance in heave is the main dimensioning target resonance in pitch is a rather undesired effect extra elements such a disc at the bottom and a cone at the top have been added to the structure in order to create a phase lag between the structure and the moonpool by increasing the phase between the two parts of the device their relative motion is amplified thus maximizing the power absorption afterwards the mooring system of the device has been designed six different configurations have been tested a description of the different variants is provided in table 2 and fig 9 results show that all variants have very little influence on the heave mode also it is found that the most pre tensioned schemes reduce considerably the natural period in pitch taking it to a dangerous region where it may likely be excited during stormy events regarding the connection point to the structure the best performance is achieved when the mooring is attached at the level of the structure s cog having very little influence in the pitch mode as well however further investigation should be done in the future at that step since until now free surface elevation has been modelled according to the linear wave theory loads may increase drastically due to non linearity of waves and stormy free surfaces have a non linear behaviour as non linearity increases with steepness in fig 15 the net power is shown that is the wave energy absorbed by the moonpool which shows higher rates around the natural period in heave t 0 h 6 s and a rated power of 18 k w backing the design procedure followed until now furthermore the performance of the device in two of the most promising locations in the mediterranean sea alghero and mazara del vallo has been assessed as shown in table 3 these site specific indicators suggest electricity production is feasible since in the energy chain they represent the available power to the eventual pto system that effectively generates electricity currently few highly efficient pto s such as a wells turbine or an elastomeric material pto can be considered as future developments in this regard according to the world energy council enerdata the average electricity consumption of an italian household is 2 4 m w h y r hence a single moonwec could feed 15 households if deployed in arrays the moonwec could provide electricity to remote islands which lack of energy resources credit authorship contribution statement a m miquel conception and design of study acquisition of data analysis and or interpretation of data drafting the

previous paragraphs the moonpool is free to move along the ξ axis nevertheless the relative motion is blocked along the σ axis by means of the structure walls this exerts a considerable influence in the moonwec dynamics as stated in eq 1 through f m p x and f m p y such forces since their origin is purely inertial are computed by means of the newton s second law 20 f m m p a m where m m p is the moonpool mass which has been obtained from eq 31 and m is the centre of gravity of the moonpool as a result of the deformable volume condition the point m fig 4 is not static with respect to the moonwec and its position varies along the ξ axis thus to compute the acceleration its position must be found first this is done by applying the definition of centre of mass which is no other than a weighted average along the ξ axis yielding the following distance g m 21 g m b g 2 ξ 2 2 b g ξ now taking the centre of gravity of the structure as reference and projecting g m onto the x y axes the coordinates of the point m are obtained subsequently the time derivative of such coordinates is applied twice to find the acceleration and after some mathematical manipulation and the application of the small angle hypothesis the following relations are found 22 x m x b g 2 ξ 2 2 b g ξ sin θ y m y b g 2 ξ 2 2 b g ξ cos θ 23 d x m d t v x m x 1 b g ξ ξ ξ sin θ b g 2 ξ 2 2 ξ sin θ b g ξ cos θ θ d y

the axis σ to obtain the component that has an effective influence to the moonwec structure finally an utter projection of f σ back to the axes x y yields the forces f m p x and f m p y in the correct reference system 25 f x ρ s m p b g ξ a x m f y ρ s m p b g ξ a y m f σ f x cos θ f y sin θ f x f y θ 26 f σ ρ s m p b g ξ x y θ 2 ξ ξ θ b g 2 ξ 2 2 θ ξ θ 2 θ 2 θ 1 b g ξ ξ ξ θ ξ θ 1 27 f m p x f σ

moment created by the force f σ due to the distance between both gravity centres g m obtained in eq 21 28 m m p g g m f σ annex b following the deformable volume approach we have that the mass

where s m p is the area of the cs and b g is the distance from the cog of the structure to s note that the moonwec structure cog has been selected as the origin of the reference system recomposing

21436,climate change increases the probability of dam break flooding making the prediction of flooding zone and dam break wave crucial for the evacuation of people in hazardous areas however the propagation of dam break waves can be affected by different downstream bed conditions such as obstacles dry and wet beds in this study a mesh free method is employed to simulate dam break wave spreading in different bed configurations the mesh free method is good at capturing the free surface in the dam break flow in the numerical method an explicit calculation for the pressure field is used and the spatial operators are based on the moving particle semi implicit method mps the mesh free method is validated to simulate the dam break flow by comparing to available experimental measurements the validated method is then used to simulate the dam break wave propagating over the downstream wet beds with different depths the effect from the combination of dry and wet bed for the dam break wave is also investigated by the mesh free method in the simulations the flow characteristics including free surface flow pattern and wavefront movement and bed shear stress are presented and discussed keywords mesh free method dam break wave free surface wavefront movement 1 introduction climate change can result in more frequent extreme events and increase the probability of dam failure and subsequent flooding it is important to identify the flooding zone and the time caused by dam break flow for the evacuation of people in the hazardous areas in this changing environment there are a number of studies investigating dam break flows in terms of the free surface wavefront movement velocity and pressure fraccarollo and toro 1995 larocque et al 2012 aleixo et al 2011 lobovský et al 2014 based on the saint venant equations for the inviscid fluids ritter 1892 obtained an analytical solution for the dam break flow on the smooth horizontal dry bed it shows that the wavefront for the dam break flow moves at a constant velocity 2 gh 0 0 5 h 0 is the initial water depth deng et al 2018 presented a method to solve the 2d shallow water equations in which they established a relationship between the wave tip velocity and time during the propagation for the dam break wave different downstream conditions may exist such as obstacle and wet downstream bed which might significantly affect the wavefront speed and free surface shape liu et al 2018 carried out a laboratory experiment in a large flume to investigate the flood impact to a downstream block by the dam break wave issakhov and imanberdiyeva 2019 employed a three dimensional model to study the dam break flow by equipping obstacles in the channels in which they found that the volume of fluid based method can simulate the 3d problems feizi khankandi et al 2012 conducted experiments to analyze the reservoir geometry effects on the dam break flow in which they measured the water level and velocity for the flow ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 presented an experimental and numerical investigation of the dam break flow over the dry bed with a bottom sill they employed both reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans and shallow water equations swe to simulate the flow by comparing to the experimental measurements generally rans can simulate better free surface profiles in the flow than swe in their study but it suffers from a much longer computational time the downstream wet bed also plays a very important role in the free surface and wavefront movement in the dam break flow which attracts laboratory and numerical studies khoshkonesh et al 2019 conducted a comparative study of the influence from the initial and geometrical conditions on the dam break flow which can significantly affect the free surface progression flow energy and the resultant force a 2d smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method is shown to reproduce the dam break flow over the wet beds in which the simulated free surface profiles are in good agreement with experimental measurements crespo et al 2008 yang et al 2018 systematically and comparatively studied the influence of the downstream water depth on the propagation of the dam break wave by using flow 3d two and three stages with different flow characteristics for the generation and propagation of the dam break wave can be distinguished respectively for the dry bed and wet bed in the downstream jánosi et al 2004 conducted an experimental study in the dam break flow over the wet bed when the dam break wave encounters different bed conditions in the downstream the near bottom shear stress could vary significantly to study the bed stress distribution in the dam break wave propagation can help understand the free surface variation and wavefront movement to investigate the bed shear stress in the flow numerical modeling provides a useful tool and we employed the mesh free method the mesh free method is commonly used to simulate the dam break flow ferrari et al 2009 yang et al 2012 hui pu et al 2013 xu and jin 2019a it is advantageous in capturing the free surface with large deformation and fragmentation due to the lagrangian nature koshizuka et al 1998 developed the mesh free method of moving particle semi implicit method mps to simulate the incompressible fluid flows the mesh free method is enhanced by many techniques such as improved spatial models khayyer and gotoh 2012 xu and jin 2016 dynamical stabilization technique tsuruta et al 2013 and particle shifting khayyer et al 2017 making the method capable of handling engineering problems to validate these improved techniques in the mesh free method including sph and mps the dam break flow is typically simulated as a benchmark case these techniques have been successfully applied in simulating flows in ocean engineering problems gotoh and khayyer 2016 in the framework of the mps method shakibaeinia and jin 2010 developed the weakly compressible mps method wc mps in which an equation of state by using the particle number density is used fu and jin 2014 simulated the dam break flow by wc mps and the velocity distribution and free surface were used to validate the method xu and jin 2016 2019b derived a laplacian model and a stabilization technique and modeled the dam break flow to validate the method in reproducing the free surface profiles and impacting pressure in the study an mps based mesh free method is employed to simulate the dam break flows with different downstream conditions in the method the pressure field is calculated by an equation to explicitly solve the pressure poisson equation hence one of the aims of this study is to validate this numerical scheme to explicitly solve the pressure poisson equation by modeling a set of dam break flows over dry and wet beds the validated model is then applied to simulate the dam break wave propagating along the wet beds with different water depths by examining flow patterns free surface wavefront movement and near bottom shear stress the combined dry and wet bed is also investigated numerically in terms of wavefront movement and near bottom shear stress the study is organized as follows the mesh free method is presented in section 2 in section 3 the method is validated by simulating the dam break wave along the dry and wet beds section 4 applies the validated method to simulate the dam break wave propagating along the wet bed with different water depths by analyzing the wavefront movement and near bottom shear stress section 5 simulates the dam break flow over the combined dry and wet bed to investigate its effect to the wavefront movement and near bottom shear stress and the final section contains the conclusions 2 the mps based mesh free method the navier stokes equations in the lagrangian framework are as follows 1 1 ρ d ρ d t u 0 2 ρ d u d t p μ 2 u ρ f where ρ is the density of the fluid t is the time u is the velocity vector μ is the dynamic viscosity and f is the body force such as gravity in this study the spatial operators for discretizing the governing equations are based on the mps method while a numerical scheme is employed to obtain the pressure field by explicitly solving the pressure poisson equation in the mesh free method the fluid and boundary are discretized into a set of particles with the same initial distance d l which interact with each other through a weighting function the weighting function by shakibaeinia and jin 2010 and xu and jin 2017 is used in this study the weighting function determines the interaction circle when calculating the flow information for a target particle in which the interaction radius r e is defined to be 4 times the initial particle distance d l r e 4 0d l the pressure gradient is calculated by using the model proposed by koshizuka et al 1998 in which a minimum pressure is used in the local interaction circle for the weighting function to calculate the pressure gradient force the laplacian model from xu and jin 2016 is employed to calculate the viscous term in the governing equations eq 2 which is also used to establish a relationship to obtain the pressure field by solving the pressure poisson equation explicitly the predictor and corrector time splitting scheme is used to solve the governing equations the viscous and force terms are calculated in the predictor so that the intermediate flow information such as the intermediate particle positions and intermediate velocity is obtained by using the intermediate flow properties the pressure gradient term is calculated to update the particle positions and velocity the detailed spatial and time discretization for the mesh free method is referred to in the previous research koshizuka et al 1998 shakibaeinia and jin 2010 xu and jin 2016 the pressure field is calculated using the following equation 3 p i k 1 d m j i p j k g i j k r i j k 1 2 ρ δ t j i w i j r i j x i j u i j y i j v i j r i j d m j i g i j k r i j k 2 where d m is the dimension of space i and j are the indexes for particles i is the target particle j is the neighboring particles r ij is the particle distance r ij is the intermediate particle distance k denotes the previous time step k 1 is the new time step u ij and v ij are the relative velocity components respectively in the x and y directions and x ij and y ij are the relative position between particle i and j g ij is derived from the weighting function and expressed as follows 4 g i j 3 d m 2 w i j r i j w i j r i j where w ij is the weighting function the collision model is adopted to repel approaching particles in this study when the distance of the two particles is less than 0 9d l the collision occurs according to the studies by lee et al 2011 and shakibaeinia and jin 2012 the free surface is identified according to the particle number density as the free surface particle number density is less than a threshold by prescribing zero pressure to that particle koshizuka et al 1998 lee et al 2011 5 n i β n 0 where n i is the intermediate particle number density obtained in the time splitting scheme n 0 is the initial particle number density and β is a coefficient in the range of 0 80 0 99 koshizuka et al 1998 in this study β 0 95 the solid boundary condition is treated according to previous studies by using ghost particles kondo and koshizuka 2011 khayyer and gotoh 2012 xu and jin 2017 the solid boundary is discretized into the solid particles with the distance d l meanwhile several layers of ghost particles are set beyond the solid particles to offset the particle number density deficiency in the vicinity of the boundary the number of the layers for the ghost particles depends on the interaction radius r e for example r e 4 0d l four layers of ghost particles are required the velocity for the solid and ghost particles are set to satisfy the no slip condition the pressure for the discretized solid particles is calculated by eq 3 and the ghost particle s pressure is assigned according to the closest solid particle s pressure the time step implemented in this study satisfies the courant friedrichs lewy condition as lee et al 2008 shadloo et al 2012 6 δ t c c f l d l v m a x where v max is the maximum velocity in the problem and the courant number c cfl 0 1 3 model validation in this section the mesh free method with the explicit calculation of the pressure field by solving the pressure poisson equation is validated by simulating the dam break flows over dry and wet beds in which the simulated free surface profiles are compared to the experimental measurements the first case to validate the method is a dam break flow along the dry bed and experiment for the flow was conducted by ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 in which the free surface profiles were measured the numerical setup for the dam break flow is shown in fig 1 a water column is 4 65 m long and 0 25 m high which initially locates at the left side of the container the simulation is conducted in 2d by using different particle distances as d l 0 0025 m 0 005 m and 0 01 m resulting in total particles of 204 761 55 895 and 16 335 respectively fig 2 shows the comparison of the free surface profiles between the simulation by using different particle distances at t 0 91 s and t 1 06 s the available experimental measurement by ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 at t 1 06 s is also included in fig 2 it shows that using the three different particle distances can obtain very similar free surface profiles at t 0 91 s we observe that there are some fluctuations for the free surface profile close to the wavefront when using the particle distance d l 0 01 m this could be caused by insufficient fluid particles involved in the wavefront for d l 0 01 m at t 1 06 s the simulated free surface profiles are in good agreement with the experimental results the second case to validate the method is a dam break flow over the wet bed and the modeled domain for the dam break flow is shown in fig 3 the left water column is initially set up at a height of 0 15 m and a length of 0 38 m which is connected with the wet bed of the length 9 55 m and water depth h d the experiment for this dam break flow was conducted by jánosi et al 2004 with the measurements for the free surface profiles in a zone of 0 38 m x 1 04 m and 0 0 z 0 13 m crespo et al 2008 also modeled the dam break flow by using a mesh free method in which the pressure is obtained by an equation of state in the dam break flow the effect of the side walls can be negligible and the flow characteristics are mainly 2d therefore in this study the simulation by using the mesh free method is conducted in 2d and two water depths for the wet bed h d 0 018 m and 0 038 m are simulated to discretize the fluid d l 0 002 m resulting in 83 086 particles for the dam break flow h d 0 018 m and 130 826 particles for the flow with the wet bed h d 0 038 m the time step implemented in the simulation is δt 5 0 10 5 s fig 4 shows the simulated free surface profiles for the dam break flow with the downstream water depth h d 0 018 m comparing to the experimental measurements by jánosi et al 2004 and sph simulation by crespo et al 2008 in general the mesh free method can reproduce the trend for the free surface evolution in the dam break flow showing similar free surface deformation to the experiment and the sph simulation at t 0 156 s the wavefront is x 0 5 m in our simulation x 0 48 m in the experiment and x 0 5 m in the sph simulation by crespo et al 2008 at t 0 468 s the wavefront simulated by the method arrives at x 0 95 m with more fragmentation on the free surface the profile of the free surface measured by the experiment exists an empty area with the wavefront at x 0 93 m to further validate the mesh free method the dam break flow over the wet bed with h d 0 038 m is simulated and the free surface profiles are shown in fig 5 by comparing to the experimental measurements jánosi et al 2004 the numerical results at t 0 281 s 0 343 s 0 468 s by crespo et al 2008 are also shown in fig 5 while the result at t 0 593 s is not available in their research this dam break flow was also simulated by using iisph and eisph farzin et al 2019 and their numerical results are included in fig 5 the present numerical results show similar wavefront movement with other numerical results by crespo et al 2008 and by farzin et al 2019 we also observed that the wavefront in all the simulations moves slightly faster than that in the experiment which is especially obvious at t 0 281 s and 0 343 s however the discrepancy for the wavefront shows smaller at t 0 593 s in fig 5 for the free surface comparison in figs 4 and 5 there are some discrepancies between our simulation and the experiment which are more obvious in the vicinity of the wavefront this could be due to the air entrainment during the violent interaction between the collapsing water and the downstream wet bed in the present simulation by the mesh free method the air entrainment as the two phase flow is not taken into account the entrained air can locally affect the free surface deformation and fragmentation in the vicinity of the wavefront resulting in the discrepancy for the free surface comparison however with time increasing and more energy dissipation there are fewer occurrences for the air entrainment thus the simulation by using the single phase model can also reflect the main flow characteristics in the dam break flow over the wet bed 4 dam break flow over the wet bed with different water depths the mesh free method with explicitly solving the pressure poisson equation has been validated by simulating the dam break flows over both dry and wet beds in section 3 the free surface profiles and wavefront movement are well captured by the method comparing to experimental measurements and other numerical results thus in this section the validated method is used to simulate a series of dam break flow over the wet beds with different water depths the numerical setup for the dam break wave propagation is illustrated in fig 3 with a constant initial water column height of 0 15 m and length of 0 38 m but varying the downstream water depths as h d 0 00 m 0 015 m 0 018 m 0 025 m 0 038 m and 0 05 m in the following the flow pattern the wavefront movement and near bottom shear stress are examined in the dam break flows 4 1 flow pattern the snapshots for the dam break flow over a wet bed with h d 0 038 m are shown in fig 6 we can observe that a violent flow with a fragmented free surface occurs during the wavefront movement in the flow an empty area can form in the vicinity of the wavefront such as t 0 281 s we can also observe that a smooth pressure field is achieved by using the present mesh free method shown in fig 6 it should be noted that there are discrepancies for the dam break wave propagation by comparing to the experimental observations by jánosi et al 2004 the backward wave breaking is not well captured in our simulation this could be partly due to the air entrainment in the dam break flow the air entrainment can locally affect deformation and fragmentation for the free surface in the vicinity of the wavefront while the present simulation by using the mesh free method is conducted in the framework of single phase flow on the other hand with the time increasing and energy dissipation the dam break flow becomes weaker and the air entrainment subsequently plays an insignificant role in the flow characteristics the flow pattern can be different in the dam break flow for different water depths in the downstream hence fig 7 shows the flow patterns for the dam break wave propagation over different downstream water depths h d at t 0 281 s with increasing the water depth in the downstream the wavefront movement becomes slower at this moment the wavefront position is 0 8 m for h d 0 0 m while it is 0 65 m for h d 0 05 m meanwhile the wavefront shape is also affected by the water depth in the downstream for the small water depths in the downstream such as h d 0 015 m the height for the wave behind the wavefront is smaller however for h d 0 038 m and 0 05 m more water accumulates behind the wavefront forming a higher wave moreover we can observe that a smooth pressure field is obtained in the simulation by using the explicit approach to solve the pressure poisson equation eq 3 4 2 wavefront movement the wavefront movement can be affected by the water depths of the wet bed and the wavefront movement is illustrated in fig 8 for the dam break flow over the wet bed with water depths of h d 0 00 m 0 015 m 0 025 m 0 038 m and 0 05 m it shows that the wavefront movement for all the downstream water depths is very similar at the beginning from t 0 0 s 0 1 s subsequently with more interaction with the downstream water body the wavefront movement is affected for all the water depths h d 0 0 m 0 05 m the wavefront position with time shows to be almost a linear relation after t 0 1 s the wavefront for h d 0 0 m moves fastest with a very steep movement trajectory with time with increasing the depth h d the slope for the wavefront movement with time becomes milder shown in fig 8 we calculated the average speed for the wavefront movement for all the water depths h d according to the wavefront movement trajectory in fig 8 at the beginning of the flow from t 0 0 s 0 1 s the average speed for the wavefront is around v f 0 70 m s for all the water depths h d from t 0 0 s 1 0 s without any water in the downstream h d 0 0 m the average speed for the wavefront is v f 1 60 m s with water in the downstream the speed for the wavefront from t 0 0 s 1 0 s is deceased for example for h d 0 015 m v f 1 01 m s the wet bed can decrease the wavefront propagation for the dam break flow however when the downstream water is deeper for the dam break flow the wavefront speed is less affected by the water depth as v f 0 633 m s for h d 0 038 m and v f 0 54 m s for h d 0 05 m 4 3 bed shear stress the downstream wet bed can affect the near bottom shear stress in the dam break flow which shows different distribution along the bed for different water depths we calculated the near bottom shear stress by considering the horizontal velocity in the simulation as τ μdu dz μ is the dynamic viscosity for the water we calculated the average horizontal velocity from the bottom to the water level 0 01 m and a similar calculation is implemented in the analysis of experimental measurements by lin et al 2018 to obtain the bed shear stress it should be noted that the simulation is conducted on the smooth bed without any configuration of roughness the study focuses on the effect on the dam break wave propagation from different downstream water depths the bed shear stress distribution for the dam break flow of two water depths h d 0 0 m and 0 018 m is shown in fig 9 for h d 0 0 m in fig 9a the bed shear stress shows an increasing trend from the left wall x 0 0 m and reaches the largest value at the leading edge of the wavefront at each time step in the dam break flow the near bottom shear stress is larger than 0 1 pa from t 0 15 s 0 9 s and it can reach 0 144 pa at t 0 45 s arnskov et al 1993 measured the bed shear stress over a smooth bed for the wave current motion and the near bottom shear stress is 0 159 pa when the downstream bed is wet with the presence of water such as h d 0 018 m shown in fig 9b the near bottom shear stress is affected reducing to 0 063 pa for the peak value at t 0 45 s which is smaller than that for the dry wet in the dam break flow fig 9a the largest bed shear stress also occurs at the leading edge in the vicinity of the wavefront in the dam break flow a different near bottom shear stress trend can be observed at t 0 90 s compared to the results for the flow over the dry in which the bed shear stress shows to be relatively flat in the range of x 0 6 m 1 3 m this could be due to the wavefront interaction to the downstream wet bed inducing a more equivalent near bed x component velocity distribution in the vicinity of the wavefront the bed shear stress can be different in the dam break wave propagation over different water depths in the downstream wet bed to examine it the near bottom shear stress distribution at t 0 9 s is plotted for the various downstream water depths of h d 0 0 m 0 015 m 0 018 m 0 038 m and 0 05 m shown in fig 10 it shows that the near bottom shear stress increases steeply to the wavefront for the dry bed h d 0 0 m while the stress shows a relatively flat distribution for the wet bed the interaction between the dam break wave and the downstream water results in a more uniform horizontal near bottom velocity so that the stress is eliminated by the downstream water smaller stress is obtained for the deeper water in the downstream shown in the figure for example for h d 0 05 m the average τ 0 0153 pa from x 0 0 m 1 5 m and h d 0 015 m the average τ 0 0322 pa from x 0 0 m 1 5 m on the other hand there are some fluctuations in the near bottom shear stress distribution this could be attributed to the collision model used in the simulations in the mesh free method the particles can approach each other resulting in the clustering of particles to avoid particles clustering we used the collision proposed by lee et al 2011 when the distance of the two particles approaching each other and their distance is shorter than 0 9d l the collision occurs to prevent further approaching meanwhile the collision can cause slight fluctuations of the velocity which the particles carry and thus the bed shear stress shows to be some fluctuations 5 dam break flow over the combined dry and wet downstream bed the above simulations found that both the dry and wet beds can affect the wave propagation in terms of wavefront movement and near bottom shear stress in hydraulic engineering the dam break flow rarely propagates simply in a dry or wet bed but spreads in a more complex downstream condition with alternatively dry and wet beds to study the effect of this alternatively dry and wet bed we simplified the condition as a length of the dry bed with the rest of the wet bed in the same height h d shown in fig 11 we analyzed the flow pattern wavefront movement and near bottom shear stress in the dam break wave propagating over the combined bed condition the length of the dry bed is denoted as l d and the height for both the dry and wet bed is defined as h d 0 05 m the left water column is initially set up to be 0 15 m high and 0 38 m long while the length of the dry bed in the combined condition is varied to be l d 0 05 m 0 10 m 0 15 m and 0 20 m these simulations aim to investigate the effect of the length of the dry bed l d on the dam break wave propagation 5 1 flow pattern the lengths of the dry bed l d 0 05 m 0 10 m 0 15 m and 0 20 m are investigated to examine the effect on the dam break wave propagation fig 12 shows the snapshots of the dam break wave propagation over the combined bed with l d 0 15 m the dam break wave propagates along the dry bed reaching the end of it at t 0 15 s subsequently the wave has an interaction with the downstream wet bed causing free surface fragmented at t 0 3 s and 0 6 s shown in the figure the dam break wave can push the downstream water body moving and meanwhile its speed is reduced to clearly show the effect of the length for the dry bed fig 13 illustrates the flow pattern for the dam break wave propagating along different lengths of the dry bed for the combined condition at t 0 3 s with the increase of the length l d the interaction to the downstream wet bed becomes weaker for l d 0 05 m a higher wave peak can be observed behind the dry bed while it shows to be a much weaker wave for l d 0 2 m the simulations suggest that the wavefront in the dam break flow can have a stronger interaction with the wet bed than the dry bed in the interaction to the wet bed the free surface can show more deformation which can be observed at t 0 6 s in fig 12 hence the speed of the wavefront can be affected by the wet bed after propagation over the dry bed 5 2 wavefront movement fig 14 shows the wavefront position for the dam break flow over the combined downstream condition with different lengths of l d at the beginning of the dam break flow the dam break wave propagates at the same speed since the downstream condition and the initial left water column are the same when the wave reaches the end of the dry bed the wavefront movement shows a different curve since the dam break wave starts to interact with the wet bed thus we can observe that the wavefront movement is the same in the overlapped line in the beginning and then there is a branch when the wave reaches the end of the dry bed in fig 14 we calculated the average speed between t 0 0 s and 1 0 s for the wave propagation over the combined bed condition for the dam break wave according to the wavefront position with time in fig 14 with the increase of the dry bed length the average speed is increased for the dam break wave for larger l d the dam break wave propagates along the dry bed to a longer distance and thus the hindering effect from the wet bed is eliminated for l d 0 2 m the average speed for the wavefront v f 0 58 m s while for l d 0 0 m v f 0 54 m s 5 3 bed shear stress we also analyzed the near bottom shear stress distribution for this type of dam break flow over the combined dry and wet bed shown in fig 15 a the dry bed results in large variation for the velocity gradient so that the bed shear stress shows a severe variation taking the time t 0 20 s as an example the bed shear stress increases along the bed and it reaches the peak value at the end of the dry bed at x 0 48 m subsequently the bed shear stress decreases sharply to zero at x 0 50 m after it the wavefront has a strong interaction with the downstream water causing an increase for the bed shear stress which reaches a value of τ 0 0038 pa at the wavefront x 0 60 m after the wavefront the bed shear stress decreases rapidly to zero since there is almost the static water without influence by the dam break wave similar bed shear stress distribution can be observed at other time steps in the dam break wave propagation however the peak value for the bed shear stress at the end of the dry bed decreases with time increase for example at t 0 20 s τ 0 0758 pa compared to τ 0 0535 pa at t 0 90 s this is because the shearing on the dry bed by the dam break wave becomes weaker after energy dissipation with the time increasing meanwhile with the propagation for the dam break wave over the dry bed the interaction for the wavefront to the downstream water becomes stronger inducing an increase of the bed shear stress to τ 0 023 pa at t 0 90 s compared with that at t 0 20 s fig 15b shows the near bottom shear stress for the various lengths of the dry bed in the dam break wave propagation at t 0 45 s with the increase of l d the near bottom shear stress at the end of the dry bed decreases the peak value at the end of the dry bed is the largest for the shortest length l d in the figure such as the largest value τ 0 057 pa for l d 0 05 m at this time step the bed shear stress has a sharp increase over the dry bed whereas it shows to be a flatter distribution without the dry bed l d 0 0 m around the wavefront in the downstream of the dry bed at this time step the bed shear stress shows a decreasing trend with the length of the dry bed l d for example τ 0 035 pa for l d 0 20 m and τ 0 057 pa for l d 0 05 m this is because more energy for the flow is dissipated during the wave propagating on the dry bed and the interaction between the wavefront and the downstream water body becomes weaker for the longer obstacle resulting in a smaller bed shear stress 6 conclusions in this study a mesh free method is used to simulate the dam break flow with different configurations for the downstream bed in the method the spatial operators are based on the mps method in which the predictor and corrector time splitting scheme is employed to obtain the pressure field an explicit scheme to solve the pressure poisson equation is adopted which satisfies the mass conservation in modeling the incompressible fluid flows the method is validated by simulating the dam break wave propagation along the dry bed by using different numerical resolutions the simulated free surface profiles have a good agreement with the experimental measurements in the flow and a good numerical convergence is observed the numerical method is also validated by modeling the dam break wave propagating along the wet bed although some discrepancies can be observed due to influence from the air in the flow the trend of dam break wave propagation is reproduced by the method particularly for the wavefront movement for the dam break wave spreading on the dry and wet beds a smooth pressure field is achieved in the simulations by using the explicit pressure calculation approach in the mesh free method after validation of the mesh free method it is applied to simulate the dam break wave propagating along different downstream bed conditions to investigate the effect of the bed configuration on the wavefront movement and near bottom shear stress when the dam break wave encounters the wet bed the wave can push the downstream water body forwards while the wavefront speed is reduced for the dry bed with h d 0 0 m the average speed for the dam break wave is v f 1 60 m s when the downstream water depth is increased to 0 05 m the average speed v f is reduced to 0 54 m s the downstream water depth can result in a more uniform bed shear stress compared to the flow with the dry bed and the large value of bed shear stress occurs in the vicinity of the wavefront with a constant height for the downstream configuration h d 0 05 m the dam break wave propagation can also be affected by different combinations of the dry and wet beds its effect is investigated by varying the dry bed length l d 0 0 0 2 m for the dam break wave triggered by the same initial water column the dam break wave propagates along the dry bed and its movement shows a different trend when reaching the end of the dry bed the dam break wave can push the downstream water body making much water accumulate behind the wavefront thus the free surface is also significantly affected by the length of the dry bed with a shorter length l d due to energy dissipation along the dry bed the wave is very weak when reaching the end of the dry bed for l d 0 0 m the average speed for the dam break wave is v f 0 54 m s while for l d 0 2 m the speed is v f 0 58 m s the bed shear stress is increasing along the dry bed and reaches the peak value at the end of the dry bed when increasing the length of the dry bed the peak value for the bed shear stress decreases at the wavefront the bed shear stress is also very large but its value decreases with increasing the length of the dry bed in the simulations a smooth pressured field is achieved which is due to the pressure calculation by an explicit approach to solve the pressure poisson equation credit authorship contribution statement yiqun

21436,climate change increases the probability of dam break flooding making the prediction of flooding zone and dam break wave crucial for the evacuation of people in hazardous areas however the propagation of dam break waves can be affected by different downstream bed conditions such as obstacles dry and wet beds in this study a mesh free method is employed to simulate dam break wave

and discussed keywords mesh free method dam break wave free surface wavefront movement 1 introduction climate change can result in more frequent extreme events and increase the probability of dam failure and subsequent flooding it is important to identify the flooding zone and the time caused by dam break flow for the evacuation of people in the hazardous areas in this changing environment there are a number of studies investigating dam break flows in terms of the free surface wavefront movement velocity and pressure fraccarollo and toro 1995 larocque et al 2012 aleixo et al 2011 lobovský et al 2014 based on the saint venant equations for the inviscid fluids ritter 1892 obtained an analytical solution for the dam break flow on the smooth horizontal dry bed it shows that the wavefront for the dam break flow moves at a constant velocity 2 gh 0 0 5 h 0 is the initial water depth deng et al 2018 presented a method to solve the 2d shallow water equations in which they established a relationship between the wave tip velocity and time during the propagation for the dam break wave different downstream conditions may exist such as obstacle and wet downstream bed which might significantly affect the wavefront speed and free surface shape liu et al 2018 carried out a laboratory experiment in a large flume to investigate the flood impact to a downstream block by the dam break wave issakhov and imanberdiyeva 2019 employed a three dimensional model to study the dam break flow by equipping obstacles in the channels in which they found that the volume of fluid based method can simulate the 3d problems feizi khankandi et al 2012 conducted experiments to analyze the reservoir geometry effects on the dam break flow in which they measured the water level and velocity for the flow ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 presented an experimental and numerical investigation of the dam break flow over the dry bed with a bottom sill they employed both reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans and shallow water equations swe to simulate the flow by comparing to the experimental measurements generally rans can simulate better free surface profiles in the flow than swe in their study but it suffers from a much longer computational time the downstream wet bed also plays a very important role in the free surface and wavefront movement in the dam break flow which attracts laboratory and numerical studies khoshkonesh et al 2019 conducted a comparative study of the influence from the initial and geometrical conditions on the dam break flow which can significantly affect the free surface progression flow energy and the resultant force a 2d smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method is shown to reproduce the dam break flow over the wet beds in which the simulated free surface profiles are in good agreement with experimental measurements crespo et al 2008 yang et al 2018 systematically and comparatively studied the influence of the downstream water depth on the propagation of the dam break wave by using flow 3d two and three stages with different flow characteristics for the generation and propagation of the dam break wave can be distinguished respectively for the dry bed and wet bed in the downstream jánosi et al 2004 conducted an experimental study in the dam break flow over the wet bed when the dam break wave encounters different bed conditions in the downstream the near bottom shear stress could vary significantly to study the bed stress distribution in the dam break wave propagation can help understand the free surface variation and wavefront movement to investigate the bed shear stress in the flow numerical modeling provides a useful tool and we employed the mesh free method the mesh free method is commonly used to simulate the dam break flow ferrari et al 2009 yang et al 2012 hui pu et al 2013 xu and jin 2019a it is advantageous in capturing the free surface with large deformation and fragmentation due to the lagrangian nature koshizuka et al 1998 developed the mesh free method of moving particle semi implicit method mps to simulate the incompressible fluid flows the mesh free method is enhanced by many techniques such as improved spatial models khayyer and gotoh 2012 xu and jin 2016 dynamical stabilization technique tsuruta et al 2013 and particle shifting khayyer et al 2017 making the method capable of handling engineering problems to validate these improved techniques in the mesh free method including sph and mps the dam break flow is typically simulated as a benchmark case these techniques have been successfully applied in simulating flows in ocean engineering problems gotoh and khayyer 2016 in the framework of the mps method shakibaeinia and jin 2010 developed the weakly compressible mps method wc mps in which an equation of state by using the particle number density is used fu and jin 2014 simulated the dam break flow by wc mps and the velocity distribution and free surface were used to validate the method xu and jin 2016 2019b derived a laplacian model and a stabilization technique and modeled the dam break flow to validate the method in reproducing the free surface profiles and impacting pressure in the study an mps based mesh free method is employed to simulate the dam break flows with different downstream conditions in the method the pressure field is calculated by an equation to explicitly solve the pressure poisson equation hence one of the aims of this study is to validate this numerical scheme to explicitly solve the pressure poisson equation by modeling a set of dam break flows over dry and wet beds the validated model is then applied to simulate the dam break wave propagating along the wet beds with different water depths by examining flow patterns free surface wavefront movement and near bottom shear stress the combined dry and wet bed is also investigated numerically in terms of wavefront movement and near bottom shear stress the study is organized as follows the mesh free method is presented in section 2 in section 3 the method is validated by simulating the dam break wave along the dry and wet beds section 4 applies the validated method to simulate the dam break wave propagating along the wet bed with different water depths by analyzing the wavefront movement and near bottom shear stress section 5 simulates the dam break flow over the combined dry and wet bed to investigate its effect to the wavefront movement and near bottom shear stress and the final section contains the conclusions 2 the mps based mesh free method the navier stokes equations in the lagrangian framework are as follows 1 1 ρ d ρ d t u 0 2 ρ d u d t p μ 2 u ρ f where ρ is the density of the fluid t is the time u is the velocity vector μ is the dynamic viscosity and f is the body force such as gravity in this study the spatial operators for discretizing the governing equations are based on the mps method while a numerical scheme is employed to obtain the pressure field by explicitly solving the pressure poisson equation in the mesh free method the fluid and boundary are discretized into a set of particles with the same initial distance d l which interact with each other through a weighting function the weighting function by shakibaeinia and jin 2010 and xu and jin 2017 is used in this study the weighting function determines the interaction circle when calculating the flow information for a target particle in which the interaction radius r e is defined to be 4 times the initial particle distance d l r e 4 0d l the pressure gradient is calculated by using the model proposed by koshizuka et al 1998 in which a minimum pressure is used in the local interaction circle for the weighting function to calculate the pressure gradient force the laplacian model from xu and jin 2016 is employed to calculate the viscous term in the governing equations eq 2 which is also used to establish a relationship to obtain the pressure field by solving the pressure poisson equation explicitly the predictor and corrector time splitting scheme is used to solve the governing equations the viscous and force terms are calculated in the predictor so that the intermediate flow information such as the intermediate particle positions and intermediate velocity is obtained by using the intermediate flow properties the pressure gradient term is calculated to update the particle positions and velocity the detailed spatial and time discretization for the mesh free method is referred to in the previous research koshizuka et al 1998 shakibaeinia and jin 2010 xu and jin 2016 the pressure field is calculated using the following equation 3 p i k 1 d m j i p j k g i j k r i j k 1 2 ρ δ t j i w i j r i j x i j u i j y i j v i j r i j d m j i g i j k r i j k 2 where d m is the dimension of space i and j are the indexes for particles i is the target particle j is the neighboring particles r ij is the particle distance r ij is the intermediate particle distance k denotes the previous time step k 1 is the new time step u ij and v ij are the relative velocity components respectively in the x and y directions and x ij and y ij are the relative position between particle i and j g ij is derived from the weighting function and expressed as follows 4 g i j 3 d m 2 w i j r i j w i j r i j where w ij is the weighting function the collision model is adopted to repel approaching particles in this study when the distance of the two particles is less than 0 9d l the collision occurs according to the studies by lee et al 2011 and shakibaeinia and jin 2012 the free surface is identified according to the particle number density as the free surface particle number density is less than a threshold by prescribing zero pressure to that particle koshizuka et al 1998 lee et al 2011 5 n i β n 0 where n i is the intermediate particle number density obtained in the time splitting scheme n 0 is the initial particle number density and β is a coefficient in the range of 0 80 0 99 koshizuka et al 1998 in this study β 0 95 the solid boundary condition is treated according to previous studies by using ghost particles kondo and koshizuka 2011 khayyer and gotoh 2012 xu and jin 2017 the solid boundary is discretized into the solid particles with the distance d l meanwhile several layers of ghost particles are set beyond the solid particles to offset the particle number density deficiency in the vicinity of the boundary the number of the layers for the ghost particles depends on the interaction radius r e for example r e 4 0d l four layers of ghost particles are required the velocity for the solid and ghost particles are set to satisfy the no slip condition the pressure for the discretized solid particles is calculated by eq 3 and the ghost particle s pressure is assigned according to the closest solid particle s pressure the time step implemented in this study satisfies the courant friedrichs lewy condition as lee et al 2008 shadloo et al 2012 6 δ t c c f l d l v m a x where v max is the maximum velocity in the problem and the courant number c cfl 0 1 3 model validation in this section the mesh free method with the explicit calculation of the pressure field by solving the pressure poisson equation is validated by simulating the dam break flows over dry and wet beds in which the simulated free surface profiles are compared to the experimental measurements the first case to validate the method is a dam break flow along the dry bed and experiment for the flow was conducted by ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 in which the free surface profiles were measured the numerical setup for the dam break flow is shown in fig 1 a water column is 4 65 m long and 0 25 m high which initially locates at the left side of the container the simulation is conducted in 2d by using different particle distances as d l 0 0025 m 0 005 m and 0 01 m resulting in total particles of 204 761 55 895 and 16 335 respectively fig 2 shows the comparison of the free surface profiles between the simulation by using different particle distances at t 0 91 s and t 1 06 s the available experimental measurement by ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 at t 1 06 s is also included in fig 2 it shows that using the three different particle distances can obtain very similar free surface profiles at t 0 91 s we observe that there are some fluctuations for the free surface profile close to the wavefront when using the particle distance d l 0 01 m this could be caused by insufficient fluid particles involved in the wavefront for d l 0 01 m at t 1 06 s the simulated free surface profiles are in good agreement with the experimental results the second case to validate the method is a dam break flow over the wet bed and the modeled domain for the dam break flow is shown in fig 3 the left water column is initially set up at a height of 0 15 m and a length of 0 38 m which is connected with the wet bed of the length 9 55 m and water depth h d the experiment for this dam break flow was conducted by jánosi et al 2004 with the measurements for the free surface profiles in a zone of 0 38 m x 1 04 m and 0 0 z 0 13 m crespo et al 2008 also modeled the dam break flow by using a mesh free method in which the pressure is obtained by an equation of state in the dam break flow the effect of the side walls can be negligible and the flow characteristics are mainly 2d therefore in this study the simulation by using the mesh free method is conducted in 2d and two water depths for the wet bed h d 0 018 m and 0 038 m are simulated to discretize the fluid d l 0 002 m resulting in 83 086 particles for the dam break flow h d 0 018 m and 130 826 particles for the flow with the wet bed h d 0 038 m the time step implemented in the simulation is δt 5 0 10 5 s fig 4 shows the simulated free surface profiles for the dam break flow with the downstream water depth h d 0 018 m comparing to the experimental measurements by jánosi et al 2004 and sph simulation by crespo et al 2008 in general the mesh free method can reproduce the trend for the free surface evolution in the dam break flow showing similar free surface deformation to the experiment and the sph simulation at t 0 156 s the wavefront is x 0 5 m in our simulation x 0 48 m in the experiment and x 0 5 m in the sph simulation by crespo et al 2008 at t 0 468 s the wavefront simulated by the method arrives at x 0 95 m with more fragmentation on the free surface the profile of the free surface measured by the experiment exists an empty area with the wavefront at x 0 93 m to further validate the mesh free method the dam break flow over the wet bed with h d 0 038 m is simulated and the free surface profiles are shown in fig 5 by comparing to the experimental measurements jánosi et al 2004 the numerical results at t 0 281 s 0 343 s 0 468 s by crespo et al 2008 are also shown in fig 5 while the result at t 0 593 s is not available in their research this dam break flow was also simulated by using iisph and eisph farzin et al 2019 and their numerical results are included in fig 5 the present numerical results show similar wavefront movement with other numerical results by crespo et al 2008 and by farzin et al 2019 we also observed that the wavefront in all the simulations moves slightly faster than that in the experiment which is especially obvious at t 0 281 s and 0 343 s however the discrepancy for the wavefront shows smaller at t 0 593 s in fig 5 for the free surface comparison in figs 4 and 5 there are some discrepancies between our simulation and the experiment which are more obvious in the vicinity of the wavefront this could be due to the air entrainment during the violent interaction between the collapsing water and the downstream wet bed in the present simulation by the mesh free method the air entrainment as the two phase flow is not taken into account the entrained air can locally affect the free surface deformation and fragmentation in the vicinity of the wavefront resulting in the discrepancy for the free surface comparison however with time increasing and more energy dissipation there are fewer occurrences for the air entrainment thus the simulation by using the single phase model can also reflect the main flow characteristics in the dam break flow over the wet bed 4 dam break flow over the wet bed with different water depths the mesh free method with explicitly solving the pressure poisson equation has been validated by simulating the dam break flows over both dry and wet beds in section 3 the free surface profiles and wavefront movement are well captured by the method comparing to experimental measurements and other numerical results thus in this section the validated method is used to simulate a series of dam break flow over the wet beds with different water depths the numerical setup for the dam break wave propagation is illustrated in fig 3 with a constant initial water column height of 0 15 m and length of 0 38 m but varying the downstream water depths as h d 0 00 m 0 015 m 0 018 m 0 025 m 0 038 m and 0 05 m in the following the flow pattern the wavefront movement and near bottom shear stress are examined in the dam break flows 4 1 flow pattern the snapshots for the dam break flow over a wet bed with h d 0 038 m are shown in fig 6 we can observe that a violent flow with a fragmented free surface occurs during the wavefront movement in the flow an empty area can form in the vicinity of the wavefront such as t 0 281 s we can also observe that a smooth pressure field is achieved by using the present mesh free method shown in fig 6 it should be noted that there are discrepancies for the dam break wave propagation by comparing to the experimental observations by jánosi et al 2004 the backward wave breaking is not well captured in our simulation this could be partly due to the air entrainment in the dam break flow the air entrainment can locally affect deformation and fragmentation for the free surface in the vicinity of the wavefront while the present simulation by using the mesh free method is conducted in the framework of single phase flow on the other hand with the time increasing and energy dissipation the dam break flow becomes weaker and the air entrainment subsequently plays an insignificant role in the flow characteristics the flow pattern can be different in the dam break flow for different water depths in the downstream hence fig 7 shows the flow patterns for the dam break wave propagation over different downstream water depths h d at t 0 281 s with increasing the water depth in the downstream the wavefront movement becomes slower at this moment the wavefront position is 0 8 m for h d 0 0 m while it is 0 65 m for h d 0 05 m meanwhile the wavefront shape is also affected by the water depth in the downstream for the small water depths in the downstream such as h d 0 015 m the height for the wave behind the wavefront is smaller however for h d 0 038 m and 0 05 m more water accumulates behind the wavefront forming a higher wave moreover we can observe that a smooth pressure field is obtained in the simulation by using the explicit approach to solve the pressure poisson equation eq 3 4 2 wavefront movement the wavefront movement can be affected by the water depths of the wet bed and the wavefront movement is illustrated in fig 8 for the dam break flow over the wet bed with water depths of h d 0 00 m 0 015 m 0 025 m 0 038 m and 0 05 m it shows that the wavefront movement for all the downstream water depths is very similar at the beginning from t 0 0 s 0 1 s subsequently with more interaction with the downstream water body the wavefront movement is affected for all the water depths h d 0 0 m 0 05 m the wavefront position with time shows to be almost a linear relation after t 0 1 s the wavefront for h d 0 0 m moves fastest with a very steep movement trajectory with time with increasing the depth h d the slope for the wavefront movement with time becomes milder shown in fig 8 we calculated the average speed for the wavefront movement for all the water depths h d according to the wavefront movement trajectory in fig 8 at the beginning of the flow from t 0 0 s 0 1 s the average speed for the wavefront is around v f 0 70 m s for all the water depths h d from t 0 0 s 1 0 s without any water in the downstream h d 0 0 m the average speed for the wavefront is v f 1 60 m s with water in the downstream the speed for the wavefront from t 0 0 s 1 0 s is deceased for example for h d 0 015 m v f 1 01 m s the wet bed can decrease the wavefront propagation for the dam break flow however when the downstream water is deeper for the dam break flow the wavefront speed is less affected by the water depth as v f 0 633 m s for h d 0 038 m and v f 0 54 m s for h d 0 05 m 4 3 bed shear stress the downstream wet bed can affect the near bottom shear stress in the dam break flow which shows different distribution along the bed for different water depths we calculated the near bottom shear stress by considering the horizontal velocity in the simulation as τ μdu dz μ is the dynamic viscosity for the water we calculated the average horizontal velocity from the bottom to the water level 0 01 m and a similar calculation is implemented in the analysis of experimental measurements by lin et al 2018 to obtain the bed shear stress it should be noted that the simulation is conducted on the smooth bed without any configuration of roughness the study focuses on the effect on the dam break wave propagation from different downstream water depths the bed shear stress distribution for the dam break flow of two water depths h d 0 0 m and 0 018 m is shown in fig 9 for h d 0 0 m in fig 9a the bed shear stress shows an increasing trend from the left wall x 0 0 m and reaches the largest value at the leading edge of the wavefront at each time step in the dam break flow the near bottom shear stress is larger than 0 1 pa from t 0 15 s 0 9 s and it can reach 0 144 pa at t 0 45 s arnskov et al 1993 measured the bed shear stress over a smooth bed for the wave current motion and the near bottom shear stress is 0 159 pa when the downstream bed is wet with the presence of water such as h d 0 018 m shown in fig 9b the near bottom shear stress is affected reducing to 0 063 pa for the peak value at t 0 45 s which is smaller than that for the dry wet in the dam break flow fig 9a the largest bed shear stress also occurs at the leading edge in the vicinity of the wavefront in the dam break flow a different near bottom shear stress trend can be observed at t 0 90 s compared to the results for the flow over the dry in which the bed shear stress shows to be relatively flat in the range of x 0 6 m 1 3 m this could be due to the wavefront interaction to the downstream wet bed inducing a more equivalent near bed x component velocity distribution in the vicinity of the wavefront the bed shear stress can be different in the dam break wave propagation over different water depths in the downstream wet bed to examine it the near bottom shear stress distribution at t 0 9 s is plotted for the various downstream water depths of h d 0 0 m 0 015 m 0 018 m 0 038 m and 0 05 m shown in fig 10 it shows that the near bottom shear stress increases steeply to the wavefront for the dry bed h d 0 0 m while the stress shows a relatively flat distribution for the wet bed the interaction between the dam break wave and the downstream water results in a more uniform horizontal near bottom velocity so that the stress is eliminated by the downstream water smaller stress is obtained for the deeper water in the downstream shown in the figure for example for h d 0 05 m the average τ 0 0153 pa from x 0 0 m 1 5 m and h d 0 015 m the average τ 0 0322 pa from x 0 0 m 1 5 m on the other hand there are some fluctuations in the near bottom shear stress distribution this could be attributed to the collision model used in the simulations in the mesh free method the particles can approach each other resulting in the clustering of particles to avoid particles clustering we used the collision proposed by lee et al 2011 when the distance of the two particles approaching each other and their distance is shorter than 0 9d l the collision occurs to prevent further approaching meanwhile the collision can cause slight fluctuations of the velocity which the particles carry and thus the bed shear stress shows to be some fluctuations 5 dam break flow over the combined dry and wet downstream bed the above simulations found that both the dry and wet beds can affect the wave propagation in terms of wavefront movement and near bottom shear stress in hydraulic engineering the dam break flow rarely propagates simply in a dry or wet bed but spreads in a more complex downstream condition with alternatively dry and wet beds to study the effect of this alternatively dry and wet bed we simplified the condition as a length of the dry bed with the rest of the wet bed in the same height h d shown in fig 11 we analyzed the flow pattern wavefront movement and near bottom shear stress in the dam break wave propagating over the combined bed condition the length of the dry bed is denoted as l d and the height for both the dry and wet bed is defined as h d 0 05 m the left water column is initially set up to be 0 15 m high and 0 38 m long while the length of the dry bed in the combined condition is varied to be l d 0 05 m 0 10 m 0 15 m and 0 20 m these simulations aim to investigate the effect of the length of the dry bed l d on the dam break wave propagation 5 1 flow pattern the lengths of the dry bed l d 0 05 m 0 10 m 0 15 m and 0 20 m are investigated to examine the effect on the dam break wave propagation fig 12 shows the snapshots of the dam break wave propagation over the combined bed with l d 0 15 m the dam break wave propagates along the dry bed reaching the end of it at t 0 15 s subsequently the wave has an interaction with the downstream wet bed causing free surface fragmented at t 0 3 s and 0 6 s shown in the figure the dam break wave can push the downstream water body moving and meanwhile its speed is reduced to clearly show the effect of the length for the dry bed fig 13 illustrates the flow pattern for the dam break wave propagating along different lengths of the dry bed for the combined condition at t 0 3 s with the increase of the length l d the interaction to the downstream wet bed becomes weaker for l d 0 05 m a higher wave peak can be observed behind the dry bed while it shows to be a much weaker wave for l d 0 2 m the simulations suggest that the wavefront in the dam break flow can have a stronger interaction with the wet bed than the dry bed in the interaction to the wet bed the free surface can show more deformation which can be observed at t 0 6 s in fig 12 hence the speed of the wavefront can be affected by the wet bed after propagation over the dry bed 5 2 wavefront movement fig 14 shows the wavefront position for the dam break flow over the combined downstream condition with different lengths of l d at the beginning of the dam break flow the dam break wave propagates at the same speed since the downstream condition and the initial left water column are the same when the wave reaches the end of the dry bed the wavefront movement shows a different curve since the dam break wave starts to interact with the wet bed thus we can observe that the wavefront movement is the same in the overlapped line in the beginning and then there is a branch when the wave reaches the end of the dry bed in fig 14 we calculated the average speed between t 0 0 s and 1 0 s for the wave propagation over the combined bed condition for the dam break wave according to the wavefront position with time in fig 14 with the increase of the dry bed length the average speed is increased for the dam break wave for larger l d the dam break wave propagates along the dry bed to a longer distance and thus the hindering effect from the wet bed is eliminated for l d 0 2 m the average speed for the wavefront v f 0 58 m s while for l d 0 0 m v f 0 54 m s 5 3 bed shear stress we also analyzed the near bottom shear stress distribution for this type of dam break flow over the combined dry and wet bed shown in fig 15 a the dry bed results in large variation for the velocity gradient so that the bed shear stress shows a severe variation taking the time t 0 20 s as an example the bed shear stress increases along the bed and it reaches the peak value at the end of the dry bed at x 0 48 m subsequently the bed shear stress decreases sharply to zero at x 0 50 m after it the wavefront has a strong interaction with the downstream water causing an increase for the bed shear stress which reaches a value of τ 0 0038 pa at the wavefront x 0 60 m after the wavefront the bed shear stress decreases rapidly to zero since there is almost the static water without influence by the dam break wave similar bed shear stress distribution can be observed at other time steps in the dam break wave propagation however the peak value for the bed shear stress at the end of the dry bed decreases with time increase for example at t 0 20 s τ 0 0758 pa compared to τ 0 0535 pa at t 0 90 s this is because the shearing on the dry bed by the dam break wave becomes weaker after energy dissipation with the time increasing meanwhile with the propagation for the dam break wave over the dry bed the interaction for the wavefront to the downstream water becomes stronger inducing an increase of the bed shear stress to τ 0 023 pa at t 0 90 s compared with that at t 0 20 s fig 15b shows the near bottom shear stress for the various lengths of the dry bed in the dam break wave propagation at t 0 45 s with the increase of l d the near bottom shear stress at the end of the dry bed decreases the peak value at the end of the dry bed is the largest for the shortest length l d in the figure such as the largest value τ 0 057 pa for l d 0 05 m at this time step the bed shear stress has a sharp increase over the dry bed whereas it shows to be a flatter distribution without the dry bed l d 0 0 m around the wavefront in the downstream of the dry bed at this time step the bed shear stress shows a decreasing trend with the length of the dry bed l d for example τ 0 035 pa for l d 0 20 m and τ 0 057 pa for l d 0 05 m this is because more energy for the flow is dissipated during the wave propagating on the dry bed and the interaction between the wavefront and the downstream water body becomes weaker for the longer obstacle resulting in a smaller bed shear stress 6 conclusions in this study a mesh free method is used to simulate the dam break flow with different configurations for the downstream bed in the method the spatial operators are based on the mps method in which the predictor and corrector time splitting scheme is employed to obtain the pressure field an explicit scheme to solve the pressure poisson equation is adopted which satisfies the mass conservation in modeling the incompressible fluid flows the method is validated by simulating the dam break wave propagation along the dry bed by using different numerical resolutions the simulated free surface profiles have a good agreement with the experimental measurements in the flow and a good numerical convergence is observed the numerical method is also validated by modeling the dam break wave propagating along the wet bed although some discrepancies can be observed due to influence from the air in the flow the trend of dam break wave propagation is reproduced by the method particularly for the wavefront movement for the dam break wave spreading on the dry and wet beds a smooth pressure field is achieved in the simulations by using the explicit pressure calculation approach in the mesh free method after validation of the mesh free method it is applied to simulate the dam break wave propagating along different downstream bed conditions to investigate the effect of the bed configuration on the wavefront movement and near bottom shear stress when the dam break wave encounters the wet bed the wave can push the downstream water body forwards while the wavefront speed is reduced for the dry bed with h d 0 0 m the average speed for the dam break wave is v f 1 60 m s when the downstream water depth is increased to 0 05 m the average speed v f is reduced to 0 54 m s the downstream water depth can result in a more uniform bed shear stress compared to the flow with the dry bed and the large value of bed shear stress occurs in the vicinity of the wavefront with a constant height for the downstream configuration h d 0 05 m the dam break wave propagation can also be affected by different combinations of the dry and wet beds its effect is investigated by varying the dry bed length l d 0 0 0 2 m for the dam break wave triggered by the same initial water column the dam break wave propagates along the dry bed and its movement shows a different trend when reaching the end of the dry bed the dam break wave can push the downstream water body making much water accumulate behind the wavefront thus the free surface is also significantly affected by the length of the dry bed with a shorter length l d due to energy dissipation along the dry bed the wave is very weak when reaching the end of the dry bed for l d 0 0 m the average speed for the dam break wave is v f 0 54 m s while for l d 0 2 m the speed is v f 0 58 m s the bed shear stress is increasing along the dry bed and reaches the peak value at the end of the dry bed when increasing the length of the dry bed the peak value for the bed shear stress decreases at the wavefront the bed shear stress is also very large but its value decreases with increasing the length of the dry bed in the simulations a smooth pressured field is achieved which is due to the pressure calculation by an explicit approach to solve the pressure poisson equation credit authorship contribution statement yiqun

21437,the ship handling decision making process constitutes the most critical step in intelligent ship collision avoidance this study utilized the ship encounter azimuth map to extract the data of 12 types of ship encounter modes from the automatic identification system ais big data the sliding window algorithm was used to identify the ship encounter behaviors which were used as the training data the sequence conditional generative adversarial network seq cgan was proposed using the sequence to sequence seq2seq model to learn how to generate appropriate anthropomorphic collision avoidance decisions and bypass the process of ship collision risk assessment based on the quantification of a series of functions the long short term memory lstm cell was simultaneously combined with seq cgan to improve the memory capacity and the current adaptability of the environment of the overall system the seq cgan was trained by 2018 zhoushan port ais data to achieve structured learning regarding human experiences the results indicate that the seq cgan effectively formulates the sequence of ship handling behaviors this study contributes significantly to the increased efficiency and safety of sea operations the proposed method could be potentially applied to determine the predictive framework for various intelligent systems including intelligent collision avoidance route planning and operational efficiency estimation keywords ais seq cgan anthropomorphic decision making seq2seq structured learning 1 introduction the development of maritime autonomous surface ship mass intelligence is supported by the hardware software and other relevant technologies the continuous developments of mass and drone technologies justify the prospects for their use in a broad range of applications and in the future development of unmanned ships ship intelligent collision avoidance plays a particularly important role in the development of mass technology and identifies the critical mechanisms necessary to enhance the decision making capability for ship handling this study proposes a novel research idea that involves the direct use of sequence to sequence seq2seq model to learn how to generate appropriate anthropomorphic collision avoidance decisions and bypass the process of ship collision risk assessment based on the quantification of a series of functions the model is based on the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs good seamanship and ship maneuverability ship collision avoidance decision making technologies can be divided into three types 1 geometric collision avoidance this ensures that the ship collision avoidance decision problem is transformed into a geometric one according to the azimuth distance distance to the closest point of approach dcpa and the time required to reach the closest point of approach tcpa from target ships calculated to assess whether there is a collision risk based on the size of the tcpa the degree of danger is determined based on the principle of relative motion between two moving objects the method aims to a achieve heading or speed or heading and speed changes to maintain a safe distance b estimate the time available to enforce collision avoidance measures and c estimate the time required to revert to the original heading and original speed lazarowska 2012 investigated the decision support system for collision avoidance in seas and this was achieved by sending a rudder order after a confirmation was received by the deck officer combined with the onboard path planning system the support system would enable an automatic passage from point a to point b bole a and dineley b 2000 huang et al 2019 presents a gvo algorithm for ship collision avoidance and designs a collision avoidance system gvo cas 2 research on the dcpa decision model based on fuzzy theory the use of fuzzy theory to consider the mindset of the officer facilitates the formulation of decisions in different situations perera et al 2010 focused on a fuzzy logic based parallel decision formulation that aimed to improve the safety of marine vessels by avoiding collision situations in ocean navigation paradigms the collision avoidance of the target vessel has been analyzed and input and output fuzzy membership functions have been derived 3 neural network decision making according to the method adopted to address the problem at present the geometric decision making has the highest applicability while the rest of the decision making methods are still in the theoretical research stage simsir et al 2014 proposed the development of an artificial neural network ann that used the data of manually controlled vessels to generate predictions regarding the future locations of these vessels perera and ferrari 2015 proposed a computer simulation to model the ship collision avoidance decision making using a ship model wang and debnath 2010 introduced a collision avoidance model based on three typical collision avoidance actions speed alteration rudder steering and the combination of speed alteration and rudder steering jansson and gustafsson 2008 presented a probabilistic framework to design and analyze existing collision avoidance algorithms that enabled online computation of the risk for faulty intervention and the consequences of different actions pietrzykowski et al 2017 used a real time implementation of an automotive collision mitigation system and evaluated the risk most of the decision making modes include the handling of the timing and handling behaviors this binary combination represents the manipulated behavioral decision of a ship however owing to a series of complicated factors such as different types of ships different maneuvering performances and increased human disturbances accurate and efficient provision of ship maneuvering decisions is an issue that requires an in depth investigation the navigation behavior of the ship is also referred to as the handling behavior and represents the movement process of the ship every three consecutive adjacent trajectory feature points indicate a motion process that is every two trajectory feature points contain a ship handling behavior event thus a certain number of ship handling units perform a recombination unit sequence to express ship handling decisions in the past automatic identification system ais data were utilized to train the machine learning framework with different data types such as the backpropagation bp xu et al 2011 convolutional neural network cnn zhang et al 2016 recursive neural network rnn cai et al 2007 and support vector machine svm liu et al 2019 in these types of machine learning approaches most of the data were input or output in the form of vectors or matrices however as research progressed the requirements of the input data structure has increased progressively previous studies have often employed the neural network framework model and indicated that the conditions between the model and data were unsuitable thus many researchers rebuilt their neural network variants based on the upgrades of model units increased the number of hidden layers or the hidden layer widths that resulted in an increased computational complexity however the requirements of big data have resulted in an exponential growth in the number of difficulties associated with these networks the generative adversarial network gan is a special machine learning framework that fits a structured learning approach for deep learning and generates state of the art behavioral sequences in generative tasks gan network reinforcement learning is achieved by fighting against two networks the generator network and the discriminator networks a cyclical confrontation against the neural network learns the sequence structure of the handling behavior of the ship which generates a new handling behavior decision based on historical experiences the representation of ship handling decisions that can be input in the model has not been thoroughly investigated so far and the existing handling decision mode is more convenient and easily understood by the ship officer previously the estimation of ship maneuverability was based on the experiences of expert users approximate research calculation methods have not been applied to address the current requirements of unmanned high precision ships to eliminate the shortcomings of the existing handling decision making algorithms the traditional method was abandoned to establish the idea of the spatial location point and the ship trajectory segment was used as a representative trajectory a new handling decision making method was proposed as follows 1 construct the seq cgan combined with the lstm to ensure the stability of the entire learning system by training with the previously acquired ais trajectory data 2 encode the ais trajectory segment in a septuple format and convert it to a structural code for the capsule the splicing rules and splicing judgment were proposed and the ship trajectory was assigned to a planned ship trajectory in the form of a septuple or capsule structure sequences 2 ship collision avoidance behavior pattern recognition owing to the widespread use of ais equipment and its simplicity in the collection of target ship information it has emerged as a big data foundation for several researchers for studying the handling behaviors of ships additionally the precision index of the data of the ship is improved this facilitates the real time monitoring of the ship by the relevant authorities effective handling decisions based on the current situation can be enforced in a timely manner this study employs ais data as a source to identify ship encounter data and extract the ship s handling behavior data which is then usedas the seq cgan training data for structural machine learning 2 1 identification of ship encounter situation model this study utilized the zhoushan port 2018 ais trajectory data fig 1 including 37011 ship ais trajectory data information a total of 45091068 coordinate points were used that required a data storage capacity of 2 73 gb to narrow the scope of the research data we categorized the ship navigation statuses as presented in table 1 according to the ais code numbering classification only the number zero under way using engine could be extracted gao and shi 2020a b at present there is no unified and practical division model for the variety of azimuth divisions encountered by ships by combining the requirements for the light range in colregs and support vector classification to supervise and learn the actual meeting data a map of the ship encounter azimuth division was constructed we established the ship collision avoidance encounter azimuthal map 002 005 044 108 203 252 306 355 for a ship as shown in fig 2 according to the encounter azimuth maps of two ships crossing match and combined with the size of the dcpa tcpa distance difference of heading and speed to establish the ship collision avoidance behavioral modes fig 3 and table 2 and then the training data are extracted using the ship encounter pattern 12 types the ship encounter situation data were extracted from the massive ship ais trajectories as shown in figs 4 6 2 2 key feature point extraction from ship encounter trajectories to perform key feature point kfp extraction we improved the sliding window algorithm considering the drift angle the kfp extraction process is briefly described as follows first points p1 l 1 b 1 t 1 p2 l 2 b 2 t 2 and p3 l 3 b 3 t 3 are located in the initial window using time t 2 from point p2 l 2 b 2 t 2 as an index the difference between p1 l 1 b 1 t 1 and p3 l 3 b 3 t 3 can be calculated as p2 l 2 b 2 t 2 for further details please refer to one of our previous studies gao and shi 2019 these parameters are calculated as follows 1 s b a 1 e 2 0 b 1 e 2 sin 2 b 3 2 δ b 2 q ln tan π 4 b 2 1 e sin b 1 e sin b e 2 δ x a d l δ y

ship points and s is the length of the straight line between the two ship points b is the ais latitude l is the ais longitude t is the ais time δ i is the time elapsed from the initial point to the check point and δ e is the time elapsed from the initial point to the end point δ b is the latitude difference in the geodetic coordinate system δ l is the longitude difference in the geodetic coordinate system a is the major radius of the ellipsoid e is the eccentricity and s b is the arc from the evaluated point to the equator the improved sliding window algorithm is illustrated in figs 7 and 8 see fig 9 the sliding window algorithm was utilized to extract the kfps from the ship encounter situation data described in section 2 1 the extracted ship handling behaviors data are shown in figs 10 12 3 data structure splicing rule 3 1 construction of septuple coding the trajectory truncated at the kfps and the ais trajectory were fragmented to obtain the ship motion trajectory units each unit was stored as the smallest segment of the ship trajectory we propose the use of a septuple coding scheme to encode the ship handling behavior units q d ss se das dae and t as shown in fig 13 where q is the azimuth from the start to the endpoint d is the distance from the start to the endpoint ss is the speed at the start point se is the speed at the endpoint das is the drift angle at the start point dae is the drift angle at the endpoint and t is the time from the start point to the endpoint among these seven variables q d and t describe the overall trend of the sub trajectory segments of the ship and se ss dae and das provide local ship state information based on the description of the two endpoints of the trajectory unit these four variables can be used for subsequent restitching of the septuple and constitutes the basis for ship trajectory planning the septuple stitch provides a new solutions and ideas for describing the sub trajectory segment of the ship subsequent ship trajectory planning and ship handling behavioral analysis 3 2 capsule structure coding transformation to facilitate the splicing of the trajectory unit and the calculation of the relevant trajectory values the verification splicing result is improved and authenticity of the generated trajectory is converted into a capsule coding representation fig 14 where s0 da0 is a splicing determination synapse sequence accordingly the end of the previous unit sk dak is connected to achieve a splicing check as follows 5 q d s s s e d a s d a e δ t s 0 d a 0 d x d y d s d d a s e d a e 6 d x d sin q d y d cos q d s s e s s d d a d a e d a s where dx is a horizontal shift by per unit time in the absolute coordinate system dy is the longitudinal shift in the absolute coordinate system ds is the difference of speed dda is the difference of drift angle s0 is the starting speed of the trajectory capsule used for the splicing check and da0 is the starting drift angle of the trajectory capsule used for the splicing check 3 3 splicing threshold in this study the concept of ship handling behavior basis shbb gao and shi 2020a units is embodied by the trajectory of the ship the smallest basic units with their identification labels are linearly independent of each other and can form arbitrary ship trajectories based on continuous linear combinations a complete ship trajectory can be mapped as a continuous sequence of shbbs fig 14 the trajectory of an entire ship can be represented as a sequence 6c 18a 6b 47 4c 78c 78 8d 76b where the number indicates the angle of rotation clockwise positive counterclockwise negative and indicates that the shbb image is flipped this unified storage format enables encoding thus the actual trajectory can be reversibly encoded the generated image can be easily interpreted by researchers and encoding the sequence is convenient for machine input and learning to successfully splice the trajectory unit it is necessary to determine a suitable splicing threshold if the splicing threshold is extremely high the splicing success rate is extremely low trajectory splicing flexibility is insufficient and applicability is poor if the splicing threshold is extremely broad the trajectory unit can be arbitrarily spliced and the traversed ship trajectory does not conform to the actual ship handling performance furthermore the spliced trajectory does not lead to any meaningful results owing to the limitation of the receiving accuracy of the ais data the angle accuracy is 0 1 and the speed accuracy is 0 1 kn the speed threshold is in the range of 0 5 kn the speed interval is 0 1 kn the drift angle is 0 5 and the angle interval is 0 1 by cutting the original ais trajectory at the position of kfp a large amount of shbb ship handling behavior basis can be obtained to construct shbs ship handling behavior space using a large amount of shbb as the raw material for splicing and re splicing the shbb under the speed threshold drift angle threshold and performing a one to one splicing test calculate the splicing success rate and control the splicing success rate by controlling the size of the threshold the septuple was do the splice test the relationships among the corresponding speed threshold drift angle threshold and the trajectory success rate are obtained as shown in fig 16 the data value corresponding to 1 1 0 8 in fig 15 is selected as the recommended splicing threshold a preliminary experiment was used to ensure that the trajectory unit splicing of the ship is feasible and that there will be no random or other splicing scheme the splicing decision should become as mature as the discriminator by the training batch increases the highest standard cannot be directly proposed the splicing decision must be confronted with the generator and the success rate of the historical data is added to calculate the splicing score if the splicing difference of speed and angle are less than the set splicing threshold during the formulation of the splicing judgment the trajectory unit will be successfully spliced it is necessary to simply verify that s0 da0 meets the secondary splicing rules before you a proceeding to the next step b receiving the t command or c generating a t splicing ship handling behavioral unit at a fixed interval the splicing process is illustrated in fig 17 7 u s 0 d a 0 d x d y

splicing check after a set duration 4 structured learning model for ship collision avoidance handling sequence 4 1 structured learning structured learning is a new concept of machine learning it can generate the same real data identical to the sample data the structured learning has two great advantages 1 it can automatically learn the data distribution characteristics of the training data traditional machine learning methods need to define a fix model for data to learn it is necessary to know the data distribution characteristics to construct the fix model but in actual research it will increase the difficulty of building machine learning structures due to the complexity of data structures and data features in structured learning the gan network automatically learns the distribution characteristics of data 2 it can automatically define the potential loss function the discriminant network can automatically learn a good discriminant method and a good loss function can be trained to discriminate among results a single ship trajectory unit shbb cannot explain the relationship between the front and the rear units of the entire trajectory without the support of a structured framework there is no connection between the individual shbb units the knowledge structure is loose and the machine learning effects are poor structured learning may fit the overall error value obtained without considering the result of nonstructural learning methods however structured learning is more stable and reasonable based on rationality considerations we constructed a structured learning model and imported the training data with sequences in the network for the learning process both the learning of the characteristics of the data unit and of the sequence characteristics between the data units led to an improvement in the ability of machine learning process 4 2 seq2seq model using the seq cgan in the seq2seq model sutskever et al 2014 was able to generate trajectory sequences that resemble the ship handling behavioral data which otherwise do not appear when historical data are used the input and output of the previously learned learning model have always been vectors however during practical application the inputs or outputs may be other structures such as sequence list or tree the ship trajectory is spliced equidistantly according to the kfps subsequently the ship trajectory is divided into six consecutive septuple combination sequences accordingly six seven tuples combination sequences are generated with real data to guide the seq cgan network structure fig 18 based on iterative and confrontation trainings the generator gradually improves the decision making ability to match reality this allows the discriminator to gradually improve the authenticity of the trajectory sequence decision the two networks compete against and enhance each other resulting in a more accurate result the give way ship is marked as own ship red and the keep way ship is marked as target ship green the four kfps including the three shbbs are set as a single batch training group which is decomposed from a complete meeting process into multiple training groups this decomposition process for the training data is shown in fig 19 furthermore the relative position and angle in each batch of data were processed the first position of the own ship in the training group is used as the reference to perform coordinate moving transformation subsequently the heading of the first position of the own ship was used as the reference to perform coordinate rotation transformation the moving transformation and rotation transformation are illustrated in fig 20 11 x 0 o x 0 y 0 o y 0 h 0 o h 0 12 o x i o x i x 0 o y i o y i y 0 o h i o h i h 0 t

al 2018 network accordingly the forget gate in the lstm unit kumar et al 2018 liu et al 2016 hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 fig 21 stores historical data remembers the common behavioral patterns and forgets the unique behaviors thus improving the universality of the model therefore it is more stable and effective when data is input into the generator 4 4 seq cgan structure the gan springenberg 2015 radford et al 2015 yu et al 2016 involves unsupervised learning and comprises two neural networks part1 the generator randomly creates the samples part2 the discriminator is a classic classifier that separates the real data from the generated data the two networks grow together by competing against each other the training goal was to ensure consistency in the distribution of the generated samples with respect to the actual data accordingly the decision of the discriminator will become increasingly more difficult such that it will become impossible to ascertain its authenticity the seq cgan structured learning model is divided into three parts part 1 lstm obtains the relative position relationship to the target ship inputs data into the lstm unit and obtains information related to the memory gate part 2 learning g receives the data from the lstm inputs these data into the generator to generate the shbb sequence determines the overall trajectory feature and formulates the stitching judgment to determine the splicing effect through the discriminator with fixed parameter values it also feeds back the result to the lstm and the generator part3 learning d accepts the real shbb sequence from the ais trajectory data as a sequence of unity values the shbb sequence is generated by the generator as a sequence of zero values and updates the parameters in the discriminator the structured learning mode of seq cgan is shown in fig 22 the standard gan network is only capable of learning and generating anthropomorphic ship handling behaviors it does not adapt well to different encounter situations however cgan includes supervised information thereby enabling matching collision avoidance decisions under different ship condition labels the navigation behavior of other ships serves as the supervised information to generate matching handling and collision avoidance decisions therefore seq cgan has three input values a random code rc b real decision rd and c target ship label tl where rc and tl are the inputs of generator fake decision fd is the output value of the generator and fd tl and rd tl are the inputs of the discriminator discriminator is used for back propagation training the trained discriminator and the trajectory stitching rule are passed together in order to train the generator and lstm cell 14 u i rd tl 15 rd o k f p 1 o k f p 2 o k f p 3 o k f p 4 tl t k f p 1 t k f p 2 t k f p 3 t k f p 4 16 fd f k f p 1 f k f p 2 f k f p 3 f k f p 4 according to the collision avoidance and handling behavior data the 12 types of ship encounter modes as discussed in section 2 constitute the training data input into the seq cgan section 2 1 details the identification of the encounter situation between the two ships extraction of the ais trajectory data of two ships marking the ship that needs to avoid the target ship as the own ship and marking the second ship as the target ship as soon as an encounter situation determined to occur the ship situation indicated in section 2 2 is used to extract the kfps of the trajectory calculate the position of the other ship via interpolation by considering the moment of the avoidance handling behavior given appropriate circumstances and calculate the distance azimuth and heading difference between the two ships simultaneously similar to the input value rc tl of part 1 lstm three consecutive shbbs are used at the subsequent instant as the input values fd of part3 learning d accordingly 12 types of ship encounter modes and 12 seq cgan models were constructed and learned separately inputting random codes will result in different handling decisions for each output making the overall output more variable and flexible similar to the outcomes for human handling the same person facing the same situation may not make completely consistent decisions this reflects the anthropomorphic nature of the resulting collision avoidance decisions which contributes significantly toward increasing the efficiency and safety of sea operations 5 seq cgan structed learning first the seq cgan was implemented in python within the machine learning framework of google s tensorflow the overall structure of the network training which was automatically generated using tensorboard is depicted in fig 23 among the marine encounter situations the crossing situation is the most complicated and difficult to judge it also involves the highest probability of a collision fig 23 presents the crossing situation extracted from the zhoushan ais data this case of successful avoidance is used as the training data for the seq cgan crossing situation models fig 25 is the entire meeting process of the first encounter data case1 from fig 24 from fig 25 we can get a clearer picture of the changing process of the entire encounter the relative positional relationship of the two ships at the same moment the division of responsibilities for avoidance of the two ships and the decision of collision avoidance as for the case1 it is a crossing situation the red ship is the give way ship the green ship is the stand on ship while the collision avoidance decision of the situation is not the common practice but this decision is more real and more in line with the actual situation at sea based on the give way ship trajectory red line the sliding window algorithm is used to extract kfps with spatiotemporal characteristics and quickly locate the time point during the encounter and the positions of the two ships fig 26 depicts the kfps extracted using the sliding window algorithm from the fig 25 the four consecutive kfps are defined as one training batch which normalizes the trajectories with different lengths disrupts the correlation among training samples facilitates the input of seq cgan and improves the generalizability of seq cgan using formulas 11 13 the relative position and angle in each batch of data were processed taking the moving transformation and rotation transformation to normalize the training data fig 27 presents the normalized training data of fig 26 obtained after sequence decomposition and the translation rotation transformation fig 28 shows the learning process for the first set of training data in fig 27 the real data are presented on the left and the data generated by seq cgan are presented on the right it can be seen from fig 28 that the decision generated from the seq cgan after 600 batches can be used as a real decision for collision avoidance furthermore a variety of feasible collision avoidance decisions can be generated fig 29 illustrates the convergence of the d loss value of the discriminator figs 30 32 show the schematic diagrams of the results of each type of decision making to avoid target ships 6 conclusions the learning strategy of seq cgan involves generating a decision that is infinitely close to real data which is more flexible moreover if the system is faced with an unknown situation conventional machine learning can be used to generate an average value without considering authenticity however seq cgan depends on the structure of real data to generate an anthropomorphic decision this decision may not be the optimal solution for collision avoidance but it can guarantee the effectiveness and authenticity of avoidance to eliminate the shortcomings of the existing handling decision making algorithms the traditional method was abandoned to establish the idea of the spatial location point and the ship trajectory segment was used as a representative trajectory a new handling decision making method was proposed as follows 1 construct seq cgans combined with the lstm to compete for the stability of the entire learning system by training with the previously acquired ais trajectory data 2 encode the ais trajectory segment in a seven tuple format and convert it to a structural code for the capsule the splicing rules and splicing judgment were proposed and the ship s trajectory was assigned to a planned ship trajectory in the form of a seven tuple or capsule structure sequences the trajectory unit splicing method can make the trajectory continuous and smooth and can ensure a smooth and rational trajectory operation the calculation is simple and easy and the singularity problem of the structure does not occur accordingly the parameters attributed to the local optimization blind optimization smoothing and computational redundancy processes can thus be avoided the proposed method overcomes the passive situation pertaining to simple blind optimization constant correction of curvature empirical approach based on continuous trials and errors and neglects the actual movement characteristics of the ship this method can effectively avoid more than half of the useless trajectories and can rapidly adapt to the operational activities including the avoidance of collision in complex marine navigation environments the method can considerably improve the optimization efficiency and the generated trajectory thus becomes more realistic in this manner it can provide directly a reasonable strategy for multiple seven tuple sequences for ship trajectory planning route planning and intelligent collision avoidance the mature algorithm following big data training has a broad application range high versatility and can achieve timely strategy generation timely response and enhanced collision avoidance security it can be used in intelligent collision avoidance decision making of ships in the detection of the abnormal behavior of the ship route planning and in other relevant tasks credit

the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs good seamanship and ship maneuverability ship collision avoidance decision making technologies can be divided into three types 1 geometric collision avoidance this ensures that the ship collision avoidance decision problem is transformed into a geometric one according to the azimuth distance distance to the closest point of approach dcpa and the time required to reach the closest point of approach tcpa from target ships calculated to assess whether there is a collision risk based on the size of the tcpa the degree of danger is determined based on the principle of relative motion between two moving objects the method aims to a achieve heading or speed or heading and speed changes to maintain a safe distance b estimate the time available to enforce collision avoidance measures and c estimate the time required to revert to the original heading and original speed lazarowska 2012 investigated the decision support system for collision avoidance in seas and this was achieved by sending a rudder order after a confirmation was received by the deck officer combined with the onboard path planning system the support system would enable an automatic passage from point a to point b bole a and dineley b 2000 huang et al 2019 presents a gvo algorithm for ship collision avoidance and designs a collision avoidance system gvo cas 2 research on the dcpa decision model based on fuzzy theory the use of fuzzy theory to consider the mindset of the officer facilitates the formulation of decisions in different situations perera et al 2010 focused on a fuzzy logic based parallel decision formulation that aimed to improve the safety of marine vessels by avoiding collision situations in ocean navigation paradigms the collision avoidance of the target vessel has been analyzed and input and output fuzzy membership functions have been derived 3 neural network decision making according to the method adopted to address the problem at present the geometric decision making has the highest applicability while the rest of the decision making methods are still in the theoretical research stage simsir et al 2014 proposed the development of an artificial neural network ann that used the data of manually controlled vessels to generate predictions regarding the future locations of these vessels perera and ferrari 2015 proposed a computer simulation to model the ship collision avoidance decision making using a ship model wang and debnath 2010 introduced a collision avoidance model based on three typical collision avoidance actions speed alteration rudder steering and the combination of speed alteration and rudder steering jansson and gustafsson 2008 presented a probabilistic framework to design and analyze existing collision avoidance algorithms that enabled online computation of the risk for faulty intervention and the consequences of different actions pietrzykowski et al 2017 used a real time implementation of an automotive collision mitigation system and evaluated the risk most of the decision making modes include the handling of the timing and handling behaviors this binary combination represents the manipulated behavioral decision of a ship however owing to a series of complicated factors such as different types of ships different maneuvering performances and increased human disturbances accurate and efficient provision of ship maneuvering decisions is an issue that requires an in depth investigation the navigation behavior of the ship is also referred to as the handling behavior and represents the movement process of the ship every three consecutive adjacent trajectory feature points indicate a motion process that is every two trajectory feature points contain a ship handling behavior event thus a certain number of ship handling units perform a recombination unit sequence to express ship handling decisions in the past automatic identification system ais data were utilized to train the machine learning framework with different data types such as the backpropagation bp xu et al 2011 convolutional neural network cnn zhang et al 2016 recursive neural network rnn cai et al 2007 and support vector machine svm liu et al 2019 in these types of machine learning approaches most of the data were input or output in the form of vectors or matrices however as research progressed the requirements of the input data structure has increased progressively previous studies have often employed the neural network framework model and indicated that the conditions between the model and data were unsuitable thus many researchers rebuilt their neural network variants based on the upgrades of model units increased the number of hidden layers or the hidden layer widths that resulted in an increased computational complexity however the requirements of big data have resulted in an exponential growth in the number of difficulties associated with these networks the generative adversarial network gan is a special machine learning framework that fits a structured learning approach for deep learning and generates state of the art behavioral sequences in generative tasks gan network reinforcement learning is achieved by fighting against two networks the generator network and the discriminator networks a cyclical confrontation against the neural network learns the sequence structure of the handling behavior of the ship which generates a new handling behavior decision based on historical experiences the representation of ship handling decisions that can be input in the model has not been thoroughly investigated so far and the existing handling decision mode is more convenient and easily understood by the ship officer previously the estimation of ship maneuverability was based on the experiences of expert users approximate research calculation methods have not been applied to address the current requirements of unmanned high precision ships to eliminate the shortcomings of the existing handling decision making algorithms the traditional method was abandoned to establish the idea of the spatial location point and the ship trajectory segment was used as a representative trajectory a new handling decision making method was proposed as follows 1 construct the seq cgan combined with the lstm to ensure the stability of the entire learning system by training with the previously acquired ais trajectory data 2 encode the ais trajectory segment in a septuple format and convert it to a structural code for the capsule the splicing rules and splicing judgment were proposed and the ship trajectory was assigned to a planned ship trajectory in the form of a septuple or capsule structure sequences 2 ship collision avoidance behavior pattern recognition owing to the widespread use of ais equipment and its simplicity in the collection of target ship information it has emerged as a big data foundation for several researchers for studying the handling behaviors of ships additionally the precision index of the data of the ship is improved this facilitates the real time monitoring of the ship by the relevant authorities effective handling decisions based on the current situation can be enforced in a timely manner this study employs ais data as a source to identify ship encounter data and extract the ship s handling behavior data which is then usedas the seq cgan training data for structural machine learning 2 1 identification of ship encounter situation model this study utilized the zhoushan port 2018 ais trajectory data fig 1 including 37011 ship ais trajectory data information a total of 45091068 coordinate points were used that required a data storage capacity of 2 73 gb to narrow the scope of the research data we categorized the ship navigation statuses as presented in table 1 according to the ais code numbering classification only the number zero under way using engine could be extracted gao and shi 2020a b at present there is no unified and practical division model for the variety of azimuth divisions encountered by ships by combining the requirements for the light range in colregs and support vector classification to supervise and learn the actual meeting data a map of the ship encounter azimuth division was constructed we established the ship collision avoidance encounter azimuthal map 002 005 044 108 203 252 306 355 for a ship as shown in fig 2 according to the encounter azimuth maps of two ships crossing match and combined with the size of the dcpa tcpa distance difference of heading and speed to establish the ship collision avoidance behavioral modes fig 3 and table 2 and then the training data are extracted using the ship encounter pattern 12 types the ship encounter situation data were extracted from the massive ship ais trajectories as shown in figs 4 6 2 2 key feature point extraction from ship encounter trajectories to perform key feature point kfp extraction we improved the sliding window algorithm considering the drift angle the kfp extraction process is briefly described as follows first points p1 l 1 b 1 t 1 p2 l 2 b 2 t 2 and p3 l 3 b 3 t 3 are located in the initial window using time t 2 from point p2 l 2 b 2 t 2 as an index the difference between p1 l 1 b 1 t 1 and p3 l 3 b 3 t 3 can be calculated as p2 l 2 b 2 t 2 for further details please refer to one of our previous studies gao and shi 2019 these parameters are calculated as follows 1 s b a 1 e 2 0 b 1 e 2 sin 2 b 3 2 δ b 2 q ln tan π 4 b 2 1 e sin b 1 e sin b e 2 δ x a d l δ y

horizontal coordinate difference in the mercator coordinate system δ y is the vertical coordinate difference in the mercator coordinate system c is the slope of the straight line defined between two ship points and s is the length of the straight line between the two ship points b is the ais latitude l is the ais longitude t is the ais time δ i is the time elapsed from the initial point to the check point and δ e is the time elapsed from the initial point to the end point δ b is the latitude difference in the geodetic coordinate system δ l is the longitude difference in the geodetic coordinate system a is the major radius of the ellipsoid e is the eccentricity and s b is the arc from the evaluated point to the equator the improved sliding window algorithm is illustrated in figs 7 and 8 see fig 9 the sliding window algorithm was utilized to extract the kfps from the ship encounter situation data described in section 2 1 the extracted ship handling behaviors data are shown in figs 10 12 3 data structure splicing rule 3 1 construction of septuple coding the trajectory truncated at the kfps and the ais trajectory were fragmented to obtain the ship motion trajectory units each unit was stored as the smallest segment of the ship trajectory we propose the use of a septuple coding scheme to encode the ship handling behavior units q d ss se das dae and t as shown in fig 13 where q is the azimuth from the start to the endpoint d is the distance from the start to the endpoint ss is the speed at the start point se is the speed at the endpoint das is the drift angle at the start point dae is the drift angle at the endpoint and t is the time from the start point to the endpoint among these seven variables q d and t describe the overall trend of the sub trajectory segments of the ship and se ss dae and das provide local ship state information based on the description of the two endpoints of the trajectory unit these four variables can be used for subsequent restitching of the septuple and constitutes the basis for ship trajectory planning the septuple stitch provides a new solutions and ideas for describing the sub trajectory segment of the ship subsequent ship trajectory planning and ship handling behavioral analysis 3 2 capsule structure coding transformation to facilitate the splicing of the trajectory unit and the calculation of the relevant trajectory values the verification splicing result is improved and authenticity of the generated trajectory is converted into a capsule coding representation fig 14 where s0 da0 is a splicing determination synapse sequence accordingly the end of the previous unit sk dak is connected to achieve a splicing check as follows 5 q d s s s e d a s d a e δ t s 0 d a 0 d x d y d s d d a s e d a e 6 d x d sin q d y d cos q d s s e s s d d a d a e d a s where dx is a horizontal shift by per unit time in the absolute coordinate system dy is the longitudinal shift in the absolute coordinate system ds is the difference of speed dda is the difference of drift angle s0 is the starting speed of the trajectory capsule used for the splicing check and da0 is the starting drift angle of the trajectory capsule used for the splicing check 3 3 splicing threshold in this study the concept of ship handling behavior basis shbb gao and shi 2020a units is embodied by the trajectory of the ship the smallest basic units with their identification labels are linearly independent of each other and can form arbitrary ship trajectories based on continuous linear combinations a complete ship trajectory can be mapped as a continuous sequence of shbbs fig 14 the trajectory of an entire ship can be represented as a sequence 6c 18a 6b 47 4c 78c 78 8d 76b where the number indicates the angle of rotation clockwise positive counterclockwise negative and indicates that the shbb image is flipped this unified storage format enables encoding thus the actual trajectory can be reversibly encoded the generated image can be easily interpreted by researchers and encoding the sequence is convenient for machine input and learning to successfully splice the trajectory unit it is necessary to determine a suitable splicing threshold if the splicing threshold is extremely high the splicing success rate is extremely low trajectory splicing flexibility is insufficient and applicability is poor if the splicing threshold is extremely broad the trajectory unit can be arbitrarily spliced and the traversed ship trajectory does not conform to the actual ship handling performance furthermore the spliced trajectory does not lead to any meaningful results owing to the limitation of the receiving accuracy of the ais data the angle accuracy is 0 1 and the speed accuracy is 0 1 kn the speed threshold is in the range of 0 5 kn the speed interval is 0 1 kn the drift angle is 0 5 and the angle interval is 0 1 by cutting the original ais trajectory at the position of kfp a large amount of shbb ship handling behavior basis can be obtained to construct shbs ship handling behavior space using a large amount of shbb as the raw material for splicing and re splicing the shbb under the speed threshold drift angle threshold and performing a one to one splicing test calculate the splicing success rate and control the splicing success rate by controlling the size of the threshold the septuple was do the splice test the relationships among the corresponding speed threshold drift angle threshold and the trajectory success rate are obtained as shown in fig 16 the data value corresponding to 1 1 0 8 in fig 15 is selected as the recommended splicing threshold a preliminary experiment was used to ensure that the trajectory unit splicing of the ship is feasible and that there will be no random or other splicing scheme the splicing decision should become as mature as the discriminator by the training batch increases the highest standard cannot be directly proposed the splicing decision must be confronted with the generator and the success rate of the historical data is added to calculate the splicing score if the splicing difference of speed and angle are less than the set splicing threshold during the formulation of the splicing judgment the trajectory unit will be successfully spliced it is necessary to simply verify that s0 da0 meets the secondary splicing rules before you a proceeding to the next step b receiving the t command or c generating a t splicing ship handling behavioral unit at a fixed interval the splicing process is illustrated in fig 17 7 u s 0 d a 0 d x d y

splicing check after a set duration 4 structured learning model for ship collision avoidance handling sequence 4 1 structured learning structured learning is a new concept of machine learning it can generate the same real data identical to the sample data the structured learning has two great advantages 1 it can automatically learn the data distribution characteristics of the training data traditional machine learning methods need to define a fix model for data to learn it is necessary to know the data distribution characteristics to construct the fix model but in actual research it will increase the difficulty of building machine learning structures due to the complexity of data structures and data features in structured learning the gan network automatically learns the distribution characteristics of data 2 it can automatically define the potential loss function the discriminant network can automatically learn a good discriminant method and a good loss function can be trained to discriminate among results a single ship trajectory unit shbb cannot explain the relationship between the front and the rear units of the entire trajectory without the support of a structured framework there is no connection between the individual shbb units the knowledge structure is loose and the machine learning effects are poor structured learning may fit the overall error value obtained without considering the result of nonstructural learning methods however structured learning is more stable and reasonable based on rationality considerations we constructed a structured learning model and imported the training data with sequences in the network for the learning process both the learning of the characteristics of the data unit and of the sequence characteristics between the data units led to an improvement in the ability of machine learning process 4 2 seq2seq model using the seq cgan in the seq2seq model sutskever et al 2014 was able to generate trajectory sequences that resemble the ship handling behavioral data which otherwise do not appear when historical data are used the input and output of the previously learned learning model have always been vectors however during practical application the inputs or outputs may be other structures such as sequence list or tree the ship trajectory is spliced equidistantly according to the kfps subsequently the ship trajectory is divided into six consecutive septuple combination sequences accordingly six seven tuples combination sequences are generated with real data to guide the seq cgan network structure fig 18 based on iterative and confrontation trainings the generator gradually improves the decision making ability to match reality this allows the discriminator to gradually improve the authenticity of the trajectory sequence decision the two networks compete against and enhance each other resulting in a more accurate result the give way ship is marked as own ship red and the keep way ship is marked as target ship green the four kfps including the three shbbs are set as a single batch training group which is decomposed from a complete meeting process into multiple training groups this decomposition process for the training data is shown in fig 19 furthermore the relative position and angle in each batch of data were processed the first position of the own ship in the training group is used as the reference to perform coordinate moving transformation subsequently the heading of the first position of the own ship was used as the reference to perform coordinate rotation transformation the moving transformation and rotation transformation are illustrated in fig 20 11 x 0 o x 0 y 0 o y 0 h 0 o h 0 12 o x i o x i x 0 o y i o y i y 0 o h i o h i h 0 t

al 2018 network accordingly the forget gate in the lstm unit kumar et al 2018 liu et al 2016 hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 fig 21 stores historical data remembers the common behavioral patterns and forgets the unique behaviors thus improving the universality of the model therefore it is more stable and effective when data is input into the generator 4 4 seq cgan structure the gan springenberg 2015 radford et al 2015 yu et al 2016 involves unsupervised learning and comprises two neural networks part1 the generator randomly creates the samples part2 the discriminator is a classic classifier that separates the real data from the generated data the two networks grow together by competing against each other the training goal was to ensure consistency in the distribution of the generated samples with respect to the actual data accordingly the decision of the discriminator will become increasingly more difficult such that it will become impossible to ascertain its authenticity the seq cgan structured learning model is divided into three parts part 1 lstm obtains the relative position relationship to the target ship inputs data into the lstm unit and obtains information related to the memory gate part 2 learning g receives the data from the lstm inputs these data into the generator to generate the shbb sequence determines the overall trajectory feature and formulates the stitching judgment to determine the splicing effect through the discriminator with fixed parameter values it also feeds back the result to the lstm and the generator part3 learning d accepts the real shbb sequence from the ais trajectory data as a sequence of unity values the shbb sequence is generated by the generator as a sequence of zero values and updates the parameters in the discriminator the structured learning mode of seq cgan is shown in fig 22 the standard gan network is only capable of learning and generating anthropomorphic ship handling behaviors it does not adapt well to different encounter situations however cgan includes supervised information thereby enabling matching collision avoidance decisions under different ship condition labels the navigation behavior of other ships serves as the supervised information to generate matching handling and collision avoidance decisions therefore seq cgan has three input values a random code rc b real decision rd and c target ship label tl where rc and tl are the inputs of generator fake decision fd is the output value of the generator and fd tl and rd tl are the inputs of the discriminator discriminator is used for back propagation training the trained discriminator and the trajectory stitching rule are passed together in order to train the generator and lstm cell 14 u i rd tl 15 rd o k f p 1 o k f p 2 o k f p 3 o k f p 4 tl t k f p 1 t k f p 2 t k f p 3 t k f p 4 16 fd f k f p 1 f k f p 2 f k f p 3 f k f p 4 according to the collision avoidance and handling behavior data the 12 types of ship encounter modes as discussed in section 2 constitute the training data input into the seq cgan section 2 1 details the identification of the encounter situation between the two ships extraction of the ais trajectory data of two ships marking the ship that needs to avoid the target ship as the own ship and marking the second ship as the target ship as soon as an encounter situation determined to occur the ship situation indicated in section 2 2 is used to extract the kfps of the trajectory calculate the position of the other ship via interpolation by considering the moment of the avoidance handling behavior given appropriate circumstances and calculate the distance azimuth and heading difference between the two ships simultaneously similar to the input value rc tl of part 1 lstm three consecutive shbbs are used at the subsequent instant as the input values fd of part3 learning d accordingly 12 types of ship encounter modes and 12 seq cgan models were constructed and learned separately inputting random codes will result in different handling decisions for each output making the overall output more variable and flexible similar to the outcomes for human handling the same person facing the same situation may not make completely consistent decisions this reflects the anthropomorphic nature of the resulting collision avoidance decisions which contributes significantly toward increasing the efficiency and safety of sea operations 5 seq cgan structed learning first the seq cgan was implemented in python within the machine learning framework of google s tensorflow the overall structure of the network training which was automatically generated using tensorboard is depicted in fig 23 among the marine encounter situations the crossing situation is the most complicated and difficult to judge it also involves the highest probability of a collision fig 23 presents the crossing situation extracted from the zhoushan ais data this case of successful avoidance is used as the training data for the seq cgan crossing situation models fig 25 is the entire meeting process of the first encounter data case1 from fig 24 from fig 25 we can get a clearer picture of the changing process of the entire encounter the relative positional relationship of the two ships at the same moment the division of responsibilities for avoidance of the two ships and the decision of collision avoidance as for the case1 it is a crossing situation the red ship is the give way ship the green ship is the stand on ship while the collision avoidance decision of the situation is not the common practice but this decision is more real and more in line with the actual situation at sea based on the give way ship trajectory red line the sliding window algorithm is used to extract kfps with spatiotemporal characteristics and quickly locate the time point during the encounter and the positions of the two ships fig 26 depicts the kfps extracted using the sliding window algorithm from the fig 25 the four consecutive kfps are defined as one training batch which normalizes the trajectories with different lengths disrupts the correlation among training samples facilitates the input of seq cgan and improves the generalizability of seq cgan using formulas 11 13 the relative position and angle in each batch of data were processed taking the moving transformation and rotation transformation to normalize the training data fig 27 presents the normalized training data of fig 26 obtained after sequence decomposition and the translation rotation transformation fig 28 shows the learning process for the first set of training data in fig 27 the real data are presented on the left and the data generated by seq cgan are presented on the right it can be seen from fig 28 that the decision generated from the seq cgan after 600 batches can be used as a real decision for collision avoidance furthermore a variety of feasible collision avoidance decisions can be generated fig 29 illustrates the convergence of the d loss value of the discriminator figs 30 32 show the schematic diagrams of the results of each type of decision making to avoid target ships 6 conclusions the learning strategy of seq cgan involves generating a decision that is infinitely close to real data which is more flexible moreover if the system is faced with an unknown situation conventional machine learning can be used to generate an average value without considering authenticity however seq cgan depends on the structure of real data to generate an anthropomorphic decision this decision may not be the optimal solution for collision avoidance but it can guarantee the effectiveness and authenticity of avoidance to eliminate the shortcomings of the existing handling decision making algorithms the traditional method was abandoned to establish the idea of the spatial location point and the ship trajectory segment was used as a representative trajectory a new handling decision making method was proposed as follows 1 construct seq cgans combined with the lstm to compete for the stability of the entire learning system by training with the previously acquired ais trajectory data 2 encode the ais trajectory segment in a seven tuple format and convert it to a structural code for the capsule the splicing rules and splicing judgment were proposed and the ship s trajectory was assigned to a planned ship trajectory in the form of a seven tuple or capsule structure sequences the trajectory unit splicing method can make the trajectory continuous and smooth and can ensure a smooth and rational trajectory operation the calculation is simple and easy and the singularity problem of the structure does not occur accordingly the parameters attributed to the local optimization blind optimization smoothing and computational redundancy processes can thus be avoided the proposed method overcomes the passive situation pertaining to simple blind optimization constant correction of curvature empirical approach based on continuous trials and errors and neglects the actual movement characteristics of the ship this method can effectively avoid more than half of the useless trajectories and can rapidly adapt to the operational activities including the avoidance of collision in complex marine navigation environments the method can considerably improve the optimization efficiency and the generated trajectory thus becomes more realistic in this manner it can provide directly a reasonable strategy for multiple seven tuple sequences for ship trajectory planning route planning and intelligent collision avoidance the mature algorithm following big data training has a broad application range high versatility and can achieve timely strategy generation timely response and enhanced collision avoidance security it can be used in intelligent collision avoidance decision making of ships in the detection of the abnormal behavior of the ship route planning and in other relevant tasks credit

castello s team the sandwich pipelines have become an important option for deep water oil and gas pipeline delivery because of the superior resistance against external pressure in deep water the serviceability of sandwich pipes has been widely recognized by the marine engineering industry for the specific conveying tasks of determining the water depth the conveying pipe diameter and the known heat preservation requirements the total amount of steel and the underwater weight of the sandwich pipeline are significantly smaller than the commonly used pipe in pipe systems therefore the economics of this type of pipeline also meets the needs of deepwater development estefen et al 2005 castello and estefen 2006 2007 2008 castello et al 2009 compared to the earlier polypropylene core materials concrete matrix heartwood increases the adhesion strength between steel layers more easily and significantly improves the uniformity of interlayer adhesion meeting the requirements of industrial applications steel fibre reinforced concrete sfrc increases the tensile strength and improves the toughness of the concrete with a bending load showing superior crack resistance therefore sfrc is considered to be the best option for sandwich pipe at present an chen et al 2012 studied the ultimate strength of this type of sandwich pipe under combined load with external pressure and axial pressure using a quasi three finite element model he selected the velasco evaluation system 2008 as the material model of sfrc which considers the mechanical properties of the high volume fraction of steel fibre reinforced self compacting concrete the concrete damage plastic model was used to simulate the inelastic behaviour of sfcr damage including stiffness degradation and crack cracking whose parameters were obtained by uniaxial tension uniaxial compression and the four point bending test su et al su and cerqueira 2001 su et al 2002 sudjane and estefen 2003 2005 studied the thermal insulation property of the sandwich pipe and believed that the passive insulation could meet the flow assurance requirements of the steady production of oil and gas while active electrical heating could meet the requirements of flow assurance under extreme conditions such as prolonged delay in transportation due to the pump stopping unexpectedly scholar m xia et al 2001 deduced the elastic solution of stress strain under the conditions of internal pressure and changing temperature and indicated that the sandwich pipeline delivering hot medium can induce higher axial stresses although these studies do not address the thermal stability of the sandwich pipelines directly the conclusions of these basic studies support the necessity of the research into the thermal stability of sandwich pipelines if sandwich pipelines are chosen for the oil transport in deep water the flow guarantee problem must be solved first it is inevitable that the high axial load would be induced among the pipeline route whether passive or active thermal insulation is selected when vertical or lateral restraint is insufficient or pipe laying operations cause significant imperfections at some locations it is possible to induce vertical or lateral buckling and even sandwich pipeline damage in the post buckling process this paper focusses on the possible upheaval buckling of the sandwich pipelines hobbs 1984 first revealed the mechanism of upheaval and lateral buckling of subsea pipelines and expressed the critical buckling force of an ideal straight pipeline as the sum of the axial force in the buckle and the friction forces outside the buckle yun and kyriakides 1985 taylor and gan 1986 taylor and tran 1996 and richards richards and ellinas 1990 studied the imperfection effects on the upheaval buckling behaviours and pointed out that the critical loads were imperfection sensitive palmer et al 1990 defined general forms for the critical axial forces and the buckling wavelength of upheaval buckling and presented a semi empirical simplified design method based on numerical analysis croll 1997 1998 presented a simplified model for the imperfect pipeline upheaval buckling analysis and provided upper and lower bounds to the imperfection sensitivity of subsea pipelines based on dimensional analysis and finite element analysis zeng et al 2014 presented an improved formula for the critical axial force of the single layer pipeline in which the ratio of the imperfection amplitude and the imperfection wavelength is used as a dimensionless parameter and the coefficient function of this ratio for typical imperfection shapes can be determined by fe models these research efforts had made important contributions to the calculations of the critical upheaval buckling loads of the pipelines but had not yet involved the cases of the upheaval buckling processes accompanied with varying pipeline stiffnesses for a specific buckle in the sandwich pipeline during the buckling process the tensile cracking and compression crushing of the concrete core would cause the flexural stiffness of the sandwich pipe section reduced the reduction of the flexural stiffness will change the critical buckling force of the sandwich pipeline also those postbuckling responses such as the wavelength the buckle configuration and the order of yielding and buckling of the steel tubes so far few literatures have dealt with buckling analyses of pipelines with variable flexural stiffness by proposing a distribution function for the bending stiffness along the buckle this paper studies the critical upheaval buckling force of the variable stiffness buckling procedure of the sandwich pipeline and provides an explicit expression including typical initial imperfection effects 2 the variable bending stiffness function for the buckling sandwich pipeline a general distribution function was proposed to describe the influence of concrete layer damage and the pipe stiffness in the buckle along the axial position has the following hypothetical expression 1 e i x 1 α 2 erfc β 4 π x 0 5 α e i 0 in which x x l α e i c e i 0 β l l c erfc x is the complementary error function e i c is minimum bending stiffness of the damaged sandwich pipe segment e i 0 is the initial sandwich pipe bending stiffness l is the buckle length and l c is the postbuckling damage length of this sandwich buckle when α 0 86 and β π fig 1 shows the nondimensional bending stiffness along the sandwich pipe buckle fig 2 compares the dimensionless bending stiffness distributions for the sandwich pipe sections with different damage degree α when the nondimensional damage length factor β remains unchanged therefore the bending stiffness distribution along the buckle can be expressed as 2 e i x 1 α 2 erfc β 4 π x l 0 5 α e i 0 γ x e i 0 where the related x coordinate is from 0 to l and γ x is the distribution function of bending stiffness reduction factor 3 the buckling characteristic equation of the pipeline with a variable bending stiffness based on classical upheaval buckling theory from hobbs 1984 the critical axial force of a heated pipeline is balanced by the critical load in the buckle and the friction forces beside the buckle fig 3 provides details of a vertical sandwich pipeline buckle in which the bending stiffness and the tensile rigidity reduced because of the tensile cracking and compression crushing of the concrete core during the instability process when ignoring the effect of change in the axial compressive stiffness the governing differential equation for sandwich pipeline upheaval buckling is 3 d 2 d x 2 e i d 2 y d x 2 p y q 0 that is 4 d 2 d x 2 e i d 2 y d x 2 p d 2 y d x 2 q 0 here p is the axial force in the sandwich pipe buckle and q is the submerged weight of a unit length of the pipeline the boundary conditions of an upheaval buckle can be given as y 0 0 and y l 0 let n 2 p e i 0 and eq 4 can be rewriten as 5 d

here the nonhomogeneous term on the right side of eq 7 is more likely to clarify the seabed support force at both ends of the vertical buckle than the hobbs equation this force also induces bending moments in the flexion section the magnitude of which is related to the sandwich pipe buckle configuration while the hobbs method has a small slope assumption assuming that this force is only related to the buckling wavelength eq 8 is the solution of eq 7 and the specific solution process can be seen in the appendix of this paper 8 y 1 x y 2 x e i d γ x x e i d γ x x i d γ x e i d γ x x i d γ x e

therefore we have c l 2 d l 2 c l 2 0 consider the following equation to answer out c x d l 2 c x 0 we have a solution 15 c x c 0 e d l x 2 therefore c l 2 c 0 e d l 2 4 and c l 2 d l 2 c 0 e d l 2 4

buckling including a bending stiffness reduction factor is proposed as follows 17 tan n l 2 α α n l 2 by iterative calculation table 1 lists the critical loads in the sandwich pipe buckles for different bending stiffness reduction factors α and n l values and the results indicate that the critical loads for a sandwich pipe segment descend following the drop of α values which means the damage increases in this pipe segment from transcendental eq 17 and the calculation results in table 1 the change of the critical loads in the sandwich pipe buckles are mainly related to α but there is little relationship with the stiffness loss range that is damage length factor β which had been confirmed in many pipeline damage evaluation cases one sandwich pipeline is selected as the example pipeline to evaluate its upheaval buckling in this paper and the pipe materials in this pipeline are 12 8 sandwich pipes whose specifications are listed in table 2 for the example 12 8 sandwich pipe where the initial bending stiffness is 47 55 mpa m 4 when α 0 6 0 8 0 99 the axial forces p in the buckles with different buckle lengths are given in fig 4 these axial forces decrease with the increase in the buckle length and the growth of pipe damage 4 the buckle configuration determined by green function method for a variable stiffness beam the deflection curve differential equation can be written as 18 d 2 y d x 2 d θ d x m p x e i x introducing green s function g as 19 g x x a x l x a l 0 x x a x a l x l x a x l x a is the coordinates of any point on the beam and green s function g satisfies the following conditions 20 l ˆ g x x a δ x x a g 0 x a 0 g l x a 0 here δ x is the dirac delta function and operator l ˆ d 2 d x 2 then the deflection curve of this variable stiffness beam can be given as 21 y x a 0 l l ˆ g x x a y x d x to get the deflection curve of the variable stiffness buckle the following deflection expression can be recommended liu 2017 y x a x a l l 0 x a x m p

to hobbs theory which is 23 m p x x 0 m p 0 p n l α y ˆ q l 2 8 here p n l α is the postbuckling axial force in the buckle a function of n l and α determined by the above transcendental equation q is the submerged weight distribution along the sandwich pipeline whose value is negative because of pointing downward p n l α y ˆ is negative with bigger absolute value than q l 2 8 which is a small positive value the buckle configuration can be described using the following expression 24 y x a x a l l 0 x a x p n l α y ˆ q l 2 8 q 2 x l 2 2 γ x e i 0 d x x a l x a l x l p n l α y ˆ q l 2 8 q 2 x

of table 2 whose initial bending stiffness is 47 55 mpa m 4 with a submerged weight q 1 0 kn m the maximum amplitude of the vertical buckle can be calculated for α 0 99 0 8 and 0 6 and the results are shown in fig 5 when α 0 6 0 8 0 99 and q 1 0 kn m the vertical configuration of the sandwich buckle can be calculated based on eq 24 which is derived from green s function integral fig 6 draws three 100 m buckle configurations for sandwich pipeline under different levels of bending stiffness degradation to verify the solution process the pinnacle amplitudes for different buckle lengths under three α values are drawn together with three configurations of 100 m buckles in fig 7 the amplitudes in the configuration central agree with those values at the ends of discrete curves fig 8 makes a similar comparison for three different submerged weights q 1 0 kn m 0 8 kn m and 0 5 kn m under a fixed damage factor α 0 6 5 critical buckling axial forces of sandwich pipelines with variable stiffnesses for the buckling sandwich pipeline section the arc length can be calculated as 27 l 0 l 1 y x 2 d x compared to a straight pipe segment the length increase of the upheaval buckle is 28 l l 0 l 1 y x 2 d x l 0 l 1 y x 2 2 d x l 0 l y x 2 2 d x this elongation can also be calculated as the integral of flexibility of infinitesimal buckling sandwich elements 29 l l 0 l p 1 p e a x d x therefore 30 l l 0 l p 1 p e a x d x 0 l y x 2 2 d x like e i x γ x e i 0 if we suppose e a x γ a x e a 0 from eq 30 the axial force difference between the sandwich buckle section and that outside the buckle is p 1 p 0 l y x 2 2 d x 0 l 1 γ a x e a 0 d x set 31 ξ γ 0 l 1 γ a x e a 0 d x 1 here ξ γ is the axial compressive stiffness of the buckle which is the function of buckle length l and the section stiffness of the damaged sandwich buckle γ a x e a 0 thus p 1 ξ γ α 0 l y x 2 2 d x p if we also suppose 32 e a x γ a x e a 0 γ x e a 0 1 α 2 erfc β 4 π x l 0 5 α e a 0 the ξ γ value can be acquired based on eq 31 fig 9 provides the ξ γ values for different buckle lengths under three α values which are 0 99 0 8 and 0 6 the real buckle arc length is 33 l 0 l y x 2 2 d x l more detailed than hobbs formula the seabed frictions induced at both ends of the upheaval buckle are 34 φ q l 2 φ q 2 0 l y x 2 2 d x l so considering the axial friction on both sides of the sandwich buckles the final critical axial load can be calculated as 35 p 0 p 1 φ q l 2 p ξ γ α 0 l y x 2 2 d x φ q l 2 which equals 36 p 0 p ξ γ α φ q 2 0 l y x 2 2 d x φ q 2 l the integral 0 l y x 2 2 d x in the above equation approximately represents the sliding length beside the buckle that joins the buckle fig 10 provides the sliding lengths for various buckle lengths of the example sandwich pipeline under different conditions from the results shown in fig 10 generally the sliding lengths beside the buckles are small such as when α 0 6 q 1 0 kn m and l 100 m the sliding length is only 1 3 m therefore in eq 35 the axial friction contribution to the final critical load is approximately equal to φ q 2 l and when φ 0 5 q 1 0 kn m and l 100 m this part is only 0 025 mn therefore the critical load of the sandwich pipeline buckling depends mainly on the first two items in eq 35 fig 11 provides the axial force parts related to the changed axial compressive stiffnesses of damaged sandwich pipe buckles and the axial forces remain in the buckles for the stiffness reduction factor α values which vary as 0 99 0 87 0 75 and 0 63 from the comparison in fig 11 we can see that for a short wavelength buckle the first item of eq 35 in the total critical load is the main part but for a long wavelength buckle the second integral item of eq 35 becomes a major part when many critical load buckle length curves are drawn in one chart we find that these curves for various stiffness reduction factor α values are intersecting see fig 13 discussed later other factors also influence the critical axial force of sandwich pipeline buckling for various buckle lengths fig 12 compares the combination effects of submerged weight q and the stiffness reduction factor α for the example sandwich pipeline when q 1 0 kn m and α 0 8 the corresponding blue curve in fig 12 shows that the 48 m buckle length has the minimum critical axial load which is 1 71 mn when q 0 6 kn m and α 0 6 the red curve in fig 12 shows that the 50 m buckle length has the minimum critical axial load which is 1 155 mn accompanied by the original high temperature media delivery the axial force in the sandwich pipeline can be seen as gradually increasing so the buckle length corresponding to the minimum critical axial load is the wavelength first occurring or the most likely buckling wavelength for the example 12 8 sandwich pipeline whose initial axial stiffness is 5127 5 mn when ignoring the thermoelastic differences between sandwich pipes and ordinary carbon steel pipes and assuming that the two kinds of pipe materials have the same coefficient of thermal expansion 1 17 10 5 1 c the critical axial load of 1 155 mn means an elevated temperature of 19 2526 c and 1 71 mn 28 5 c generally the analytical results are useful for quickly determining the thermal stability of the pipeline during the design process but are not conducive to describing the buckling process of a specific pipeline section however when we draw a family of curves following various stiffness reduction factors and see the buckle lengths related to the minimum critical loads of each curve as actual events a possible buckling path can be portrayed followed the gradual sandwich pipe damage fig 13 shows the critical axial force vs buckle length curves for the example sandwich pipeline where q 1 0 kn m φ 0 5 and α changes from 0 99 to 0 63 seven values together the seven most possible status points are selected in fig 13 and follow the bending stiffness reduction of the sandwich pipe buckle the possible buckling path can be gained illustrating the shortening of the buckle length and the increasing of the pipe material damage during a postbuckling process of a sandwich pipe buckle 6 initial imperfection influences on critical axial forces usually for a pipeline in the seabed trench no burial is carried out but waiting for natural siltation backfilling an uneven ditch will lead to the laying imperfections of the pipeline conservatively it can be considered that the upheaval buckling of the pipeline does not have the resistance of the upper covering soil but initial imperfections have obviously influenced the buckling behaviours including on the critical axial force and on the postbuckling response etc karampour et al proposed four typical shape functions to account for possible vertical initial imperfections karampour et al 2013 considering the coordinate transformation the first three shape functions can be given in the variable interval from zero to l 0 as f 1 y 0 max 8 3 1 2 x 0 l 0 2 6 x 0 l 0 2 x 0 l 0 3 0 x 0 l 0 2 y 0 max 8 3 1 2 x 0 l 0 2 6 x 0 l 0 2 2 x 0 l 0 3 l 0 2 x 0 l 0 f 2 y 0 max 2 1 cos π 1 2 x 0 l 0 0 x 0 l 0 f 3 y 0 max 8 x 0 l 0 5 2 x 0 l 0 4 0 x 0 l 0 2 y 0 max 8 x 0 l 0 3 2 x 0 l 0 2 4 l 0 2 x 0 l 0 fig 14 draws these three configuration curves and their rotation curves for 30 m wavelength imperfections of which the amplitudes are all 0 1 m compared to the sandwich pipeline with an initial imperfection the length increase of the upheaval buckle is 37 l l 0 0 l 1 y x 2 d x l 01 l 02 1 y 0 x 2 d x l l 0 0 l 1 y x 2 2 d x l 01 l 02 1 y 0 x 2 2 d x l l 0 here l 0 is the initial pipeline section arc length before buckling in which a shorter imperfection y 0 is located in the interval from l 01 to l 02 whose wavelength is l 0 if we suppose the initial axial force in the imperfect sandwich pipeline is zero which can be modified when pipe laying residual stresses are included and the stable buckle reserves the same axial force as those induced from straight pipeline sections the above elongation can also be calculated as l l 0 0 l p 1 p e a x d x thus 0 l p 1 p e a x d x 0 l 1 y x 2 2 d x l 01 l 02 1 y 0 x 2 2 d x l l 0 the axial force difference between the sandwich buckle section and that outside the buckle is p 1 p 0 l 1 y x 2 2 d x l 01 l 02 1 y 0 x 2 2 d x l l 0 0 l 1 γ a x e a 0 d x p 1 ξ γ α 0 l 1 y x 2 2 d x l 01 l 02 1 y 0 x 2 2 d x l l 0 p considering the axial friction on both sides of the sandwich buckles the final critical axial load can be calculated as 38 p 0 p 1 φ q l 2 p ξ γ α φ q 2 0 l y x 2 2 d x φ q 2 l ξ γ α l 01 l 02 y 0 x 2 2 d x compared to eq 36 the last item in eq 38 reflects the influence of the imperfection on the critical axial force of sandwich pipeline upheaval buckling due to the convenience of integral form using eq 38 it is easy to deal with different imperfection shapes including those proposed by karampour et al and the situation when even several initial imperfections locate in one buckling pipeline section we can define the last item in eq 38 as 39 p imper ξ γ α l 01 l 02 y 0 x 2 2 d x ξ γ α δ imper here the integral shows the length added value of the pipeline route in imperfection locations which depends on the imperfection length l 0 and the imperfection configuration function y 0 δ imper is the imperfection curve length increase compared to the straight pipe route and ξ γ α reflects the axial stiffness change of the damaged sandwich buckle for an initial imperfection with the second configuration under two 20 m and 30 m wavelength imperfections table 3 lists the δ imper values and critical load change p imper values for different imperfection amplitude y 0 max values table 3 indicates that for a vertical initial imperfection with determined wavelength a bigger imperfection amplitude means the bigger critical axial load drop and for a vertical initial imperfection with a determined amplitude 30 m wavelength imperfections have smaller critical axial load drops than 20 m wavelength imperfections this comparison means that a short and high imperfection has a more significant impact on the sandwich pipeline buckling and induces a bigger critical axial load drop fig 15 provides more detailed comparison data on imperfection influences for the potential 50 m sandwich buckle for the same 0 1 m imperfection amplitude following the increasing wavelength the critical axial load drop declines which means the stability of the sandwich pipeline can be preserved more this conclusion is beneficial for the configuration design of a crossover piping whose amplitude is fixed as a purpose designed vertical imperfection imperfection configuration comparisons are also provided in fig 15 a imperfection f3 has the most centralized flexion and causes the biggest critical axial load drop in three different configurations which is further confirmed by fig 15 b fig 15 b shows that when the imperfection wavelength is fixed as 30 m following the imperfection amplitudes increasing the critical axial load drops rise where imperfection f3 has the most rapid rate the variable δ imper in eq 39 directly reflects the diversity of different configurations and fig 15 c compares integral function y 0 x 2 2 of δ imper for imperfection configurations f1 f2 and f3 the integral area contrast of three imperfection configurations can reflect their influence on a critical axial drop that is f 3 f 1 f 2 which is consistent with the findings of the zeng etc zeng et al 2014 for two independent variables imperfection wavelengths and imperfection amplitudes fig 16 provides three dimensional surfaces to show the imperfection influences on critical axial load these surfaces are tilted and the coordinate positions corresponding to small wavelength and big amplitude have the highest p imper values which decrease along with the increase of the wavelength or the decline of the amplitude the relative locations of three surfaces are also consistent with the planar curve cluster some p imper values in fig 16 may be invalid for they may already exceed the total critical axial load in eq 36 when the wavelength is close to 10 m and the amplitude is near 0 3 m for the example sandwich pipeline fig 17 contrasts the final critical upheaval buckling forces for different imperfection conditions when the imperfection wavelength and the imperfection amplitude are respectively supposed as 30 m and 0 1 m and the stiffness reduction factor is assumed to be 0 6 7 conclusions 1 to deal with the bending stiffness change during sandwich pipeline buckling this paper considers the bending stiffness of the buckle segment as a function of position and uses the complementary error function to describe the pipe material stiffness reduction two parameters involved in this distribution function represent the damage length of the core material and the damage degree respectively which is compatible with the fitting of the richer experimental data of this kind of pipeline in the future based on a variable stiffness beam s deflection curve differential equation a new buckling characteristic equation is gained including the core damage degree factor from the bending moment in the sandwich buckle the upheaval buckling deflection can be expressed by integral form based on green s function then the critical axial load for the sandwich pipeline upheaval buckling can be calculated for different buckle lengths once the final core damage degree factor is determined from the most likely buckling wavelengths in the above curve family a series of core damage degree factors can be connected to portray the buckling path of a sandwich pipeline 2 one of the significant advantages of the analytical expression in this paper is that the buckle lengths or imperfection wavelengths can easily be employed as design or check variables which is difficult to achieve by finite element modelling analyses in addition the effects on critical upheaval buckling forces from pipe laying imperfections are quantitative given by an integral expression when imperfections with variable wavelengths or different shapes have a unified evaluation method and the new out of straightness control criterion for pipeline upheaval buckling can be proposed more easily in practice 3 to simplify expressions the bending stiffness reduction and the axial compressive stiffness change for the pipe materials in the sandwich buckle are described with the same reduction factor for the example 12 8 sandwich pipeline the axial compressive stiffness values ξ γ are provided followed two variables the buckle length l and bending stiffness reduction factor a which characterize the relationships between unit axial release of the compressive damaged pipeline and the axial force moved if enough damaged experiments can be finished for sandwich pipe materials two self contained factors can better solve this buckling problem using the equations issued in this paper credit

21438,the upheaval buckling of sandwich pipelines may cause damage to the core material in the buckle and the changed pipe material stiffness makes such instability problems more complicated in this

castello s team the sandwich pipelines have become an important option for deep water oil and gas pipeline delivery because of the superior resistance against external pressure in deep water the serviceability of sandwich pipes has been widely recognized by the marine engineering industry for the specific conveying tasks of determining the water depth the conveying pipe diameter and the known heat preservation requirements the total amount of steel and the underwater weight of the sandwich pipeline are significantly smaller than the commonly used pipe in pipe systems therefore the economics of this type of pipeline also meets the needs of deepwater development estefen et al 2005 castello and estefen 2006 2007 2008 castello et al 2009 compared to the earlier polypropylene core materials concrete matrix heartwood increases the adhesion strength between steel layers more easily and significantly improves the uniformity of interlayer adhesion meeting the requirements of industrial applications steel fibre reinforced concrete sfrc increases the tensile strength and improves the toughness of the concrete with a bending load showing superior crack resistance therefore sfrc is considered to be the best option for sandwich pipe at present an chen et al 2012 studied the ultimate strength of this type of sandwich pipe under combined load with external pressure and axial pressure using a quasi three finite element model he selected the velasco evaluation system 2008 as the material model of sfrc which considers the mechanical properties of the high volume fraction of steel fibre reinforced self compacting concrete the concrete damage plastic model was used to simulate the inelastic behaviour of sfcr damage including stiffness degradation and crack cracking whose parameters were obtained by uniaxial tension uniaxial compression and the four point bending test su et al su and cerqueira 2001 su et al 2002 sudjane and estefen 2003 2005 studied the thermal insulation property of the sandwich pipe and believed that the passive insulation could meet the flow assurance requirements of the steady production of oil and gas while active electrical heating could meet the requirements of flow assurance under extreme conditions such as prolonged delay in transportation due to the pump stopping unexpectedly scholar m xia et al 2001 deduced the elastic solution of stress strain under the conditions of internal pressure and changing temperature and indicated that the sandwich pipeline delivering hot medium can induce higher axial stresses although these studies do not address the thermal stability of the sandwich pipelines directly the conclusions of these basic studies support the necessity of the research into the thermal stability of sandwich pipelines if sandwich pipelines are chosen for the oil transport in deep water the flow guarantee problem must be solved first it is inevitable that the high axial load would be induced among the pipeline route whether passive or active thermal insulation is selected when vertical or lateral restraint is insufficient or pipe laying operations cause significant imperfections at some locations it is possible to induce vertical or lateral buckling and even sandwich pipeline damage in the post buckling process this paper focusses on the possible upheaval buckling of the sandwich pipelines hobbs 1984 first revealed the mechanism of upheaval and lateral buckling of subsea pipelines and expressed the critical buckling force of an ideal straight pipeline as the sum of the axial force in the buckle and the friction forces outside the buckle yun and kyriakides 1985 taylor and gan 1986 taylor and tran 1996 and richards richards and ellinas 1990 studied the imperfection effects on the upheaval buckling behaviours and pointed out that the critical loads were imperfection sensitive palmer et al 1990 defined general forms for the critical axial forces and the buckling wavelength of upheaval buckling and presented a semi empirical simplified design method based on numerical analysis croll 1997 1998 presented a simplified model for the imperfect pipeline upheaval buckling analysis and provided upper and lower bounds to the imperfection sensitivity of subsea pipelines based on dimensional analysis and finite element analysis zeng et al 2014 presented an improved formula for the critical axial force of the single layer pipeline in which the ratio of the imperfection amplitude and the imperfection wavelength is used as a dimensionless parameter and the coefficient function of this ratio for typical imperfection shapes can be determined by fe models these research efforts had made important contributions to the calculations of the critical upheaval buckling loads of the pipelines but had not yet involved the cases of the upheaval buckling processes accompanied with varying pipeline stiffnesses for a specific buckle in the sandwich pipeline during the buckling process the tensile cracking and compression crushing of the concrete core would cause the flexural stiffness of the sandwich pipe section reduced the reduction of the flexural stiffness will change the critical buckling force of the sandwich pipeline also those postbuckling responses such as the wavelength the buckle configuration and the order of yielding and buckling of the steel tubes so far few literatures have dealt with buckling analyses of pipelines with variable flexural stiffness by proposing a distribution function for the bending stiffness along the buckle this paper studies the critical upheaval buckling force of the variable stiffness buckling procedure of the sandwich pipeline and provides an explicit expression including typical initial imperfection effects 2 the variable bending stiffness function for the buckling sandwich pipeline a general distribution function was proposed to describe the influence of concrete layer damage and the pipe stiffness in the buckle along the axial position has the following hypothetical expression 1 e i x 1 α 2 erfc β 4 π x 0 5 α e i 0 in which x x l α e i c e i 0 β l l c erfc x is the complementary error function e i c is minimum bending stiffness of the damaged sandwich pipe segment e i 0 is the initial sandwich pipe bending stiffness l is the buckle length and l c is the postbuckling damage length of this sandwich buckle when α 0 86 and β π fig 1 shows the nondimensional bending stiffness along the sandwich pipe buckle fig 2 compares the dimensionless bending stiffness distributions for the sandwich pipe sections with different damage degree α when the nondimensional damage length factor β remains unchanged therefore the bending stiffness distribution along the buckle can be expressed as 2 e i x 1 α 2 erfc β 4 π x l 0 5 α e i 0 γ x e i 0 where the related x coordinate is from 0 to l and γ x is the distribution function of bending stiffness reduction factor 3 the buckling characteristic equation of the pipeline with a variable bending stiffness based on classical upheaval buckling theory from hobbs 1984 the critical axial force of a heated pipeline is balanced by the critical load in the buckle and the friction forces beside the buckle fig 3 provides details of a vertical sandwich pipeline buckle in which the bending stiffness and the tensile rigidity reduced because of the tensile cracking and compression crushing of the concrete core during the instability process when ignoring the effect of change in the axial compressive stiffness the governing differential equation for sandwich pipeline upheaval buckling is 3 d 2 d x 2 e i d 2 y d x 2 p y q 0 that is 4 d 2 d x 2 e i d 2 y d x 2 p d 2 y d x 2 q 0 here p is the axial force in the sandwich pipe buckle and q is the submerged weight of a unit length of the pipeline the boundary conditions of an upheaval buckle can be given as y 0 0 and y l 0 let n 2 p e i 0 and eq 4 can be rewriten as 5 d 2 d x 2 γ x e i 0 d 2 y d x 2 e i 0 n 2 d 2 y d x 2 q 0 that is 6 d 2 d x 2 γ x d 2 y d x 2 n 2 d 2 y d x 2 q e i 0 0 direct integration to eq 6 yields 7 γ x d 2 y d x 2 n 2 y q e i 0 x 2 2 a 1 x a 2 here the nonhomogeneous term on the right side of eq 7 is more likely to clarify the seabed support force at both ends of the vertical buckle than the hobbs equation this force also induces bending moments in the flexion section the magnitude of which is related to the sandwich pipe buckle configuration while the hobbs method has a small slope assumption assuming that this force is only related to the buckling wavelength eq 8 is the solution of eq 7 and the specific solution process can be seen in the appendix of this paper 8 y 1 x y 2 x e i d γ x x e i d γ x x i d γ x e i d γ x x i d γ x e

buckling including a bending stiffness reduction factor is proposed as follows 17 tan n l 2 α α n l 2 by iterative calculation table 1 lists the critical loads in the sandwich pipe buckles for different bending stiffness reduction factors α and n l values and the results indicate that the critical loads for a sandwich pipe segment descend following the drop of α values which means the damage increases in this pipe segment from transcendental eq 17 and the calculation results in table 1 the change of the critical loads in the sandwich pipe buckles are mainly related to α but there is little relationship with the stiffness loss range that is damage length factor β which had been confirmed in many pipeline damage evaluation cases one sandwich pipeline is selected as the example pipeline to evaluate its upheaval buckling in this paper and the pipe materials in this pipeline are 12 8 sandwich pipes whose specifications are listed in table 2 for the example 12 8 sandwich pipe where the initial bending stiffness is 47 55 mpa m 4 when α 0 6 0 8 0 99 the axial forces p in the buckles with different buckle lengths are given in fig 4 these axial forces decrease with the increase in the buckle length and the growth of pipe damage 4 the buckle configuration determined by green function method for a variable stiffness beam the deflection curve differential equation can be written as 18 d 2 y d x 2 d θ d x m p x e i x introducing green s function g as 19 g x x a x l x a l 0 x x a x a l x l x a x l x a is the coordinates of any point on the beam and green s function g satisfies the following conditions 20 l ˆ g x x a δ x x a g 0 x a 0 g l x a 0 here δ x is the dirac delta function and operator l ˆ d 2 d x 2 then the deflection curve of this variable stiffness beam can be given as 21 y x a 0 l l ˆ g x x a y x d x to get the deflection curve of the variable stiffness buckle the following deflection expression can be recommended liu 2017 y x a x a l l 0 x a x m p

to hobbs theory which is 23 m p x x 0 m p 0 p n l α y ˆ q l 2 8 here p n l α is the postbuckling axial force in the buckle a function of n l and α determined by the above transcendental equation q is the submerged weight distribution along the sandwich pipeline whose value is negative because of pointing downward p n l α y ˆ is negative with bigger absolute value than q l 2 8 which is a small

of table 2 whose initial bending stiffness is 47 55 mpa m 4 with a submerged weight q 1 0 kn m the maximum amplitude of the vertical buckle can be calculated for α 0 99 0 8 and 0 6 and the results are shown in fig 5 when α 0 6 0 8 0 99 and q 1 0 kn m the vertical configuration of the sandwich buckle can be calculated based on eq 24 which is derived from green s function integral fig 6 draws three 100 m buckle configurations for sandwich pipeline under different levels of bending stiffness degradation to verify the solution process the pinnacle amplitudes for different buckle lengths under three α values are drawn together with three configurations of 100 m buckles in fig 7 the amplitudes in the configuration central agree with those values at the ends of discrete curves fig 8 makes a similar comparison for three different submerged weights q 1 0 kn m 0 8 kn m and 0 5 kn m under a fixed damage factor α 0 6 5 critical buckling axial forces of sandwich pipelines with variable stiffnesses for the buckling sandwich pipeline section the arc length can be calculated as 27 l 0 l 1 y x 2 d x compared to a straight pipe segment the length increase of the upheaval buckle is 28 l l 0 l 1 y x 2 d x l 0 l 1 y x 2 2 d x l 0 l y x 2 2 d x this elongation can also be calculated as the integral of flexibility of infinitesimal buckling sandwich elements 29 l l 0 l p 1 p e a x d x therefore 30 l l 0 l p 1 p e a x d x 0 l y x 2 2 d x like e i x γ x e i 0 if we suppose e a x γ a x e a 0 from eq 30 the axial force difference between the sandwich buckle section and that outside the buckle is p 1 p 0 l y x 2 2 d x 0 l 1 γ a x e a 0 d x set 31 ξ γ 0 l 1 γ a x e a 0 d x 1 here ξ γ is the axial compressive stiffness of the buckle which is the function of buckle length l and the section stiffness of the damaged sandwich buckle γ a x e a 0 thus p 1 ξ γ α 0 l y x 2 2 d x p if we also suppose 32 e a x γ a x e a 0 γ x e a 0 1 α 2 erfc β 4 π x l 0 5 α e a 0 the ξ γ value can be acquired based on eq 31 fig 9 provides the ξ γ values for different buckle lengths under three α values which are 0 99 0 8 and 0 6 the real buckle arc length is 33 l 0 l y x 2 2 d x l more detailed than hobbs formula the seabed frictions induced at both ends of the upheaval buckle are 34 φ q l 2 φ q 2 0 l y x 2 2 d x l so considering the axial friction on both sides of the sandwich buckles the final critical axial load can be calculated as 35 p 0 p 1 φ q l 2 p ξ γ α 0 l y x 2 2 d x φ q l 2 which equals 36 p 0 p ξ γ α φ q 2 0 l y x 2 2 d x φ q 2 l the integral 0 l y x 2 2 d x in the above equation approximately represents the sliding length beside the buckle that joins the buckle fig 10 provides the sliding lengths for various buckle lengths of the example sandwich pipeline under different conditions from the results shown in fig 10 generally the sliding lengths beside the buckles are small such as when α 0 6 q 1 0 kn m and l 100 m the sliding length is only 1 3 m therefore in eq 35 the axial friction contribution to the final critical load is approximately equal to φ q 2 l and when φ 0 5 q 1 0 kn m and l 100 m this part is only 0 025 mn therefore the critical load of the sandwich pipeline buckling depends mainly on the first two items in eq 35 fig 11 provides the axial force parts related to the changed axial compressive stiffnesses of damaged sandwich pipe buckles and the axial forces remain in the buckles for the stiffness reduction factor α values which vary as 0 99 0 87 0 75 and 0 63 from the comparison in fig 11 we can see that for a short wavelength buckle the first item of eq 35 in the total critical load is the main part but for a long wavelength buckle the second integral item of eq 35 becomes a major part when many critical load buckle length curves are drawn in one chart we find that these curves for various stiffness reduction factor α values are intersecting see fig 13 discussed later other factors also influence the critical axial force of sandwich pipeline buckling for various buckle lengths fig 12 compares the combination effects of submerged weight q and the stiffness reduction factor α for the example sandwich pipeline when q 1 0 kn m and α 0 8 the corresponding blue curve in fig 12 shows that the 48 m buckle length has the minimum critical axial load which is 1 71 mn when q 0 6 kn m and α 0 6 the red curve in fig 12 shows that the 50 m buckle length has the minimum critical axial load which is 1 155 mn accompanied by the original high temperature media delivery the axial force in the sandwich pipeline can be seen as gradually increasing so the buckle length corresponding to the minimum critical axial load is the wavelength first occurring or the most likely buckling wavelength for the example 12 8 sandwich pipeline whose initial axial stiffness is 5127 5 mn when ignoring the thermoelastic differences between sandwich pipes and ordinary carbon steel pipes and assuming that the two kinds of pipe materials have the same coefficient of thermal expansion 1 17 10 5 1 c the critical axial load of 1 155 mn means an elevated temperature of 19 2526 c and 1 71 mn 28 5 c generally the analytical results are useful for quickly determining the thermal stability of the pipeline during the design process but are not conducive to describing the buckling process of a specific pipeline section however when we draw a family of curves following various stiffness reduction factors and see the buckle lengths related to the minimum critical loads of each curve as actual events a possible buckling path can be portrayed followed the gradual sandwich pipe damage fig 13 shows the critical axial force vs buckle length curves for the example sandwich pipeline where q 1 0 kn m φ 0 5 and α changes from 0 99 to 0 63 seven values together the seven most possible status points are selected in fig 13 and follow the bending stiffness reduction of the sandwich pipe buckle the possible buckling path can be gained illustrating the shortening of the buckle length and the increasing of the pipe material damage during a postbuckling process of a sandwich pipe buckle 6 initial imperfection influences on critical axial forces usually for a pipeline in the seabed trench no burial is carried out but waiting for natural siltation backfilling an uneven ditch will lead to the laying imperfections of the pipeline conservatively it can be considered that the upheaval buckling of the pipeline does not have the resistance of the upper covering soil but initial imperfections have obviously influenced the buckling behaviours including on the critical axial force and on the postbuckling response etc karampour et al proposed four typical shape functions to account for possible vertical initial imperfections karampour et al 2013 considering the coordinate transformation the first three shape functions can be given in the variable interval from zero to l 0 as f 1 y 0 max 8 3 1 2 x 0 l 0 2 6 x 0 l 0 2 x 0 l 0 3 0 x 0 l 0 2 y 0 max 8 3 1 2 x 0 l 0 2 6 x 0 l 0 2 2 x 0 l 0 3 l 0 2 x 0 l 0 f 2 y 0 max 2 1 cos π 1 2 x 0 l 0 0 x 0 l 0 f 3 y 0 max 8 x 0 l 0 5 2 x 0 l 0 4 0 x 0 l 0 2 y 0 max 8 x 0 l 0 3 2 x 0 l 0 2 4 l 0 2 x 0 l 0 fig 14 draws these three configuration curves and their rotation curves for 30 m wavelength imperfections of which the amplitudes are all 0 1 m compared to the sandwich pipeline with an initial imperfection the length increase of the upheaval buckle is 37 l l 0 0 l 1 y x 2 d x l 01 l 02 1 y 0 x 2 d x l l 0 0 l 1 y x 2 2 d x l 01 l 02 1 y 0 x 2 2 d x l l 0 here l 0 is the initial pipeline section arc length before buckling in which a shorter imperfection y 0 is located in the interval from l 01 to l 02 whose wavelength is l 0 if we suppose the initial axial force in the imperfect sandwich pipeline is zero which can be modified when pipe laying residual stresses are included and the stable buckle reserves the same axial force as those induced from straight pipeline sections the above elongation can also be calculated as l l 0 0 l p 1 p e a x d x thus 0 l p 1 p e a x d x 0 l 1 y x 2 2 d x l 01 l 02 1 y 0 x 2 2 d x l l 0 the axial force difference between the sandwich buckle section and that outside the buckle is p 1 p 0 l 1 y x 2 2 d x l 01 l 02 1 y 0 x 2 2 d x l l 0 0 l 1 γ a x e a 0 d x p 1 ξ γ α 0 l 1 y x 2 2 d x l 01 l 02 1 y 0 x 2 2 d x l l 0 p considering the axial friction on both sides of the sandwich buckles the final critical axial load can be calculated as 38 p 0 p 1 φ q l 2 p ξ γ α φ q 2 0 l y x 2 2 d x φ q 2 l ξ γ α l 01 l 02 y 0 x 2 2 d x compared to eq 36 the last item in eq 38 reflects the influence of the imperfection on the critical axial force of sandwich pipeline upheaval buckling due to the convenience of integral form using eq 38 it is easy to deal with different imperfection shapes including those proposed by karampour et al and the situation when even several initial imperfections locate in one buckling pipeline section we can define the last item in eq 38 as 39 p imper ξ γ α l 01 l 02 y 0 x 2 2 d x ξ γ α δ imper here the integral shows the length added value of the pipeline route in imperfection locations which depends on the imperfection length l 0 and the imperfection configuration function y 0 δ imper is the imperfection curve length increase compared to the straight pipe route and ξ γ α reflects the axial stiffness change of the damaged sandwich buckle for an initial imperfection with the second configuration under two 20 m and 30 m wavelength imperfections table 3 lists the δ imper values and critical load change p imper values for different imperfection amplitude y 0 max values table 3 indicates that for a vertical initial imperfection with determined wavelength a bigger imperfection amplitude means the bigger critical axial load drop and for a vertical initial imperfection with a determined amplitude 30 m wavelength imperfections have smaller critical axial load drops than 20 m wavelength imperfections this comparison means that a short and high imperfection has a more significant impact on the sandwich pipeline buckling and induces a bigger critical axial load drop fig 15 provides more detailed comparison data on imperfection influences for the potential 50 m sandwich buckle for the same 0 1 m imperfection amplitude following the increasing wavelength the critical axial load drop declines which means the stability of the sandwich pipeline can be preserved more this conclusion is beneficial for the configuration design of a crossover piping whose amplitude is fixed as a purpose designed vertical imperfection imperfection configuration comparisons are also provided in fig 15 a imperfection f3 has the most centralized flexion and causes the biggest critical axial load drop in three different configurations which is further confirmed by fig 15 b fig 15 b shows that when the imperfection wavelength is fixed as 30 m following the imperfection amplitudes increasing the critical axial load drops rise where imperfection f3 has the most rapid rate the variable δ imper in eq 39 directly reflects the diversity of different configurations and fig 15 c compares integral function y 0 x 2 2 of δ imper for imperfection configurations f1 f2 and f3 the integral area contrast of three imperfection configurations can reflect their influence on a critical axial drop that is f 3 f 1 f 2 which is consistent with the findings of the zeng etc zeng et al 2014 for two independent variables imperfection wavelengths and imperfection amplitudes fig 16 provides three dimensional surfaces to show the imperfection influences on critical axial load these surfaces are tilted and the coordinate positions corresponding to small wavelength and big amplitude have the highest p imper values which decrease along with the increase of the wavelength or the decline of the amplitude the relative locations of three surfaces are also consistent with the planar curve cluster some p imper values in fig 16 may be invalid for they may already exceed the total critical axial load in eq 36 when the wavelength is close to 10 m and the amplitude is near 0 3 m for the example sandwich pipeline fig 17 contrasts the final critical upheaval buckling forces for different imperfection conditions when the imperfection wavelength and the imperfection amplitude are respectively supposed as 30 m and 0 1 m and the stiffness reduction factor is assumed to be 0 6 7 conclusions 1 to deal with the bending stiffness change during sandwich pipeline buckling this paper considers the bending stiffness of the buckle segment as a function of position and uses the complementary error function to describe the pipe material stiffness reduction two parameters involved in this distribution function represent the damage length of the core material and the damage degree respectively which is compatible with the fitting of the richer experimental data of this kind of pipeline in the future based on a variable stiffness beam s deflection curve differential equation a new buckling characteristic equation is gained including the core damage degree factor from the bending moment in the sandwich buckle the upheaval buckling deflection can be expressed by integral form based on green s function then the critical axial load for the sandwich pipeline upheaval buckling can be calculated for different buckle lengths once the final core damage degree factor is determined from the most likely buckling wavelengths in the above curve family a series of core damage degree factors can be connected to portray the buckling path of a sandwich pipeline 2 one of the significant advantages of the analytical expression in this paper is that the buckle lengths or imperfection wavelengths can easily be employed as design or check variables which is difficult to achieve by finite element modelling analyses in addition the effects on critical upheaval buckling forces from pipe laying imperfections are quantitative given by an integral expression when imperfections with variable wavelengths or different shapes have a unified evaluation method and the new out of straightness control criterion for pipeline upheaval buckling can be proposed more easily in practice 3 to simplify expressions the bending stiffness reduction and the axial compressive stiffness change for the pipe materials in the sandwich buckle are described with the same reduction factor for the example 12 8 sandwich pipeline the axial compressive stiffness values ξ γ are provided followed two variables the buckle length l and bending stiffness reduction factor a which characterize the relationships between unit axial release of the compressive damaged pipeline and the axial force moved if enough damaged experiments can be finished for sandwich pipe materials two self contained factors can better solve this buckling problem using the equations issued in this paper credit

21439,in this paper the instability and three dimensional 3 d nonlinear dynamics of a supported pipe subjected concurrently to internal and external axial flows are investigated for the flow velocity of internal fluid being either steady or pulsatile for that purpose a 3 d version of nonlinear governing equations for two perpendicular lateral displacements of the pipe are derived by the use of extended hamilton s principle unlike previous two dimensional 2 d versions of governing equation for a supported pipe subjected concurrently to external and internal axial flows this new 3 d version of governing equations is capable of predicting the non planar motions of the pipe based on linear analyses it is shown that buckling instability may occur for an internal steady fluid flow while parametric instability can be generated by an internal pulsatile flow in the nonlinear analyses the nonlinear dynamics of the pipe with various internal and external flow velocities for different pulsating frequencies and amplitudes are represented by means of bifurcation diagrams time traces phase portraits oscillation trajectories power spectral density psd diagrams and poincaré maps some interesting dynamical behaviors including periodic quasi periodic and chaotic motions are detected in a wide range of pulsating frequency of interest in many cases non planar motions of the pipe may be induced by fluid flows these non planar motions however need to be determined by using the present 3 d theoretical model instead of previously used 2 d ones for supported pipes subjected concurrently to internal and external axial flows keywords pipe conveying fluid external axial flow non planar dynamics pulsating flow velocity instability 1 introduction pipes conveying fluid are a typical fluid structure interaction system and have wide engineering applications such as marine engineering nuclear engineering aerospace engineering and petrochemical industries etc in the past decades therefore the dynamical behaviors of pipes conveying fluid have been extensively investigated by many researchers in terms of the initial shape of centerline pipes may be classified as straight and curved pipes only straight pipes conveying fluid are of our interest in this study some early fundamental work on this topic was concentrated on the two dimensional 2 d dynamics of initially straight pipes conveying steady fluid i e the fluid velocity does not vary with time it was theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that at sufficiently high flow velocity supported pipes may lose stability by static divergence while cantilevered pipes would be subject to flutter instability païdoussis 1998 based on linear theories the determination of natural frequencies and critical flow velocities for instability of fluid conveying pipes has been extensively studied by païdoussis and li 1993 weaver and unny 1973 yu et al 2013 tornabene et al 2010 li et al 2018 and alizadeh et al 2016 showing that the basic dynamics of cantilevered and supported pipes are fundamentally different by means of nonlinear theories the 2 d nonlinear dynamics of pipes conveying steady fluid with motion limiting constraints jin 1997 jin and zou 2003 wang and ni 2006 païdoussis et al 1989 ni et al 2015 intermediate springs sugiyama et al 1985 païdoussis et al 2007 ghayesh and païdoussis 2010 or external excitations liang and wen 2011 mamaghani et al 2016 zhai et al 2011 were also considered by some researchers showing that some complex and interesting nonlinear behaviors including chaotic and quasi periodic motions might occur since non planar motions of pipes conveying fluid can occur in some cases three dimensional 3 d vibrations of straight pipes were also analyzed by some researchers for instance wadham gagnon et al 2007 derived a 3 d version of nonlinear equations of cantilevered pipes conveying fluid via a modified version of hamilton s principle it was shown that a cantilevered pipe with additional spring support and spring arrays can generate chaotic and quasi periodic motions in a 3 d space wadham gagnon et al s 3 d version of nonlinear equations has been also applied to solve the dynamical problems of several variants of the cantilevered pipe system by later researchers recently peng et al 2019 developed a set of nonlinear equations for 3 d motions of inclined supported pipes conveying fluid peng et al 2019 found that the dynamical behaviors of the inclined pipe are sensitive to the changes of the inclination angle for other aspects and or details on 3 d motions of pipes conveying fluid the interested reader may be referred to the works of łuczko and czerwiński 2017 wang et al 2017 dai et al 2012 and chatjigeorgiou 2010 when the internal flow velocity is pulsating with a time dependent harmonic component superposed on the steady one the pipe may experience parametric instabilities with judicious choice of amplitude and frequency of the flow fluctuation this pipe system is akin to a column experiencing a time varying end load indeed a great deal of work has been done on this topic partly because by a judicious choice of system parameters the pulsating flow can render the pipe s dynamics particularly interesting except the studies of païdoussis and issid 1974 païdoussis and sundararajan 1975 and ariaratnam and sri namachchivaya 1986 on the dynamical instability of the linear system of pipes conveying pulsating fluid some researchers initiated analyses on the nonlinear dynamics of supported pipes conveying pulsating fluid for instance namachchivaya and tien 1989 used the method of averaging to derive autonomous equations based on the nonlinear equations of a pinned pinned pipe through the autonomous equations they determined the bifurcation behavior of the pipe system it was shown that the pipe loses stability through a simple or double zero bifurcation for subharmonic resonance or a hopf bifurcation for combination resonance in another study panda and kar 2007 investigated the nonlinear system of a pinned pinned pipe conveying pulsating fluid by considering geometric cubic nonlinearity due to stretching effect of the pipe diverse dynamical phenomena including periodic quasi periodic chaotic responses jump phenomena pitchfork and hopf bifurcations have been observed based on numerical calculations in addition to those investigations on pipes supported at both ends several other studies by szabó 2000 bajaj 1987 and semler and païdoussis 1996 provided new insight into the phenomenon of cantilevered pipes conveying pulsating fluid another analogy but different problem is the dynamics of a cylindrical structure in external axial flow most of the interest in the flow induced vibration fiv of a cylindrical structure in axial flow was directly related to the power generating industry and nuclear power plants similar to the system of pipes conveying fluid a cylindrical structure in axial flow can be exerted by centrifugal force coriolis force and inertia force due to added mass of flow the essential difference is the presence of the viscous forces in the normal and longitudinal directions for external flow exerted on the cylindrical structure for an internal fluid the viscosity friction related terms do not explicitly appear in the final governing equations and hence the internal fluid frictional effect seems to play no role in the dynamics of the pipe system this has also been discussed by païdoussis 1998 for an external fluid however the viscosity related terms would explicitly appear in the governing equations and hence play an important role in the stability and dynamic responses of the pipe system a mathematical formulation of these viscous forces for external flow exerted on the cylindrical structure was first introduced by taylor 1952 who have initiated a study on the swimming of long and narrow animals the linear equations of motion for cylindrical structures in axial flow were firstly derived by païdoussis 1966a and later modified by païdoussis 1973 1974 in the mathematical model of païdoussis 1973 the gravity and pressurization effects were essentially considered in the works of ghayesh and païdoussis 1994a 1994b the fluid coupling characteristics and turbulence induced response of clustered cylinders subjected to axial flow were studied by using both theoretical and experimental methods since then linear and nonlinear dynamical behaviors of cylindrical structures subjected to axial flow have been extensively investigated by researchers by the use of either linear or nonlinear governing equations for instance païdoussis et al 2002 lopes et al 2002 and semler et al 2002 investigated dynamics of a cantilevered cylinder in axial flow in a three part study in part 1 of the three part study païdoussis et al 2002 examined the stability and energy transfer mechanisms of the system and presented good qualitative agreement between experimental observations and solutions of the linearized equation of motion in part 2 of the three part study lopes et al 2002 derived a full nonlinear equation of motion of the cantilevered cylinder via hamilton s principle in part 3 by semler et al 2002 based on the equations derived in part 2 the linear and nonlinear dynamics were examined by means of bifurcation diagrams phase plane plots and poincaré maps again agreements between theoretical and experimental results were achieved in addition to the above studies the dynamical behaviors of a cylinder in axial flow for different boundary conditions have been investigated by modarres sadeghi et al 2005 kheiri et al 2013a and kheiri and païdoussis 2015 since the longitudinal displacement of a supported pipe is generally an order of magnitude smaller than the lateral displacement païdoussis 1998 the longitudinal displacement could be reasonably neglected in many studies on flow induced vibrations of supported pipes coupled with axial flows on the other hand the mechanism of flow induced vibrations of cylindrical structures in cross flow has also attracted considerable attention in the past decades in the notable book of païdoussis et al 2011 the cross flow induced vibrations have been categorized into several types such as galloping vortex induced vibration fluidelastic instability and etc indeed the mechanism of cross flow induced vibrations of pipes is fundamentally different from that of axial flow induced vibrations of pipes the interested readers are referred to the works by facchinetti et al 2004 tang et al 2019 wang et al 2019 and xu et al 2019 cylindrical structures simultaneously subjected to internal and external axial flows are also common in engineering applications such as drill string systems heat exchanger tubes carrying internal fluid and offshore oil conveying pipes in external axial flow etc however the literature on this topic was relatively limited hannoyer and païdoussis 1978 examined the 2 d linear dynamics and stability of a cylindrical tubular beams conveying fluid and subjected to external axial flow by using linear theories they found that stability characteristics of pipes supported at both ends and cantilevered pipes are quite different for a supported pipe the system will first lose stability by static divergence when increasing either the internal or external flow velocity subsequently by flutter at higher external flow velocity in the case of a cantilevered tubular beam stability of the system depends on the absolute values of internal and external flow velocities and on the shape of the downstream end païdoussis and besancon 1981 examined various aspects of the 2 d dynamics and stability of a cluster of fluid conveying cylinders subjected to external axial flow qian et al 2008 developed a theoretical model for the planar vibration and stability of a vertical fluid conveying pipe subjected concurrently to external and axial flows in an annular channel recently abdelbaki et al 2019 proposed a nonlinear model for the 3 d dynamics of a hanging tubular cantilever that is simultaneously subjected to internal and external axial flows the internal and external flows of the system are dependent on each other and are in opposite directions abdelbaki et al 2019 compared their result with another previous linear theoretical one for the same system parameters showing good qualitative and quantitative agreements with each other after reviewing the literature on the dynamics of fivs of cylindrical structures it is found that there is a lack of knowledge about 3 d dynamics of supported fluid conveying pipes in external axial flow motived by this in the present work instability and nonlinear dynamics for 3 d motions of a simply supported pipe conveying steady or pulsating fluid are investigated with particular attention on the cumulative effect of both internal and external axial flows the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the nonlinear governing equations for 3 d motions of the pipe system are derived via hamilton s principle then discretized by the use of galerkin s method and finally solved through a fourth order runge kutta integration algorithm in section 3 validation of the newly developed model is conducted by comparing the present results with published ones also convergence in the galerkin solution is checked on for a suitable number of truncated modes in section 4 linear and nonlinear dynamics of a supported pipe conveying steady fluid in the presence of external axial flow are explored in section 5 the parametric instability of the supported pipe conveying pulsating fluid is examined in sections 4 and 5 the dynamical behaviors of the pipe with various internal and external flow velocities are presented in the form of bifurcation diagrams time traces phase portraits oscillation trajectories power spectral density diagrams and poincaré maps finally some conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 mathematical model 2 1 basic assumptions and definitions the system under consideration as shown in fig 1 consists of an elastic uniform pipe of bending stiffness ei mass per unit length m p outer diameter d inner diameter d and length l the pipe is conveying an internal fluid which may be either steady or pulsating of mass per unit length m f and velocity u i the fluid conveying pipe is placed in an external axial flow with density ρ e and steady velocity u e the pipe is simply supported at both ends and installed horizontally with no axial sliding being permitted in order to derive the governing equations of the pipe the following assumptions made for the fluid structure interaction system are i the fluid is incompressible ii the internal axial fluid flow is assumed to be a plug like flow iii the pipe is slender with large aspect ratio so that the pipe behaves like an euler bernoulli beam iv the deflection of the pipe may be large but the strain is small v the influence of supports and end shapes of the pipe on external fluid flow are neglected vi the longitudinal displacement is small enough compared to the transverse displacements and thus its effect on the dynamics of the pipe system can be neglected before deriving governing equations of the pipe system it should be pointed out that timoshenko beam theories could be more reliable for fluid conveying pipes with relatively small aspect ratios laithier and païdoussis 1981 ding et al 2017 tan et al 2019 2 2 derivation of the nonlinear equations of motion for the purpose of deriving the governing equations of motion of the pipe two coordinate systems are defined i e the eulerian x y z and lagrangian x 0 y 0 z 0 coordinate systems as for the eulerian coordinate system the x axis is along the undeformed centerline of the pipe and parallel to the external axial flow both the y axis and z axis are perpendicular to the pipe s undeformed centerline when a material point of the pipe moves its displacements can be defined by u x x 0 v y y 0 and w z z 0 for 3 d non planar motions for a slender pipe with its initially undeformed state along the x 0 axis we have y 0 z 0 0 so that v y and w z the nonlinear governing equations of motions of the pipe can be derived by the use of extended hamilton s principle which is written in the following form païdoussis 1998 1 δ t 1 t 2 t v d t t 1 t 2 δ w n c d t t 1 t 2 m f u i r l t u i τ l δ r l d t where t and v represent the kinetic and potential energies of the pipe system respectively δw nc is the virtual work done by non conservative forces t is the time r l and τ l are respectively the position vector and tangent vector of the deformed pipe at the end of the pipe located at x 0 l the position vector of the deformed pipe is given by 2 r x i y j z k where i j and k are the unit vectors in the x y and z directions respectively since the pipe is simply supported at two ends the value of the right hand side of eq 1 is zero 2 2 1 kinetic and potential energies of the pipe system the kinetic energy of the pipe and internal fluid can be expressed as 3 t t p t f 1 2 m p 0 l v p 2 d x 0 1 2 m f 0 l v f 2 d x 0 where v p and v f represent the velocities of the pipe and internal fluid respectively bearing in mind that the longitudinal displacement of the pipe is neglected the velocities of the pipe and fluid can be respectively written as 4 v p r t u i v j w k v j w k 5 v f v p u i τ u i i v u i v j w u i w k in which the dots and primes denote derivatives with respect to time t and to lagrangian coordinate x 0 respectively hence the total kinetic energy can be expressed as 6 t 1 2 m p 0 l v p 2 d x 0 1 2 m f 0 l v f 2 d x 0 1

potential energy of the pipe system v is the strain energy including the strain energy resulted from the axial elongation and bending of the pipe denoted as v e and v b respectively it is noted that the pipe is installed horizontally and thus the gravitational potential energy is absent the total potential energy of the pipe system can be given by 8 v v e v b e a p 2 0 l t e a ε s 2 d x 0 e i 2 0 l 1 ε s 2 κ 2 d x 0 where t represents the axial tension of the deformed pipe a p is the cross sectional area of the pipe ε s and κ are the strain and curvature of the deformed pipe respectively defined by 9 ε s 1 u x 0 2 v x 0 2 w x 0 2 1 10 κ 2 r s 2 2 x s 2 2 2 y s 2 2 2 z s 2 2 where s denotes the curvilinear coordinate measured from the origin after some manipulation and neglecting the higher order terms of o 4 1 one can obtain 11 ε s v 2 2 w 2 2 o 4 12 1 ε s 2 κ 2 v 2 w 2 o 4 the total axial tension t is the sum of two parts i e the externally applied load and the force associated with friction denoted as t a and the nonlinear tension resulted from axial elongation of the centreline of the pipe denoted as t e followed by that of modarres sadeghi et al 2005 and païdoussis 1998 the total axial tension can be written as 13 t t a t e 14 t a 1 2 ρ e d u e 2 c t l 2 x 0 m f u i l x 0 t 0 15 t e e a p 2 l 0 l v x 2 w x 2 d x 0 in eq 14 t 0 is the externally applied tension c t

viscoelastic model developed by snowdon 1968 with the modulus of elasticity being modified via e e 1 a t a is a viscoelastic coefficient 2 2 2 virtual work done by the external fluid forces the fluid related forces exerted on the pipe due to the external fluid flow are associated with the inviscid hydrodynamic force f a which acts in the transverse direction and the normal and longitudinal viscous frictional forces denoted as f n and f l respectively both the inviscid and viscous hydrodynamic forces will be decomposed in the y and z directions they can be obtained from the work of lighthill 1960 and taylor 1952 and are defined by 17 f a y ρ e a e t u e x 0 2 v 18 f a z ρ e a e t u e x 0 2 w 19 f n 1 2 ρ e d u e 2 c d p sin 2 i c n sin i 20 f l 1 2 ρ e d u e 2 c t cos i where a e is the area enclosed by the outer diameter of the pipe c dp represents the drag coefficient due to the normal component and i is the angle of incidence corresponding to the angle between the relative fluid

c d v 2 and ρ e d c d w 2 respectively with c d being dimensional therefore the virtual work done by the hydrodynamic forces acting on the pipe can be expressed by 25 t 1 t 2 δ w n c d t t 1 t 2 0 l f

q n t and p p 1 p 2 p n t are the generalized coordinate vectors n is the number of truncated modes of the galerkin s method for computational cost consideration the choice of n may be the minimum value satisfying the convergence property of numerical results thus substituting eqs 32 into 29 and 30 multiplying by ϕ i ξ i 1 2 n on both sides and integrating from 0 to 1 one can transform all the differential integral equations into a set of ordinary differential equations finally the discretized ordinary differential equations can be further numerically solved through the use of a fourth order runge kutta integration algorithm 2 4 system parameters and initial conditions in this subsection system parameters of the pipe model and initial conditions employed for later calculations will be given first several key system parameters are listed in table 1 after some simple manipulation several dimensionless parameters of the pipe system in the governing equations i e eqs 29 and 30 can be calculated from table 1 in addition the hydrodynamic friction coefficients in the tangential and normal directions were sometimes chosen to be the same païdoussis 1966a 1966b the values of these dimensionless parameters are given as follows 33 β 1 0 0307 β 2 0 1445 π 8711100 γ 0 α 0 005 ε c n ε c t 1 c d 0 it should be pointed out that in the following analysis unless otherwise stated the same dimensionless system parameters in eq 33 will be used in all numerical calculations a set of initial values for generalized coordinates p 0 q 0 p 0 a n d q 0 should be given if all initial values are chosen to be zero the solutions will be also zero it is because that the dynamic response of the pipe may be either planar or non planar presumably depending on whether the given initial values are planar or non planar in the following calculations two types of nonzero initial values will be employed as follows i the planar initial values defined by 34 p 1 0 1 10 6 p 1 0 1 10 5 ii the non

external flow in this subsection the validation of the present theoretical model will be checked by comparing the present result with published theoretical result of modarres sadeghi and païdoussis 2009 who have explored the post buckling behaviors of a pinned pinned 2 d pipe conveying steady fluid in the absence of external axial flow in the work of modarres sadeghi and païdoussis 2009 two coupled nonlinear equations in the longitudinal and transverse directions were considered and the post divergence behaviors were explored in order to compare the present result with that given by modarres sadeghi and païdoussis 2009 a bifurcation diagram for the dimensionless transverse displacements at the midpoint of the pipe with the dimensionless internal flow velocity as the variable parameter is constructed based on the present theoretical model the comparison is presented in fig 2 showing a quite good agreement between the result of our study and that of modarres sadeghi and païdoussis 2009 3 2 validation using the linear results for a pipe in external axial flow but without internal flow païdoussis 1966a 1966b has theoretically and experimentally examined the stability and dynamical behaviors of a flexible 2 d cylinder in external axial flow for different boundary conditions in the work of païdoussis 1966a mathematical formulations for the motions of a flexible cylinder immersed in axial flowing fluid were derived and frequency and stability analyses were presented païdoussis 1966a found that for a pinned pinned cylinder in addition to buckling in the first mode oscillatory instabilities in higher flexural modes may occur for sufficiently higher external flow velocities these oscillatory instabilities may be generated by the frictional forces in another work of païdoussis 1966b experiments were designed to verify the theoretical results predicted by païdoussis 1966a the observations in experiments were in substantial agreement with their theory for comparison purpose a diagram of the critical flow velocity for buckling and oscillatory instabilities denoted by u cb and u co varying with an uniform axial tension г is constructed in fig 3 where it is obvious that the present theoretical results agree quite well with païdoussis s results when the externally applied tension is absent it is found that the dimensionless critical flow velocity for buckling instability is about 3 135 with the corresponding dimensional value for cylinder a is about 41 m s païdoussis 1966b 3 3 convergence analysis in order to search for the truncated mode number n of the galerkin s method convergence analysis for different truncated mode numbers including n 4 5 6 and 7 will be conducted the planar initial values defined in eq 34 will be employed in the calculations three key parameters of the flow velocity in eqs 29 30 and 31 are taken as follows 36 u e 1 u 0 4 5 μ 0 6 four bifurcation diagrams for the midpoint displacement amplitudes in the y direction with respect to pulsating frequency ω of the internal fluid for different truncated mode numbers are constructed in fig 4 as can be seen from fig 4 the difference between the results based on four values of n are not pronounced therefore in this study a truncated mode number with n 6 will be employed in the galerkin s method for all later calculations 4 dynamics of pipes conveying steady fluid in this section the case with internal flow velocity being steady will be considered such that 37 μ ω 0 u i u 0 c o n s t a n t in addition the planar initial values defined in eq 34 are employed thus the pipe will deflect in the xoy plane when the internal and or external flow velocities become high 4 1 linear frequency analysis based on eqs 29 and 30 the basic linear dynamics of the pipe system will be analyzed variations of the lowest three dimensionless natural frequencies denoted as ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 with respect to the internal and external flow velocities u i and u e are illustrated in fig 5 the flow velocity at which the fundamental frequency becomes zero is denoted as the critical flow velocity for divergence thus it is obviously found that the critical velocity of internal fluid is equal to π for u e 0 while the critical velocity of external fluid is about 3 14 for u i 0 it can be also observed from fig 5 that with internal and external flow velocities being concurrently increased from zero all the lowest three natural frequencies decrease in the initial stage the first mode frequency would decrease to zero indicating that the pipe loses stability in the first mode first unlike the variation of the first mode frequency the second and third mode frequencies become zero at much higher flow velocities of either internal or external flow one might have thought that the pipe could lose stability via divergence in the second and third modes however this is not true since buckling instabilities in higher modes do not materialize according to nonlinear theories païdoussis and li 1993 in addition it can be concluded from fig 5 that the external flow velocity has a similar influence on the natural frequencies of the pipe compared to the internal flow velocity this can be easily understood from eq 29 where the internal and external fluid flows have a similar contribution to the centrifugal and coriolis forces exerted on the pipe 4 2 nonlinear dynamics in this subsection the nonlinear dynamics of a simply supported pipe conveying steady fluid subjected concurrently to external axial flow will be studied bifurcation diagrams for the midpoint displacement amplitudes of the pipe versus internal or external flow velocity are constructed in addition the effects of several key parameters including the externally applied tension г and two hydrodynamic coefficients associated with friction εc n and εc t on the dynamic responses of the pipe will be also analyzed 4 2 1 influence of internal flow velocity buckling displacements at the midpoint of the pipe versus internal flow velocity for different external flow velocities including u e 0 2 3 and 4 are shown in fig 6 as can be seen in fig 6 in the special case of u e 0 the pipe stays stable at its straight equilibrium position until the internal flow velocity reaches the critical value u i cr π where the pipe loses stability by static divergence via a pitchfork bifurcation in the case of u e 2 or 3 the bifurcation routes are similar to that for u e 0 except that the critical flow velocities of the internal fluid become lower furthermore when the external flow velocity is equal to 4 it can be seen that the pipe would be buckled even when u i is equal to zero thus it can be concluded that this buckling behavior is exactly due to the external flow this nonlinear result regarding the buckling behavior of the pipe is in accordance with the linear prediction given in section 4 1 where it was shown that the pipe loses stability at u e 3 14 in the absence of internal fluid flow it can be also seen from fig 6 that the four curves for different external flow velocities are nearly parallel when the internal flow velocity becomes relatively high this indicates that the growth rates of the buckling displacement amplitudes for different external flow velocities are almost identical as the internal flow velocity increases 4 2 2 influence of external flow velocity in this subsection the influence of external flow velocity on the buckling displacements of the pipe is investigated the evolutions of the midpoint displacements of the pipe with increasing external flow velocity for four different internal flow velocities including u i 0 2 4 5 and 6 are plotted in fig 7 combing figs 6 and 7 it can be seen that effect of external flow velocity on the buckling displacements of the pipe is in a manner analogous to that of internal flow velocity when the flow velocity is not sufficiently high next effects of εc n εc t and г on the dynamic responses of the pipe with respect to external flow velocity are studied since the effects of these three system parameters on the responses of the pipe as the internal flow velocity increases have been previously studied by modarres sadeghi and païdoussis 2009 the corresponding results will not be reproduced by varying the internal flow velocity bifurcation diagrams for the lateral buckling displacements at the midpoint of the pipe in the y direction as a function of u e for u i 0 are constructed in fig 8 in this case again we choose εc n εc t as can be seen in fig 8 a the critical flow velocity of external fluid for divergence in the first mode becomes lower as either εc n or εc t increases fig 8 b displays the effect of г on responses of the pipe with respect to external flow velocity u e it is obvious that when a larger compression force e g г 10 is applied at two ends of the pipe the pipe will be buckled and hence a nonzero displacement in the y direction can be observed in the case of u e 0 additionally it can be seen from fig 8 b that u e cr will increase with the increase of externally applied tension and that the midpoint displacement amplitude of the pipe decreases as г increases for a given value of u e this indicates that an externally applied tension г 0 stabilizes while a compression force г 0 destabilizes the system it has been shown in section 1 that a supported pipe in external axial flow will first lose stability by static divergence via a pitchfork bifurcation at the critical flow velocity of external fluid and may undergo post divergence flutter at sufficiently high external flow velocity however this flutter instability phenomenon has not been observed in the results of figs 7 and 8 even if higher external fluid velocities are taken for calculations it is now of interest to investigate the possibility of the post divergence flutter of the pipe system according to the discussion of païdoussis 2004 for a cylinder supported at both ends the condition for flutter δw s s 0 due to external flow requires that 38 δ w s s c n c t u e 2 0 l v v d x c n u e c 0 l v 2 d x 0 where the overbar denotes the long time average and c 4 π c d δw s s represents the work done by the external fluid on the pipe over a period oscillation the second term including the negative sign in eq 38 is always negative hence for inequality 38 to be satisfied one must have c n c t this can explain why flutter like oscillatory motions cannot be observed in the results of figs 7 and 8 a bifurcation diagram for the dimensionless midpoint displacement amplitudes versus external flow velocity for ε c n 1 and ε c t 0 25 with u i 0 is displayed in fig 9 in the calculations all other system parameters are defined in eq 33 and the planar initial values of eq 34 are employed it can be observed from fig 9 that the pipe stays stable at its original static equilibrium position up to the critical flow velocity of external fluid u e 3 1 where it loses stability by static divergence as the external flow velocity is further increased flutter instability develops and the onset of flutter is at u e 15 2 a summary of typical results for key dynamical behaviors the pipe is presented in fig 10 by means of time traces and phase plots 5 dynamics of pipes conveying pulsating fluid section 4 was focused on the dynamical behaviors of the pipe conveying a steady fluid now we turn our attention to the case of a pipe conveying a pulsating fluid the pulsating internal flow velocity is expressed in eq 31 since the internal flow velocity has a time dependent harmonic component superposed on the steady flow dynamical instability instead of static instability might occur two things should be done in this section firstly floquet theory is introduced to deal with the linear parametric instability of the pipe system the second item concerns the influence of pulsating internal fluid flow and external fluid flow on the nonlinear dynamical behaviors of the pipe since the linear parts of the governing equations in the two directions are decoupled only the linear form of eq 29 is used to predict the stability boundaries for parametric resonance of the dynamical system in all calculations for nonlinear dynamics of the pipe the system parameters defined in eq 33 and the non planar initial values given in eq 35 will be employed 5 1 stability analysis after neglecting nonlinear terms and utilizing galerkin s method introduced in section 2 3 eq 29 can be transformed into the linear matrix form as follows 39 m p c p kp 0 where 40 m i j 0 1 ϕ i ϕ j d ξ 41 c i j 2 β 1 u i β 2 u e 0 1 ϕ i ϕ j d ξ α 0 1 ϕ i ϕ j d ξ 1 2 ε c d β 2 1 2 ε c n β 2 u e 0 1 ϕ i ϕ j d ξ 42 k i j u i 2 u e 2 γ 0 1 ϕ i ϕ j d ξ 0 1 ϕ i ϕ j d ξ 1 2 ε c n u e 2 0 1 ϕ i ϕ j d ξ 1 2 ε c t u e 2 0 1 1 2 ξ ϕ i ϕ j d ξ β 1 u i 0 1 1 ξ ϕ i ϕ j d ξ introducing a vector h p p after some simple manipulation eq 39 reduces to 43 h ah where 44 a 0 i m 1 k m 1 c four different cases with different values of internal mean flow velocity and external flow velocity including u e 0 u 0 1 u e 1 u 0 2 u e 2 u 0 2 and u e 0 u 0 3 are considered for stability analyses for later analysis on the possible parametric resonances due to pulsating internal fluid flow the lowest two dimensionless natural frequencies corresponding to these external flow velocities and internal mean flow velocities are listed in table 2 the stability of the pipe system with the abovementioned flow velocities is analyzed by varying the pulsating frequency and amplitude of internal fluid with the aid of floquet theory meirovitch 2010 the parametric instability regions in the ω μ space are displayed in fig 11 it can be seen from fig 11 that motions of the pipe may become unstable when the pulsating frequency ω of the internal fluid approaches some multiples of the lowest two natural frequencies in the range of 0 60 for ω for instance it is seen that instabilities may occur at ω 2ω 1 in fig 11 a and at ω ω 1 and 2ω 1 in fig 11 b d as shown in fig 11 d indeed the pipe system can be subject to an instability at ω ω 2 moreover by inspecting fig 11 it is seen that the pipe is stable when the pulsating amplitude is small and becomes unstable for some values of pulsating frequency it is also noted that the instability regions in the ω μ space may be widened as u e or u 0 is increased with increasing pulsating amplitude the range of pulsating frequency for unstable motions becomes wider to further understand the dynamical stability of the pipe system typical bifurcation diagrams for the midpoint displacement amplitudes of the pipe in the y and z directions are obtained using nonlinear equations and shown in figs 12 and 13 for two typical values of u e and u 0 from fig 12 a and b it can be found that for the case of u e 0 u 0 1 and μ 0 6 the parameter range of pulsating frequency where dynamical instability occurs is within 18 ω 19 approximately this parameter range of pulsating frequency predicted by nonlinear equations is in accordance with that predicted using linear theory see fig 11 a in most cases the pipe undergoes periodic motions in this unstable region when u e 2 u 0 2 and μ 0 2 the dynamical instability of the pipe system occurs in the ranges of 3 8 ω 4 and 6 6 ω 9 6 as the pulsating amplitude μ further increases to μ 0 4 or 0 6 it can be observed that the range of pulsating frequency where instability occurs becomes wider and motions of the pipe in these instability regions may become more complicated for instance for u e 2 u 0 2 and μ 0 6 parametric instability occurs in the range of 0 ω 12 approximately as shown in fig 13 e and f after a careful comparison it is noted that the ranges of ω where parametric instabilities occur in figs 12 and 13 are consistent with the counterparts shown in fig 11 a and c predicted by floquet theory based on linear theories this further demonstrates the correctness of the calculation procedures in this study 5 2 nonlinear dynamics as mentioned in the foregoing the pipe conveying pulsating fluid is akin to a column subjected to a time dependent end load thus parametric resonances may occur and complex dynamical behaviors can be generated since the basic dynamics of the pipe with low internal mean flow velocity and external flow velocity have been shown in figs 12 and 13 in the following nonlinear analysis focus will be placed on the nonlinear dynamics of the pinned pinned pipe when the internal mean flow velocity and or the external flow velocity is higher than the corresponding critical value to understand the nonlinear dynamics of the pipe system numerical results for u 0 4 5 and various external flow velocities are presented in the form of bifurcation diagrams time traces phase portraits oscillation trajectories and poincaré maps three typical values of pulsating amplitude are considered including μ 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 5 2 1 the case with zero external flow velocity fig 14 illustrate bifurcation results for the midpoint displacement amplitudes of the pipe versus pulsating frequency for u 0 4 5 and u e 0 looking at the results for μ 0 2 shown in fig 14 a and b the bifurcation diagrams may be divided into five regions based on the types of motions of the pipe in the range of 0 ω 4 approximately the pipe undergoes period 1 motion with asymmetric amplitudes in either y or z direction this region of pulsating frequency is named as region i typical results of the phase portraits and time traces for such a period 1 motion are presented in fig 15 as the pulsating frequency is increased the period 1 motion may changes to multi periodic or more complex motions in region ii period 1 2 4 motions and chaotic motions are detected and these complex motions may alternately occur at about ω 16 2 however a sudden change of the dynamical behavior of the pipe occurs i e the oscillation of the pipe is of a period 1 motion in a wide range of 16 2 ω 26 4 approximately this parameter region for period 1 motions is denoted as region iii when the pulsating frequency is in the range of 26 4 ω 28 4 denoted as region iv the oscillation of the pipe again evolves to become chaotic in regions ii iii and iv all the motions of the pipe are displayed to be wide band finally as the pulsating frequency is further increased beyond 28 4 the wide band chaotic motion was destroyed and the motion of the pipe would be a narrow band chaotic or period 1 one sample results of phase plots and poincaré maps for the pipe with u 0 4 5 u e 0 and μ 0 2 for three typical values of pulsating frequencies are given in figs 15 and 16 it can be seen that the pipe vibrates either regularly or irregularly showing a periodic motion figs 15 and 16 a b or a chaotic motion fig 16 c and d it is now interesting to investigate the evolution of oscillating shapes of the pipe as the pulsating frequency varies typical results are presented in fig 17 it is obviously seen from fig 17 a that the motions of the pipe are dominated by the first mode for u 0 4 5 u e 0 μ 0 2 and ω 5 8 in this case the value of pulsating frequency is within region ii it is seen that the oscillating shapes of the pipe are regular and almost symmetric about the undeformed configuration the evolution of oscillating shapes for chaotic motions with ω 27 shown in fig 17 b are irregular and shows obvious difference from that plotted in fig 17 a to further study the impacts of pulsating amplitude on the dynamic responses of the pipe the results for μ 0 4 and 0 6 with u 0 4 5 and u e 0 are displayed in fig 14 c f compared with the bifurcation results for μ 0 2 it can be seen that the bifurcation diagrams for μ 0 4 or 0 6 have similar bifurcation routes but with some minor difference the first difference is that the region i in fig 14 a b does not exist in fig 14 c d for the results of μ 0 4 and in fig 14 e f for the results of μ 0 6 in addition it is seen from fig 14 c f that region iii and region iv become wider for μ 0 4 and 0 6 while region v becomes narrower in the range of 0 ω 60 in the case of μ 0 4 it is interesting to find that there is a sub region of period 1 motions embedded within region ii and region iv this sub region of period 1 motions is not detected in the bifurcation results for μ 0 2 and 0 6 moreover in the case of μ 0 6 there is a narrow sub region 40 8 ω 43 8 approximately of quasi periodic motions in region iv an example of the results for such quasi periodic motions is presented in fig 18 within this sub region of quasi periodic motions there are several so called periodic windows where periodic motion can be detected for μ 0 6 5 2 2 the case with nonzero external flow velocity in this subsection nonlinear dynamic responses of the pipe with nonzero external flow velocity are explored in all calculations the pulsating amplitude of internal fluid is fixed to be μ 0 4 fig 19 illustrates bifurcation diagrams for the midpoint displacement amplitudes versus pulsating frequency for different values of u 0 and u e according to the bifurcation results in fig 14 in each case the difference between the bifurcations in the y direction and those in the z direction is not pronounced and hence only the y direction bifurcation results are presented here looking at the bifurcation diagrams shown in fig 19 the region i with asymmetric periodic motions could occur for three different combination values of u 0 and u e it is also seen that the range of pulsating frequency for region i becomes wider as u 0 or u e is increased for example region i occurs in the range of 0 ω 1 4 for u 0 4 5 and u e 2 however it does occur in the range of 0 ω 12 4 for u 0 4 5 and u e 4 and in the range of 0 ω 14 2 for u 0 6 and u e 4 from the results shown in fig 14 c d and 19 a b the influence of external flow velocity on the nonlinear dynamic responses of the pipe can be understood in these figures all results were obtained using the same values of internal mean flow velocity and pulsating amplitude but using different values of external flow velocity u e 0 2 or 4 in the case of u e 0 or 2 the external flow velocity is below the critical value 3 14 while in the case of u e 4 the external flow velocity is beyond the critical value thus the bifurcation routes shown in fig 19 b and c are similar while the bifurcation routes shown in fig 19 a and b or c are quite different it can be also found that the range of pulsating frequency for region iii becomes narrower and that for region iv becomes wider for u e 4 compared to the counterparts for u e 0 and 2 additionally a sub region of quasi periodic motions can be observed within region iv for u e 2 and 4 this sub region of quasi periodic motions occurs in the range of 42 ω 43 6 for u e 2 and it occurs in the ranges of 29 4 ω 41 2 and 45 2 ω 47 8 for u e 4 the results for u e 2 shown in fig 17 a indicate that a narrow sub region of chaotic motions in the range of 18 2 ω 19 8 is possible within region iii this chaotic phenomenon is not detected in the region iii for u e 0 or 4 a set of diagrams constructed for the dynamic response of the pipe for ω 19 is shown in fig 20 where the feature of chaos is obvious 5 3 parameter analysis for 3 d and 2 d motions of the pipe we next turn our attention to determine whether the motions of the pipe are planar or not indeed it is difficult to distinguish non planar motions from planar motions from bifurcation diagrams therefore the oscillation trajectories for the midpoint of the pipe are constructed looking at figs 15 c and 20 c the oscillation trajectories of the pipe may be shaped as a straight line indicating that the pipe undergoes a planar motion the result shown in 18 c however corresponds to a non planar motion based on oscillation trajectories for many values of pulsating frequency one can obtain the ranges of pulsating frequency for planar or non planar motions the corresponding results for different values of u 0 and u e with μ 0 4 are given in table 3 where the gray regions represent the ranges of pulsating frequency for planar motions while the black regions represent those for non planar motions in the case of u 0 4 5 and u e 0 it can be found that there are only three narrow regions for non planar motions and these regions occur only when ω is larger than 35 as seen from table 3 when u e or u 0 is increased the ranges of pulsating frequency for non planar motions become wider and the first occurrence of non planar motions would be located at a lower pulsating frequency for instance the critical value of pulsating frequency for the first occurrence of non planar motions is about 35 8 for u 0 4 5 and u e 0 while it reduces to 14 4 for u 0 6 and u e 4 some typical results for non planar motions is presented in fig 21 in the form of oscillation trajectories the figure of eight trajectory is observed in fig 21 a which indicates the oscillation of the pipe is periodic and non planar the result in fig 21 b is chaotic and those in fig 21 c and d show quasi periodic motions from fig 21 a it is seen that the oscillation amplitudes in the y and z directions are quite different due to the coupling of the lateral deflections of the pipe along these two directions showing an obvious asymmetric feature in the phase portrait for this reason it is necessary to utilize a non planar theoretical model for predicting the nonlinear responses of the pipe in many cases 6 conclusions in this paper the linear and nonlinear dynamics of a simply supported pipe conveying fluid simultaneously subjected to an external axial flow are investigated geometric nonlinearities due to stretching effect of the pipe are considered in the newly developed 3 d version of governing equations this analytical model allows the flow velocity of internal fluid to be either steady or pulsatile in the case of internal fluid with steady flow velocity variations of the lowest three natural frequencies of the pipe as functions of internal or external flow velocity are constructed first the results show that the natural frequencies of the pipe can be greatly affected by the internal and external fluid flows indeed the internal and external fluid flows have a similar effect on the variations of the pipe s natural frequencies since both of them generate centrifugal and coriolis forces exerted on the pipe after the linear dynamics analysis the post divergence behaviors of the pipe are investigated either the flow velocity of internal fluid or external fluid is selected as the variable parameter nonlinear results show that when the internal flow velocity or the external flow velocity is successively increased the pipe remains stable at relatively low flow velocity and then loses stability by static divergence at a critical flow velocity of internal or external fluid it is also found that the hydrodynamic coefficients of external fluid and the externally applied tension have great effects on the post divergence behaviors of the pipe flutter instability may be observed for sufficiently high external flow velocity when the two frictional coefficients in the tangential and normal directions are chosen to be different in the case of internal flow velocity with a harmonic component the parametric instability of the pipe system is analyzed by floquet theory it is found that the instability regions may grow in the ω μ space as the internal mean flow velocity or external flow velocity is increased these linear results are further verified by using nonlinear theory the nonlinear dynamical behaviors of the pipe are investigated by examining the midpoint responses of the pipe in several bifurcation diagrams the pulsating frequency is taken as the variable parameter and some typical values of internal mean flow velocity and external flow velocity are considered numerical results show that within the range of pulsating frequency of interest each bifurcation diagram can be approximately divided into five regions according to the oscillation feature of the pipe for further understanding of the nonlinear dynamics of the pipe typical results for some key dynamical behaviors of the pipe are displayed in the form of time traces phase portraits oscillation trajectories and poincaré maps it can be observed from these results that periodic quasi periodic and chaotic motions are possible finally the parameter ranges of pulsating frequency for planar and non planar motions for various internal mean flow velocities and external flow velocities are explored it is shown that as the internal mean flow velocity or external flow velocity is increased the parameter ranges of pulsating frequency for non planar motions become wider and the first occurrence of non planar motion would occur at a lower pulsating frequency for non planar motions of the pipe indeed the present 3 d version instead of previous 2 d version

work of kheiri et al 2013b the derivation of the viscous hydrodynamic forces i e f n f l and their components in the y and z directions will be given in this appendix following eq 2 the position vector of the deformed pipe can be expressed as a 1 r x i y j z k x 0 u i v j w k the velocities of external free stream and the pipe may be defined by a 2 v f u e i a 3 v p u i v j w k thus one can easily obtain the relative velocity between the free stream and the pipe in the following form a 4 v f p u e u i v j w k where u e o 1 u o 2 and v w o moreover the magnitude of the relative fluid pipe velocity can be given by a 5 v f p u e u 2 v 2 w 2 1 2 u e 1 2 u u e u u e 2 v u e 2 w u e 2 1 2 furthermore the tangential and normal components of v f p may be written as a 6 v a v a x i y j z k x 2

however it must be pointed out that the effect of longitudinal motion of the pipe is neglected thus eqs a 5 a 6 and a 11 can be rewritten as a 12 v f p u e 1 v u e 2 w u e 2 1 2 a 13 v a e t u e v v w

21439,in this paper the instability and three dimensional 3 d nonlinear dynamics of a supported pipe subjected concurrently to internal and external axial flows are investigated for the flow velocity of internal fluid being either steady or pulsatile for that purpose a 3 d version of nonlinear governing equations for two perpendicular lateral displacements of the pipe are derived by the use of extended hamilton s principle unlike previous two dimensional 2 d versions of governing equation for a supported pipe subjected concurrently to external and internal axial flows this new 3 d version of governing equations is capable of predicting the non planar motions of the pipe based on linear analyses it is shown that buckling instability may occur for an internal steady fluid flow while parametric instability can be generated by an internal pulsatile flow in the nonlinear analyses the nonlinear dynamics of the pipe with various internal and external flow velocities for different pulsating frequencies and amplitudes are represented by means of bifurcation diagrams time traces phase portraits oscillation trajectories power spectral density psd diagrams and poincaré maps some interesting dynamical behaviors including periodic quasi periodic and chaotic motions are detected in a wide range of pulsating frequency of interest in many cases non planar motions of the pipe may be induced by fluid flows these non planar motions however need to be determined by using the present 3 d theoretical model instead of previously used 2 d ones for supported pipes subjected concurrently to internal and external axial flows keywords pipe conveying fluid external axial flow non planar dynamics pulsating flow velocity instability 1 introduction pipes conveying fluid are a typical fluid structure interaction system and have wide engineering applications such as marine engineering nuclear engineering aerospace engineering and petrochemical industries etc in the past decades therefore the dynamical behaviors of pipes conveying fluid have been extensively investigated by many researchers in terms of the initial shape of centerline pipes may be classified as straight and curved pipes only straight pipes conveying fluid are of our interest in this study some early fundamental work on this topic was concentrated on the two dimensional 2 d dynamics of initially straight pipes conveying steady fluid i e the fluid velocity does not vary with time it was theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that at sufficiently high flow velocity supported pipes may lose stability by static divergence while cantilevered pipes would be subject to flutter instability païdoussis 1998 based on linear theories the determination of natural frequencies and critical flow velocities for instability of fluid conveying pipes has been extensively studied by païdoussis and li 1993 weaver and unny 1973 yu et al 2013 tornabene et al 2010 li et al 2018 and alizadeh et al 2016 showing that the basic dynamics of cantilevered and supported pipes are fundamentally different by means of nonlinear theories the 2 d nonlinear dynamics of pipes conveying steady fluid with motion limiting constraints jin 1997 jin and zou 2003 wang and ni 2006 païdoussis et al 1989 ni et al 2015 intermediate springs sugiyama et al 1985 païdoussis et al 2007 ghayesh and païdoussis 2010 or external excitations liang and wen 2011 mamaghani et al 2016 zhai et al 2011 were also considered by some researchers showing that some complex and interesting nonlinear behaviors including chaotic and quasi periodic motions might occur since non planar motions of pipes conveying fluid can occur in some cases three dimensional 3 d vibrations of straight pipes were also analyzed by some researchers for instance wadham gagnon et al 2007 derived a 3 d version of nonlinear equations of cantilevered pipes conveying fluid via a modified version of hamilton s principle it was shown that a cantilevered pipe with additional spring support and spring arrays can generate chaotic and quasi periodic motions in a 3 d space wadham gagnon et al s 3 d version of nonlinear equations has been also applied to solve the dynamical problems of several variants of the cantilevered pipe system by later researchers recently peng et al 2019 developed a set of nonlinear equations for 3 d motions of inclined supported pipes conveying fluid peng et al 2019 found that the dynamical behaviors of the inclined pipe are sensitive to the changes of the inclination angle for other aspects and or details on 3 d motions of pipes conveying fluid the interested reader may be referred to the works of łuczko and czerwiński 2017 wang et al 2017 dai et al 2012 and chatjigeorgiou 2010 when the internal flow velocity is pulsating with a time dependent harmonic component superposed on the steady one the pipe may experience parametric instabilities with judicious choice of amplitude and frequency of the flow fluctuation this pipe system is akin to a column experiencing a time varying end load indeed a great deal of work has been done on this topic partly because by a judicious choice of system parameters the pulsating flow can render the pipe s dynamics particularly interesting except the studies of païdoussis and issid 1974 païdoussis and sundararajan 1975 and ariaratnam and sri namachchivaya 1986 on the dynamical instability of the linear system of pipes conveying pulsating fluid some researchers initiated analyses on the nonlinear dynamics of supported pipes conveying pulsating fluid for instance namachchivaya and tien 1989 used the method of averaging to derive autonomous equations based on the nonlinear equations of a pinned pinned pipe through the autonomous equations they determined the bifurcation behavior of the pipe system it was shown that the pipe loses stability through a simple or double zero bifurcation for subharmonic resonance or a hopf bifurcation for combination resonance in another study panda and kar 2007 investigated the nonlinear system of a pinned pinned pipe conveying pulsating fluid by considering geometric cubic nonlinearity due to stretching effect of the pipe diverse dynamical phenomena including periodic quasi periodic chaotic responses jump phenomena pitchfork and hopf bifurcations have been observed based on numerical calculations in addition to those investigations on pipes supported at both ends several other studies by szabó 2000 bajaj 1987 and semler and païdoussis 1996 provided new insight into the phenomenon of cantilevered pipes conveying pulsating fluid another analogy but different problem is the dynamics of a cylindrical structure in external axial flow most of the interest in the flow induced vibration fiv of a cylindrical structure in axial flow was directly related to the power generating industry and nuclear power plants similar to the system of pipes conveying fluid a cylindrical structure in axial flow can be exerted by centrifugal force coriolis force and inertia force due to added mass of flow the essential difference is the presence of the viscous forces in the normal and longitudinal directions for external flow exerted on the cylindrical structure for an internal fluid the viscosity friction related terms do not explicitly appear in the final governing equations and hence the internal fluid frictional effect seems to play no role in the dynamics of the pipe system this has also been discussed by païdoussis 1998 for an external fluid however the viscosity related terms would explicitly appear in the governing equations and hence play an important role in the stability and dynamic responses of the pipe system a mathematical formulation of these viscous forces for external flow exerted on the cylindrical structure was first introduced by taylor 1952 who have initiated a study on the swimming of long and narrow animals the linear equations of motion for cylindrical structures in axial flow were firstly derived by païdoussis 1966a and later modified by païdoussis 1973 1974 in the mathematical model of païdoussis 1973 the gravity and pressurization effects were essentially considered in the works of ghayesh and païdoussis 1994a 1994b the fluid coupling characteristics and turbulence induced response of clustered cylinders subjected to axial flow were studied by using both theoretical and experimental methods since then linear and nonlinear dynamical behaviors of cylindrical structures subjected to axial flow have been extensively investigated by researchers by the use of either linear or nonlinear governing equations for instance païdoussis et al 2002 lopes et al 2002 and semler et al 2002 investigated dynamics of a cantilevered cylinder in axial flow in a three part study in part 1 of the three part study païdoussis et al 2002 examined the stability and energy transfer mechanisms of the system and presented good qualitative agreement between experimental observations and solutions of the linearized equation of motion in part 2 of the three part study lopes et al 2002 derived a full nonlinear equation of motion of the cantilevered cylinder via hamilton s principle in part 3 by semler et al 2002 based on the equations derived in part 2 the linear and nonlinear dynamics were examined by means of bifurcation diagrams phase plane plots and poincaré maps again agreements between theoretical and experimental results were achieved in addition to the above studies the dynamical behaviors of a cylinder in axial flow for different boundary conditions have been investigated by modarres sadeghi et al 2005 kheiri et al 2013a and kheiri and païdoussis 2015 since the longitudinal displacement of a supported pipe is generally an order of magnitude smaller than the lateral displacement païdoussis 1998 the longitudinal displacement could be reasonably neglected in many studies on flow induced vibrations of supported pipes coupled with axial flows on the other hand the mechanism of flow induced vibrations of cylindrical structures in cross flow has also attracted considerable attention in the past decades in the notable book of païdoussis et al 2011 the cross flow induced vibrations have been categorized into several types such as galloping vortex induced vibration fluidelastic instability and etc indeed the mechanism of cross flow induced vibrations of pipes is fundamentally different from that of axial flow induced vibrations of pipes the interested readers are referred to the works by facchinetti et al 2004 tang et al 2019 wang et al 2019 and xu et al 2019 cylindrical structures simultaneously subjected to internal and external axial flows are also common in engineering applications such as drill string systems heat exchanger tubes carrying internal fluid and offshore oil conveying pipes in external axial flow etc however the literature on this topic was relatively limited hannoyer and païdoussis 1978 examined the 2 d linear dynamics and stability of a cylindrical tubular beams conveying fluid and subjected to external axial flow by using linear theories they found that stability characteristics of pipes supported at both ends and cantilevered pipes are quite different for a supported pipe the system will first lose stability by static divergence when increasing either the internal or external flow velocity subsequently by flutter at higher external flow velocity in the case of a cantilevered tubular beam stability of the system depends on the absolute values of internal and external flow velocities and on the shape of the downstream end païdoussis and besancon 1981 examined various aspects of the 2 d dynamics and stability of a cluster of fluid conveying cylinders subjected to external axial flow qian et al 2008 developed a theoretical model for the planar vibration and stability of a vertical fluid conveying pipe subjected concurrently to external and axial flows in an annular channel recently abdelbaki et al 2019 proposed a nonlinear model for the 3 d dynamics of a hanging tubular cantilever that is simultaneously subjected to internal and external axial flows the internal and external flows of the system are dependent on each other and are in opposite directions abdelbaki et al 2019 compared their result with another previous linear theoretical one for the same system parameters showing good qualitative and quantitative agreements with each other after reviewing the literature on the dynamics of fivs of cylindrical structures it is found that there is a lack of knowledge about 3 d dynamics of supported fluid conveying pipes in external axial flow motived by this in the present work instability and nonlinear dynamics for 3 d motions of a simply supported pipe conveying steady or pulsating fluid are investigated with particular attention on the cumulative effect of both internal and external axial flows the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the nonlinear governing equations for 3 d motions of the pipe system are derived via hamilton s principle then discretized by the use of galerkin s method and finally solved through a fourth order runge kutta integration algorithm in section 3 validation of the newly developed model is conducted by comparing the present results with published ones also convergence in the galerkin solution is checked on for a suitable number of truncated modes in section 4 linear and nonlinear dynamics of a supported pipe conveying steady fluid in the presence of external axial flow are explored in section 5 the parametric instability of the supported pipe conveying pulsating fluid is examined in sections 4 and 5 the dynamical behaviors of the pipe with various internal and external flow velocities are presented in the form of bifurcation diagrams time traces phase portraits oscillation trajectories power spectral density diagrams and poincaré maps finally some conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 mathematical model 2 1 basic assumptions and definitions the system under consideration as shown in fig 1 consists of an elastic uniform pipe of bending stiffness ei mass per unit length m p outer diameter d inner diameter d and length l the pipe is conveying an internal fluid which may be either steady or pulsating of mass per unit length m f and velocity u i the fluid conveying pipe is placed in an external axial flow with density ρ e and steady velocity u e the pipe is simply supported at both ends and installed horizontally with no axial sliding being permitted in order to derive the governing equations of the pipe the following assumptions made for the fluid structure interaction system are i the fluid is incompressible ii the internal axial fluid flow is assumed to be a plug like flow iii the pipe is slender with large aspect ratio so that the pipe behaves like an euler bernoulli beam iv the deflection of the pipe may be large but the strain is small v the influence of supports and end shapes of the pipe on external fluid flow are neglected vi the longitudinal displacement is small enough compared to the transverse displacements and thus its effect on the dynamics of the pipe system can be neglected before deriving governing equations of the pipe system it should be pointed out that timoshenko beam theories could be more reliable for fluid conveying pipes with relatively small aspect ratios laithier and païdoussis 1981 ding et al 2017 tan et al 2019 2 2 derivation of the nonlinear equations of motion for the purpose of deriving the governing equations of motion of the pipe two coordinate systems are defined i e the eulerian x y z and lagrangian x 0 y 0 z 0 coordinate systems as for the eulerian coordinate system the x axis is along the undeformed centerline of the pipe and parallel to the external axial flow both the y axis and z axis are perpendicular to the pipe s undeformed centerline when a material point of the pipe moves its displacements can be defined by u x x 0 v y y 0 and w z z 0 for 3 d non planar motions for a slender pipe with its initially undeformed state along the x 0 axis we have y 0 z 0 0 so that v y and w z the nonlinear governing equations of motions of the pipe can be derived by the use of extended hamilton s principle which is written in the following form païdoussis 1998 1 δ t 1 t 2 t v d t t 1 t 2 δ w n c d t t 1 t 2 m f u i r l t u i τ l δ r l d t where t and v represent the kinetic and potential energies of the pipe system respectively δw nc is the virtual work done by non conservative forces t is the time r l and τ l are respectively the position vector and tangent vector of the deformed pipe at the end of the pipe located at x 0 l the position vector of the deformed pipe is given by 2 r x i y j z k where i j and k are the unit vectors in the x y and z directions respectively since the pipe is simply supported at two ends the value of the right hand side of eq 1 is zero 2 2 1 kinetic and potential energies of the pipe system the kinetic energy of the pipe and internal fluid can be expressed as 3 t t p t f 1 2 m p 0 l v p 2 d x 0 1 2 m f 0 l v f 2 d x 0 where v p and v f represent the velocities of the pipe and internal fluid respectively bearing in mind that the longitudinal displacement of the pipe is neglected the velocities of the pipe and fluid can be respectively written as 4 v p r t u i v j w k v j w k 5 v f v p u i τ u i i v u i v j w u i w k in which the dots and primes denote derivatives with respect to time t and to lagrangian coordinate x 0 respectively hence the total kinetic energy can be expressed as 6 t 1 2 m p 0 l v p 2 d x 0 1 2 m f 0 l v f 2 d x 0 1

potential energy of the pipe system v is the strain energy including the strain energy resulted from the axial elongation and bending of the pipe denoted as v e and v b respectively it is noted that the pipe is installed horizontally and thus the gravitational potential energy is absent the total potential energy of the pipe system can be given by 8 v v e v b e a p 2 0 l t e a ε s 2 d x 0 e i 2 0 l 1 ε s 2 κ 2 d x 0 where t represents the axial tension of the deformed pipe a p is the cross sectional area of the pipe ε s and κ are the strain and curvature of the deformed pipe respectively defined by 9 ε s 1 u x 0 2 v x 0 2 w x 0 2 1 10 κ 2 r s 2 2 x s 2 2 2 y s 2 2 2 z s 2 2 where s denotes the curvilinear coordinate measured from the origin after some manipulation and neglecting the higher order terms of o 4 1 one can obtain 11 ε s v 2 2 w 2 2 o 4 12 1 ε s 2 κ 2 v 2 w 2 o 4 the total axial tension t is the sum of two parts i e the externally applied load and the force associated with friction denoted as t a and the nonlinear tension resulted from axial elongation of the centreline of the pipe denoted as t e followed by that of modarres sadeghi et al 2005 and païdoussis 1998 the total axial tension can be written as 13 t t a t e 14 t a 1 2 ρ e d u e 2 c t l 2 x 0 m f u i l x 0 t 0 15 t e e a p 2 l 0 l v x 2 w x 2 d x 0 in eq 14 t 0 is the externally applied tension c t

viscoelastic model developed by snowdon 1968 with the modulus of elasticity being modified via e e 1 a t a is a viscoelastic coefficient 2 2 2 virtual work done by the external fluid forces the fluid related forces exerted on the pipe due to the external fluid flow are associated with the inviscid hydrodynamic force f a which acts in the transverse direction and the normal and longitudinal viscous frictional forces denoted as f n and f l respectively both the inviscid and viscous hydrodynamic forces will be decomposed in the y and z directions they can be obtained from the work of lighthill

value satisfying the convergence property of numerical results thus substituting eqs 32 into 29 and 30 multiplying by ϕ i ξ i 1 2 n on both sides and integrating from 0 to 1 one can transform all the differential integral equations into a set of ordinary differential equations finally the discretized ordinary differential equations can be further numerically solved through the use of a fourth order runge kutta integration algorithm 2 4 system parameters and initial conditions in this subsection system parameters of the pipe model and initial conditions employed for later calculations will be given first several key system parameters are listed in table 1 after some simple manipulation several dimensionless parameters of the pipe system in the governing equations i e eqs 29 and 30 can be calculated from table 1 in addition the hydrodynamic friction coefficients in the tangential and normal directions were sometimes chosen to be the same païdoussis 1966a 1966b the values of these dimensionless parameters are given as follows 33 β 1 0 0307 β 2 0 1445 π 8711100 γ 0 α 0 005 ε c n ε c t 1 c d 0 it should be pointed out that in the following analysis unless otherwise stated the same dimensionless system parameters in eq 33 will be used in all numerical calculations a set of initial values for generalized coordinates p 0 q 0 p 0 a n d q 0 should be given if all initial values are chosen to be zero the solutions will be also zero it is because that the dynamic response of the pipe may be either planar or non planar presumably depending on whether the given initial values are planar or non planar in the following calculations two types of nonzero initial values will be employed as follows i the planar initial values defined by 34 p 1 0 1 10 6 p 1 0 1 10 5 ii the non planar initial values defined by 35 p 1 0 1 10 6 p 1 0 1 10 5 q 1 0 1 10 6 3 model validation and convergence analysis 3 1 validation using the nonlinear results for a fluid conveying pipe without external flow in this subsection the validation of the present theoretical model will be checked by comparing the present result with published theoretical result of modarres sadeghi and païdoussis 2009 who have explored the post buckling behaviors of a pinned pinned 2 d pipe conveying steady fluid in the absence of external axial flow in the work of modarres sadeghi and païdoussis 2009 two coupled nonlinear equations in the longitudinal and transverse directions were considered and the post divergence behaviors were explored in order to compare the present result with that given by modarres sadeghi and païdoussis 2009 a bifurcation diagram for the dimensionless transverse displacements at the midpoint of the pipe with the dimensionless internal flow velocity as the variable parameter is constructed based on the present theoretical model the comparison is presented in fig 2 showing a quite good agreement between the result of our study and that of modarres sadeghi and païdoussis 2009 3 2 validation using the linear results for a pipe in external axial flow but without internal flow païdoussis 1966a 1966b has theoretically and experimentally examined the stability and dynamical behaviors of a flexible 2 d cylinder in external axial flow for different boundary conditions in the work of païdoussis 1966a mathematical formulations for the motions of a flexible cylinder immersed in axial flowing fluid were derived and frequency and stability analyses were presented païdoussis 1966a found that for a pinned pinned cylinder in addition to buckling in the first mode oscillatory instabilities in higher flexural modes may occur for sufficiently higher external flow velocities these oscillatory instabilities may be generated by the frictional forces in another work of païdoussis 1966b experiments were designed to verify the theoretical results predicted by païdoussis 1966a the observations in experiments were in substantial agreement with their theory for comparison purpose a diagram of the critical flow velocity for buckling and oscillatory instabilities denoted by u cb and u co varying with an uniform axial tension г is constructed in fig 3 where it is obvious that the present theoretical results agree quite well with païdoussis s results when the externally applied tension is absent it is found that the dimensionless critical flow velocity for buckling instability is about 3 135 with the corresponding dimensional value for cylinder a is about 41 m s païdoussis 1966b 3 3 convergence analysis in order to search for the truncated mode number n of the galerkin s method convergence analysis for different truncated mode numbers including n 4 5 6 and 7 will be conducted the planar initial values defined in eq 34 will be employed in the calculations three key parameters of the flow velocity in eqs 29 30 and 31 are taken as follows 36 u e 1 u 0 4 5 μ 0 6 four bifurcation diagrams for the midpoint displacement amplitudes in the y direction with respect to pulsating frequency ω of the internal fluid for different truncated mode numbers are constructed in fig 4 as can be seen from fig 4 the difference between the results based on four values of n are not pronounced therefore in this study a truncated mode number with n 6 will be employed in the galerkin s method for all later calculations 4 dynamics of pipes conveying steady fluid in this section the case with internal flow velocity being steady will be considered such that 37 μ ω 0 u i u 0 c o n s t a n t in addition the planar initial values defined in eq 34 are employed thus the pipe will deflect in the xoy plane when the internal and or external flow velocities become high 4 1 linear frequency analysis based on eqs 29 and 30 the basic linear dynamics of the pipe system will be analyzed variations of the lowest three dimensionless natural frequencies denoted as ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 with respect to the internal and external flow velocities u i and u e are illustrated in fig 5 the flow velocity at which the fundamental frequency becomes zero is denoted as the critical flow velocity for divergence thus it is obviously found that the critical velocity of internal fluid is equal to π for u e 0 while the critical velocity of external fluid is about 3 14 for u i 0 it can be also observed from fig 5 that with internal and external flow velocities being concurrently increased from zero all the lowest three natural frequencies decrease in the initial stage the first mode frequency would decrease to zero indicating that the pipe loses stability in the first mode first unlike the variation of the first mode frequency the second and third mode frequencies become zero at much higher flow velocities of either internal or external flow one might have thought that the pipe could lose stability via divergence in the second and third modes however this is not true since buckling instabilities in higher modes do not materialize according to nonlinear theories païdoussis and li 1993 in addition it can be concluded from fig 5 that the external flow velocity has a similar influence on the natural frequencies of the pipe compared to the internal flow velocity this can be easily understood from eq 29 where the internal and external fluid flows have a similar contribution to the centrifugal and coriolis forces exerted on the pipe 4 2 nonlinear dynamics in this subsection the nonlinear dynamics of a simply supported pipe conveying steady fluid subjected concurrently to external axial flow will be studied bifurcation diagrams for the midpoint displacement amplitudes of the pipe versus internal or external flow velocity are constructed in addition the effects of several key parameters including the externally applied tension г and two hydrodynamic coefficients associated with friction εc n and εc t on the dynamic responses of the pipe will be also analyzed 4 2 1 influence of internal flow velocity buckling displacements at the midpoint of the pipe versus internal flow velocity for different external flow velocities including u e 0 2 3 and 4 are shown in fig 6 as can be seen in fig 6 in the special case of u e 0 the pipe stays stable at its straight equilibrium position until the internal flow velocity reaches the critical value u i cr π where the pipe loses stability by static divergence via a pitchfork bifurcation in the case of u e 2 or 3 the bifurcation routes are similar to that for u e 0 except that the critical flow velocities of the internal fluid become lower furthermore when the external flow velocity is equal to 4 it can be seen that the pipe would be buckled even when u i is equal to zero thus it can be concluded that this buckling behavior is exactly due to the external flow this nonlinear result regarding the buckling behavior of the pipe is in accordance with the linear prediction given in section 4 1 where it was shown that the pipe loses stability at u e 3 14 in the absence of internal fluid flow it can be also seen from fig 6 that the four curves for different external flow velocities are nearly parallel when the internal flow velocity becomes relatively high this indicates that the growth rates of the buckling displacement amplitudes for different external flow velocities are almost identical as the internal flow velocity increases 4 2 2 influence of external flow velocity in this subsection the influence of external flow velocity on the buckling displacements of the pipe is investigated the evolutions of the midpoint displacements of the pipe with increasing external flow velocity for four different internal flow velocities including u i 0 2 4 5 and 6 are plotted in fig 7 combing figs 6 and 7 it can be seen that effect of external flow velocity on the buckling displacements of the pipe is in a manner analogous to that of internal flow velocity when the flow velocity is not sufficiently high next effects of εc n εc t and г on the dynamic responses of the pipe with respect to external flow velocity are studied since the effects of these three system parameters on the responses of the pipe as the internal flow velocity increases have been previously studied by modarres sadeghi and païdoussis 2009 the corresponding results will not be reproduced by varying the internal flow velocity bifurcation diagrams for the lateral buckling displacements at the midpoint of the pipe in the y direction as a function of u e for u i 0 are constructed in fig 8 in this case again we choose εc n εc t as can be seen in fig 8 a the critical flow velocity of external fluid for divergence in the first mode becomes lower as either εc n or εc t increases fig 8 b displays the effect of г on responses of the pipe with respect to external flow velocity u e it is obvious that when a larger compression force e g г 10 is applied at two ends of the pipe the pipe will be buckled and hence a nonzero displacement in the y direction can be observed in the case of u e 0 additionally it can be seen from fig 8 b that u e cr will increase with the increase of externally applied tension and that the midpoint displacement amplitude of the pipe decreases as г increases for a given value of u e this indicates that an externally applied tension г 0 stabilizes while a compression force г 0 destabilizes the system it has been shown in section 1 that a supported pipe in external axial flow will first lose stability by static divergence via a pitchfork bifurcation at the critical flow velocity of external fluid and may undergo post divergence flutter at sufficiently high external flow velocity however this flutter instability phenomenon has not been observed in the results of figs 7 and 8 even if higher external fluid velocities are taken for calculations it is now of interest to investigate the possibility of the post divergence flutter of the pipe system according to the discussion of païdoussis 2004 for a cylinder supported at both ends the condition for flutter δw s s 0 due to external flow requires that 38 δ w s s c n c t u e 2 0 l v v d x c n u e c 0 l v 2 d x 0 where the overbar denotes the long time average and c 4 π c d δw s s represents the work done by the external fluid on the pipe over a period oscillation the second term including the negative sign in eq 38 is always negative hence for inequality 38 to be satisfied one must have c n c t this can explain why flutter like oscillatory motions cannot be observed in the results of figs 7 and 8 a bifurcation diagram for the dimensionless midpoint displacement amplitudes versus external flow velocity for ε c n 1 and ε c t 0 25 with u i 0 is displayed in fig 9 in the calculations all other system parameters are defined in eq 33 and the planar initial values of eq 34 are employed it can be observed from fig 9 that the pipe stays stable at its original static equilibrium position up to the critical flow velocity of external fluid u e 3 1 where it loses stability by static divergence as the external flow velocity is further increased flutter instability develops and the onset of flutter is at u e 15 2 a summary of typical results for key dynamical behaviors the pipe is presented in fig 10 by means of time traces and phase plots 5 dynamics of pipes conveying pulsating fluid section 4 was focused on the dynamical behaviors of the pipe conveying a steady fluid now we turn our attention to the case of a pipe conveying a pulsating fluid the pulsating internal flow velocity is expressed in eq 31 since the internal flow velocity has a time dependent harmonic component superposed on the steady flow dynamical instability instead of static instability might occur two things should be done in this section firstly floquet theory is introduced to deal with the linear parametric instability of the pipe system the second item concerns the influence of pulsating internal fluid flow and external fluid flow on the nonlinear dynamical behaviors of the pipe since the linear parts of the governing equations in the two directions are decoupled only the linear form of eq 29 is used to predict the stability boundaries for parametric resonance of the dynamical system in all calculations for nonlinear dynamics of the pipe the system parameters defined in eq 33 and the non planar initial values given in eq 35 will be employed 5 1 stability analysis after neglecting nonlinear terms and utilizing galerkin s method introduced in section 2 3 eq 29 can be transformed into the linear matrix form as follows 39 m p c p kp 0 where 40 m i j 0 1 ϕ i ϕ j d ξ 41 c i j 2 β 1 u i β 2 u e 0 1 ϕ i ϕ j d ξ α 0 1 ϕ i ϕ j d ξ 1 2 ε c d β 2 1 2 ε c n β 2 u e 0 1 ϕ i ϕ j d ξ 42 k i j u i 2 u e 2 γ 0 1 ϕ i ϕ j d ξ 0 1 ϕ i ϕ j d ξ 1 2 ε c n u e 2 0 1 ϕ i ϕ j d ξ 1 2 ε c t u e 2 0 1 1 2 ξ ϕ i ϕ j d ξ β 1 u i 0 1 1 ξ ϕ i ϕ j d ξ introducing a vector h p p after some simple manipulation eq 39 reduces to 43 h ah where 44 a 0 i m 1 k m 1 c four different cases with different values of internal mean flow velocity and external flow velocity including u e 0 u 0 1 u e 1 u 0 2 u e 2 u 0 2 and u e 0 u 0 3 are considered for stability analyses for later analysis on the possible parametric resonances due to pulsating internal fluid flow the lowest two dimensionless natural frequencies corresponding to these external flow velocities and internal mean flow velocities are listed in table 2 the stability of the pipe system with the abovementioned flow velocities is analyzed by varying the pulsating frequency and amplitude of internal fluid with the aid of floquet theory meirovitch 2010 the parametric instability regions in the ω μ space are displayed in fig 11 it can be seen from fig 11 that motions of the pipe may become unstable when the pulsating frequency ω of the internal fluid approaches some multiples of the lowest two natural frequencies in the range of 0 60 for ω for instance it is seen that instabilities may occur at ω 2ω 1 in fig 11 a and at ω ω 1 and 2ω 1 in fig 11 b d as shown in fig 11 d indeed the pipe system can be subject to an instability at ω ω 2 moreover by inspecting fig 11 it is seen that the pipe is stable when the pulsating amplitude is small and becomes unstable for some values of pulsating frequency it is also noted that the instability regions in the ω μ space may be widened as u e or u 0 is increased with increasing pulsating amplitude the range of pulsating frequency for unstable motions becomes wider to further understand the dynamical stability of the pipe system typical bifurcation diagrams for the midpoint displacement amplitudes of the pipe in the y and z directions are obtained using nonlinear equations and shown in figs 12 and 13 for two typical values of u e and u 0 from fig 12 a and b it can be found that for the case of u e 0 u 0 1 and μ 0 6 the parameter range of pulsating frequency where dynamical instability occurs is within 18 ω 19 approximately this parameter range of pulsating frequency predicted by nonlinear equations is in accordance with that predicted using linear theory see fig 11 a in most cases the pipe undergoes periodic motions in this unstable region when u e 2 u 0 2 and μ 0 2 the dynamical instability of the pipe system occurs in the ranges of 3 8 ω 4 and 6 6 ω 9 6 as the pulsating amplitude μ further increases to μ 0 4 or 0 6 it can be observed that the range of pulsating frequency where instability occurs becomes wider and motions of the pipe in these instability regions may become more complicated for instance for u e 2 u 0 2 and μ 0 6 parametric instability occurs in the range of 0 ω 12 approximately as shown in fig 13 e and f after a careful comparison it is noted that the ranges of ω where parametric instabilities occur in figs 12 and 13 are consistent with the counterparts shown in fig 11 a and c predicted by floquet theory based on linear theories this further demonstrates the correctness of the calculation procedures in this study 5 2 nonlinear dynamics as mentioned in the foregoing the pipe conveying pulsating fluid is akin to a column subjected to a time dependent end load thus parametric resonances may occur and complex dynamical behaviors can be generated since the basic dynamics of the pipe with low internal mean flow velocity and external flow velocity have been shown in figs 12 and 13 in the following nonlinear analysis focus will be placed on the nonlinear dynamics of the pinned pinned pipe when the internal mean flow velocity and or the external flow velocity is higher than the corresponding critical value to understand the nonlinear dynamics of the pipe system numerical results for u 0 4 5 and various external flow velocities are presented in the form of bifurcation diagrams time traces phase portraits oscillation trajectories and poincaré maps three typical values of pulsating amplitude are considered including μ 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 5 2 1 the case with zero external flow velocity fig 14 illustrate bifurcation results for the midpoint displacement amplitudes of the pipe versus pulsating frequency for u 0 4 5 and u e 0 looking at the results for μ 0 2 shown in fig 14 a and b the bifurcation diagrams may be divided into five regions based on the types of motions of the pipe in the range of 0 ω 4 approximately the pipe undergoes period 1 motion with asymmetric amplitudes in either y or z direction this region of pulsating frequency is named as region i typical results of the phase portraits and time traces for such a period 1 motion are presented in fig 15 as the pulsating frequency is increased the period 1 motion may changes to multi periodic or more complex motions in region ii period 1 2 4 motions and chaotic motions are detected and these complex motions may alternately occur at about ω 16 2 however a sudden change of the dynamical behavior of the pipe occurs i e the oscillation of the pipe is of a period 1 motion in a wide range of 16 2 ω 26 4 approximately this parameter region for period 1 motions is denoted as region iii when the pulsating frequency is in the range of 26 4 ω 28 4 denoted as region iv the oscillation of the pipe again evolves to become chaotic in regions ii iii and iv all the motions of the pipe are displayed to be wide band finally as the pulsating frequency is further increased beyond 28 4 the wide band chaotic motion was destroyed and the motion of the pipe would be a narrow band chaotic or period 1 one sample results of phase plots and poincaré maps for the pipe with u 0 4 5 u e 0 and μ 0 2 for three typical values of pulsating frequencies are given in figs 15 and 16 it can be seen that the pipe vibrates either regularly or irregularly showing a periodic motion figs 15 and 16 a b or a chaotic motion fig 16 c and d it is now interesting to investigate the evolution of oscillating shapes of the pipe as the pulsating frequency varies typical results are presented in fig 17 it is obviously seen from fig 17 a that the motions of the pipe are dominated by the first mode for u 0 4 5 u e 0 μ 0 2 and ω 5 8 in this case the value of pulsating frequency is within region ii it is seen that the oscillating shapes of the pipe are regular and almost symmetric about the undeformed configuration the evolution of oscillating shapes for chaotic motions with ω 27 shown in fig 17 b are irregular and shows obvious difference from that plotted in fig 17 a to further study the impacts of pulsating amplitude on the dynamic responses of the pipe the results for μ 0 4 and 0 6 with u 0 4 5 and u e 0 are displayed in fig 14 c f compared with the bifurcation results for μ 0 2 it can be seen that the bifurcation diagrams for μ 0 4 or 0 6 have similar bifurcation routes but with some minor difference the first difference is that the region i in fig 14 a b does not exist in fig 14 c d for the results of μ 0 4 and in fig 14 e f for the results of μ 0 6 in addition it is seen from fig 14 c f that region iii and region iv become wider for μ 0 4 and 0 6 while region v becomes narrower in the range of 0 ω 60 in the case of μ 0 4 it is interesting to find that there is a sub region of period 1 motions embedded within region ii and region iv this sub region of period 1 motions is not detected in the bifurcation results for μ 0 2 and 0 6 moreover in the case of μ 0 6 there is a narrow sub region 40 8 ω 43 8 approximately of quasi periodic motions in region iv an example of the results for such quasi periodic motions is presented in fig 18 within this sub region of quasi periodic motions there are several so called periodic windows where periodic motion can be detected for μ 0 6 5 2 2 the case with nonzero external flow velocity in this subsection nonlinear dynamic responses of the pipe with nonzero external flow velocity are explored in all calculations the pulsating amplitude of internal fluid is fixed to be μ 0 4 fig 19 illustrates bifurcation diagrams for the midpoint displacement amplitudes versus pulsating frequency for different values of u 0 and u e according to the bifurcation results in fig 14 in each case the difference between the bifurcations in the y direction and those in the z direction is not pronounced and hence only the y direction bifurcation results are presented here looking at the bifurcation diagrams shown in fig 19 the region i with asymmetric periodic motions could occur for three different combination values of u 0 and u e it is also seen that the range of pulsating frequency for region i becomes wider as u 0 or u e is increased for example region i occurs in the range of 0 ω 1 4 for u 0 4 5 and u e 2 however it does occur in the range of 0 ω 12 4 for u 0 4 5 and u e 4 and in the range of 0 ω 14 2 for u 0 6 and u e 4 from the results shown in fig 14 c d and 19 a b the influence of external flow velocity on the nonlinear dynamic responses of the pipe can be understood in these figures all results were obtained using the same values of internal mean flow velocity and pulsating amplitude but using different values of external flow velocity u e 0 2 or 4 in the case of u e 0 or 2 the external flow velocity is below the critical value 3 14 while in the case of u e 4 the external flow velocity is beyond the critical value thus the bifurcation routes shown in fig 19 b and c are similar while the bifurcation routes shown in fig 19 a and b or c are quite different it can be also found that the range of pulsating frequency for region iii becomes narrower and that for region iv becomes wider for u e 4 compared to the counterparts for u e 0 and 2 additionally a sub region of quasi periodic motions can be observed within region iv for u e 2 and 4 this sub region of quasi periodic motions occurs in the range of 42 ω 43 6 for u e 2 and it occurs in the ranges of 29 4 ω 41 2 and 45 2 ω 47 8 for u e 4 the results for u e 2 shown in fig 17 a indicate that a narrow sub region of chaotic motions in the range of 18 2 ω 19 8 is possible within region iii this chaotic phenomenon is not detected in the region iii for u e 0 or 4 a set of diagrams constructed for the dynamic response of the pipe for ω 19 is shown in fig 20 where the feature of chaos is obvious 5 3 parameter analysis for 3 d and 2 d motions of the pipe we next turn our attention to determine whether the motions of the pipe are planar or not indeed it is difficult to distinguish non planar motions from planar motions from bifurcation diagrams therefore the oscillation trajectories for the midpoint of the pipe are constructed looking at figs 15 c and 20 c the oscillation trajectories of the pipe may be shaped as a straight line indicating that the pipe undergoes a planar motion the result shown in 18 c however corresponds to a non planar motion based on oscillation trajectories for many values of pulsating frequency one can obtain the ranges of pulsating frequency for planar or non planar motions the corresponding results for different values of u 0 and u e with μ 0 4 are given in table 3 where the gray regions represent the ranges of pulsating frequency for planar motions while the black regions represent those for non planar motions in the case of u 0 4 5 and u e 0 it can be found that there are only three narrow regions for non planar motions and these regions occur only when ω is larger than 35 as seen from table 3 when u e or u 0 is increased the ranges of pulsating frequency for non planar motions become wider and the first occurrence of non planar motions would be located at a lower pulsating frequency for instance the critical value of pulsating frequency for the first occurrence of non planar motions is about 35 8 for u 0 4 5 and u e 0 while it reduces to 14 4 for u 0 6 and u e 4 some typical results for non planar motions is presented in fig 21 in the form of oscillation trajectories the figure of eight trajectory is observed in fig 21 a which indicates the oscillation of the pipe is periodic and non planar the result in fig 21 b is chaotic and those in fig 21 c and d show quasi periodic motions from fig 21 a it is seen that the oscillation amplitudes in the y and z directions are quite different due to the coupling of the lateral deflections of the pipe along these two directions showing an obvious asymmetric feature in the phase portrait for this reason it is necessary to utilize a non planar theoretical model for predicting the nonlinear responses of the pipe in many cases 6 conclusions in this paper the linear and nonlinear dynamics of a simply supported pipe conveying fluid simultaneously subjected to an external axial flow are investigated geometric nonlinearities due to stretching effect of the pipe are considered in the newly developed 3 d version of governing equations this analytical model allows the flow velocity of internal fluid to be either steady or pulsatile in the case of internal fluid with steady flow velocity variations of the lowest three natural frequencies of the pipe as functions of internal or external flow velocity are constructed first the results show that the natural frequencies of the pipe can be greatly affected by the internal and external fluid flows indeed the internal and external fluid flows have a similar effect on the variations of the pipe s natural frequencies since both of them generate centrifugal and coriolis forces exerted on the pipe after the linear dynamics analysis the post divergence behaviors of the pipe are investigated either the flow velocity of internal fluid or external fluid is selected as the variable parameter nonlinear results show that when the internal flow velocity or the external flow velocity is successively increased the pipe remains stable at relatively low flow velocity and then loses stability by static divergence at a critical flow velocity of internal or external fluid it is also found that the hydrodynamic coefficients of external fluid and the externally applied tension have great effects on the post divergence behaviors of the pipe flutter instability may be observed for sufficiently high external flow velocity when the two frictional coefficients in the tangential and normal directions are chosen to be different in the case of internal flow velocity with a harmonic component the parametric instability of the pipe system is analyzed by floquet theory it is found that the instability regions may grow in the ω μ space as the internal mean flow velocity or external flow velocity is increased these linear results are further verified by using nonlinear theory the nonlinear dynamical behaviors of the pipe are investigated by examining the midpoint responses of the pipe in several bifurcation diagrams the pulsating frequency is taken as the variable parameter and some typical values of internal mean flow velocity and external flow velocity are considered numerical results show that within the range of pulsating frequency of interest each bifurcation diagram can be approximately divided into five regions according to the oscillation feature of the pipe for further understanding of the nonlinear dynamics of the pipe typical results for some key dynamical behaviors of the pipe are displayed in the form of time traces phase portraits oscillation trajectories and poincaré maps it can be observed from these results that periodic quasi periodic and chaotic motions are possible finally the parameter ranges of pulsating frequency for planar and non planar motions for various internal mean flow velocities and external flow velocities are explored it is shown that as the internal mean flow velocity or external flow velocity is increased the parameter ranges of pulsating frequency for non planar motions become wider and the first occurrence of non planar motion would occur at a lower pulsating frequency for non planar motions of the pipe indeed the present 3 d version instead of previous 2 d version

work of kheiri et al 2013b the derivation of the viscous hydrodynamic forces i e f n f l and their components in the y and z directions will be given in this appendix following eq 2 the position vector of the deformed pipe can be expressed as a 1 r x i y j z k x 0 u i v j w k the velocities of external free stream and the pipe may be defined by a 2 v f u e i a 3 v p u i v j w k thus one can easily obtain the relative velocity between the free stream and the pipe in the following form a 4 v f p u e u i v j w k where u e o 1 u o 2 and v w o moreover the magnitude of the relative fluid pipe velocity can be given by a 5 v f p u e u 2 v 2 w 2 1 2 u e 1 2 u u e u u e 2 v u e 2 w u e 2 1 2 furthermore the tangential and normal components of v f p may be written as a 6 v a v a x i y j z k x 2

however it must be pointed out that the effect of longitudinal motion of the pipe is neglected thus eqs a 5 a 6 and a 11 can be rewritten as a 12 v f p u e 1 v u e 2 w u e 2 1 2 a 13 v a e t u e v v w
