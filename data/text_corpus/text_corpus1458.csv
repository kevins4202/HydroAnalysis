7290,real time hydrologic forecasting requires near accurate initial condition of soil moisture however continuous monitoring of soil moisture is not operational in many regions such as in ganga basin extended in nepal india and bangladesh here we examine the impacts of perturbation error in the initial soil moisture conditions on simulated soil moisture and streamflow in ganga basin and its propagation during the summer monsoon season june to september this provides information regarding the required minimum duration of model simulation for attaining the model stability we use the variable infiltration capacity model for hydrological simulations after validation multiple hydrologic simulations are performed each of 21 days initialized on every 5th day of the monsoon season for deficit surplus and normal monsoon years each of these simulations is performed with the initial soil moisture condition obtained from long term runs along with positive and negative perturbations the time required for the convergence of initial errors is obtained for all the cases we find a quick convergence for the year with high rainfall as well as for the wet spells within a season we further find high spatial variations in the time required for convergence the region with high precipitation such as lower ganga basin attains convergence at a faster rate furthermore deeper soil layers need more time for convergence our analysis is the first attempt on understanding the sensitivity of hydrological simulations of ganga basin on initial soil moisture conditions the results obtained here may be useful in understanding the spin up requirements for operational hydrologic forecasts keywords large river basin hydrologic modeling impacts of initial soil moisture error propagation 1 introduction hydrologic models are useful for understanding hydrological processes predictions and managing water resources as each model is unique in terms of model structures input requirements and parameterizations the uncertainties involved in them are persistent and affect the model rahman and lu 2015 out of many sources of uncertainties the initial state is considered to be one of the most sensitive inputs to model outcomes to eliminate the impacts of initial condition spin up runs are required in land surface modeling in general a single year forcing is repeated every year and the spin up process is considered to be completed when the model s state in year n 1 matches with n yang et al 1995 however such a process needs multi year simulations and useful for modeling land processes at a climate scale but cannot be performed in real time mode for a real time forecast nevertheless eliminating errors due to initial condition is a very important step for land surface modeling and predictions though has received little attention in the hydrologic community while improper spin up often leads to the loss of true information or may cause erroneous initial outputs rahman and lu 2015 accurate specification of initial land states is important the impacts of initial conditions on model outputs are highlighted by limited number of studies and some of them are listed here goodrich et al 1994 demonstrated the possibility of runoff predictions on small 0 044 km2 to medium scale catchments 6 31 km2 through the soil moisture obtained from remote sensing or field measurements nikolopoulos et al 2011 found the role of resolution of precipitation data and contribution of wet soil to the flash flood events in a large basin 632 km2 with an increase in the basin size the impacts of initial wetness condition also increase in addition the peak discharge and runoff volume are found to be doubled in quantity under the change of soil moisture from drier to saturated conditions indicating the sensitivity on moisture contents a similar study demonstrated the impact of antecedent soil moisture on the response of runoff in semiarid regions with the use of a physically distributed model castillo et al 2003 the results showed that for medium and low intensity storms typical in semiarid regions the pre existing soil moisture conditions were crucial to control runoff while during high intensity and low frequency storms antecedent soil moisture was less impactful the study also suggested that regions of highly permeable soils with less intense storms are mostly influenced by initial soil water content however there is no study available specifically for south asian river basins where the water availability is controlled by seasonal summer monsoon rainfall initiatives are taken to improve monsoon forecasts and predictions as part of the national monsoon mission project of the government of india among which accurate land surface initialization for improving the temperature and rainfall forecasts halder et al 2018 is one however linking those efforts for initiating accurate hydrologic forecasts at river basin scale is yet to be developed under such development process it is important to understand the impacts of errors in initial condition on the forecast as well also the forecast error propagation for water resources decision making this is specifically important for large international rivers such as ganga basin which is extended over tibet nepal india and bangladesh but has very limited station level monitoring system for one of the most important variable soil moisture it is important to understand the impacts of uncertainty in initial condition of soil moisture on the forecasts of soil moisture and streamflow as well the propagation of decaying error here we present the first analysis of the same for ganga basin we investigate the impacts of uncertainty in initial soil moisture conditions in the variable infiltration capacity vic model within ganga basin we select monsoon seasons of three different years namely surplus monsoon wet year normal year and deficit monsoon drought year for the hydrologic simulation a simple and reasonable technique based on the long term standard deviation of simulated gridded soil moisture is used as the perturbation in the initial conditions we perform hydrological simulations initialized on every fifth day of the monsoon season and each of the simulations continues for 3 weeks with original and perturbed initial conditions this consists of simulating the model for a total of 225 cases spanning the three years we analyze the data to understand the propagation and convergence of perturbations initiating from the gridded initial conditions the details of the methods and data are presented in next section 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the study area consists of ganga basin extending over tibet nepal india and bangladesh with an area of 1 151 740 km2 the himalayan

used variable infiltration capacity vic as a modeling tool which is a semi distributed macroscale hydrologic model generally applied in large continental rivers vic solves complete water and energy balance and reduces errors in surface energy balance this includes an iterative process to determine the surface temperature which is used to generate surface energy flux gao et al 2010 the model considers sub grid scale variability in infiltration capacity where runoff is generated via variable infiltration curve and baseflow is generated via the empirical arno baseflow curve liang et al 1994 the model features multiple soil layers and represents multiple vegetation types in a single grid through the mosaic approach the model represents lakes and wetlands bowling et al 2003 cherkauer et al 2003 bowling and lettenmaier 2010 and includes frozen soil and permafrost algorithm cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 cherkauer et al 2003 for a realistic mountain topography the model allows sub grid scale variability in the representation of elevation though elevation bands nijssen et al 2001 and consists better snow processes bowling et al 2004 andreadis et al 2009 which has improved vic simulations in cold regions and hence expected to work well in the himalayan region a stand alone routing model lohmann et al 1996 1998a b is used to transport grid based runoff and baseflow to the grid cell outlet and ultimately to the basin outlet for the generation of streamflow based on the linearized saint venant equation the vic model has been applied from regional to global scales for various hydrological applications nijssen et al 2001 maurer et al 2002 saurral et al 2008 raje and krishnan 2012 raje et al 2014 maurer et al 2002 used vic model to generate a long term 1950 2002 dataset of land surface states and fluxes at a spatial resolution of 1 80 in the conterminous united states and portions of canada and mexico for better comparison of model predictions a similar study livneh et al 2013 applied vic to generate improved hydrological dataset for the extended period of 97 years 1915 2011 at a spatial resolution of 1 160 vic has been applied in a number of studies that involves the understanding and analysis of drought sheffield et al 2004 luo and wood 2007 sheffield and wood 2007 mo 2008 mishra and cherkauer 2010 mishra et al 2014 recently an experimental drought monitor system in india has been developed shah and mishra 2015 to provide near real time drought information on daily basis at higher resolution 0 25 the authors applied vic to simulate necessary soil moisture and runoff and the simulated data is in good agreement with monthly streamflow for the ganges and the mahanadi basin shah and mishra 2016 employed vic to simulate evapotranspiration and surface water availability in the 18 indian subcontinental basins to understand the long term 1901 2012 changes in hydroclimatic variables monsoon season precipitation a key driver of changes in evapotranspiration and surface water availability was found to have declining trends after 1948 in most of the sub continental basins with significant decline in the ganges affecting the surface water availability in this region a study mishra et al 2010 employed vic together with urban land cover representation developed by yang et al 2010 that resulted in the significant impacts of land use land cover and climate change on water and energy budget at a regional level similarly chawla and mujumdar 2015 isolated the impacts of land use and climate on the streamflow in the upper ganga basin of india and found the higher sensitivity of simulated streamflow with changes in urban areas and varying precipitation though integrated impacts of land use and climate was substantial on vic simulated streamflow impacts of climate was found to be more dominant compared to land use in the region 2 3 data and model setup the required input data for the study were compiled from various sources daily gridded meteorological forcing maximum temperature minimum temperature and wind speed at a spatial resolution of 0 25 for the study period january 1979 to december 2006 were obtained from ecmwf era interim dee et al 2011 whereas daily gridded precipitation at similar temporal and spatial resolution was obtained from aphrodite yatagai et al 2012 the non meteorological inputs include elevation vegetation and soil information the elevation input was extracted from digital elevation model dem developed under shuttle radar topographic mission srtm at 90 m resolution jarvis et al 2008 the land use and land cover information were obtained from the university of maryland at 1 km resolution analyzed through the avhrr satellites hansen et al 2000 the global land cover classification glcc that includes 14 different land cover types including water was used the soil parameters were developed from harmonized world soil database hwsd this soil map represents 5000 soil type at two soil layers 0 30 cm and 30 100 cm the required input parameters for the vic model were developed using the methods available on its website http vic readthedocs io en master the model domain as in fig 1 resulted in a total of 1659 grids each of 0 25 resolution the meteorological and non meteorological information as discussed above were stored grid wise three soil layers with respective depths of 0 3 m top layer 0 3 m middle layer and 0 4 m bottom layer were considered in the study an interval of 500 m was chosen to create elevation bands to improve the performance of vic especially in complex terrains or mountainous regions as in nijssen et al 2001 which resulted in a total of 18 elevation bands inside the basin the model was simulated once the required model inputs were in order an independent routing model lohmann et al 1996 1998a b was used to determine the streamflow at three locations seti beni and trishuli on the himalayas in nepal and ankinghat in india as shown in fig 1 the model was evaluated through streamflow calibration at two stations seti beni and ankinghat and validation at all three locations the observed streamflow data at seti beni 1984 1992 and trishuli 1997 2001 required for calibration validation were obtained from the department of hydrology and meteorology of nepal http www dhm gov np access date 12 26 2016 similarly the historical streamflow records at ankinghat from 1984 to 1992 were obtained from central water commission of india http www cwc nic in access date 03 20 2017 daily soil moisture from 2002 to 2006 required for the validation of simulated soil moisture were obtained from european space agency climate change initiative combined liu et al 2012 wagner et al 2012 in addition the observed soil moisture data for the monsoon season at seven days interval were obtained from the india meteorological department imd these field measurements of soil moisture at imd station krl 2005 2006 and imd station klni 2005 were employed for the model validation 2 4 methodology fig 2 provides the overview of the methodology used in the present study first we perform a long term hydrological simulation of ganga basin for the period 1979 2006 and validate the model outputs the hydrologic model vic is validated based on observed streamflow and soil moisture data each at three locations the model performance measures used in this study are nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 r2 refined index of agreement dr willmott et al 2012 and root mean square errors rmse before validation the model was first calibrated to obtain the parameters of vic viz maximum baseflow dsmax fraction of dsmax ds variable infiltration curve parameter bi fraction of maximum soil moisture ws as discussed in nijssen et al 1997 till the satisfactory values of model performance measures were obtained for all the three streamflow stations the calibration is performed without considering irrigation that may result slightly different parameterization causing parameter uncertainties in the present study such parameter uncertainty is not considered and it is one of the limitations of our study the calibration and subsequent validation summary are shown in table 2 for understanding the convergence of error due to perturbation in the initial soil moisture condition we selected three contrasting years surplus normal and deficit years based on 1 standard deviation sd of the monsoon rainfall anomaly in the period 1979 2006 as per the imd definition years with rainfall anomalies less than 1 standard deviation and greater than 1 standard deviation are considered as deficit drought and surplus wet years respectively rest of the years are known as normal years we follow the same definition and apply to the spatial average of rainfall over the ganga basin we find the year 1988 to be surplus year 1997 to be normal year and 2002 to be deficit year as shown in supplementary fig s1 we perform the hydrological simulations each of duration 21 days initialized on every 5th day of the monsoon june through september jjas season for all three years table 1 the initial soil moisture condition for 25 such days in a season table 1 b is obtained from the long term hydrological simulations as shown in fig 2 the standard deviation sd of simulated soil moisture is obtained for these 25 days across all years 1979 2006 positive and negative perturbations of initial soil moisture conditions are applied with the perturbation value as 1 sd as for example when the model is initialized with 31st may 1988 the gridded simulated soil moisture of the same day from long term simulations is used as initial conditions for 31st may the sd of soil moisture for each grid from 1979 to 2006 is obtained the long term simulated value of 1 sd and the long term simulated value of 1 sd are considered as perturbed initial conditions for simulated and perturbed initial conditions the model is run for 3 times each for duration 21 days the entire process is performed for every 5th day of the season that makes total 225 days fig 2 we analyze the output for each of the simulations with perturbations the uncertainties in simulated hydrologic variables viz streamflow and soil moisture due to perturbations in initial conditions are estimated with the differences between simulated variables with perturbed and non perturbed initial conditions we analyze the error convergence and its propagation with time the time required for convergence uncertainty is less than 5 and its spatio temporal variability for entire ganga basin is obtained after validation 225 simulations are made each of 21 days duration over the entire ganga basin the uncertainty z in simulated soil moisture due to perturbation in the soil moisture initial condition is quantified as 1 z a c b where a c and b denotes the values of simulated hydrological variables from positively perturbed negatively perturbed and non perturbed initial conditions z is computed every day for each day of the 21 day period for each one of the simulations 3 results and discussions 3 1 evaluation of hydrologic model the simulated streamflow is in good agreement with the historical observations for all three stations as supported by the statistics of table 2 the comparison of observed and simulated streamflow at seti beni trishuli and ankinghat is shown in fig 3 a c the validation for soil moisture is represented in fig 3 d f fig 3 d represents the validation of simulated soil moisture at chhakarbandha across top 1 cm soil depth with observed information obtained from esa combined dataset that shows underestimation of soil moisture during dry period the simulated soil moisture at the top layer was compared with the 30 cm in situ soil moisture measurements from the indian meteorological department imd at 7 days interval during monsoon season as shown in fig 3 e and f we find a good match in the patterns of time series between observed and simulated soil moisture data the correlations are moderate r2 value in the order of 0 3 0 4 and this is expected as vic does not consider features of irrigation directly coupled with changes in ground water this is also partly attributed to the comparison of soil moisture at a point observed with the grid averaged simulated information these may be considered as some of the limitations of the study underestimation of soil moisture is generally consistent with underestimation of streamflow during dry periods for the stations seti beni and trishuli but not for the station ankinghat this is because of the location of ankinghat is in upstream regions which is less affected by human interference 3 2 impacts of perturbed initial soil moisture condition on simulated soil moisture the z values for the simulated soil moisture as discussed earlier are plotted in fig 4 for all three layers over ganga basin the abscissa shows the starting day of each of the simulations while y axis presents the day of simulation ranging from 1 to 21 the plot presents the z value spatial average over the entire case study area in terms of color and provide information about propagation of errors and time required for convergence as the model is initiated on every 5th day the abscissa contains the values 1st june 6th june and so on the last date in abscissa is september 29th for the simulation till october 19th the impacts of perturbations in the soil moisture due to initial conditions reduce with time which is expected rahman and lu 2015 the perturbations in initial condition which is based on climatological standard deviation from long term simulations is highest for top soil layer during onset of monsoon while for deeper soil the perturbations are more for mid peak monsoon supplementary fig s2 this attributes to the pattern of rainfall and infiltration in the ganga basin for example the onset of monsoon usually takes place during the end of june with low rainfall activity in the upper ganga causing the deeper soil layer to remain very dry without much variability after the onset of monsoon the deeper soil moisture starts getting affected by rainfall and subsequent infiltration with a prominent variability at temporal scale during peak monsoon moisture from high rainfall quickly infiltrates and results into high variability of soil moisture in the deeper layers from our simulations we find that the top soil layer has the early convergence in soil moisture as compared to middle and bottom soil layer this is associated with low variability of top soil layer the bottom layer has maximum variability as shown in terms of standard deviation of soil moisture in supplementary fig s2 in its moisture during peak monsoon and takes maximum time to converge given perturbation in the initial condition the time required for convergence is highest during drought year followed by normal and wet years the minimum time required for the convergence is 2 days and maximum time is greater than 21 days non converged for the entire basin for all the years these minimum and maximum values remain same for drought and wet years due to the seasonal pattern of monsoon however number of periods with high low convergences are different across years the wet years have more number of periods with quick convergence in the simulated soil moisture our results are also in agreement with rahman et al 2015 and rahman and lu 2015 that shows lower aridity results into quick convergence in simulated soil moisture with the requirement of low duration for spin up runs high rainfall in wet years erases the soil moisture memory easily resulting minimum sensitivity to initial condition good rainfall spells within a season with transformation from dry to wet state also clears the soil moisture memory rahman et al 2015 for all the years we find slow convergence only for the top soil layer during the onset of monsoon i e the first half of june when the rainfall is quite low this is consistent with our finding that high rainfall erases the soil moisture memory quickly during the withdrawal of monsoon end of september we find quick convergence though the amount of rainfall is less during the same time this is probably due to high moisture content in soil resulting from the recharge during the entire four months of monsoon period it is interesting to note that during drought year the convergence takes little more time even during the withdrawal time as compared to other years this is due to low recharge of soil moisture in the deficit monsoon year this is further explained with the rainfall time series plot for all the three years fig s3 in the supplemental material interestingly in the first week of june 2002 the rainfall was better than the other two years over the basin and hence the z value of the top layer soil moisture was slightly lower compared to the other two years as in fig 4 a d and g being a deficit year year 2002 has low rainfall throughout the season especially after the first half of june and that resulted into higher z values year 1988 has good rainfall during the entire season except september and hence the z value was also high in september we further analyze the results separately for the four regions in ganga basin north west ganga and nepal upper ganga middle ganga and lower ganga they are presented in figs 5 8 respectively we present the impacts of inter annual variations of monsoon rainfall on the z values for north west ganga and nepal region in fig 5 the average and wet years have a lower z value for soil moisture signifying a quick convergence of the perturbed values of initial soil moisture with frequent good rain spells during the drought year of 2002 the z value was quite high for this region except august when there had been a good spell of rainfall the plots in figs 5 8 bottom row of all show differences in perturbations in initial conditions in different regions for deeper soil layers this attributes to the spatial variations of climatological standard deviation of soil moisture for those layers as obtained from long term simulations while averaging the perturbations are only prominent during peak monsoon for deeper layer when entire ganga basin is considered fig 4 for the upper ganga region the z value is consistently higher as compared to the other three regions of ganga basin fig 6 this is because upper ganga region receives the lowest rainfall and hence the memory of soil moisture exists for longer period with the existence of propagated errors in the initial conditions we find a clear lag in the z values in bottom layers as compared to top layer and that propagates from top to middle to bottom soil layer this attributes to lower perturbation associated with lower standard deviation of soil moisture in the deeper layers during the onset supplementary fig s2 as expected the bottom soil layer has the highest z value and with such a high value it is almost impossible to get the errors convergence within 21 days of simulations even in good monsoon years however good spell of rain may reduce the z value in top soil layer in the upper ganga basin the middle ganga basin receives higher rainfall as compared to upper ganga basin and the z value is also comparatively low fig 7 rest of the characteristics is almost similar to that of the upper ganga basin such as prominent lead lag relationship between z values of top middle and bottom layers the lower ganga basin receives the highest rainfall during monsoon season among all the four regions considered and hence have the lowest z value fig 8 as this region receives good rainfall even in a deficit year as shown in fig 9 the interannual variations of z values are not so prominent in this region with a possibility of quick convergence across all the years the lag structure in z value for different layers exists in this region but it is not so prominent like the other regions the sub regions of ganga basin have significant variability across them in terms of the profiles of convergence of soil moisture as seen in figs 5 8 this is primarily due to spatial variability of rainfall across the basins with subsequent infiltration patterns this points to an important recommendation of not considering a large basin as a whole as for example here we find that the results from fig 4 spatial average for ganga is entirely different from that shown in fig 5 nepal and northwest ganga hence considering the average of ganga basin as a representation of northwest ganga may not be adequate and this shows the importance of regional hydrologic simulation with a fine spatial resolution we further analyze the convergence of non perturbed positively perturbed and negatively perturbed initial condition simulations with the plotting of time series the selection of the simulation is made arbitrarily and here we select the simulation with 20th july initial condition during peak monsoon the results for top soil layer for all the four regions are presented in fig 10 the precipitation anomalies are presented to understand the impacts of rainfall spells in soil moisture profiles we observe that the soil moisture profiles and the convergence of errors are dependent on the precipitation events we find a very quick convergence of simulated soil moisture from all the three simulations immediately after a good rain spell this is visible and prominent for all the regions north ganga upper ganga middle ganga and lower ganga this emphasizes the role of precipitation in dissipating the effects of drier initial conditions over the basin which is in accordance with the study made by seck et al 2015 the middle soil layer also shows supplementary fig s4 convergence after a good rainfall spell but the rate of convergence is slower as compared to top layer the bottom layer does not show convergence within 21 days for any of the regions even after a good spell of rainfall supplementary fig s5 our findings of the lower spin up process in deeper soil layer is in accordance with the past study done by cosgrove et al 2003 we further compute the number of days required for convergence in the simulated soil moisture with non perturbed and perturbed initial conditions if a b and c denote the simulated soil moisture in the top layer with positively perturbed non perturbed and negatively perturbed initial soil moisture condition we consider convergence when 2 a 1 025 b 3 c 0 975 b we find the number of days required for the convergence for each grid and compute the median values of these convergence days along with the first seven days of total precipitation in a separate axis across all grids for all the three years separately as presented in fig 11 as in fig 11 the number of days required for convergence of initial perturbations in soil moisture in the ganga basin is higher during the initial days of monsoon across all the years this indicates that the dry state of the basin cannot erase the soil moisture memory and hence convergence in getting delayed this indicates the necessity for correct initialization of land surface states so that the errors do not propagate for longer time however with time after few good rainfall spells the number of days required for convergence drops this drop is little delayed in the deficit year of 2002 due to lack of good rainfall during the peak monsoon time of july and first half of august the number of days required for convergence is minimum and is within 5 10 days during the end of monsoon the number of days required for convergence of simulated soil moisture increases and shows similar condition as starting of monsoon we further plot fig 12 the same for the different regions of ganga basin as considered in this study we find similar results with highest number of days required for convergence for drought year followed by normal and wet years however there is spatial variability as for example the dry upper ganga region needs highest number of days for convergence and with distinctly different patterns for wet normal and dry years however for lower ganga basin they are not different across years this attributes to good rainfall over the region for all the years these results are in agreement with the existing knowledge seck et al 2015 rahman and lu 2015 cosgrove et al 2003 that dry regions converge slower compared to wet regions the results have significant implications for real time extended range hydro meteorological forecasts this suggests that an inclusion of wet spell in the spin up runs reduces the convergence time in forecasts in the absence of real time soil moisture monitoring framework and may provide some guidelines towards the estimation of the length of spin up requirements specifically for the poorly gauged river basin such as ganga however the spin up time should not be very small even after inclusion of wet period as that may produce unrealistic simulations 3 3 impacts of perturbed initial soil moisture condition on simulated streamflow in order to understand the impacts of initial soil moisture conditions on streamflow we compute z s as a measure of uncertainty given by 4 z s a s c s where as and cs being the streamflow simulated with positively and negatively perturbed initial soil moisture respectively we avoided scaling of streamflow values as absolute magnitudes are important for the same variable fig 13 presents the spread in terms of zs for the streamflow at the three stations seti beni trishuli and ankinghat as shown in fig 1 we find that the sensitivity of streamflow to the perturbation in initial soil moisture is different from soil moisture the perturbations in soil moisture take some time to be reflected in the streamflow with a sudden increase in the spread zs during the initial period of monsoon streamflow remains very low and hence their impacts are not visible during the mid monsoon season with high rainfall amount streamflow increases with the increase in zs value this also shows the need of soil moisture monitoring for a better forecast of flood during the peak monsoon time of july and august during the drought year the station ankinghat does not show any spread and this is associated with very low rainfall and resulting low streamflow we find that though good rainfall spell erases the soil moisture memory it gets reflected in the streamflow simulations as streamflow is higher during good rainfall spells we speculate that inclusion of a good rainfall spell during the spin up period may work well for real time extended range streamflow forecasting as depicted in fig 13 the errors in initial soil moisture greatly influences streamflow forecasts initially with increasing days the difference between as and cs increased but after that it got reduced this is probably due to the convergence of soil moisture after the first good spell this further shows the possibility that inclusion of an observed good spell in the spin up runs can help in the prediction of the next extremes by reducing the convergence time to understand this further we present the uncertainty in simulated streamflow of trishuli fig 14 due to perturbation of initial soil moisture we considered 3 time slices of simulations of length 21 days starting with june 1 august 5 and september 29 initial conditions for all three years for the simulations starting with august 5 initial conditions for years 1997 and 2002 we find converged streamflow values in the second peak this clearly shows that due to the first good rainfall spell corresponding to the first peak the soil moisture has converged resulting in converged streamflow values during the second peak this shows the need of considering at least one good spell in the spin up run for simulating hydrologic variables in real time 4 conclusion this paper investigated the impacts of the perturbed initial soil moisture conditions on hydrologic simulations in a semi distributed hydrologic model for the ganga basin in south asia three initial soil moisture conditions one unperturbed and two perturbed by 1 standard deviation sd were generated via long term sd of soil moisture and were initialized for three weeks simulations in monsoon season in three contrasting years further the effects of the perturbation in initial soil moisture were observed on streamflow at three stations the major findings of the study are 1 the errors in simulated top layer soil moisture in all three years propagated slowly during the onset of monsoon when the soil was relatively dry in all the regions within the ganga basin the convergence of errors in the simulated soil moisture was impeded by the dryness of soil that lasted as long as first three weeks this phenomenon showed the strong dependence of succeeding soil moisture in the initial soil moisture states however with good rainfall spells the errors in soil moisture were quickly minimized downsizing the sensitivity on initial soil moisture condition the role of precipitation in erasing the soil moisture memory resulted in earlier convergence of errors in year with higher rainfall wet year had early convergence followed by normal and drought year 2 the errors developed in simulated soil moisture through perturbation of initial soil moisture possessed the spatial variability within the regions of ganga basin however the role of precipitation events in minimizing the sensitivity of initial soil moisture is well observed in these sub regions upper ganga with the least rainfall received in all years considered in this study had prolonged soil moisture memory resulting higher convergence time while lower ganga with high rainfall even in drought year took the least time to converge the errors north ganga and middle ganga with almost similar monsoon rainfall within wet normal and deficit year had convergence period proportionate to the rainfall spells interestingly in all three years within ganga the top soil layer showed greater sensitivity to the changes in soil moisture and precipitation events while the deeper soil layers with slower spin up process showed little or none response even to good rainfall spells 3 the convergence of errors in streamflow takes longer time as compared to that of soil moisture while the errors in soil moisture converged mostly within the first rainfall peak the errors in streamflow converged after the first peak indicating the delayed response against the same perturbation 4 for real time hydrologic simulation it is important and recommended to include at least one good rainfall spell in the spin up process which aids in proper convergence of errors in both simulated soil moisture and streamflow via reducing the dependency on the initial soil moisture conditions 5 the model has a dry bias in terms of soil moisture specifically during dry period and it takes longer time to get rid of the errors in initial condition during dry period hence there is a good chance of non convergence of errors after a break period and this needs to be considered carefully in operational hydro meteorological forecasting at extended range however the present analysis does not provide a specific guideline of model spin up this may be considered as the potential area of future research extension 6 we find significant variability in the soil moisture convergence profiles across different regions of ganga basin hence just representing the spatial average of hydrologic characteristics may not be adequate for a larger basin and this needs to be seriously considered with fine resolution region specific hydrologic models acknowledgements the authors sincerely thank the editor

7290,real time hydrologic forecasting requires near accurate initial condition of soil moisture however continuous monitoring of soil moisture is not operational in many regions such as in ganga basin extended in nepal india and bangladesh here we examine the impacts of perturbation error in the initial soil moisture conditions on simulated soil moisture and streamflow in ganga basin and its propagation during the summer monsoon season june to september this provides information regarding the required minimum duration of model simulation for attaining the model stability we use the variable infiltration capacity model for hydrological simulations after validation multiple hydrologic simulations are performed each of 21 days initialized on every 5th day of the monsoon season for deficit surplus and normal monsoon years each of these simulations is performed with the initial soil moisture condition obtained from long term runs along with positive and negative perturbations the time required for the convergence of initial errors is obtained for all the cases we find a quick convergence for the year with high rainfall as well as for the wet spells within a season we further find high spatial variations in the time required for convergence the region with high precipitation such as lower ganga basin attains convergence at a faster rate furthermore deeper soil layers need more time for convergence our analysis is the first attempt on understanding the sensitivity of hydrological simulations of ganga basin on initial soil moisture conditions the results obtained here may be useful in understanding the spin up requirements for operational hydrologic forecasts keywords large river basin hydrologic modeling impacts of initial soil moisture error propagation 1 introduction hydrologic models are useful for understanding hydrological processes predictions and managing water resources as each model is unique in terms of model structures input requirements and parameterizations the uncertainties involved in them are persistent and affect the model rahman and lu 2015 out of many sources of uncertainties the initial state is considered to be one of the most sensitive inputs to model outcomes to eliminate the impacts of initial condition spin up runs are required in land surface modeling in general a single year forcing is repeated every year and the spin up process is considered to be completed when the model s state in year n 1 matches with n yang et al 1995 however such a process needs multi year simulations and useful for modeling land processes at a climate scale but cannot be performed in real time mode for a real time forecast nevertheless eliminating errors due to initial condition is a very important step for land surface modeling and predictions though has received little attention in the hydrologic community while improper spin up often leads to the loss of true information or may cause erroneous initial outputs rahman and lu 2015 accurate specification of initial land states is important the impacts of initial conditions on model outputs are highlighted by limited number of studies and some of them are listed here goodrich et al 1994 demonstrated the possibility of runoff predictions on small 0 044 km2 to medium scale catchments 6 31 km2 through the soil moisture obtained from remote sensing or field measurements nikolopoulos et al 2011 found the role of resolution of precipitation data and contribution of wet soil to the flash flood events in a large basin 632 km2 with an increase in the basin size the impacts of initial wetness condition also increase in addition the peak discharge and runoff volume are found to be doubled in quantity under the change of soil moisture from drier to saturated conditions indicating the sensitivity on moisture contents a similar study demonstrated the impact of antecedent soil moisture on the response of runoff in semiarid regions with the use of a physically distributed model castillo et al 2003 the results showed that for medium and low intensity storms typical in semiarid regions the pre existing soil moisture conditions were crucial to control runoff while during high intensity and low frequency storms antecedent soil moisture was less impactful the study also suggested that regions of highly permeable soils with less intense storms are mostly influenced by initial soil water content however there is no study available specifically for south asian river basins where the water availability is controlled by seasonal summer monsoon rainfall initiatives are taken to improve monsoon forecasts and predictions as part of the national monsoon mission project of the government of india among which accurate land surface initialization for improving the temperature and rainfall forecasts halder et al 2018 is one however linking those efforts for initiating accurate hydrologic forecasts at river basin scale is yet to be developed under such development process it is important to understand the impacts of errors in initial condition on the forecast as well also the forecast error propagation for water resources decision making this is specifically important for large international rivers such as ganga basin which is extended over tibet nepal india and bangladesh but has very limited station level monitoring system for one of the most important variable soil moisture it is important to understand the impacts of uncertainty in initial condition of soil moisture on the forecasts of soil moisture and streamflow as well the propagation of decaying error here we present the first analysis of the same for ganga basin we investigate the impacts of uncertainty in initial soil moisture conditions in the variable infiltration capacity vic model within ganga basin we select monsoon seasons of three different years namely surplus monsoon wet year normal year and deficit monsoon drought year for the hydrologic simulation a simple and reasonable technique based on the long term standard deviation of simulated gridded soil moisture is used as the perturbation in the initial conditions we perform hydrological simulations initialized on every fifth day of the monsoon season and each of the simulations continues for 3 weeks with original and perturbed initial conditions this consists of simulating the model for a total of 225 cases spanning the three years we analyze the data to understand the propagation and convergence of perturbations initiating from the gridded initial conditions the details of the methods and data are presented in next section 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the study area consists of ganga basin extending over tibet nepal india and bangladesh with an area of 1 151 740 km2 the himalayan

used variable infiltration capacity vic as a modeling tool which is a semi distributed macroscale hydrologic model generally applied in large continental rivers vic solves complete water and energy balance and reduces errors in surface energy balance this includes an iterative process to determine the surface temperature which is used to generate surface energy flux gao et al 2010 the model considers sub grid scale variability in infiltration capacity where runoff is generated via variable infiltration curve and baseflow is generated via the empirical arno baseflow curve liang et al 1994 the model features multiple soil layers and represents multiple vegetation types in a single grid through the mosaic approach the model represents lakes and wetlands bowling et al 2003 cherkauer et al 2003 bowling and lettenmaier 2010 and includes frozen soil and permafrost algorithm cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 cherkauer et al 2003 for a realistic mountain topography the model allows sub grid scale variability in the representation of elevation though elevation bands nijssen et al 2001 and consists better snow processes bowling et al 2004 andreadis et al 2009 which has improved vic simulations in cold regions and hence expected to work well in the himalayan region a stand alone routing model lohmann et al 1996 1998a b is used to transport grid based runoff and baseflow to the grid cell outlet and ultimately to the basin outlet for the generation of streamflow based on the linearized saint venant equation the vic model has been applied from regional to global scales for various hydrological applications nijssen et al 2001 maurer et al 2002 saurral et al 2008 raje and krishnan 2012 raje et al 2014 maurer et al 2002 used vic model to generate a long term 1950 2002 dataset of land surface states and fluxes at a spatial resolution of 1 80 in the conterminous united states and portions of canada and mexico for better comparison of model predictions a similar study livneh et al 2013 applied vic to generate improved hydrological dataset for the extended period of 97 years 1915 2011 at a spatial resolution of 1 160 vic has been applied in a number of studies that involves the understanding and analysis of drought sheffield et al 2004 luo and wood 2007 sheffield and wood 2007 mo 2008 mishra and cherkauer 2010 mishra et al 2014 recently an experimental drought monitor system in india has been developed shah and mishra 2015 to provide near real time drought information on daily basis at higher resolution 0 25 the authors applied vic to simulate necessary soil moisture and runoff and the simulated data is in good agreement with monthly streamflow for the ganges and the mahanadi basin shah and mishra 2016 employed vic to simulate evapotranspiration and surface water availability in the 18 indian subcontinental basins to understand the long term 1901 2012 changes in hydroclimatic variables monsoon season precipitation a key driver of changes in evapotranspiration and surface water availability was found to have declining trends after 1948 in most of the sub continental basins with significant decline in the ganges affecting the surface water availability in this region a study mishra et al 2010 employed vic together with urban land cover representation developed by yang et al 2010 that resulted in the significant impacts of land use land cover and climate change on water and energy budget at a regional level similarly chawla and mujumdar 2015 isolated the impacts of land use and climate on the streamflow in the upper ganga basin of india and found the higher sensitivity of simulated streamflow with changes in urban areas and varying precipitation though integrated impacts of land use and climate was substantial on vic simulated streamflow impacts of climate was found to be more dominant compared to land use in the region 2 3 data and model setup the required input data for the study were compiled from various sources daily gridded meteorological forcing maximum temperature minimum temperature and wind speed at a spatial resolution of 0 25 for the study period january 1979 to december 2006 were obtained from ecmwf era interim dee et al 2011 whereas daily gridded precipitation at similar temporal and spatial resolution was obtained from aphrodite yatagai et al 2012 the non meteorological inputs include elevation vegetation and soil information the elevation input was extracted from digital elevation model dem developed under shuttle radar topographic mission srtm at 90 m resolution jarvis et al 2008 the land use and land cover information were obtained from the university of maryland at 1 km resolution analyzed through the avhrr satellites hansen et al 2000 the global land cover classification glcc that includes 14 different land cover types including water was used the soil parameters were developed from harmonized world soil database hwsd this soil map represents 5000 soil type at two soil layers 0 30 cm and 30 100 cm the required input parameters for the vic model were developed using the methods available on its website http vic readthedocs io en master the model domain as in fig 1 resulted in a total of 1659 grids each of 0 25 resolution the meteorological and non meteorological information as discussed above were stored grid wise three soil layers with respective depths of 0 3 m top layer 0 3 m middle layer and 0 4 m bottom layer were considered in the study an interval of 500 m was chosen to create elevation bands to improve the performance of vic especially in complex terrains or mountainous regions as in nijssen et al 2001 which resulted in a total of 18 elevation bands inside the basin the model was simulated once the required model inputs were in order an independent routing model lohmann et al 1996 1998a b was used to determine the streamflow at three locations seti beni and trishuli on the himalayas in nepal and ankinghat in india as shown in fig 1 the model was evaluated through streamflow calibration at two stations seti beni and ankinghat and validation at all three locations the observed streamflow data at seti beni 1984 1992 and trishuli 1997 2001 required for calibration validation were obtained from the department of hydrology and meteorology of nepal http www dhm gov np access date 12 26 2016 similarly the historical streamflow records at ankinghat from 1984 to 1992 were obtained from central water commission of india http www cwc nic in access date 03 20 2017 daily soil moisture from 2002 to 2006 required for the validation of simulated soil moisture were obtained from european space agency climate change initiative combined liu et al 2012 wagner et al 2012 in addition the observed soil moisture data for the monsoon season at seven days interval were obtained from the india meteorological department imd these field measurements of soil moisture at imd station krl 2005 2006 and imd station klni 2005 were employed for the model validation 2 4 methodology fig 2 provides the overview of the methodology used in the present study first we perform a long term hydrological simulation of ganga basin for the period 1979 2006 and validate the model outputs the hydrologic model vic is validated based on observed streamflow and soil moisture data each at three locations the model performance measures used in this study are nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 r2 refined index of agreement dr willmott et al 2012 and root mean square errors rmse before validation the model was first calibrated to obtain the parameters of vic viz maximum baseflow dsmax fraction of dsmax ds variable infiltration curve parameter bi fraction of maximum soil moisture ws as discussed in nijssen et al 1997 till the satisfactory values of model performance measures were obtained for all the three streamflow stations the calibration is performed without considering irrigation that may result slightly different parameterization causing parameter uncertainties in the present study such parameter uncertainty is not considered and it is one of the limitations of our study the calibration and subsequent validation summary are shown in table 2 for understanding the convergence of error due to perturbation in the initial soil moisture condition we selected three contrasting years surplus normal and deficit years based on 1 standard deviation sd of the monsoon rainfall anomaly in the period 1979 2006 as per the imd definition years with rainfall anomalies less than 1 standard deviation and greater than 1 standard deviation are considered as deficit drought and surplus wet years respectively rest of the years are known as normal years we follow the same definition and apply to the spatial average of rainfall over the ganga basin we find the year 1988 to be surplus year 1997 to be normal year and 2002 to be deficit year as shown in supplementary fig s1 we perform the hydrological simulations each of duration 21 days initialized on every 5th day of the monsoon june through september jjas season for all three years table 1 the initial soil moisture condition for 25 such days in a season table 1 b is obtained from the long term hydrological simulations as shown in fig 2 the standard deviation sd of simulated soil moisture is obtained for these 25 days across all years 1979 2006 positive and negative perturbations of initial soil moisture conditions are applied with the perturbation value as 1 sd as for example when the model is initialized with 31st may 1988 the gridded simulated soil moisture of the same day from long term simulations is used as initial conditions for 31st may the sd of soil moisture for each grid from 1979 to 2006 is obtained the long term simulated value of 1 sd and the long term simulated value of 1 sd are considered as perturbed initial conditions for simulated and perturbed initial conditions the model is run for 3 times each for duration 21 days the entire process is performed for every 5th day of the season that makes total 225 days fig 2 we analyze the output for each of the simulations with perturbations the uncertainties in simulated hydrologic variables viz streamflow and soil moisture due to perturbations in initial conditions are estimated with the differences between simulated variables with perturbed and non perturbed initial conditions we analyze the error convergence and its propagation with time the time required for convergence uncertainty is less than 5 and its spatio temporal variability for entire ganga basin is obtained after validation 225 simulations are made each of 21 days duration over the entire ganga basin the uncertainty z in simulated soil moisture due to perturbation in the soil moisture initial condition is quantified as 1 z a c b where a c and b denotes the values of simulated hydrological variables from positively perturbed negatively perturbed and non perturbed initial conditions z is computed every day for each day of the 21 day period for each one of the simulations 3 results and discussions 3 1 evaluation of hydrologic model the simulated streamflow is in good agreement with the historical observations for all three stations as supported by the statistics of table 2 the comparison of observed and simulated streamflow at seti beni trishuli and ankinghat is shown in fig 3 a c the validation for soil moisture is represented in fig 3 d f fig 3 d represents the validation of simulated soil moisture at chhakarbandha across top 1 cm soil depth with observed information obtained from esa combined dataset that shows underestimation of soil moisture during dry period the simulated soil moisture at the top layer was compared with the 30 cm in situ soil moisture measurements from the indian meteorological department imd at 7 days interval during monsoon season as shown in fig 3 e and f we find a good match in the patterns of time series between observed and simulated soil moisture data the correlations are moderate r2 value in the order of 0 3 0 4 and this is expected as vic does not consider features of irrigation directly coupled with changes in ground water this is also partly attributed to the comparison of soil moisture at a point observed with the grid averaged simulated information these may be considered as some of the limitations of the study underestimation of soil moisture is generally consistent with underestimation of streamflow during dry periods for the stations seti beni and trishuli but not for the station ankinghat this is because of the location of ankinghat is in upstream regions which is less affected by human interference 3 2 impacts of perturbed initial soil moisture condition on simulated soil moisture the z values for the simulated soil moisture as discussed earlier are plotted in fig 4 for all three layers over ganga basin the abscissa shows the starting day of each of the simulations while y axis presents the day of simulation ranging from 1 to 21 the plot presents the z value spatial average over the entire case study area in terms of color and provide information about propagation of errors and time required for convergence as the model is initiated on every 5th day the abscissa contains the values 1st june 6th june and so on the last date in abscissa is september 29th for the simulation till october 19th the impacts of perturbations in the soil moisture due to initial conditions reduce with time which is expected rahman and lu 2015 the perturbations in initial condition which is based on climatological standard deviation from long term simulations is highest for top soil layer during onset of monsoon while for deeper soil the perturbations are more for mid peak monsoon supplementary fig s2 this attributes to the pattern of rainfall and infiltration in the ganga basin for example the onset of monsoon usually takes place during the end of june with low rainfall activity in the upper ganga causing the deeper soil layer to remain very dry without much variability after the onset of monsoon the deeper soil moisture starts getting affected by rainfall and subsequent infiltration with a prominent variability at temporal scale during peak monsoon moisture from high rainfall quickly infiltrates and results into high variability of soil moisture in the deeper layers from our simulations we find that the top soil layer has the early convergence in soil moisture as compared to middle and bottom soil layer this is associated with low variability of top soil layer the bottom layer has maximum variability as shown in terms of standard deviation of soil moisture in supplementary fig s2 in its moisture during peak monsoon and takes maximum time to converge given perturbation in the initial condition the time required for convergence is highest during drought year followed by normal and wet years the minimum time required for the convergence is 2 days and maximum time is greater than 21 days non converged for the entire basin for all the years these minimum and maximum values remain same for drought and wet years due to the seasonal pattern of monsoon however number of periods with high low convergences are different across years the wet years have more number of periods with quick convergence in the simulated soil moisture our results are also in agreement with rahman et al 2015 and rahman and lu 2015 that shows lower aridity results into quick convergence in simulated soil moisture with the requirement of low duration for spin up runs high rainfall in wet years erases the soil moisture memory easily resulting minimum sensitivity to initial condition good rainfall spells within a season with transformation from dry to wet state also clears the soil moisture memory rahman et al 2015 for all the years we find slow convergence only for the top soil layer during the onset of monsoon i e the first half of june when the rainfall is quite low this is consistent with our finding that high rainfall erases the soil moisture memory quickly during the withdrawal of monsoon end of september we find quick convergence though the amount of rainfall is less during the same time this is probably due to high moisture content in soil resulting from the recharge during the entire four months of monsoon period it is interesting to note that during drought year the convergence takes little more time even during the withdrawal time as compared to other years this is due to low recharge of soil moisture in the deficit monsoon year this is further explained with the rainfall time series plot for all the three years fig s3 in the supplemental material interestingly in the first week of june 2002 the rainfall was better than the other two years over the basin and hence the z value of the top layer soil moisture was slightly lower compared to the other two years as in fig 4 a d and g being a deficit year year 2002 has low rainfall throughout the season especially after the first half of june and that resulted into higher z values year 1988 has good rainfall during the entire season except september and hence the z value was also high in september we further analyze the results separately for the four regions in ganga basin north west ganga and nepal upper ganga middle ganga and lower ganga they are presented in figs 5 8 respectively we present the impacts of inter annual variations of monsoon rainfall on the z values for north west ganga and nepal region in fig 5 the average and wet years have a lower z value for soil moisture signifying a quick convergence of the perturbed values of initial soil moisture with frequent good rain spells during the drought year of 2002 the z value was quite high for this region except august when there had been a good spell of rainfall the plots in figs 5 8 bottom row of all show differences in perturbations in initial conditions in different regions for deeper soil layers this attributes to the spatial variations of climatological standard deviation of soil moisture for those layers as obtained from long term simulations while averaging the perturbations are only prominent during peak monsoon for deeper layer when entire ganga basin is considered fig 4 for the upper ganga region the z value is consistently higher as compared to the other three regions of ganga basin fig 6 this is because upper ganga region receives the lowest rainfall and hence the memory of soil moisture exists for longer period with the existence of propagated errors in the initial conditions we find a clear lag in the z values in bottom layers as compared to top layer and that propagates from top to middle to bottom soil layer this attributes to lower perturbation associated with lower standard deviation of soil moisture in the deeper layers during the onset supplementary fig s2 as expected the bottom soil layer has the highest z value and with such a high value it is almost impossible to get the errors convergence within 21 days of simulations even in good monsoon years however good spell of rain may reduce the z value in top soil layer in the upper ganga basin the middle ganga basin receives higher rainfall as compared to upper ganga basin and the z value is also comparatively low fig 7 rest of the characteristics is almost similar to that of the upper ganga basin such as prominent lead lag relationship between z values of top middle and bottom layers the lower ganga basin receives the highest rainfall during monsoon season among all the four regions considered and hence have the lowest z value fig 8 as this region receives good rainfall even in a deficit year as shown in fig 9 the interannual variations of z values are not so prominent in this region with a possibility of quick convergence across all the years the lag structure in z value for different layers exists in this region but it is not so prominent like the other regions the sub regions of ganga basin have significant variability across them in terms of the profiles of convergence of soil moisture as seen in figs 5 8 this is primarily due to spatial variability of rainfall across the basins with subsequent infiltration patterns this points to an important recommendation of not considering a large basin as a whole as for example here we find that the results from fig 4 spatial average for ganga is entirely different from that shown in fig 5 nepal and northwest ganga hence considering the average of ganga basin as a representation of northwest ganga may not be adequate and this shows the importance of regional hydrologic simulation with a fine spatial resolution we further analyze the convergence of non perturbed positively perturbed and negatively perturbed initial condition simulations with the plotting of time series the selection of the simulation is made arbitrarily and here we select the simulation with 20th july initial condition during peak monsoon the results for top soil layer for all the four regions are presented in fig 10 the precipitation anomalies are presented to understand the impacts of rainfall spells in soil moisture profiles we observe that the soil moisture profiles and the convergence of errors are dependent on the precipitation events we find a very quick convergence of simulated soil moisture from all the three simulations immediately after a good rain spell this is visible and prominent for all the regions north ganga upper ganga middle ganga and lower ganga this emphasizes the role of precipitation in dissipating the effects of drier initial conditions over the basin which is in accordance with the study made by seck et al 2015 the middle soil layer also shows supplementary fig s4 convergence after a good rainfall spell but the rate of convergence is slower as compared to top layer the bottom layer does not show convergence within 21 days for any of the regions even after a good spell of rainfall supplementary fig s5 our findings of the lower spin up process in deeper soil layer is in accordance with the past study done by cosgrove et al 2003 we further compute the number of days required for convergence in the simulated soil moisture with non perturbed and perturbed initial conditions if a b and c denote the simulated soil moisture in the top layer with positively perturbed non perturbed and negatively perturbed initial soil moisture condition we consider convergence when 2 a 1 025 b 3 c 0 975 b we find the number of days required for the convergence for each grid and compute the median values of these convergence days along with the first seven days of total precipitation in a separate axis across all grids for all the three years separately as presented in fig 11 as in fig 11 the number of days required for convergence of initial perturbations in soil moisture in the ganga basin is higher during the initial days of monsoon across all the years this indicates that the dry state of the basin cannot erase the soil moisture memory and hence convergence in getting delayed this indicates the necessity for correct initialization of land surface states so that the errors do not propagate for longer time however with time after few good rainfall spells the number of days required for convergence drops this drop is little delayed in the deficit year of 2002 due to lack of good rainfall during the peak monsoon time of july and first half of august the number of days required for convergence is minimum and is within 5 10 days during the end of monsoon the number of days required for convergence of simulated soil moisture increases and shows similar condition as starting of monsoon we further plot fig 12 the same for the different regions of ganga basin as considered in this study we find similar results with highest number of days required for convergence for drought year followed by normal and wet years however there is spatial variability as for example the dry upper ganga region needs highest number of days for convergence and with distinctly different patterns for wet normal and dry years however for lower ganga basin they are not different across years this attributes to good rainfall over the region for all the years these results are in agreement with the existing knowledge seck et al 2015 rahman and lu 2015 cosgrove et al 2003 that dry regions converge slower compared to wet regions the results have significant implications for real time extended range hydro meteorological forecasts this suggests that an inclusion of wet spell in the spin up runs reduces the convergence time in forecasts in the absence of real time soil moisture monitoring framework and may provide some guidelines towards the estimation of the length of spin up requirements specifically for the poorly gauged river basin such as ganga however the spin up time should not be very small even after inclusion of wet period as that may produce unrealistic simulations 3 3 impacts of perturbed initial soil moisture condition on simulated streamflow in order to understand the impacts of initial soil moisture conditions on streamflow we compute z s as a measure of uncertainty given by 4 z s a s c s where as and cs being the streamflow simulated with positively and negatively perturbed initial soil moisture respectively we avoided scaling of streamflow values as absolute magnitudes are important for the same variable fig 13 presents the spread in terms of zs for the streamflow at the three stations seti beni trishuli and ankinghat as shown in fig 1 we find that the sensitivity of streamflow to the perturbation in initial soil moisture is different from soil moisture the perturbations in soil moisture take some time to be reflected in the streamflow with a sudden increase in the spread zs during the initial period of monsoon streamflow remains very low and hence their impacts are not visible during the mid monsoon season with high rainfall amount streamflow increases with the increase in zs value this also shows the need of soil moisture monitoring for a better forecast of flood during the peak monsoon time of july and august during the drought year the station ankinghat does not show any spread and this is associated with very low rainfall and resulting low streamflow we find that though good rainfall spell erases the soil moisture memory it gets reflected in the streamflow simulations as streamflow is higher during good rainfall spells we speculate that inclusion of a good rainfall spell during the spin up period may work well for real time extended range streamflow forecasting as depicted in fig 13 the errors in initial soil moisture greatly influences streamflow forecasts initially with increasing days the difference between as and cs increased but after that it got reduced this is probably due to the convergence of soil moisture after the first good spell this further shows the possibility that inclusion of an observed good spell in the spin up runs can help in the prediction of the next extremes by reducing the convergence time to understand this further we present the uncertainty in simulated streamflow of trishuli fig 14 due to perturbation of initial soil moisture we considered 3 time slices of simulations of length 21 days starting with june 1 august 5 and september 29 initial conditions for all three years for the simulations starting with august 5 initial conditions for years 1997 and 2002 we find converged streamflow values in the second peak this clearly shows that due to the first good rainfall spell corresponding to the first peak the soil moisture has converged resulting in converged streamflow values during the second peak this shows the need of considering at least one good spell in the spin up run for simulating hydrologic variables in real time 4 conclusion this paper investigated the impacts of the perturbed initial soil moisture conditions on hydrologic simulations in a semi distributed hydrologic model for the ganga basin in south asia three initial soil moisture conditions one unperturbed and two perturbed by 1 standard deviation sd were generated via long term sd of soil moisture and were initialized for three weeks simulations in monsoon season in three contrasting years further the effects of the perturbation in initial soil moisture were observed on streamflow at three stations the major findings of the study are 1 the errors in simulated top layer soil moisture in all three years propagated slowly during the onset of monsoon when the soil was relatively dry in all the regions within the ganga basin the convergence of errors in the simulated soil moisture was impeded by the dryness of soil that lasted as long as first three weeks this phenomenon showed the strong dependence of succeeding soil moisture in the initial soil moisture states however with good rainfall spells the errors in soil moisture were quickly minimized downsizing the sensitivity on initial soil moisture condition the role of precipitation in erasing the soil moisture memory resulted in earlier convergence of errors in year with higher rainfall wet year had early convergence followed by normal and drought year 2 the errors developed in simulated soil moisture through perturbation of initial soil moisture possessed the spatial variability within the regions of ganga basin however the role of precipitation events in minimizing the sensitivity of initial soil moisture is well observed in these sub regions upper ganga with the least rainfall received in all years considered in this study had prolonged soil moisture memory resulting higher convergence time while lower ganga with high rainfall even in drought year took the least time to converge the errors north ganga and middle ganga with almost similar monsoon rainfall within wet normal and deficit year had convergence period proportionate to the rainfall spells interestingly in all three years within ganga the top soil layer showed greater sensitivity to the changes in soil moisture and precipitation events while the deeper soil layers with slower spin up process showed little or none response even to good rainfall spells 3 the convergence of errors in streamflow takes longer time as compared to that of soil moisture while the errors in soil moisture converged mostly within the first rainfall peak the errors in streamflow converged after the first peak indicating the delayed response against the same perturbation 4 for real time hydrologic simulation it is important and recommended to include at least one good rainfall spell in the spin up process which aids in proper convergence of errors in both simulated soil moisture and streamflow via reducing the dependency on the initial soil moisture conditions 5 the model has a dry bias in terms of soil moisture specifically during dry period and it takes longer time to get rid of the errors in initial condition during dry period hence there is a good chance of non convergence of errors after a break period and this needs to be considered carefully in operational hydro meteorological forecasting at extended range however the present analysis does not provide a specific guideline of model spin up this may be considered as the potential area of future research extension 6 we find significant variability in the soil moisture convergence profiles across different regions of ganga basin hence just representing the spatial average of hydrologic characteristics may not be adequate for a larger basin and this needs to be seriously considered with fine resolution region specific hydrologic models acknowledgements the authors sincerely thank the editor

7291,evapotranspiration et estimation is of great importance due to its key role in water resource management surface energy modeling tools such as surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration metric and the surface energy balance system sebs can estimate the amount of evapotranspiration for every pixel of the satellite images the main objective of this research is evaporation investigation from the freshwater bodies using sebal metric and sebs for this purpose the amirkabir dam reservoir and its nearby agricultural lands in a semi arid climate were selected and studied from 2011 to 2017 as the study area the implementations of this study were accomplished on 16 satellite images of landsat tm5 and oli then sebal metric and sebs were implemented on the selected images moreover the corresponding pan evaporate measurements on the reservoir bank were considered as the ground truth data regarding to the results sebal is not a reliable method to evaluate freshwater evaporation with the coefficient of determination r2 of 0 36 and the root mean square error rmse of 5 1 mm on the other hand metric with rmse and r2 of 0 57 and 2 02 mm and sebs with rmse and r2 of 0 93 and 0 62 demonstrated a relatively good performance keywords energy balance equation evaporation estimation evapotranspiration freshwater remote sensing 1 introduction various methods have been developed to estimate evapotranspiration by meteorological data in different environmental conditions and land covers these methods mostly use local stationary data to evaluate evapotranspiration which makes them suitable only at local scale bastiaanssen et al 1998a furthermore regarding to the dynamic nature and regional changes in evapotranspiration these methods cannot be generalized to the larger areas seemann et al 2003 in recent decades with developments in satellite sensors and remote sensing methods using their images attracts a great attention for estimation of evapotranspiration bastiaanssen et al 1998b jana et al 2016 one can estimate evapotranspiration using satellite images with no regards to soil condition crop and farm management bastiaanssen et al 2005 using these images the spatial distribution of required factors and their changes are provided in two or more sequential images allen et al 2002 among the remote sensing algorithms of evapotranspiration estimation surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998a mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution and with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2005 and surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 are the most frequently used methods sebal was initially introduced by bastiaanssen et al 1998a to estimate evapotranspiration from the vegetated surfaces then it was modified by allen et al 2002 to make it usable for other land conditions sebal was implemented in various environmental regions using different satellite images with acceptable performance national water commission of australia represented the annual evaporation of wetherell and pamamaroo lakes in their annual report using sebal pan evaporate and water balance results showed that remote sensing methods are reliable especially in remote places where terrestrial data is not available nationalwatercommission 2009 sima et al 2013 developed a distributed model to estimate the evaporation of urmia saline lake using sebal method and remote sensing data it was accomplished by considering salinity effects and spatial distribution of variables yang et al 2015 estimated actual evapotranspiration of corn farms summer and wheat farms winter in hwang hwai hai plain in china using sebal local analysis showed a linear relationship between actual evaporation normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and land surface temperature lst jana et al 2016 used landsat 5 images to calculate evapotranspiration of doon valley in india using sebal the results showed the variability of et in at the regional scale and unreliability of point in situ measurements of et in the relatively vast areas genanu et al 2017 calculated actual evapotranspiration for sugarcane farms in wonji using sebal the simplified surface energy balance sseb and the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop regarding this research estimated evapotranspiration of well watered sugarcane farms in plant growth season was higher than terrestrial measurements metric algorithm is an image processing tool to calculate evapotranspiration based on the energy budget balance on the land surface this algorithm is an important derivative from sebal metric was initially developed by allen et al 2005 and extended by allen et al 2007 allen et al 2005 allpied metric algorithm in idaho and compared it with lysimeter measurements they obtained 4 and 1 error in evapotranspiration for lawn and sugar beet in plant growth season respectively trezza 2006 investigated and compared sebal and metric at a field in venezuela he found out that both models were able to estimate evapotranspiration with an acceptable precision however metric overestimated sebal as 7 in this study and sebal had better results folhes et al 2009 calculated actual evapotranspiration of farm lands at the north east of brazil using metric and landsat images they compared the acquired et from metric with observations from eddy correlation ec method this study demonstrated that metric is a good tool for water resource management in semi arid regions of north east of brazil trezza et al 2013 implemented metric in new mexico using images from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and landsat the main challenge for this study was the calibration of metric to utilize modis images well calibrated metric model with modis as well as landsat images showed reliable monthly and annually et estimation morton et al 2013 used metric in the water budget estimation of nevada according to the results uncertainty for regions with less evapotranspiration was higher and vice versa french et al 2015 implemented two source energy balance t seb and metric in arizona using landsat to estimate et both models showed similar results with a daily difference of 1 9 mm for plant growth season estimated evapotranspiration amounts for two models were between 5 77 mm and 10 75 mm per day sebs was introduced by su 2002 to estimate daily monthly and annual evapotranspiration in a semi arid environment and for drought monitoring chinyepe 2010 modified sebs for evaporation of mutirikwi lake in zimbabwe he used modis terra images and compared the results with pan evaporate measurements he concluded that sebs results were slightly higher than pan evaporate measurements but it was negligible moreover sebs was proved as a reliable method to estimate evaporation in large scales abdelrady 2013 modified sebs to estimate evaporation from fresh and saline waters using aatsr envisat images the coefficient of determination r2 for freshwater and saline water evaporation was acquired as 0 98 and 0 88 respectively abdelrady 2013 zhuo et al 2014 calculated distribution of actual and potential evapotranspiration on the land surface in tibet using sebs andpenman monteith equation regarding to this investigation both actual and potential evaporations were changed with the same distribution from the south east to the north west of the study area comparing the results of sebs with penman monteith equation confirmed the efficiency of sebs however there were variations in regions with highly dense vegetation such as forests elhag 2016 employed sebs to estimate evapotranspiration for nile delta using weather stations data and satellite remote sensing data analysis of the result along with evapotranspiration maps confirmed the efficiency of sebs for farm lands on the other hand some short fallings were reported for sebs such as using fractional vegetation cover to estimate the ground heat flux and saturating this parameter rapidly with increasing lai and consequently underestimating soil heat flux timmermans et al 2013 moreover poor performance of the sebs for complex surfaces is another disadvantage ma et al 2015 regarding the previous studies different algorithms of evapotranspiration estimation using satellite images have different performance in various environmental condition and land covers moreover enough studies have not been accomplished about the efficiency of remote sensing based evapotranspiration algorithms in freshwater lakes then the main aim of this research is investigating the efficiency of sebal metric and sebs to estimate evaporation from freshwater lakes in this regard amirkabir karaj dam reservoir in iran was chosen as the study area and the results of these three algorithms were compared with pan evaporate measurements 2 material and methods 2 1 the study area the selected study area of this research is a part of tehran and

regional water authority http www thrw ir 2 2 data 2 2 1 ground station data various terrestrial data was used in this research 16 ground station evaporation measurements by karaj pan evaporate station were used to evaluate the selected satellite evapotranspiration models corresponding dates of table 1 pan evaporate measurements were obtained by tehran regional water authority the pan evaporate measurements estimate potential et pet in a point of ground station the pan evaporate measurements were performed using volumetric method and measurements were accomplished twice a day at 6

remote sensing evapotranspiration models furthermore temperature dew point temperature and wind speed of corresponding dates were gathered from iran meteorological organization 2 2 2 satellite images in this research 16 images from tm and oli sensors on board landsat satellites were utilized table 1 in the selection of the images it was tried to use images with no uncommon environmental phenomenon such as clouds clear sky condition aerosols and dust satellite images were prepared from earth explorer website www earthexplorer usgs gov 2 3 methodology sebal sebs and metric algorithms are based on energy balance on the surface of the earth in these models actual evapotranspiration is calculated using satellite images satellite sensors measure electromagnetic radiation from the surface of the earth at the overpassing time of the satellite thus calculations are performed for the overpassing moment and then are converted to daily amounts 2 3 1 sebal methodology sebal uses energy balance equation to calculate instantaneous latent heat flux of evaporation as the residue of eq 1 bastiaanssen et al 1998a then instantaneous and daily evaporation and transpiration are calculated for each pixel of the image 1 λ et inst r n g h where λ et inst is latent heat flux of evaporation at imaging time w m2 rn is net radiation flux at the surface w m2 g is soil and water flux heat w m2 and h is sensible heat flux to the air the components of the equation are described in details below net radiation flux rn shows the actual available radiation at the surface waters et al 2002 which is calculated as 2 r n 1 α r s r l 1 ε 0 r l where α is surface albedo ε 0 is surface thermal emissivity in broad thermal spectrum r s is incoming downward shortwave radiation r l is downward longwave radiation and r l is outgoing upward longwave radiation to calculate rn it is necessary to apply radiometric corrections on images and image bands are converted to radiance and reflectance regarding to their wavelengths these corrections can be accomplished by gain and offset data available in the header file of the manuscript allen et al 2002 bastiaanssen et al 1998a bastiaanssen et al 2005 incoming shortwave radiation is obtained from equation below 3 r s g sc cos θ dr τ sw where g sc is solar constant of 1367 w m2 θ is solar incidence angle and dr is inverse squared relative distance between sun and earth τ sw is atmospheric transmissivity which can be calculated by an empirical equation as pereira et al 2015 4 τ sw 0 75 2 10 5 z where z is the height above mean sea level m outgoing longwave r l is obtained from eq 5 5 r l ε 0 σ t s 4 where σ is boltzmann constant as 5 67 10 8 and t s is surface temperature k surface emissivity is the ratio of the thermal radiation from a surface to the radiation from an ideal black body surface at the same temperature emissivity can be calculated based on empirical equations of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi rouse et al 1974 and leaf area index lai lai can be calculated using an empirical equation of soil adjusted vegetation index savi allen et al 2002 as 6 lai ln 0 69 savi 0 59 0 91 savi is adjusted for soil effects which eliminates its effect on the reflectance of surface in the arid areas and thus decreases soil moisture impacts at this index results allen et al 2002 finally two required emissivity values of sebal including surface thermal emissivity ε 0 and narrow band emissivity from thermal bands ε nb are obtained from the following empirical equations according to lai and ndvi as introduced by allen et al 2002 surface temperature from thermal band is calculated using planck s black body equation eq 7 7 t s k 2 ln ε nb k 1 r c 1 where r c is the corrected thermal radiance from the surface w m 2 sr μ m and k1 and k2 are constant values for selected images incoming longwave radiation is calculated as 8 r l ε a σ t a 4 where ε a is atmospheric emissivity and t a is the near surface air temperature k soil and water heat flux g is the rate of heat storage in the soil plant and water in heat transfer it is not possible to calculate this factor by remote sensing methods then it can be calculated by the relation between g r n ndvi t s and albedo bastiaanssen 2000 9 g r n t s α 0 0038 α 0 0074 α 2 1 0 98 ndvi 4 where the surface temperature is in c for water bodies the heat flux is calculated by amayreh equations from january to june as below amayreh 1995 10 g 0 9 r n 40 and from july to december as 11 g r n 90 sensible heat flux h is transferred heat by convection to the air due to temperature difference and is obtained from eq 12 12 h ρ c p dt r ah where ρ is air density c p is specific heat capacity of air which equals to 1004 j kg 1 k 1 dt is temperature difference from height z1 to z2 k and r ah is aerodynamic resistivity for heat transfer due to existence of two unknown variable of dt and r ah in the equation acquiring sensible heat flux is complicated thus in this algorithm two anchor pixels are determined cold pixel and hot pixel and then variables dt and r ah are calculated by using a trial and error method in an iterative process in this process frictional velocity and aerodynamic resistance measured at nearby weather station of the study area are utilized in the loop as initial values afterwards variables dt and r ah are calculated in the first loop and then current values are implemented in the loop as new initial values and variables are updated in every loop this loop continues until the variables converge to a constant value and finally acquired sensible heat flux of the last iteration is considered as the selected value instantaneous evapotranspiration for the satellite at the overpass time is calculated using eq 1 and 13 13 et inst 3600 λ et λ where et inst is instantaneous evapotranspiration mm h 3600 is time conversion from second to hour λ et is evaporation latent heat flux and λ is evaporation latent heat etrf constant is obtained using instantaneous evapotranspiration as 14 etrf et inst et r where et r is reference evapotranspiration this variable can be calculated by some softwares such as ref et this software is developed in university of idaho for reference crop evapotranspiration allen 2000 the advantage of this software is that user is able to choose various methods such penman monteith priestley taylor and pan evaporate and etc to calculate evaporation and transpiration penman monteith method is used in this study at the end daily evapotranspiration is calculated by 15 et 24 etrf et r 24 where et r 24 is a summation of et r values of each day 2 3 2 metric methodology metric algorithm uses the similar way as sebal to calculate evapotranspiration in both models sensible heat flux is calculated from linear relation between near surface air temperature and land surface temperature and using two cold and hot pixels but they are different in calculation of two other fluxes which is described below mertic equations to calculate net radiation flux are as same as sebal except in one equation unlike sebal which calculates atmospheric transmissivity using height above mean sea level metric uses air pressure and water content of the atmosphere to calculates τ sw as 16 τ sw 0 35 0 627 exp 0 00146 p k t cos θ hor 0 75 w cos θ hor 0 4 where p is atmospheric pressure kpa w is water of the atmosphere mm and θ hor is solar zenith angle k t is dimensionless turbidity coefficient of the atmosphere which can changes between 0 and 1 1 for clean air and 0 5 for turbid air furthermore atmospheric pressure kpa is obtained from eq 17 17 p 101 3 293 0 0065 z 293 5 26 where z is the height above mean sea surface water vapor in atmosphere w can be calculated as mm 18 w 0 14 e a p air 2 1 where e a is vapor pressure close to earth surface kpa and p air is air pressure kpa metric employed eq 9 to calculate soil heat transfer flux at the beginning but in current research an equation developed by tasumi 2003 is sued for lai 0 5 19 g r n 0 05 0 18 e 0 521 lai and for lai 0 5 20 g r n 1 80 t s 273 15 r n 0 084 sensible heat transfer is calculated by multiplication of rn in acquired g r n these equations are mostly used in agricultural lands and have acceptable results however they do not have reasonable results for regions with water or snow for metric applications in usa for regions with water and snow acceptable results are achieved by applying g r n 0 5 which it is applied in this research as well 2 3 3 sebs methodology sebs uses energy equilibrium equation to calculate instantaneous latent heat flux of evaporation eq 1 since there are common parts between two sebal and sebs methods only different parts of sebs are explained in this section net radiation flux rn is calculated similar to sebal with a slight change in lai equation lai in sebs is calculated from choudhury 1987 equation as 21 lai log 1 f c λ where fc is fractional canopy coverage and λ is leaf angle distribution function which is obtained according to the vegetation cover of the study area fractional canopy coverage fc is obtained from eq 22 22 f c 1 ndvi max ndvi ndvi max ndvi min 0 625 where ndvimax and ndvimin are the maximum and the minimum of ndvi respectively in this research soil heat flux g is calculated from two equations for soil and water for non aquatic zones su 2002 equation is used 23 g r n γ c 1 f c γ s γ c where γ c is ratio of soil heat flux to net radiation which is equal to 0 05 for complete vegetated areas γ s is ratio of soil heat flux to net radiation which is equal

is the number of observations x i is measured value and y i is predicted value 3 results and discussion 3 1 daily evaporation initially selected images were converted to radiance or reflectance values according to represented data in header file of images then daily evaporation values were calculated using sebal metric and sebs for the selected dates evaporations of two pixels in amirkabir reservoir were considered including one within and one outside of water body near the pan evaporate location table 2 to perform more precise evaluations as it can be seen from the results and regarding the measured values by pan evaporate sebal has closer results to pan evaporate measurements outside dam reservoir comparing with within values moreover the sebs model has more accurate estimations inside the reservoir than the reservoir bank on the other hand the metric model estimates the et in the bank near the pan evaporate measurement for instance fig 2 shows daily evapotranspiration of the selected image of 9 7 2011 as can be seen in this figure areas with vegetation cover such as western and north eastern parts of the image have more evapotranspiration comparing urban areas in the eastern parts and areas without vegetation in the southern parts of the image fig 2 shows that evapotranspiration in vegetated areas is higher than non vegetated areas in all three models this difference can be due to simultaneous evapotranspiration of soil and vegetation cover in vegetated lands while other areas are without transpiration and only evaporation occurs fig 3 shows masked and zoomed image of the daily evaporation of amirkabir dam reservoir as it can be seen evaporation is not the same in the whole surface of the dam lake investigating the results it was found that albedo is changing at the lake surface and this difference in determining the amount of flux intake and its storage was effective on the other hand the depth of the lake in all areas was not the same and the depth was increased with moving toward the center of the dam lake this issue results in the increasing the thermal capacity and consequently the evaporation changes from the surface another factor affecting the evaporation amount is the wind function wind currents caused to the displacement of water vapor and changing the evaporation process in different locations whole of these factors together in a fixed location determine the evaporation rate from each point which requires a closer investigation of each of these factors overall as pan evaporate measurements estimate potential et pet and remote sensing methods estimate actual et aet then each environmental parameter which is effective in converting pet to aet can change the distribution of et over the dam lake table 3 shows r2 and rmse values between acquired evaporation values of pan evaporate and three selected models in the chosen dates for sebal r2 values for selected points in reservoir bank and inside the reservoir were 0 9 and 0 52 respectively thus sebal was more efficient in estimating evaporation of land comparing with water metric has better results comparing with sebal in selected reservoir point and its evaluated values were closer to measured values it also can be seen from fewer fluctuations between evaluations and measured values from coefficient of determination r2 generally metric model had r2 of 0 79 for evaluated values and measured values on reservoir bank point and 0 57 in reservoir point hence it shows acceptable results for just land areas one reason for the differences of results between sebal and metric is their difference in calculating transmissivity coefficient and soil heat flux in addition sebs and sebal have different ways to calculate soil heat flux and sensible heat flux thus they have different results according to table 3 and fig 2 sebs was the most efficient method for estimation of evaporation from the water surface however there were considerable differences between evaluated values of sebs in bank of reservoir point and pan evaporate values which clearly can be inferred from r2 coefficient of determination for evaluated values and pan evaporate on reservoir bank was 0 36 while for water surface it was 0 93 which showed high correlation for water bodies according to table 3 the minimum rmse for evaluated values of the reservoir was acquired by sebs 0 62 mm which had the highest coefficient of determination 0 93 with measured values of pan evaporate sebal results showed the rmse of 0 82 mm and r2 of 0 85 for reservoir bank point although it was more accurate than other two models it is not efficient for the inside point of the reservoir metric has a relative efficiency in reservoir bank with relatively high r2 value of 0 79 to evaluate daily evaporation from whole of the lake surface acquired evaporation values from three selected models for pixels of amirkabir lake surface were integrated table 4 shows daily evaporation of amirkabir lake for chosen dates according to table 4 metric and sebs estimated considerably higher values comparing with sebal in metric model the highest estimated evaporation was for may and august 2011 with a slight difference and lowest estimated evaporation corresponded to august 2016 regarding the climate and weather condition of study area results were reasonable furthermore evaluated values by sebs have great differences with evaluated values of sebal but not as much as metric in general it can be concluded that sebal and metric were not efficient for water bodies but sebs was highly correlated and were efficient to evaluate evaporation from water bodies 4 conclusion evaporation from freshwater lakes surface is a reason for wasting these valuable water resources in the last decades remote sensing based evapotranspiration models have attracted attentions however it is necessary to investigate precision and efficiency of these models especially in freshwater bodies then the main objective of this research was to investigate the performance of sebal metric and sebs in estimating evaporation from a freshwater body amirkabir lake using landsat satellite images in this regard 16 landsat images were selected and these three algorithms were implemented acquired results were investigated for two points including one point in the bank of the reservoir lake and close to measuring station and the other one in the reservoir then the obtained results were compared with pan evaporate measurements in the study area according to the results sebs showed the highest correlation 0 93 and the lowest rmse 0 62 mm with pan evaporate in the reservoir but it did not have good results for the bank moreover metric results were relatively acceptable in the reservoir with a relatively high value of the determination coefficient 0 57 on the average for the chosen point of the reservoir rmse for metric and sebal were 2 02 mm and 5 1 mm respectively thus sebal was not precise enough for water bodies generally metric and sebs are appropriate models to evaluate evaporation from the selected freshwater surface due to their higher correlations then the results showed the efficiency of sebs to evaluate these two parameters furthermore evaporations from different areas of surface of the lake were not the same this shows that it is not proper to extrapolate station point measurements to the whole surface of the lakes this is one of the advantages of algorithms which use satellite images moreover the maximum daily evaporation value evaluated with the sebs for the whole of the amirkabir lake the most precise model was acquired as 38 85 mm at 9th of july 2011 this amount of evaporation from the amirkabir lake surface is considerable and it is necessary to consider a plan to prevent this amount of wasting freshwater due to evaporation these results can be used in water resource management studies to present more precise information about evaporation from freshwater resources this research showed that models which use satellite images are efficient to study evaporation from freshwater resources furthermore these models can be used in areas which there are not enough available data from measurements of the stations 
7291,evapotranspiration et estimation is of great importance due to its key role in water resource management surface energy modeling tools such as surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration metric and the surface energy balance system sebs can estimate the amount of evapotranspiration for every pixel of the satellite images the main objective of this research is evaporation investigation from the freshwater bodies using sebal metric and sebs for this purpose the amirkabir dam reservoir and its nearby agricultural lands in a semi arid climate were selected and studied from 2011 to 2017 as the study area the implementations of this study were accomplished on 16 satellite images of landsat tm5 and oli then sebal metric and sebs were implemented on the selected images moreover the corresponding pan evaporate measurements on the reservoir bank were considered as the ground truth data regarding to the results sebal is not a reliable method to evaluate freshwater evaporation with the coefficient of determination r2 of 0 36 and the root mean square error rmse of 5 1 mm on the other hand metric with rmse and r2 of 0 57 and 2 02 mm and sebs with rmse and r2 of 0 93 and 0 62 demonstrated a relatively good performance keywords energy balance equation evaporation estimation evapotranspiration freshwater remote sensing 1 introduction various methods have been developed to estimate evapotranspiration by meteorological data in different environmental conditions and land covers these methods mostly use local stationary data to evaluate evapotranspiration which makes them suitable only at local scale bastiaanssen et al 1998a furthermore regarding to the dynamic nature and regional changes in evapotranspiration these methods cannot be generalized to the larger areas seemann et al 2003 in recent decades with developments in satellite sensors and remote sensing methods using their images attracts a great attention for estimation of evapotranspiration bastiaanssen et al 1998b jana et al 2016 one can estimate evapotranspiration using satellite images with no regards to soil condition crop and farm management bastiaanssen et al 2005 using these images the spatial distribution of required factors and their changes are provided in two or more sequential images allen et al 2002 among the remote sensing algorithms of evapotranspiration estimation surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998a mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution and with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2005 and surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 are the most frequently used methods sebal was initially introduced by bastiaanssen et al 1998a to estimate evapotranspiration from the vegetated surfaces then it was modified by allen et al 2002 to make it usable for other land conditions sebal was implemented in various environmental regions using different satellite images with acceptable performance national water commission of australia represented the annual evaporation of wetherell and pamamaroo lakes in their annual report using sebal pan evaporate and water balance results showed that remote sensing methods are reliable especially in remote places where terrestrial data is not available nationalwatercommission 2009 sima et al 2013 developed a distributed model to estimate the evaporation of urmia saline lake using sebal method and remote sensing data it was accomplished by considering salinity effects and spatial distribution of variables yang et al 2015 estimated actual evapotranspiration of corn farms summer and wheat farms winter in hwang hwai hai plain in china using sebal local analysis showed a linear relationship between actual evaporation normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and land surface temperature lst jana et al 2016 used landsat 5 images to calculate evapotranspiration of doon valley in india using sebal the results showed the variability of et in at the regional scale and unreliability of point in situ measurements of et in the relatively vast areas genanu et al 2017 calculated actual evapotranspiration for sugarcane farms in wonji using sebal the simplified surface energy balance sseb and the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop regarding this research estimated evapotranspiration of well watered sugarcane farms in plant growth season was higher than terrestrial measurements metric algorithm is an image processing tool to calculate evapotranspiration based on the energy budget balance on the land surface this algorithm is an important derivative from sebal metric was initially developed by allen et al 2005 and extended by allen et al 2007 allen et al 2005 allpied metric algorithm in idaho and compared it with lysimeter measurements they obtained 4 and 1 error in evapotranspiration for lawn and sugar beet in plant growth season respectively trezza 2006 investigated and compared sebal and metric at a field in venezuela he found out that both models were able to estimate evapotranspiration with an acceptable precision however metric overestimated sebal as 7 in this study and sebal had better results folhes et al 2009 calculated actual evapotranspiration of farm lands at the north east of brazil using metric and landsat images they compared the acquired et from metric with observations from eddy correlation ec method this study demonstrated that metric is a good tool for water resource management in semi arid regions of north east of brazil trezza et al 2013 implemented metric in new mexico using images from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and landsat the main challenge for this study was the calibration of metric to utilize modis images well calibrated metric model with modis as well as landsat images showed reliable monthly and annually et estimation morton et al 2013 used metric in the water budget estimation of nevada according to the results uncertainty for regions with less evapotranspiration was higher and vice versa french et al 2015 implemented two source energy balance t seb and metric in arizona using landsat to estimate et both models showed similar results with a daily difference of 1 9 mm for plant growth season estimated evapotranspiration amounts for two models were between 5 77 mm and 10 75 mm per day sebs was introduced by su 2002 to estimate daily monthly and annual evapotranspiration in a semi arid environment and for drought monitoring chinyepe 2010 modified sebs for evaporation of mutirikwi lake in zimbabwe he used modis terra images and compared the results with pan evaporate measurements he concluded that sebs results were slightly higher than pan evaporate measurements but it was negligible moreover sebs was proved as a reliable method to estimate evaporation in large scales abdelrady 2013 modified sebs to estimate evaporation from fresh and saline waters using aatsr envisat images the coefficient of determination r2 for freshwater and saline water evaporation was acquired as 0 98 and 0 88 respectively abdelrady 2013 zhuo et al 2014 calculated distribution of actual and potential evapotranspiration on the land surface in tibet using sebs andpenman monteith equation regarding to this investigation both actual and potential evaporations were changed with the same distribution from the south east to the north west of the study area comparing the results of sebs with penman monteith equation confirmed the efficiency of sebs however there were variations in regions with highly dense vegetation such as forests elhag 2016 employed sebs to estimate evapotranspiration for nile delta using weather stations data and satellite remote sensing data analysis of the result along with evapotranspiration maps confirmed the efficiency of sebs for farm lands on the other hand some short fallings were reported for sebs such as using fractional vegetation cover to estimate the ground heat flux and saturating this parameter rapidly with increasing lai and consequently underestimating soil heat flux timmermans et al 2013 moreover poor performance of the sebs for complex surfaces is another disadvantage ma et al 2015 regarding the previous studies different algorithms of evapotranspiration estimation using satellite images have different performance in various environmental condition and land covers moreover enough studies have not been accomplished about the efficiency of remote sensing based evapotranspiration algorithms in freshwater lakes then the main aim of this research is investigating the efficiency of sebal metric and sebs to estimate evaporation from freshwater lakes in this regard amirkabir karaj dam reservoir in iran was chosen as the study area and the results of these three algorithms were compared with pan evaporate measurements 2 material and methods 2 1 the study area the selected study area of this research is a part of tehran and karaj basin in iran including amirkabir reservoir and nearby agricultural lands fig 1 amirkabir dam is located at 48 km from west of tehran with longitude and latitude of 51 05 30 and 35 58 45 respectively the average height of this reservoir is 1200 m from mean sea level according to long term measurements of karaj weather station its annual precipitation is 247 3 mm the average

amirkabir dam has been built on the karaj river with a basin area of 764 km2 which provides a part of drinking water and agricultural water of adjacent provinces including tehran and karaj tehran regional water authority http www thrw ir 2 2 data 2 2 1 ground station data various terrestrial data was used in this research 16 ground station evaporation measurements by karaj pan evaporate station were used to evaluate the selected satellite evapotranspiration models corresponding dates of table 1 pan evaporate measurements were obtained by tehran regional water authority the pan evaporate measurements estimate potential et pet in a point of ground station the pan evaporate measurements were performed using volumetric method and measurements were accomplished twice a day at 6 30 am and 18 30 pm accuracy of evaporation measurements of pan evaporate was 0 1 mm moreover daily solar radiation and sunny hours of selected dates were prepared from karaj weather station to use in remote sensing evapotranspiration models furthermore temperature dew point temperature and wind speed of corresponding dates were gathered from iran meteorological organization 2 2 2 satellite images in this research 16 images from tm and oli sensors on board landsat satellites were utilized table 1 in the selection of the images it was tried to use images with no uncommon environmental phenomenon such as clouds clear sky condition aerosols and dust satellite images were prepared from earth explorer website www earthexplorer usgs gov 2 3 methodology sebal sebs and metric algorithms are based on energy balance on the surface of the earth in these models actual evapotranspiration is calculated using satellite images satellite sensors measure electromagnetic radiation from the surface of the earth at the overpassing time of the satellite thus calculations are performed for the overpassing moment and then are converted to daily amounts 2 3 1 sebal methodology sebal uses energy balance equation to calculate instantaneous latent heat flux of evaporation as the residue of eq 1 bastiaanssen et al 1998a then instantaneous and daily evaporation and transpiration are calculated for each pixel of the image 1 λ et inst r n g h where λ et inst is latent heat flux of evaporation at imaging time w m2 rn is net radiation flux at the surface w m2 g is soil and water flux heat w m2 and h is sensible heat flux to the air the components of the equation are described in details below net radiation flux rn shows the actual available radiation at the surface waters et al 2002 which is calculated as 2 r n 1 α r s r l 1 ε 0 r l where α is surface albedo ε 0 is surface thermal emissivity in broad thermal spectrum r s is incoming downward shortwave radiation r l is downward longwave radiation and r l is outgoing upward longwave radiation to calculate rn it is necessary to apply radiometric corrections on images and image bands are converted to radiance and reflectance regarding to their wavelengths these corrections can be accomplished by gain and offset data available in the header file of the manuscript allen et al 2002 bastiaanssen et al 1998a bastiaanssen et al 2005 incoming shortwave radiation is obtained from equation below 3 r s g sc cos θ dr τ sw where g sc is solar constant of 1367 w m2 θ is solar incidence angle and dr is inverse squared relative distance between sun and earth τ sw is atmospheric transmissivity which can be calculated by an empirical equation as pereira et al 2015 4 τ sw 0 75 2 10 5 z where z is the height above mean sea level m outgoing longwave r l is obtained from eq 5 5 r l ε 0 σ t s 4 where σ is boltzmann constant as 5 67 10 8 and t s is surface temperature k surface emissivity is the ratio of the thermal radiation from a surface to the radiation from an ideal black body surface at the same temperature emissivity can be calculated based on empirical equations of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi rouse et al 1974 and leaf area index lai lai can be calculated using an empirical equation of soil adjusted vegetation index savi allen et al 2002 as 6 lai ln 0 69 savi 0 59 0 91 savi is adjusted for soil effects which eliminates its effect on the reflectance of surface in the arid areas and thus decreases soil moisture impacts at this index results allen et al 2002 finally two required emissivity values of sebal including surface thermal emissivity ε 0 and narrow band emissivity from thermal bands ε nb are obtained from the following empirical equations according to lai and ndvi as introduced by allen et al 2002 surface temperature from thermal band is calculated using planck s black body equation eq 7 7 t s k 2 ln ε nb k 1 r c 1 where r c is the corrected thermal radiance from the surface w m 2 sr μ m and k1 and k2 are constant values for selected images incoming longwave radiation is calculated as 8 r l ε a σ t a 4 where ε a is atmospheric emissivity and t a is the near surface air temperature k soil and water heat flux g is the rate of heat storage in the soil plant and water in heat transfer it is not possible to calculate this factor by remote sensing methods then it can be calculated by the relation between g r n ndvi t s and albedo bastiaanssen 2000 9 g r n t s α 0 0038 α 0 0074 α 2 1 0 98 ndvi 4 where the surface temperature is in c for water bodies the heat flux is calculated by amayreh equations from january to june as below amayreh 1995 10 g 0 9 r n 40 and from july to december as 11 g r n 90 sensible heat flux h is transferred heat by convection to the air due to temperature difference and is obtained from eq 12 12 h ρ c p dt r ah where ρ is air density c p is specific heat capacity of air which equals to 1004 j kg 1 k 1 dt is temperature difference from height z1 to z2 k and r ah is aerodynamic resistivity for heat transfer due to existence of two unknown variable of dt and r ah in the equation acquiring sensible heat flux is complicated thus in this algorithm two anchor pixels are determined cold pixel and hot pixel and then variables dt and r ah are calculated by using a trial and error method in an iterative process in this process frictional velocity and aerodynamic resistance measured at nearby weather station of the study area are utilized in the loop as initial values afterwards variables dt and r ah are calculated in the first loop and then current values are implemented in the loop as new initial values and variables are updated in every loop this loop continues until the variables converge to a constant value and finally acquired sensible heat flux of the last iteration is considered as the selected value instantaneous evapotranspiration for the satellite at the overpass time is calculated using eq 1 and 13 13 et inst 3600 λ et λ where et inst is instantaneous evapotranspiration mm h 3600 is time conversion from second to hour λ et is evaporation latent heat flux and λ is evaporation latent heat etrf constant is obtained using instantaneous evapotranspiration as 14 etrf et inst et r where et r is reference evapotranspiration this variable can be calculated by some softwares such as ref et this software is developed in university of idaho for reference crop evapotranspiration allen 2000 the advantage of this software is that user is able to choose various methods such penman monteith priestley taylor and pan evaporate and etc to calculate evaporation and transpiration penman monteith method is used in this study at the end daily evapotranspiration is calculated by 15 et 24 etrf et r 24 where et r 24 is a summation of et r values of each day 2 3 2 metric methodology metric algorithm uses the similar way as sebal to calculate evapotranspiration in both models sensible heat flux is calculated from linear relation between near surface air temperature and land surface temperature and using two cold and hot pixels but they are different in calculation of two other fluxes which is described below mertic equations to calculate net radiation flux are as same as sebal except in one equation unlike sebal which calculates atmospheric transmissivity using height above mean sea level metric uses air pressure and water content of the atmosphere to calculates τ sw as 16 τ sw 0 35 0 627 exp 0 00146 p k t cos θ hor 0 75 w cos θ hor 0 4 where p is atmospheric pressure kpa w is water of the atmosphere mm and θ hor is solar zenith angle k t is dimensionless turbidity coefficient of the atmosphere which can changes between 0 and 1 1 for clean air and 0 5 for turbid air furthermore atmospheric pressure kpa is obtained from eq 17 17 p 101 3 293 0 0065 z 293 5 26 where z is the height above mean sea surface water vapor in atmosphere w can be calculated as mm 18 w 0 14 e a p air 2 1 where e a is vapor pressure close to earth surface kpa and p air is air pressure kpa metric employed eq 9 to calculate soil heat transfer flux at the beginning but in current research an equation developed by tasumi 2003 is sued for lai 0 5 19 g r n 0 05 0 18 e 0 521 lai and for lai 0 5 20 g r n 1 80 t s 273 15 r n 0 084 sensible heat transfer is calculated by multiplication of rn in acquired g r n these equations are mostly used in agricultural lands and have acceptable results however they do not have reasonable results for regions with water or snow for metric applications in usa for regions with water and snow acceptable results are achieved by applying g r n 0 5 which it is applied in this research as well 2 3 3 sebs methodology sebs uses energy equilibrium equation to calculate instantaneous latent heat flux of evaporation eq 1 since there are common parts between two sebal and sebs methods only different parts of sebs are explained in this section net radiation flux rn is calculated similar to sebal with a slight change in lai equation lai in sebs is calculated from choudhury 1987 equation as 21 lai log 1 f c λ where fc is fractional canopy coverage and λ is leaf angle distribution function which is obtained according to the vegetation cover of the study area fractional canopy coverage fc is obtained from eq 22 22 f c 1 ndvi max ndvi ndvi max ndvi min 0 625 where ndvimax and ndvimin are the maximum and the minimum of ndvi respectively in this research soil heat flux g is calculated from two equations for soil and water for non aquatic zones su 2002 equation is used 23 g r n γ c 1 f c γ s γ c where γ c is ratio of soil heat flux to net radiation which is equal to 0 05 for complete vegetated areas γ s is ratio of soil heat flux to net radiation which is equal

is the number of observations x i is measured value and y i is predicted value 3 results and discussion 3 1 daily evaporation initially selected images were converted to radiance or reflectance values according to represented data in header file of images then daily evaporation values were calculated using sebal metric and sebs for the selected dates evaporations of two pixels in amirkabir reservoir were considered including one within and one outside of water body near the pan evaporate location table 2 to perform more precise evaluations as it can be seen from the results and regarding the measured values by pan evaporate sebal has closer results to pan evaporate measurements outside dam reservoir comparing with within values moreover the sebs model has more accurate estimations inside the reservoir than the reservoir bank on the other hand the metric model estimates the et in the bank near the pan evaporate measurement for instance fig 2 shows daily evapotranspiration of the selected image of 9 7 2011 as can be seen in this figure areas with vegetation cover such as western and north eastern parts of the image have more evapotranspiration comparing urban areas in the eastern parts and areas without vegetation in the southern parts of the image fig 2 shows that evapotranspiration in vegetated areas is higher than non vegetated areas in all three models this difference can be due to simultaneous evapotranspiration of soil and vegetation cover in vegetated lands while other areas are without transpiration and only evaporation occurs fig 3 shows masked and zoomed image of the daily evaporation of amirkabir dam reservoir as it can be seen evaporation is not the same in the whole surface of the dam lake investigating the results it was found that albedo is changing at the lake surface and this difference in determining the amount of flux intake and its storage was effective on the other hand the depth of the lake in all areas was not the same and the depth was increased with moving toward the center of the dam lake this issue results in the increasing the thermal capacity and consequently the evaporation changes from the surface another factor affecting the evaporation amount is the wind function wind currents caused to the displacement of water vapor and changing the evaporation process in different locations whole of these factors together in a fixed location determine the evaporation rate from each point which requires a closer investigation of each of these factors overall as pan evaporate measurements estimate potential et pet and remote sensing methods estimate actual et aet then each environmental parameter which is effective in converting pet to aet can change the distribution of et over the dam lake table 3 shows r2 and rmse values between acquired evaporation values of pan evaporate and three selected models in the chosen dates for sebal r2 values for selected points in reservoir bank and inside the reservoir were 0 9 and 0 52 respectively thus sebal was more efficient in estimating evaporation of land comparing with water metric has better results comparing with sebal in selected reservoir point and its evaluated values were closer to measured values it also can be seen from fewer fluctuations between evaluations and measured values from coefficient of determination r2 generally metric model had r2 of 0 79 for evaluated values and measured values on reservoir bank point and 0 57 in reservoir point hence it shows acceptable results for just land areas one reason for the differences of results between sebal and metric is their difference in calculating transmissivity coefficient and soil heat flux in addition sebs and sebal have different ways to calculate soil heat flux and sensible heat flux thus they have different results according to table 3 and fig 2 sebs was the most efficient method for estimation of evaporation from the water surface however there were considerable differences between evaluated values of sebs in bank of reservoir point and pan evaporate values which clearly can be inferred from r2 coefficient of determination for evaluated values and pan evaporate on reservoir bank was 0 36 while for water surface it was 0 93 which showed high correlation for water bodies according to table 3 the minimum rmse for evaluated values of the reservoir was acquired by sebs 0 62 mm which had the highest coefficient of determination 0 93 with measured values of pan evaporate sebal results showed the rmse of 0 82 mm and r2 of 0 85 for reservoir bank point although it was more accurate than other two models it is not efficient for the inside point of the reservoir metric has a relative efficiency in reservoir bank with relatively high r2 value of 0 79 to evaluate daily evaporation from whole of the lake surface acquired evaporation values from three selected models for pixels of amirkabir lake surface were integrated table 4 shows daily evaporation of amirkabir lake for chosen dates according to table 4 metric and sebs estimated considerably higher values comparing with sebal in metric model the highest estimated evaporation was for may and august 2011 with a slight difference and lowest estimated evaporation corresponded to august 2016 regarding the climate and weather condition of study area results were reasonable furthermore evaluated values by sebs have great differences with evaluated values of sebal but not as much as metric in general it can be concluded that sebal and metric were not efficient for water bodies but sebs was highly correlated and were efficient to evaluate evaporation from water bodies 4 conclusion evaporation from freshwater lakes surface is a reason for wasting these valuable water resources in the last decades remote sensing based evapotranspiration models have attracted attentions however it is necessary to investigate precision and efficiency of these models especially in freshwater bodies then the main objective of this research was to investigate the performance of sebal metric and sebs in estimating evaporation from a freshwater body amirkabir lake using landsat satellite images in this regard 16 landsat images were selected and these three algorithms were implemented acquired results were investigated for two points including one point in the bank of the reservoir lake and close to measuring station and the other one in the reservoir then the obtained results were compared with pan evaporate measurements in the study area according to the results sebs showed the highest correlation 0 93 and the lowest rmse 0 62 mm with pan evaporate in the reservoir but it did not have good results for the bank moreover metric results were relatively acceptable in the reservoir with a relatively high value of the determination coefficient 0 57 on the average for the chosen point of the reservoir rmse for metric and sebal were 2 02 mm and 5 1 mm respectively thus sebal was not precise enough for water bodies generally metric and sebs are appropriate models to evaluate evaporation from the selected freshwater surface due to their higher correlations then the results showed the efficiency of sebs to evaluate these two parameters furthermore evaporations from different areas of surface of the lake were not the same this shows that it is not proper to extrapolate station point measurements to the whole surface of the lakes this is one of the advantages of algorithms which use satellite images moreover the maximum daily evaporation value evaluated with the sebs for the whole of the amirkabir lake the most precise model was acquired as 38 85 mm at 9th of july 2011 this amount of evaporation from the amirkabir lake surface is considerable and it is necessary to consider a plan to prevent this amount of wasting freshwater due to evaporation these results can be used in water resource management studies to present more precise information about evaporation from freshwater resources this research showed that models which use satellite images are efficient to study evaporation from freshwater resources furthermore these models can be used in areas which there are not enough available data from measurements of the stations 
7292,stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o of water can help our understanding of origin mixing and migration of groundwater in the formation with low permeability it provides information about migration mechanism of ion such as diffusion and or advection thus it has been realized as very important information to understand the migration of water and ions in it however in formation with low permeability it is difficult to obtain the ground water sample as liquid and water in pores needs to be extracted to estimate it compressing rock is the most common and widely used method of extracting water in pores however changes in δ2h and δ18o may take place during compression because changes in ion concentration have been reported in previous studies in this study two natural rocks were compressed and the changes in the δ2h and δ18o with compression pressure were investigated mechanisms for the changes in water isotopes observed during the compression were then discussed in addition δ2h and δ18o of water in pores were also evaluated by direct vapor equilibration and laser spectrometry dve ls and δ2h and δ18o were compared with those obtained by compression δ2h was found to change during the compression and a part of this change was found to be explained by the effect of water from closed pores extracted by compression in addition water isotopes in both open and closed pores were estimated by combining the results of 2 kinds of compression experiments water isotopes evaluated by compression that not be affected by water from closed pores showed good agreements with those obtained by dve ls indicating compression could show the mixed information of water from open and closed pores while dve ls could show the information only for open pores thus the comparison of water isotopes obtained by compression and dve ls could provide the information about water isotopes in closed and open pores keywords compression δ2h δ18o water in pores low permeability rock closed pore effect laser spectrometry 1 introduction stable water isotopes δ2h and δ18o have been used for groundwater investigations and could provide very useful information such as recharge and mixing of groundwater migration of materials in subsurface and paleohydrogeology in the previous studies murgulet et al 2016 prada et al 2016 hendry et al 2013 chen et al 2011 sidle 1998 some geological formations with low permeability are considered as potential host rock for radioactive waste disposal hendry et al 2015a savoye et al 2008 distribution of δ2h and δ18o can be important to understand the migration behavior of water in pores and dissolved radionuclides in such formations savoye et al 2008 hendry et al 2004 rübel et al 2002 however in such formations obtaining liquid water sample for measurement of water isotopes is difficult because of low permeability and samples have to be obtained from rock cores as water in pores therefore many methods to extract or investigate the water isotopes of water in pores have been developed including distillation koeniger et al 2011 rübel et al 2002 revesz and woods 1990 centrifugation gimmi et al 2007 yang et al 2003 squeezing hendry et al 2015b kelln et al 2001 isotopic exchange with water with known water isotopes rübel et al 2002 van der kamp et al 1996 and direct equilibrium with head space gas hendry et al 2004 koehler et al 2000 the new method called direct vapor equilibration and laser spectrometry dve ls was developed by wassenaar et al 2008 and some points of attention of this method was indicated by hendry et al 2015b among the methods mentioned above dve ls is one of the most attractive methods because the procedure is relatively simple and applicability to many kind of rocks is already confirmed hendry et al 2015b uniaxial compression squeezing is also considered a useful method because concentrations of major ions and some isotopic ratios such as 36cl 35cl 37cl 37cl 35cl and 81br 79br in water in pores can be measured with the squeezed water and they are very useful to understand the migration of radionuclides and water in pores in low permeable formations hasegawa et al 2016 shouakar stash et al 2007 alessandro et al 1997 desaulniers et al 1986 the depth profiles of δ2h and δ18o evaluated from dve ls isotopic exchange and extracted pore water by compression were compared and showed a good agreement each other in previous studies hendry et al 2015b rübel et al 2002 this agreement showed all dve ls isotopic exchange and squeezing methods potentially can evaluate the water isotopes of water in pores adequately however in the case of compression method it has been found that ion concentrations change with increase of compression pressure nakata et al 2016 fernandez et al 2003 sacchi et al 2000 therefore it could be assumed that δ2h and δ18o also may change with the compression pressure in some cases in such cases there may be a significant difference between δ2h and δ18o evaluated by compression and the other methods even though it has not been observed in the past studies hendry et al 2015b rübel et al 2002 thus it is very important to investigate the change of δ2h and δ18o and understand the mechanism of isotope change of δ2h and δ18o during compression so that the compression can be applied to investigate the distribution of them properly in addition the mechanisms of isotope change of δ2h and δ18o may be related to those of the other isotopes such as 37cl 35cl and 81br 79br thus investigating the effect of compression on δ2h and δ18o may also provide useful information about extraction and measurement of useful isotopes dissolved in water in pores by compression in this study the dependence of the δ2h and δ18o of squeezed water from pores obtained by compression is investigated for 2 kinds of rocks in japan in addition the values of δ2h and δ18o are compared with those obtained by dve ls method the mechanism of isotope change during the compression was assumed by using dependence on pressure and comparison of methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the rock a came from cores collected from rokkasho village in the aomori prefecture the northern most part of honshu island in japan this rock was pumiceous tuff of neogene it included pumice 1 3 cm diameter in matrix the pumice might include a hydrothermal fluid in the pores as a trace of volcanic activity oyama et al 2007 2008 the freshly cut block of rocks about 20 20 20 cm were obtained from the wall of the underground tunnel and it was vacuum packed in plastic bag soon after being collected to prevent the rocks being dried packed blocks of rocks were sent to laboratory and the surface of the rocks was trimmed by a dry cutter soon after the arrival at laboratory because surface might be dry or contaminated during sampling procedure the blocks of rocks after trimming were cut and molded so that we could obtain 2 cores in cylindrical shape 50 mm in diameter and 100 mm in length a number of disk shaped cores 50 mm in diameter 5 mm in thickness were also obtained from the part just next to cylindrical cores the rock cut into cylindrical and disk shape was used for compression and dve ls experiments respectively the rock was analyzed by x ray diffractometer xrd and was found to be composed of glass quartz cristobalite feldspars mica mineral smectite chlorite and pyrite oyama et al 2007 the porosity and hydraulic conductivity of rock a was 50 and 3 10 8 m s respectively sasaki et al 2009 oyama et al 2008 rock b came from cores obtained in horonobe area which is located in the hokkaido prefecture the northernmost part of japan this area is covered by thick sedimentary formations drilling was carried out from depth of 350 m in horonobe research laboratory and drilled core was obtained at 82 m in depth from depth of 380 m 462 m from ground level the core was obtained from the wakkanai formation the freshly drilled cores about 60 mm in diameter and 200 mm in length were vacuum packed soon after obtained by drilling and sent to laboratory in the laboratory the surface of the core was trimmed by 5 mm which might be contaminated during drilling by drilling fluids the cores with cylindrical 50 mm in diameter and 100 mm in length and disk 50 mm in diameter and 5 mm in thickness shapes were also obtained from trimmed core and used for compression and dve ls experiments respectively the samples were analyzed by xrd and were found to be composed of opal ct quartz feldspars mica mineral smectite chlorite calcite and pyrite the porosity and hydraulic conductivity of rock b was 42 and 2 0 10 12 to 2 0 10 11 m s respectively kurikami et al 2008 2 2 measurements the δ2h and δ18o of liquid water were measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometer iso prime gv instruments ltd manchester uk or laser spectrometry iwa 45ep los gatos research california us in the case of dve ls method iwa 45ep was applied to measure the water vapor isotopes the isotope ratios of hydrogen and oxygen δ2h and δ18o are expressed in the following δ notation 1 δ x r sample r standard 1 where r is the isotopic ratio d h or 18o 16o relative to the international standards vsmow coplen et al 2002 the analytical precision was 0 5 for δ2h measurements and 0 1 for δ18o measurements in this study δ2h and δ18o were measured 12 times and top and bottom 3 data were omitted then average and dispersion of 6 data were indicated as measurement results and error in the results the concentration of cl ion was measured by ion chromatograph ic compact professional ic881 compact professional ic881 882 metrohm co herisau switzerland and br ion was measured by ic or icp ms 7500ce agilent technology california us 2 3 procedures in this study rock a and b were compressed stepwisely and δ2h and δ18o of squeezed water in each pressure were measured to investigate the dependence of δ2h and δ18o of squeezed water on the compression pressure in addition dve ls method was applied to rocks a and b and δ2h and δ18o values obtained by 2 methods were compared 2 3 1 compression experiments the compression equipment was performed in central research institute of electric power industry kiho et al 1999 following the equipment design published by mower et al 1991 the rocks were cut molded and placed in a cylinder 50 mm inner diameter 100 mm high a hydraulic jack was used to compress the rock uniaxially at a controlled pressure which could be raised to 500 mpa squeezed water from pores was collected in a polypropylene syringe through a glass filter with 1 0 μm pores rock a and b were trimmed into cylinders 50 mm in diameter 100 mm in length as described in part 2 1 and used for the compression experiments the weights of trimmed cores were about 350 to 400 g in both rocks uniaxial pressure was loaded stepwisely for rock a the pressure was increased to 25 mpa in the first step and it was maintained until the shrinking of rock stopped the squeezed water from pores was obtained in the syringe during the first step as sample at 25 mpa after the first step an empty syringes for the next step were set the pressure was then increased to 50 75 100 150 200 260 300 400 and 500 mpa and the squeezed water from pores was collected at each pressure for rock b the pressure was increased to 75 the pore water was first collected at 75 mpa 100 193 200 300 400 and 500 mpa and squeezed water from pores was obtained δ2h and δ18o and cl and br ions concentrations were measured with squeezed water from pores in this study the experiment described above was defined as compression experiment of natural rock in the compression experiments additional experiment was carried out to investigate the relationships between pressure and effect of closed pores in this study closed pores were defined as the pores that were closed to outside and water in those could not interact with outside of rock bahadur et al 2016 alexeev et al 1999 trimmed and molded rock a or b was immersed into a solution with high δ2h about 1000 that prepared by adding heavy water into distilled water the δ2h in immersed solution decreased due to the exchange of water between solution and open pores in this study open pores were defined as pores that interact with outside of rock on the other hand cl concentration increased with increase of immersed time because cl ion diffused out from rock samples from pores rock samples were kept immersed into the solution until δ2h and cl concentration in immersed solution reached a steady state fig 1 showed the immersed time vs δ2h of the solution for rock a and b the δ2h was seemed to become stable against immersed time within 10 days for both rocks the immersion was continued over 30 days so that diffusion equilibrium between water in pores and solution was certainly achieved then rock sample was taken from the solution and used for step wise squeezing the squeezed water from pores was obtained and δ2h and cl concentration were measured br concentration was found too low to be measured in this experiment in this study this experiment was described as compression experiment after immersion 2 3 2 dve ls method the dve ls method was conducted according to the procedures proposed by wassenaar et al 2008 and hendry et al 2015b rock a and b were cut into disk shape so that the weight of one disk to be about 12 g as described part 2 1 the disks were put into 2000 ml aluminum bag with valve on petri dish and 1000 ml of dried nitrogen was put into the bag the bag was closed tightly against the air and put under room temperature for 2 days and then the valve of bag was directly connected to the analyzer the vapor inside of the bag was led into analyzer by opening the valve and measurement of δ2h and δ18o was started after 1 min since the connection the isotopes of vapor were measured at every 10 s and measurement was continued for 2 min the average and one sigma of 12 data was treated as a result and uncertainty in the measurement respectively standard sample was also prepared by following procedure wiper was put on petri dish and 4 g in the case of rock a and 2 g in the case of rock b of water with known water isotopes were dropped on the wiper the amounts of water for standard samples were controlled so that the amount of water in pores and standard water became close the measurement of isotopes of vapor was carried out in the same manner as described above calibration curve between δ2h and δ18o of water and measured vapor isotopes was made with the result of standard samples and the measured isotopes of vapor of rock samples were translated to water isotopes by using the calibration curve the amount of water 2 to 4 g and the experimental time were confirmed appropriate by the preliminary experiment with 2000 ml aluminum bag 3 results and discussions 3 1 dependence of δ2h and δ18o of squeezed water on pressure during compression the relationships between the pressure amount of squeezed water δ2h and δ18o and cl and br ions concentrations in squeezed water for rock a and b in compression experiment of natural rock were summarized in table 1 in addition δ2h and δ18o of the squeezed water from pores vs pressure for rocks a and b in compression experiment of natural rock was indicated in figs 2 and 3 respectively 3 1 1 compression of rock a as was shown in fig 2 δ2h of squeezed water showed a clear dependence on pressure in the case of rock a δ2h rapidly increased with increase of pressure from 25 to 100 mpa and then it showed a plateau from 100 to 300 mpa δ2h increased again rapidly at 300 mpa and then showed stable value from 300 to 500 mpa on the other hand significant dependence on pressure was not observed in the case of δ18o the cl and br concentrations increased with increase of pressure and the behavior against the pressure was similar to that of δ2h fig 4 the results described above could be explained by following assumptions 1 closed pores in rock a contained water with high cl and br concentrations and high δ2h 2 the effect of closed pores became more significant with increase of pressure immersion into solution with extremely high δ2h about 1000 and low cl and br concentrations followed by squeezing compression experiment after immersion described in part 2 3 1 was carried out to investigate the possibility of these assumptions the dependence of amount of water from closed pores in the squeezed water on pressure could be evaluated by this experiment water molecular diffuse into open pores during immersion and thus δ2h of water in open pores is considered increase with time and become equal to that in solution when equilibrium of diffusion is achieved on the other hand δ2h of water in the closed pores is considered to remain same as before immersion if δ2h of the squeezed pore water was significantly lower than that of solution we could know that significant amount of water from closed pores was mixed into squeezed water fig 5 showed the relationships between pressure and δ2h and cl concentration during compression in compression experiment after immersion in compression experiment after immersion rock core was immersed into solution with high δ2h and compressed after δ2h in solution had reached to equilibrium state fig 1 in fig 5 δ2h and cl concentration of solution after equilibrium were shown by dashed lines br concentration was too low to be measured correctly the δ2h of squeezed water was less than that of solution after equilibrium indicating some fraction of water from closed pores mixed into squeezed water in addition δ2h decreased with increase of pressure indicating mixture ratio of water from closed pores to squeezed water increased with increase of pressure the mixture ratio of water from closed pores to squeezed water at each pressure f in the eq 2 could be calculated by following eq 2 under the assumption that δ2h in the closed pores is between 55 and 0 the range of δ2h of water in closed pores 55 to 0 was assumed because minimum δ2h of squeezed water was 55 however δ2h in the closed pores did not affect to mixture ratio significantly because δ2h in the solution was extremely higher than that in other words results of compression experiment after immersion can reduce the effect of uncertainty of δ2h value of water in closed pores for calculation of f 2 δ 2 h cp f δ 2 h op 1 f δ 2 h sq where δ2h cp δ2h op and δ2h sq was δ2h of water in closed pores 55 to 0 that of water in open pores in the case of compression experiment after immersion this is considered to be same as δ2h of solution after equilibrium 1087 and δ2h of squeezed water at the pressure respectively the mixture ratios calculated by eq 2 were shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 when the compression pressure is low below 50 mpa mixture ratio of water from closed pores was low under 1 indicating the effect of closed pore was not significant at low pressure the mixture ratio increased sharply from 50 to 200 mpa with increase of pressure and it reached to 6 at 500 mpa the dependence of mixture ratio on pressure was similar to that of δ2h fig 2 and cl and br concentrations fig 4 for natural rock indicating they were also affected by mixing of water from closed pores the values of f in each pressure were calculated as above in the compression experiment of natural rock δ2h sq was already obtained at each pressure table 1 equations expressing the relationships between δ2h cp and δ2h op were available by substituting f and δ2h sq into eq 2 at each pressure three equations were obtained from the results at 50 100 and 500 mpa and we obtained 3 sets of δ2h cp and δ2h op by dissolving the equations the average value of δ2h op was calculated as 55 4 0 1 and δ2h cp was calculated to be 36 6 1 2 the uncertainties described above are one sigma of 3 values obtained from 3 equations cl concentration in squeezed water was higher than that of solution and increased with increase of pressure it reached to 54 mg l at 500 mpa indicating cl concentration in water in closed pore was higher than 54 mg l cl concentration in water in closed pores was calculated as about 750 mg l with mixture ratio and cl concentration of solution after equilibrium 1 38 mg l by using similar way of δ2h cp aoki 1992 clarified that the water of hot springs near the point where rock a was obtained is affected by high temperature volcanic fluids and they had relatively higher δ2h and cl concentration than local groundwater in addition the pumice in rock a might include a hydrothermal fluid in the pores as a trace of volcanic activity oyama et al 2007 2008 thus the relatively higher δ2h and cl concentration of water in closed pores have been considered to come from volcanic fluids thus combining the results of compression experiment of natural rock and after immersion δ2h and ion concentration in both open and closed pores could be evaluated as mentioned above compression experiment after immersion clearly showed followings 1 significant amount of water from closed pores mixed into squeezed water up to 6 and affected δ2h and ion concentrations cl and br 2 the mixture ratio of water from closed pore increased with increase of pressure and this behavior against pressure showed a good agreement with that of δ2h and cl and br concentrations in natural sample 3 δ2h and cl concentration of water in closed pores was estimated to be 36 6 1 2 and about 750 mg l respectively these were much higher than that of water in open pores and it might be explained by mixing high temperature volcanic fluids 4 water isotopes and ion concentrations could be inferred combining the results of compression experiment of natural rock and after immersion thus the results of compression experiment of rock a could be explained by the effect of closed pores the δ18o was also considered to be affected by water from closed pores however no significant dependence on pressure was observed in the case of δ18o aoki 1992 obtained the water of hot springs near the point where rock a was obtained and showed the relationships between δ2h and δ18o in the water that was affected by high temperature volcanic fluids according to the relationships shown by aoki 1992 δ18o of water in closed pores was assumed to be about 5 0 because δ2h of that was evaluated as 36 6 1 2 on the other hand δ18o of water in the open pores was assumed to be 9 1 according to the measurement of squeezed water at 25 mpa thus if the mixing ratio is 6 the maximum value observed in compression experiment for rock a δ18o of squeezed water was calculated to 8 9 it was assumed that because measurement of δ18o had uncertainty by 0 1 and there was only slight difference between 8 9 and 9 1 the dependence of δ18o on compression pressure was not observed clearly 3 1 2 compression of rock b and comparison between rock a and b in the case of rock b δ2h decreased with increase of pressure from 50 to 300 mpa and δ2h showed stable value from 300 to 500 mpa in the compression experiment of natural rock fig 3 on the other hand significant dependence on pressure was not observed in the case of δ18o the relationships between pressure and cl and br concentrations were summarized in fig 7 and both cl and br concentration decreased with increase of pressure compression experiment after immersion was also carried out for rock b and mixture ratio of water in closed pores was also evaluated by eq 2 the relationships between pressure and δ2h of water squeezed by compression in compression experiment after immersion was indicated in fig 8 in fig 8 δ2h of solution after equilibrium were shown by dashed lines in addition the calculated mixture ratio of water from closed pores into squeezed water at each pressure was indicated in fig 9 in the case of rock b mixture ratio of water from closed pores was smaller than that of rock a and it became maximum at lowest pressure 75 mpa and it decreased with increase of pressure as indicated in figs 8 and 9 this result meant that the effect of closed pore was more significant in lower pressure below 200 mpa in the case of rock b in other words almost of all closed pores in rock b might be opened at 75 mpa unlike the results of rock a as described in part 2 1 rock a was pumiceous tuff oyama et al 2007 2008 and thus it might contain vitreous parts in the rock it was inferred that pores inside of vitreous parts formed the closed pores with water in pores affected by hydrothermal fluid in this case it was assumed that closed pores were mechanically strong and high pressure was required to break the structure of closed pores on the other hand rock b was sedimentary rock and pores in diatom fossils ishii et al 2011 and closed part during sedimentation might form the closed pores it was inferred that such structures may be broken at lower pressure compared to those in vitreous part thus we assumed that the difference in structure of closed pores caused the difference in pressure dependence of mixing ratio of water from closed pores in the compression experiment of natural rock for rock b δ2h decreased with increase of pressure fig 3 and mixing ratio of water from closed pores calculated from the results of compression experiment also decreased with increase of pressure thus water from closed pores was considered to contribute the change in δ2h during compression if δ2h of water in closed pore in rock b was higher than 22 maximum value observed in compression δ2h of water in closed pores in rock b was assumed to be about 0 much higher than 22 because rock b was formed at the bottom of sea and origin of the water in closed pores was considered to be sea water ishii et al 2011 thus it could be inferred that the effect of water from closed pores could be one of the reason of the change in δ2h on compression pressure δ2h of water in open δ2h op and closed pores δ2h cq was calculated by using eq 2 as the same manner of rock a δ2h op was calculated as 25 4 1 5 however calculated δ2h cp showed an unrealistic value over 50 this unrealistic value indicated that the change in δ2h for rock b could not be explained quantitatively by only the effect of closed pores thus it is inferred that some other mechanisms may exist for change of δ2h during the compression in the case of rock b dependence of δ18o on pressure was not observed clearly either in the case of rock b the δ18o of water in open pores was expected to be about 1 5 according to the results of compression experiment of natural rock for rock b the δ18o of water in closed pores was assumed to be about 0 because rock b was formed at the bottom of sea thus the difference in δ18o value between water in open and closed pores 1 5 and 0 0 was not as big as that in δ2h and mixture of about 1 7 of closed pore might not affect to δ18o in the squeezed water cl and br concentrations decreased significantly and those at 500 mpa were about 70 of those at 75 mpa in the case of rock b in the previous study the change in cl concentration during compression had been investigated for rock b nakata et al 2016 according to this study interlayer water of smectite that contains little cl ion is squeezed during compression the squeezed interlayer water dilutes water in pores and this dilution is the main reason of decrease in cl concentration during compression the effect of closed pores also may contribute to changes in ion concentrations during compressions in the case of rock a the change in both δ2h and cl concentration could be explained by the effect of closed pore based on the assumption that δ2h and cl concentration in closed pores is 36 6 1 2 and 750 mg l respectively however in the case of rock b the mixture ratio of water from closed pores was too small up to 1 7 to explain the sharp decrease of cl or br concentration with increase of pressure thus even though effect of closed pores might contribute the changes in cl concentrations it was considered that the main reason of changes in cl and br concentration was dilution with interlayer water of smectite for rock b this dilution might also take place in rock a however the effect of dilution might be much smaller than the effect of closed pore in the case of rock a because the amount of smectite in rock a was very small 3 2 comparison of compression and dve ls method 3 2 1 comparison of water isotopes obtained by 2 methods in figs 10 and 11 δ2h and δ18o evaluated by dve ls were compared with those by compression method for rock a and b respectively in figs 10 and 11 δ2h and δ18o evaluated by dve ls were shown as open circle with error bar three data were indicated in the figures because 3 experiments were conducted in each condition one sigma of 12 times measurement in 2 min described in part 2 3 1 was shown as error bar in each data in the case of rock a fig 10 δ2h obtained by dve ls showed a good agreement with that of squeezed water in lower 75 mpa pressure the mixture ratio of closed pore was below 1 in lower pressure for rock a as indicated in fig 6 therefore squeezed water with lower pressure was considered to be mainly extracted from open pores this could be a reason that δ2h obtained by dve ls coincided with that of squeezed water at lower pressure because water vapor was produced not from closed pore but from surface and open pores δ18o obtained by dve ls also showed similar values to those of squeezed water and this agreement pointed both methods could be applicable for measurement of δ18o of pore water however δ18o obtained by dve ls was seemed like slightly higher than that squeezed water this might include some substantial differences between 2 methods because similar tendency was also shown in rock b fig 11 even though the difference was about 0 1 in average and it could be explained by an error in measurement in the case of rock b δ2h obtained by dve ls was very close to that of squeezed water with high over 300 mpa pressure the effect of closed pore in squeezed water was more significant in lower pressure in the case of rock b therefore δ2h obtained by dve ls was considered to be close to that of water in open pores these results showed that water isotopes obtained by compression method contained both information of open and closed pores while those by dve ls method contained only information of open pores δ18o obtained by dve ls also approximately coincide with that of squeezed water even though it was slightly higher than that of squeezed water as was the case in rock a as described above δ2h and δ18o obtained by dve ls showed a good agreement with that of squeezed water that was not affected by water from closed pores in both rock a and b this result indicated that compression method could provide the mixed information of both closed and open pores and dve ls could show only the information of open pores thus if we compare the results of dve ls and compression we can obtain information about water in closed pore we can assume water isotopes of water in closed pores are higher or lower than that in open pores dve ls method could measure δ2h and δ18o of water in pores within 3 days and dispersion between the 3 results for each condition was found small as indicated in figs 10 and 11 in addition the amount of pore water amount of rock sample required for measurement was small in our experimental conditions over 1 0 g and it could be applied nearly all forms of rock samples cores powders and etc dve ls was again confirmed as a powerful method for measurement of δ2h and δ18o of water in open pores by the comparison with compression method as indicated by hendry et al 2015b 3 2 2 comparison of compression and dve ls dve ls was seemed to have big advantage because the amount of sample needed for measurement was small various samples in forms was applicable it took for only 2 to 3 days for preparation and measurement operation was relatively easy and dispersion in the repeated test was relatively small as indicted by wassenaar et al 2008 and hendry et al 2015b if analyzer that can measure the water isotopes of vapor is available it could be a prime candidate as a method for evaluation of δ2h and δ18o of water in pores compression is also useful because the squeezed water can be used for the other important measurements δ2h and δ18o of squeezed water were affected by water from closed pores and this could be a cause of shift of them during compression the difference between comparison and dve ls might include some information about closed pore and thus comparison is useful to obtain the information about water in closed pores in addition if we can combine the results of compression of natural rock and after immersion mixing ratio of water from closed pore and water isotopes in closed pores could be calculated even though careful attention should be paid because there is possibility that some other mechanisms may exist to change water isotopes in squeezed water information of closed pore may help our understanding about origin and evolution of water in pores curtis et al 1986 in this study the mixing of water from closed pores resulted in a change inδ2h up to 2 to 3 if we need the profile in large scale with large range of variation in δ2h such as 100 this change may not have significant effect on evaluation on the other hand sometimes it is required to discuss about the difference in δ2h by a few and then the effect of closed pore may be significant the effect of water from closed pores may affect the other useful isotopes for evaluating flow of groundwater such as 36cl 35cl 37cl 37cl 35cl and 81br 79br if the cl and br concentrations in close pores were much higher than those in open pores like rock a in this study isotopic ratio of cl and br ions are affected significantly thus in following cases we should consider about the effect of closed pores carefully when we evaluate the isotopic ratio of water and or dissolved ions by compression method 1 when we need only the information about water in open pores that related to migration of groundwater and dissolved ions in the field 2 when it is assumed that water in closed and open pores are significantly different for example in the case that the origin of pore water is sea water and water in open pores has been replaced by fresh water 3 when we need to evaluate the difference in δ2h by a few 4 conclusions in this study the change in water isotopes δ2h and δ18o during compression of rock to extract the pore water was investigated for 2 natural rocks δ2h was found to change during the compression in both rocks the effect of water from the closed pores was found to affect the water isotopes of squeezed water and this could explain a part of the change of water isotopes during compressions in addition water isotopes of water in closed pores could be calculated combining the results of compression of natural rock and after immersion however it was also indicated that there should be the other factors that affect to water isotopes during compressions in addition water isotopes evaluated by compression were compared to those obtained by dve ls water isotopes evaluated by compression that not be affected by water from closed pores showed good agreements with those obtained by dve ls thus it was clarified that compression can provide the mixed information of open and closed pores while dve ls can provide only information of open pores therefore the comparison of compression and dve ls methods is useful to infer the water isotopes in closed pores careful attention should be paid to the effect of closed pores for application of compression when the purpose is to evaluate only open pores and small difference in water isotopes have to be discussed the effect of closed pores may be remarkable when water in open and closed pores are different significantly acknowledgments the authors also wish to thank a yokosuka h shimura t yamaguchi and m yoshioka for helping with the laboratory works the

7292,stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o of water can help our understanding of origin mixing and migration of groundwater in the formation with low permeability it provides information about migration mechanism of ion such as diffusion and or advection thus it has been realized as very important information to understand the migration of water and ions in it however in formation with low permeability it is difficult to obtain the ground water sample as liquid and water in pores needs to be extracted to estimate it compressing rock is the most common and widely used method of extracting water in pores however changes in δ2h and δ18o may take place during compression because changes in ion concentration have been reported in previous studies in this study two natural rocks were compressed and the changes in the δ2h and δ18o with compression pressure were investigated mechanisms for the changes in water isotopes observed during the compression were then discussed in addition δ2h and δ18o of water in pores were also evaluated by direct vapor equilibration and laser spectrometry dve ls and δ2h and δ18o were compared with those obtained by compression δ2h was found to change during the compression and a part of this change was found to be explained by the effect of water from closed pores extracted by compression in addition water isotopes in both open and closed pores were estimated by combining the results of 2 kinds of compression experiments water isotopes evaluated by compression that not be affected by water from closed pores showed good agreements with those obtained by dve ls indicating compression could show the mixed information of water from open and closed pores while dve ls could show the information only for open pores thus the comparison of water isotopes obtained by compression and dve ls could provide the information about water isotopes in closed and open pores keywords compression δ2h δ18o water in pores low permeability rock closed pore effect laser spectrometry 1 introduction stable water isotopes δ2h and δ18o have been used for groundwater investigations and could provide very useful information such as recharge and mixing of groundwater migration of materials in subsurface and paleohydrogeology in the previous studies murgulet et al 2016 prada et al 2016 hendry et al 2013 chen et al 2011 sidle 1998 some geological formations with low permeability are considered as potential host rock for radioactive waste disposal hendry et al 2015a savoye et al 2008 distribution of δ2h and δ18o can be important to understand the migration behavior of water in pores and dissolved radionuclides in such formations savoye et al 2008 hendry et al 2004 rübel et al 2002 however in such formations obtaining liquid water sample for measurement of water isotopes is difficult because of low permeability and samples have to be obtained from rock cores as water in pores therefore many methods to extract or investigate the water isotopes of water in pores have been developed including distillation koeniger et al 2011 rübel et al 2002 revesz and woods 1990 centrifugation gimmi et al 2007 yang et al 2003 squeezing hendry et al 2015b kelln et al 2001 isotopic exchange with water with known water isotopes rübel et al 2002 van der kamp et al 1996 and direct equilibrium with head space gas hendry et al 2004 koehler et al 2000 the new method called direct vapor equilibration and laser spectrometry dve ls was developed by wassenaar et al 2008 and some points of attention of this method was indicated by hendry et al 2015b among the methods mentioned above dve ls is one of the most attractive methods because the procedure is relatively simple and applicability to many kind of rocks is already confirmed hendry et al 2015b uniaxial compression squeezing is also considered a useful method because concentrations of major ions and some isotopic ratios such as 36cl 35cl 37cl 37cl 35cl and 81br 79br in water in pores can be measured with the squeezed water and they are very useful to understand the migration of radionuclides and water in pores in low permeable formations hasegawa et al 2016 shouakar stash et al 2007 alessandro et al 1997 desaulniers et al 1986 the depth profiles of δ2h and δ18o evaluated from dve ls isotopic exchange and extracted pore water by compression were compared and showed a good agreement each other in previous studies hendry et al 2015b rübel et al 2002 this agreement showed all dve ls isotopic exchange and squeezing methods potentially can evaluate the water isotopes of water in pores adequately however in the case of compression method it has been found that ion concentrations change with increase of compression pressure nakata et al 2016 fernandez et al 2003 sacchi et al 2000 therefore it could be assumed that δ2h and δ18o also may change with the compression pressure in some cases in such cases there may be a significant difference between δ2h and δ18o evaluated by compression and the other methods even though it has not been observed in the past studies hendry et al 2015b rübel et al 2002 thus it is very important to investigate the change of δ2h and δ18o and understand the mechanism of isotope change of δ2h and δ18o during compression so that the compression can be applied to investigate the distribution of them properly in addition the mechanisms of isotope change of δ2h and δ18o may be related to those of the other isotopes such as 37cl 35cl and 81br 79br thus investigating the effect of compression on δ2h and δ18o may also provide useful information about extraction and measurement of useful isotopes dissolved in water in pores by compression in this study the dependence of the δ2h and δ18o of squeezed water from pores obtained by compression is investigated for 2 kinds of rocks in japan in addition the values of δ2h and δ18o are compared with those obtained by dve ls method the mechanism of isotope change during the compression was assumed by using dependence on pressure and comparison of methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the rock a came from cores collected from rokkasho village in the aomori prefecture the northern most part of honshu island in japan this rock was pumiceous tuff of neogene it included pumice 1 3 cm diameter in matrix the pumice might include a hydrothermal fluid in the pores as a trace of volcanic activity oyama et al 2007 2008 the freshly cut block of rocks about 20 20 20 cm were obtained from the wall of the underground tunnel and it was vacuum packed in plastic bag soon after being collected to prevent the rocks being dried packed blocks of rocks were sent to laboratory and the surface of the rocks was trimmed by a dry cutter soon after the arrival at laboratory because surface might be dry or contaminated during sampling procedure the blocks of rocks after trimming were cut and molded so that we could obtain 2 cores in cylindrical shape 50 mm in diameter and 100 mm in length a number of disk shaped cores 50 mm in diameter 5 mm in thickness were also obtained from the part just next to cylindrical cores the rock cut into cylindrical and disk shape was used for compression and dve ls experiments respectively the rock was analyzed by x ray diffractometer xrd and was found to be composed of glass quartz cristobalite feldspars mica mineral smectite chlorite and pyrite oyama et al 2007 the porosity and hydraulic conductivity of rock a was 50 and 3 10 8 m s respectively sasaki et al 2009 oyama et al 2008 rock b came from cores obtained in horonobe area which is located in the hokkaido prefecture the northernmost part of japan this area is covered by thick sedimentary formations drilling was carried out from depth of 350 m in horonobe research laboratory and drilled core was obtained at 82 m in depth from depth of 380 m 462 m from ground level the core was obtained from the wakkanai formation the freshly drilled cores about 60 mm in diameter and 200 mm in length were vacuum packed soon after obtained by drilling and sent to laboratory in the laboratory the surface of the core was trimmed by 5 mm which might be contaminated during drilling by drilling fluids the cores with cylindrical 50 mm in diameter and 100 mm in length and disk 50 mm in diameter and 5 mm in thickness shapes were also obtained from trimmed core and used for compression and dve ls experiments respectively the samples were analyzed by xrd and were found to be composed of opal ct quartz feldspars mica mineral smectite chlorite calcite and pyrite the porosity and hydraulic conductivity of rock b was 42 and 2 0 10 12 to 2 0 10 11 m s respectively kurikami et al 2008 2 2 measurements the δ2h and δ18o of liquid water were measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometer iso prime gv instruments ltd manchester uk or laser spectrometry iwa 45ep los gatos research california us in the case of dve ls method iwa 45ep was applied to measure the water vapor isotopes the isotope ratios of hydrogen and oxygen δ2h and δ18o are expressed in the following δ notation 1 δ x r sample r standard 1 where r is the isotopic ratio d h or 18o 16o relative to the international standards vsmow coplen et al 2002 the analytical precision was 0 5 for δ2h measurements and 0 1 for δ18o measurements in this study δ2h and δ18o were measured 12 times and top and bottom 3 data were omitted then average and dispersion of 6 data were indicated as measurement results and error in the results the concentration of cl ion was measured by ion chromatograph ic compact professional ic881 compact professional ic881 882 metrohm co herisau switzerland and br ion was measured by ic or icp ms 7500ce agilent technology california us 2 3 procedures in this study rock a and b were compressed stepwisely and δ2h and δ18o of squeezed water in each pressure were measured to investigate the dependence of δ2h and δ18o of squeezed water on the compression pressure in addition dve ls method was applied to rocks a and b and δ2h and δ18o values obtained by 2 methods were compared 2 3 1 compression experiments the compression equipment was performed in central research institute of electric power industry kiho et al 1999 following the equipment design published by mower et al 1991 the rocks were cut molded and placed in a cylinder 50 mm inner diameter 100 mm high a hydraulic jack was used to compress the rock uniaxially at a controlled pressure which could be raised to 500 mpa squeezed water from pores was collected in a polypropylene syringe through a glass filter with 1 0 μm pores rock a and b were trimmed into cylinders 50 mm in diameter 100 mm in length as described in part 2 1 and used for the compression experiments the weights of trimmed cores were about 350 to 400 g in both rocks uniaxial pressure was loaded stepwisely for rock a the pressure was increased to 25 mpa in the first step and it was maintained until the shrinking of rock stopped the squeezed water from pores was obtained in the syringe during the first step as sample at 25 mpa after the first step an empty syringes for the next step were set the pressure was then increased to 50 75 100 150 200 260 300 400 and 500 mpa and the squeezed water from pores was collected at each pressure for rock b the pressure was increased to 75 the pore water was first collected at 75 mpa 100 193 200 300 400 and 500 mpa and squeezed water from pores was obtained δ2h and δ18o and cl and br ions concentrations were measured with squeezed water from pores in this study the experiment described above was defined as compression experiment of natural rock in the compression experiments additional experiment was carried out to investigate the relationships between pressure and effect of closed pores in this study closed pores were defined as the pores that were closed to outside and water in those could not interact with outside of rock bahadur et al 2016 alexeev et al 1999 trimmed and molded rock a or b was immersed into a solution with high δ2h about 1000 that prepared by adding heavy water into distilled water the δ2h in immersed solution decreased due to the exchange of water between solution and open pores in this study open pores were defined as pores that interact with outside of rock on the other hand cl concentration increased with increase of immersed time because cl ion diffused out from rock samples from pores rock samples were kept immersed into the solution until δ2h and cl concentration in immersed solution reached a steady state fig 1 showed the immersed time vs δ2h of the solution for rock a and b the δ2h was seemed to become stable against immersed time within 10 days for both rocks the immersion was continued over 30 days so that diffusion equilibrium between water in pores and solution was certainly achieved then rock sample was taken from the solution and used for step wise squeezing the squeezed water from pores was obtained and δ2h and cl concentration were measured br concentration was found too low to be measured in this experiment in this study this experiment was described as compression experiment after immersion 2 3 2 dve ls method the dve ls method was conducted according to the procedures proposed by wassenaar et al 2008 and hendry et al 2015b rock a and b were cut into disk shape so that the weight of one disk to be about 12 g as described part 2 1 the disks were put into 2000 ml aluminum bag with valve on petri dish and 1000 ml of dried nitrogen was put into the bag the bag was closed tightly against the air and put under room temperature for 2 days and then the valve of bag was directly connected to the analyzer the vapor inside of the bag was led into analyzer by opening the valve and measurement of δ2h and δ18o was started after 1 min since the connection the isotopes of vapor were measured at every 10 s and measurement was continued for 2 min the average and one sigma of 12 data was treated as a result and uncertainty in the measurement respectively standard sample was also prepared by following procedure wiper was put on petri dish and 4 g in the case of rock a and 2 g in the case of rock b of water with known water isotopes were dropped on the wiper the amounts of water for standard samples were controlled so that the amount of water in pores and standard water became close the measurement of isotopes of vapor was carried out in the same manner as described above calibration curve between δ2h and δ18o of water and measured vapor isotopes was made with the result of standard samples and the measured isotopes of vapor of rock samples were translated to water isotopes by using the calibration curve the amount of water 2 to 4 g and the experimental time were confirmed appropriate by the preliminary experiment with 2000 ml aluminum bag 3 results and discussions 3 1 dependence of δ2h and δ18o of squeezed water on pressure during compression the relationships between the pressure amount of squeezed water δ2h and δ18o and cl and br ions concentrations in squeezed water for rock a and b in compression experiment of natural rock were summarized in table 1 in addition δ2h and δ18o of the squeezed water from pores vs pressure for rocks a and b in compression experiment of natural rock was indicated in figs 2 and 3 respectively 3 1 1 compression of rock a as was shown in fig 2 δ2h of squeezed water showed a clear dependence on pressure in the case of rock a δ2h rapidly increased with increase of pressure from 25 to 100 mpa and then it showed a plateau from 100 to 300 mpa δ2h increased again rapidly at 300 mpa and then showed stable value from 300 to 500 mpa on the other hand significant dependence on pressure was not observed in the case of δ18o the cl and br concentrations increased with increase of pressure and the behavior against the pressure was similar to that of δ2h fig 4 the results described above could be explained by following assumptions 1 closed pores in rock a contained water with high cl and br concentrations and high δ2h 2 the effect of closed pores became more significant with increase of pressure immersion into solution with extremely high δ2h about 1000 and low cl and br concentrations followed by squeezing compression experiment after immersion described in part 2 3 1 was carried out to investigate the possibility of these assumptions the dependence of amount of water from closed pores in the squeezed water on pressure could be evaluated by this experiment water molecular diffuse into open pores during immersion and thus δ2h of water in open pores is considered increase with time and become equal to that in solution when equilibrium of diffusion is achieved on the other hand δ2h of water in the closed pores is considered to remain same as before immersion if δ2h of the squeezed pore water was significantly lower than that of solution we could know that significant amount of water from closed pores was mixed into squeezed water fig 5 showed the relationships between pressure and δ2h and cl concentration during compression in compression experiment after immersion in compression experiment after immersion rock core was immersed into solution with high δ2h and compressed after δ2h in solution had reached to equilibrium state fig 1 in fig 5 δ2h and cl concentration of solution after equilibrium were shown by dashed lines br concentration was too low to be measured correctly the δ2h of squeezed water was less than that of solution after equilibrium indicating some fraction of water from closed pores mixed into squeezed water in addition δ2h decreased with increase of pressure indicating mixture ratio of water from closed pores to squeezed water increased with increase of pressure the mixture ratio of water from closed pores to squeezed water at each pressure f in the eq 2 could be calculated by following eq 2 under the assumption that δ2h in the closed pores is between 55 and 0 the range of δ2h of water in closed pores 55 to 0 was assumed because minimum δ2h of squeezed water was 55 however δ2h in the closed pores did not affect to mixture ratio significantly because δ2h in the solution was extremely higher than that in other words results of compression experiment after immersion can reduce the effect of uncertainty of δ2h value of water in closed pores for calculation of f 2 δ 2 h cp f δ 2 h op 1 f δ 2 h sq where δ2h cp δ2h op and δ2h sq was δ2h of water in closed pores 55 to 0 that of water in open pores in the case of compression experiment after immersion this is considered to be same as δ2h of solution after equilibrium 1087 and δ2h of squeezed water at the pressure respectively the mixture ratios calculated by eq 2 were shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 when the compression pressure is low below 50 mpa mixture ratio of water from closed pores was low under 1 indicating the effect of closed pore was not significant at low pressure the mixture ratio increased sharply from 50 to 200 mpa with increase of pressure and it reached to 6 at 500 mpa the dependence of mixture ratio on pressure was similar to that of δ2h fig 2 and cl and br concentrations fig 4 for natural rock indicating they were also affected by mixing of water from closed pores the values of f in each pressure were calculated as above in the compression experiment of natural rock δ2h sq was already obtained at each pressure table 1 equations expressing the relationships between δ2h cp and δ2h op were available by substituting f and δ2h sq into eq 2 at each pressure three equations were obtained from the results at 50 100 and 500 mpa and we obtained 3 sets of δ2h cp and δ2h op by dissolving the equations the average value of δ2h op was calculated as 55 4 0 1 and δ2h cp was calculated to be 36 6 1 2 the uncertainties described above are one sigma of 3 values obtained from 3 equations cl concentration in squeezed water was higher than that of solution and increased with increase of pressure it reached to 54 mg l at 500 mpa indicating cl concentration in water in closed pore was higher than 54 mg l cl concentration in water in closed pores was calculated as about 750 mg l with mixture ratio and cl concentration of solution after equilibrium 1 38 mg l by using similar way of δ2h cp aoki 1992 clarified that the water of hot springs near the point where rock a was obtained is affected by high temperature volcanic fluids and they had relatively higher δ2h and cl concentration than local groundwater in addition the pumice in rock a might include a hydrothermal fluid in the pores as a trace of volcanic activity oyama et al 2007 2008 thus the relatively higher δ2h and cl concentration of water in closed pores have been considered to come from volcanic fluids thus combining the results of compression experiment of natural rock and after immersion δ2h and ion concentration in both open and closed pores could be evaluated as mentioned above compression experiment after immersion clearly showed followings 1 significant amount of water from closed pores mixed into squeezed water up to 6 and affected δ2h and ion concentrations cl and br 2 the mixture ratio of water from closed pore increased with increase of pressure and this behavior against pressure showed a good agreement with that of δ2h and cl and br concentrations in natural sample 3 δ2h and cl concentration of water in closed pores was estimated to be 36 6 1 2 and about 750 mg l respectively these were much higher than that of water in open pores and it might be explained by mixing high temperature volcanic fluids 4 water isotopes and ion concentrations could be inferred combining the results of compression experiment of natural rock and after immersion thus the results of compression experiment of rock a could be explained by the effect of closed pores the δ18o was also considered to be affected by water from closed pores however no significant dependence on pressure was observed in the case of δ18o aoki 1992 obtained the water of hot springs near the point where rock a was obtained and showed the relationships between δ2h and δ18o in the water that was affected by high temperature volcanic fluids according to the relationships shown by aoki 1992 δ18o of water in closed pores was assumed to be about 5 0 because δ2h of that was evaluated as 36 6 1 2 on the other hand δ18o of water in the open pores was assumed to be 9 1 according to the measurement of squeezed water at 25 mpa thus if the mixing ratio is 6 the maximum value observed in compression experiment for rock a δ18o of squeezed water was calculated to 8 9 it was assumed that because measurement of δ18o had uncertainty by 0 1 and there was only slight difference between 8 9 and 9 1 the dependence of δ18o on compression pressure was not observed clearly 3 1 2 compression of rock b and comparison between rock a and b in the case of rock b δ2h decreased with increase of pressure from 50 to 300 mpa and δ2h showed stable value from 300 to 500 mpa in the compression experiment of natural rock fig 3 on the other hand significant dependence on pressure was not observed in the case of δ18o the relationships between pressure and cl and br concentrations were summarized in fig 7 and both cl and br concentration decreased with increase of pressure compression experiment after immersion was also carried out for rock b and mixture ratio of water in closed pores was also evaluated by eq 2 the relationships between pressure and δ2h of water squeezed by compression in compression experiment after immersion was indicated in fig 8 in fig 8 δ2h of solution after equilibrium were shown by dashed lines in addition the calculated mixture ratio of water from closed pores into squeezed water at each pressure was indicated in fig 9 in the case of rock b mixture ratio of water from closed pores was smaller than that of rock a and it became maximum at lowest pressure 75 mpa and it decreased with increase of pressure as indicated in figs 8 and 9 this result meant that the effect of closed pore was more significant in lower pressure below 200 mpa in the case of rock b in other words almost of all closed pores in rock b might be opened at 75 mpa unlike the results of rock a as described in part 2 1 rock a was pumiceous tuff oyama et al 2007 2008 and thus it might contain vitreous parts in the rock it was inferred that pores inside of vitreous parts formed the closed pores with water in pores affected by hydrothermal fluid in this case it was assumed that closed pores were mechanically strong and high pressure was required to break the structure of closed pores on the other hand rock b was sedimentary rock and pores in diatom fossils ishii et al 2011 and closed part during sedimentation might form the closed pores it was inferred that such structures may be broken at lower pressure compared to those in vitreous part thus we assumed that the difference in structure of closed pores caused the difference in pressure dependence of mixing ratio of water from closed pores in the compression experiment of natural rock for rock b δ2h decreased with increase of pressure fig 3 and mixing ratio of water from closed pores calculated from the results of compression experiment also decreased with increase of pressure thus water from closed pores was considered to contribute the change in δ2h during compression if δ2h of water in closed pore in rock b was higher than 22 maximum value observed in compression δ2h of water in closed pores in rock b was assumed to be about 0 much higher than 22 because rock b was formed at the bottom of sea and origin of the water in closed pores was considered to be sea water ishii et al 2011 thus it could be inferred that the effect of water from closed pores could be one of the reason of the change in δ2h on compression pressure δ2h of water in open δ2h op and closed pores δ2h cq was calculated by using eq 2 as the same manner of rock a δ2h op was calculated as 25 4 1 5 however calculated δ2h cp showed an unrealistic value over 50 this unrealistic value indicated that the change in δ2h for rock b could not be explained quantitatively by only the effect of closed pores thus it is inferred that some other mechanisms may exist for change of δ2h during the compression in the case of rock b dependence of δ18o on pressure was not observed clearly either in the case of rock b the δ18o of water in open pores was expected to be about 1 5 according to the results of compression experiment of natural rock for rock b the δ18o of water in closed pores was assumed to be about 0 because rock b was formed at the bottom of sea thus the difference in δ18o value between water in open and closed pores 1 5 and 0 0 was not as big as that in δ2h and mixture of about 1 7 of closed pore might not affect to δ18o in the squeezed water cl and br concentrations decreased significantly and those at 500 mpa were about 70 of those at 75 mpa in the case of rock b in the previous study the change in cl concentration during compression had been investigated for rock b nakata et al 2016 according to this study interlayer water of smectite that contains little cl ion is squeezed during compression the squeezed interlayer water dilutes water in pores and this dilution is the main reason of decrease in cl concentration during compression the effect of closed pores also may contribute to changes in ion concentrations during compressions in the case of rock a the change in both δ2h and cl concentration could be explained by the effect of closed pore based on the assumption that δ2h and cl concentration in closed pores is 36 6 1 2 and 750 mg l respectively however in the case of rock b the mixture ratio of water from closed pores was too small up to 1 7 to explain the sharp decrease of cl or br concentration with increase of pressure thus even though effect of closed pores might contribute the changes in cl concentrations it was considered that the main reason of changes in cl and br concentration was dilution with interlayer water of smectite for rock b this dilution might also take place in rock a however the effect of dilution might be much smaller than the effect of closed pore in the case of rock a because the amount of smectite in rock a was very small 3 2 comparison of compression and dve ls method 3 2 1 comparison of water isotopes obtained by 2 methods in figs 10 and 11 δ2h and δ18o evaluated by dve ls were compared with those by compression method for rock a and b respectively in figs 10 and 11 δ2h and δ18o evaluated by dve ls were shown as open circle with error bar three data were indicated in the figures because 3 experiments were conducted in each condition one sigma of 12 times measurement in 2 min described in part 2 3 1 was shown as error bar in each data in the case of rock a fig 10 δ2h obtained by dve ls showed a good agreement with that of squeezed water in lower 75 mpa pressure the mixture ratio of closed pore was below 1 in lower pressure for rock a as indicated in fig 6 therefore squeezed water with lower pressure was considered to be mainly extracted from open pores this could be a reason that δ2h obtained by dve ls coincided with that of squeezed water at lower pressure because water vapor was produced not from closed pore but from surface and open pores δ18o obtained by dve ls also showed similar values to those of squeezed water and this agreement pointed both methods could be applicable for measurement of δ18o of pore water however δ18o obtained by dve ls was seemed like slightly higher than that squeezed water this might include some substantial differences between 2 methods because similar tendency was also shown in rock b fig 11 even though the difference was about 0 1 in average and it could be explained by an error in measurement in the case of rock b δ2h obtained by dve ls was very close to that of squeezed water with high over 300 mpa pressure the effect of closed pore in squeezed water was more significant in lower pressure in the case of rock b therefore δ2h obtained by dve ls was considered to be close to that of water in open pores these results showed that water isotopes obtained by compression method contained both information of open and closed pores while those by dve ls method contained only information of open pores δ18o obtained by dve ls also approximately coincide with that of squeezed water even though it was slightly higher than that of squeezed water as was the case in rock a as described above δ2h and δ18o obtained by dve ls showed a good agreement with that of squeezed water that was not affected by water from closed pores in both rock a and b this result indicated that compression method could provide the mixed information of both closed and open pores and dve ls could show only the information of open pores thus if we compare the results of dve ls and compression we can obtain information about water in closed pore we can assume water isotopes of water in closed pores are higher or lower than that in open pores dve ls method could measure δ2h and δ18o of water in pores within 3 days and dispersion between the 3 results for each condition was found small as indicated in figs 10 and 11 in addition the amount of pore water amount of rock sample required for measurement was small in our experimental conditions over 1 0 g and it could be applied nearly all forms of rock samples cores powders and etc dve ls was again confirmed as a powerful method for measurement of δ2h and δ18o of water in open pores by the comparison with compression method as indicated by hendry et al 2015b 3 2 2 comparison of compression and dve ls dve ls was seemed to have big advantage because the amount of sample needed for measurement was small various samples in forms was applicable it took for only 2 to 3 days for preparation and measurement operation was relatively easy and dispersion in the repeated test was relatively small as indicted by wassenaar et al 2008 and hendry et al 2015b if analyzer that can measure the water isotopes of vapor is available it could be a prime candidate as a method for evaluation of δ2h and δ18o of water in pores compression is also useful because the squeezed water can be used for the other important measurements δ2h and δ18o of squeezed water were affected by water from closed pores and this could be a cause of shift of them during compression the difference between comparison and dve ls might include some information about closed pore and thus comparison is useful to obtain the information about water in closed pores in addition if we can combine the results of compression of natural rock and after immersion mixing ratio of water from closed pore and water isotopes in closed pores could be calculated even though careful attention should be paid because there is possibility that some other mechanisms may exist to change water isotopes in squeezed water information of closed pore may help our understanding about origin and evolution of water in pores curtis et al 1986 in this study the mixing of water from closed pores resulted in a change inδ2h up to 2 to 3 if we need the profile in large scale with large range of variation in δ2h such as 100 this change may not have significant effect on evaluation on the other hand sometimes it is required to discuss about the difference in δ2h by a few and then the effect of closed pore may be significant the effect of water from closed pores may affect the other useful isotopes for evaluating flow of groundwater such as 36cl 35cl 37cl 37cl 35cl and 81br 79br if the cl and br concentrations in close pores were much higher than those in open pores like rock a in this study isotopic ratio of cl and br ions are affected significantly thus in following cases we should consider about the effect of closed pores carefully when we evaluate the isotopic ratio of water and or dissolved ions by compression method 1 when we need only the information about water in open pores that related to migration of groundwater and dissolved ions in the field 2 when it is assumed that water in closed and open pores are significantly different for example in the case that the origin of pore water is sea water and water in open pores has been replaced by fresh water 3 when we need to evaluate the difference in δ2h by a few 4 conclusions in this study the change in water isotopes δ2h and δ18o during compression of rock to extract the pore water was investigated for 2 natural rocks δ2h was found to change during the compression in both rocks the effect of water from the closed pores was found to affect the water isotopes of squeezed water and this could explain a part of the change of water isotopes during compressions in addition water isotopes of water in closed pores could be calculated combining the results of compression of natural rock and after immersion however it was also indicated that there should be the other factors that affect to water isotopes during compressions in addition water isotopes evaluated by compression were compared to those obtained by dve ls water isotopes evaluated by compression that not be affected by water from closed pores showed good agreements with those obtained by dve ls thus it was clarified that compression can provide the mixed information of open and closed pores while dve ls can provide only information of open pores therefore the comparison of compression and dve ls methods is useful to infer the water isotopes in closed pores careful attention should be paid to the effect of closed pores for application of compression when the purpose is to evaluate only open pores and small difference in water isotopes have to be discussed the effect of closed pores may be remarkable when water in open and closed pores are different significantly acknowledgments the authors also wish to thank a yokosuka h shimura t yamaguchi and m yoshioka for helping with the laboratory works the

7293,headwater catchments provide substantial streamflow to rivers even during long periods of drought documenting the mean transit times mtt of stream water in headwater catchments and therefore the retention capacities of these catchments is crucial for water management this study uses time series of 3h activities in combination with major ion concentrations stable isotope ratios and radon activities 222rn in the lyrebird creek catchment in victoria australia to provide a unique insight into the mean transit time distributions and flow systems of this small temperate headwater catchment at all streamflows the stream has 3h activities 2 4 tu that are significantly below those of rainfall 3 2 tu implying that most of the water in the stream is derived from stores with long transit times if the water in the catchment can be represented by a single store with a continuum of ages mean transit times of the stream water range from 6 up to 40 years which indicates the large retention potential for this catchment alternatively variations of 3h activities stable isotopes and major ions can be explained by mixing between of young recent recharge and older water stored in the catchment while surface runoff is negligible the variation in stable isotope ratios major ion concentrations and radon activities during most of the year is minimal 12 and only occurs during major storm events this suggests that different subsurface water stores are activated during the storm events and that these cease to provide water to the stream within a few days or weeks after storm events the stores comprise micro and macropore flow in the soils and saprolite as well as the boundary between the saprolite and the fractured bed rock hydrograph separations from three major storm events using tritium electrical conductivity and selected major ions as well a δ 18 o suggest a minimum of 50 baseflow at most flow conditions we demonstrate that headwater catchments can have a significant storage capacity and that the relationship between long water stores and fast storm event subsurface flow is complex the study also illustrates that using 3h to determine mean transit times is probably only valid for baseflow conditions where the catchment can be represented as a single store the results of this study reinforce the need to protect headwater catchments from contamination and extreme land use changes keywords mean transit times tritium time series headwater catchment hydrograph separation 1 introduction documenting the time taken for water to flow through a catchment until it discharges into the stream network the transit time is crucial for understanding catchment hydrological responses and for water resource protection and management kirchner et al 2010 mcdonnell et al 2010 morgenstern et al 2010 hrachowitz et al 2013 water management authorities have mostly focussed on lowland rivers and larger catchments where rivers flow through low gradient well developed alluvial valleys while neglecting the storage capacities of headwater catchments however headwater streams typically comprise over two thirds of total stream length and contribute a significant proportion of the total flow of many river systems especially at low flow conditions freeman et al 2007 this in turn means that the headwater catchments provide much of the water supply for communities agriculture and industry further downstream groundwater from the near river alluvial sediments generally contributes water to perennial lowland rivers during low flow periods baseflow conditions sophocleous 2002 mccallum et al 2010 cook 2013 by contrast headwater catchments are commonly developed on indurated or crystalline rocks and lack extensive alluvial groundwater systems the observation that many streams in headwater catchments continue to flow over prolonged dry periods indicates that there are stores of water in soils weathered basement rocks or fractures with retention times of at least a few years maloszewski et al 1983 1992 rice and hornberger 1998 protecting headwater catchments is vital while many upper catchments retain native vegetation and are protected under national park legislation increasing population growth as well as economic development have led to progressive changes in landuse in these areas including plantation forestry agriculture and peri urban developments the impacts of such development on the catchments and consequently on the river systems as a whole is currently poorly understood understanding the timescales of water movement within the catchments and the importance of the different water stores is essential for understanding flow generation and providing catchment characteristic baselines for water management authorities 1 1 runoff processes in headwater catchments that headwater catchments provide substantial flow to river systems even during prolonged dry periods implies that they store and eventually release water back into the rivers becker 2005 many geochemical studies suggest that a large component of storm runoff is also composed of water that has been stored in the catchment rather than direct surface runoff this is often termed the old water paradox sklash and farvolden 1979 kirchner 2003 mcdonnell et al 1990 kienzler and naef 2008 there are two main mechanisms by which old water emerges in streams firstly displacement of stored water by infiltrating rainfall and secondly a pressure wave propagation from the infiltrating rain resulting in increased groundwater discharge to the stream hydraulic loading klaus et al 2013 the total groundwater or subsurface flow is a sum of water release from all subsurface stores including deeper groundwater soil water and interflow there has been significant research into distinguishing faster from slower subsurface flow jencso and mcglynn 2011 bogaart et al 2013 berne et al 2005 several studies have shown that flow at the hillslope scale is a combination of matrix flow or displacement mixed with preferential flow the ratios of matrix flow to preferential flow vary widely between studies and catchments and range from 1 to 90 leaney et al 1993 kumar et al 1997 vogel et al 2010 allaire et al 2009 stumpp and maloszewski 2010 the variability of the distribution of matrix flow versus preferential flow is linked to soil types geology and vegetation klaus et al 2015 preferential flow paths such as macropores soil pipes cracks from clay shrinkage root channels and animal burrows provide path ways with a multitude of flow velocities which are generally well above those of water travelling through the soil matrix pores davies et al 2013 kienzler and naef 2008 beven and germann 2013 van schaik et al 2014 the dynamic mixing and displacement of groundwater with these ranges of velocities create a complexity in catchment response and therefore also influence the transit times the mean transit time at a catchment outlet then represents a mix of water from all different flow paths 1 2 determining transit times in headwater catchments there are several methods that may be used to determine the transit times of water in catchments mcdonnell et al 2010 as transit times increase any variation in the geochemistry of rainfall is progressively attenuated thus comparing the temporal variation of stable isotope ratios or major ion concentrations in the stream water with those in rainfall can be used to derive transit times mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 mcdonnell et al 2010 kirchner et al 2010 hrachowitz et al 2013 mean transit times of stream water have also been estimated by fitting the variability of stable isotope ratios in the stream water to those of rainfall with sine wave functions rodgers et al 2005 tetzlaff et al 2007 tekleab et al 2014 alternatively when combined with models that describe the distribution of flow paths in a catchment maloszewski 2000 the variation in stable isotopes or major ion geochemistry at the catchment outlet can be used to quantify mean transit times while this approach has been applied with some success there are several limitations firstly it requires high frequency ideally sub weekly stable isotope and or major ion geochemistry rainfall and streamflow records of at least the duration of the transit time of water in the catchment timbe et al 2015 these records are not commonly available especially where transit times are more than a few years secondly a single estimate of the transit time is commonly made whereas water of different ages may contribute to the stream at baseflow and higher flow conditions morgenstern et al 2010 morgenstern and daughney 2012 finally the above mentioned tracers are ineffective where transit times are in excess of 4 5 years as the initial tracer variation over time is attenuated stewart et al 2010 duvert et al 2016 tritium 3h is an ideal tracer for determining water transit times in catchments 3h is part of the water molecule and its abundance in water isolated from the atmosphere is controlled only by radioactive decay and not by reactions between the water and the aquifer matrix as is the case with some solute tracers it has a half life of 12 32 years and with high precision low background analyses morgenstern and taylor 2009 it can be utilised to estimate mean transit times of over 100 years morgenstern et al 2010 the 3h input function in rainfall has a distinct peak in the 1950s to 1960s due to the production of 3h by the atmospheric thermonuclear tests the so called bomb pulse traditionally the propagation of the bomb pulse has been utilised to trace the flow of water recharged during this period fritz et al 1991 clark and fritz 1997 since the mid 1960s atmospheric 3h activities have declined in the northern hemisphere single 3h measurements currently yield non unique mean transit time estimates although mean transit times may be estimated using 3h time series the bomb pulse 3h peak was several orders of magnitude lower in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere clark and fritz 1997 morgenstern et al 2010 and the 3h activities of remnant bomb pulse water have now decayed well below those of modern rainfall this allows unique mean transit times to be estimated from single 3h activities morgenstern et al 2010 morgenstern and daughney 2012 consequently the transit time of stream water can be determined for a specific time or at different streamflows by extension 3h can be used to test whether older and younger reservoirs contribute water to streamflow at different stages of the hydrological cycle because 3h activities in rainfall have been measured globally for several decades global network or isotopes in precipiation 2016 tadros et al 2014 3h input into many catchments is relatively well known calculating precise transit times may be difficult due to the unknown complexity of the catchment flow system however since the 3h bomb pulse has mostly disappeared in the southern hemisphere relative transit times do not depend on the accuracy of the assumed flow model and water with low 3h activities has longer transit times than water with tritium activities closer to those of rainfall this in turns allows tritium activities to be directly compared to other parameters such as streamflow stable isotopes and major ion concentrations cartwright and morgenstern 2015 1 3 understanding water sources soil water runoff and groundwater from aquifers with different mineralogy most likely have different major ion and trace element geochemistries gaillardet et al 1999 herczeg and edmunds 2000 cartwright et al 2007 2012 cartwright and morgenstern 2012 soulsby and tetzlaff 2008 hofmann and cartwright 2013 edmunds 2009 for example soil water commonly has elevated si and k concentrations waters derived from sedimentary rocks may have higher ca concentrations if carbonate dissolution has occurred and waters from granitic aquifers commonly have high na k or ca concentrations due to the weathering of feldspar and other silicate minerals hofmann and cartwright 2013 the stable isotope ratios of water leaving a catchment progress towards the weighted mean value of annual rainfall when residence times in the catchment are sufficient to attenuate seasonal variations although this precludes their use in terms of transit time estimations they can be used to separate the baseflow during high flow periods via a mass balance hugenschmidt et al 2014 radon 222rn which is part of the 238u to 206pb decay series is commonly used to determine the distribution and quantity of groundwater inflows to streams and rivers cartwright et al 2014b cook 2013 222rn reaches secular equilibrium with its parent isotope 226ra over a few weeks cecil and green 2000 the concentration of 226ra in minerals is several orders of magnitude higher than dissolved 226ra in surface water which results in 222rn activities in groundwater also being orders of magnitude higher than in streams cook 2013 cecil and green 2000 adsorption of 226ra onto hydroxides clays and organic substrates may increase 222rn activities in soils and weathered rocks chabaux et al 2011 high 222rn activities in surface water therefore indicate that groundwater or soil water discharges into the stream the differentiation between groundwater and soil water or interflow using 222rn is difficult 222rn activities in the soil waters are commonly higher than in water from the saprolite or the bedrock due to the higher emanation potential in the weathered soils while 222rn requires approximately three weeks to reach secular equilibrium dissolution of already existing 222rn in the unsaturated zone occurs instantly when rain water infiltrates into the subsurface and mixes with the existing soil air surbeck 1993 1 4 aims and objectives the aim of the project was to investigate headwater mean transit times in a small 7 3 km2 temperate headwater catchments in victoria australia at varying streamflows the project integrates monthly tritium activities major ion concentrations stable isotopes ratios and 222rn activities collected over a years the tritium and stable isotope data are used to estimate the transit times of water in the catchment the catchment behaviour is investigated by high frequency sampling over storm events the combination of stable isotope major ion chemistry and 3h data over storm events is used to assess the changing stores of water in the catchment despite the advantages of 3h in directly understanding the transit times of water during high streamflow it has been little used for this purpose crouzet et al 1970 kennedy et al 1986 with the diminishing of the bomb pulse 3h holds the potential to resolve the inputs from different water stores during high streamflows and thus allows to better understand how catchments respond to rainfall 2 methods 2 1 site description and catchment characteristics the lyrebird creek catchment is part of the yarra river catchment and is located in the dandenong ranges national park west of melbourne australia fig 1 it is a 7 3 km2 headwater catchment and is mostly covered 90 in pristine eucalypt forest with dense undergrowth vegetation lyrebird creek is a first order stream draining the catchment to the northeast the southern catchment boundary is the highest part of the catchment with an elevation of 580 m while the catchment outlet at olinda road is at 220 m fig 1 average yearly rainfall at montrose approximately 5 km west of lyrebird creek between 2009 and 2014 is 1044 mm australian bureau of meteorology 2015 with an average evapotranspiration loss over the same period of 75 in this temperate climate most of the rainfall occurs during the austral winter while the highest evapotranspiration rates occur during summer average summer temperatures range from 11 30 c and winter temperatures range from 3 5 13 c australian bureau of meteorology 2015 lyrebird creek is perennial at the catchment outlet at olinda road however the reaches upstream of boundary road fig 1 may dry up in summer flow at olinda road between 2006 and 2013 ranged from 0 48 to 52 9 ml day 1 the flow varies with annual rainfall with a median flow q50 of 3 91 ml day 1 for the period from 2000 to 2012 samantha imberger university of melbourne personal communications due to the below average rainfall the median flow was 2 1 ml day 1 in 2013 fig 2 the gentle slope of the flow duration curve and a 90 occurrence of flows smaller than 8 43 and 4 64 ml day 1 indicates that surface runoff only occurs after major storm events the average annual flow of lyrebird creek is 1550 ml but the 2013 flow was 67 of the long term average at 1140 ml this is due to rainfall in 2013 being lower 982 6 mm than the average of 1044 mm australian bureau of meteorology 2015 streamflows were low 1 34 ml day 1 during april 2013 and may 2013 as a consequence of a relatively dry summer monthly flows increased to peaks of 34 08 ml day 1 in november 2013 after intensive rainfall with monthly rainfall totals of over 100 mm for august september and october and november the lyrebird catchment lies within dandenong ranges igneous complex which consists of devonian volcanic rhyolitic and dacitic ignimbrites hornfels in the east of the catchment forms the boundary between the devonian volcanics and palaeogene tholeiitic lava flows tweed et al 2005 2006 the volcanic rocks are underlain by palaeozoic marine metasediments of the lachlan fold belt which underlie most of the melbourne region there are minor deposits of quaternary alluvium along the streams in the northern central part of the lyrebird catchment deep saprolitic weathering forms kaolinite rich red loamy soils the total depth is unknown but is estimated at 1 5 m at the top of the catchment to 3 m at the catchment outlet hand augering showed that the root zone of the vegetation penetrates the soils to at least 2 m the lower altitude alluvial areas are rich in clay and organic matter which results in swampy waterlogged areas in the proximity of the lyrebird creek that are regularly flooded the palaeozoic basement comprises an unconfined fractured rock aquifer due to the complex geology and the high degree of fracturing groundwater flow is variable but the general flow direction follows the topography to the north towards the yarra river tweed et al 2005 investigated the larger dandenong ranges area and suggested that the catchment is relatively variable with respect to rainfall and recharge with bore hydrographs responding to seasonal precipitation changes with a lag of 2 to 3 months 2 2 sample collection lyrebird creek was sampled at least monthly at the catchment outlet at olinda road and boundary road which is the furthest upstream location where the stream is perennial between april 2013 and february 2014 fig 1 stream water was sampled directly from the stream into 1 litre high density polyethylene hdpe bottles in addition to the monthly samples stream water was collected at olinda road over three storm events two minor events in october 2013 and a major storm event in november 2013 the storm event samples were taken using an isco 6712 autosampler teledyne isco inc with remote trigger and a 24 1 litre sample carousel the autosampler samples were collected 1 day after the storm events bottled in 1 litre hdpe bottles refrigerated until further processing push point piezometers were driven into the sediments to a depth of approximately 1 m near the stream 1 2 m distance at eagles nest and olinda road fig 1 a small diameter bailer was used to extract water from the push point piezometers soil water was sampled using suction cup soil moisture samplers ums germany at depths of 40 and 80 cm at three locations hilltop mid slope and valley fig 1 four water samples were also taken directly from discrete discharge points from the soils on a road cutting at boundary road during the november storm event flow at the road cutting only occurred during major storm events and were dry during the rest of the study period overland flow was sampled during the november storm event by collecting running water on the hillslope into 125 ml hdpe bottles rainwater was sampled at monash university approximately 30 km from field site on an event basis rainwater was also collected monthly at olinda road using a funnel rain collector mounted 1 5 m above ground the rain collector sampled a mixture of rainfall and throughfall under the canopy cover and was emptied monthly a thin paraffin film was added to the rainwater sampler to prevent evaporation chemical analysis of rainwater is equivalent to those of creek and groundwater which is described below 2 3 geochemical and isotope analyses electrical conductivity ec was measured in the field using a calibrated wtw meter and probe continuous ec was measured at boundary road and olinda road using a winsitu aquatroll 200 on a 15 min time step samples for cation analysis were filtered through 0 45 μm nitrate cellulose filters and acidified to ph 2 with 16 m hno3 and analysed at monash university using a thermofinnigan inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms samples for anion analysis were filtered through 0 45 μm nitrate cellulose filters and analysed using a metrohm ion chromatograph at monash university the precision of anion and cation analyses based on replicates is 2 and the accuracy based on analysis of certified water standards is 5 hco3 and dissolved co2 with a precision of 5 10 were determined by titration using a hach field titration kit rainfall bicarbonate concentrations were not measured due to the small volumes and long residence time in the sample containers δ 18 o and δ 2 h values were measured at monash university using finnigan mat 252 and thermofinnigan deltaplus advantage mass spectrometers δ 18 o was analysed via equilibration with he co2 at 32 c for 24 48 h in a thermofinnigan gas bench δ 2 h was measured by reaction with cr at 850 c using an automated finnigan mat h device δ 18 o and δ 2 h values were measured relative to internal standards calibrated against iaea smow gisp and slap data were normalised following the method by coplen 1988 and are expressed relative to v smow precision 1 σ based on replicate analysis is δ 18 o 0 1 and δ 2 h 1 samples for 3h were vacuum distilled and enriched by electrolysis prior to being analysed by liquid scintillation spectrometry using quantulus ultra low level counters at the institute of geological and nuclear sciences gns new zealand following the improvements from morgenstern and taylor 2009 the sensitivity is now further increased to a lower detection limit of 0 02 tu via tritium enrichment by a factor of 95 and reproducibility of tritium enrichment of 1 is achieved via deuterium calibration for every sample the precision 1 sigma is 1 8 at 2 tu 3h activities are expressed in tritium units tu where 1tu represents a 3h 1h ratio of 1 10 18 222rn activities in stream water and pipe flow were determined using a portable radon in air monitor rad 7 durridge co following methods described by burnett and dulaiova 2006 a glass flask of 0 5 l was filled and 222rn was degassed for 5 min into a closed air loop of fixed volume calibrated by manufacturer incorporating the rad 7 counting times were 1 2 h for stream water typical relative precision is 3 at 10 000 bq m 3 and 10 at 100 bq m 3 soil water samples from suction cups were too small for 222rn analysis and the vacuum in the sample container would induce degassing 222rn emanation rates were estimated from three soil samples collected at the top of the catchment at boundary road in the middle of the catchment at eagles nest and at the lower catchment at olinda road dried soil samples of known weight were filled in airtight containers distilled water was then added and the container was closed for 5 weeks by which time the rate of 222rn production and decay have reached secular equilibrium after 5 weeks 40 ml of pore water was extracted and analysed for 222rn using the same method as described above but with counting times of 12 h emanation rates γ and equilibrium 222rn activities of the sediments in the catchment were calculated from the 222rn activity of the extracted pore water following lamontagne and cook 2007 assuming a matrix density of 2800 kg m 3 and a porosity of 0 35 which are appropriate for silty soils with moderate clay content 2 4 estimating transit times the time taken for water to flow through a catchment from where it recharges to where it discharges into a stream the transit time can be estimated using simplified lumped parameter models that reflect the geometry and distribution of flow paths within a catchment stewart and fahey 2010 jurgens et al 2012 these models are based on simplified aquifer geometries and account for effects of dispersion and mixing of water that has followed flow paths of different lengths jurgens et al 2012 for steady state flow the convolution integral relates the tracer input over time c inp and the tracer concentration at the catchment outlet c out maloszewski 2000 1 c out c inp t τ h τ exp λ τ d τ where t is the sampling time τ is the transit time h τ is the flow model or response function of the hydrological system and λ is the decay constant 0 0563 yr 1 for 3h the exponential term represents the radioactive decay of 3h stewart et al 2010 lumped parameter models are most easily applied to conservative tracers such as 3h or the stable isotopes that migrated at the same rate as the water jurgens et al 2012 the application of these models to a specific catchment requires a conceptual understanding of the geometry of the groundwater flow system the exponential flow model em describes mean transit times in a homogeneous unconfined aquifer of constant thickness and with uniform recharge the combined flow to a stream at the outflow constitutes water from flow paths from the entire aquifer that have an exponential transit time distribution stewart et al 2010 the piston flow model pfm assumes linear flow with no mixing within the aquifer such that all water discharging to a stream at one point in time has the same transit time one of the most commonly used models is the exponential piston flow model epm it is a combination of the piston flow model where the catchment has regions of linear flow and regions where the flow paths have an exponential distribution morgenstern et al 2010 the solution to 1 for the exponential piston flow model is given by zuber et al 2005 2 h τ 0 for τ m 1 f 3 h τ f τ m 1 exp τ f τ m 1 f 1 for τ τ m 1 f where τ m is the mean residence time and f the ratio of the volume of the aquifer that exhibits exponential flow to the total aquifer volume the epm is widely used to estimate transit times in catchments where the water in the stream follows flow paths of varying lengths but where parts of the aquifer are confined or where there is vertical recharge through the unsaturated zone above an aquifer that exhibits exponential flow stewart et al 2010 cartwright and hofmann 2016 the dispersion model dm is based on the one dimensional advection dispersion equation for fluid flow in porous media maloszewski 2000 jurgens et al 2012 while not always considered to be a realistic conceptualisation of the flow system it has been shown to reproduce time series of tracer activities stewart et al 2010 it incorporates two parameters a mean age and a dimensionless dispersion parameter dp dp is the inverse of the peclet number and describes the relative importance of dispersion and advection dp d v x where d is the dispersion coefficient in m2 day 1 v is velocity in m day 1 and x is distance in m jurgens et al 2012 4 h τ 1 τ 4 π dp τ τ m exp 1 τ τ m 2 4 dp τ τ m dp dispersion parameter dispersion coefficient d vx together these are the most commonly used lumped parameter models for determining mean transit times mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 in catchments where long time series i e several years data are available they have reproduced the measured variation in 3h activities over time maloszewski and zuber 1982 zuber et al 2005 gusyev et al 2013 morgenstern et al 2015 the mean transit times were calculated by comparing the observed 3h activity with those predicted by the transit time model jurgens et al 2012 because 3h activities are not affected by reactions in the unsaturated zone the estimated mean transit times reflect both recharge through the unsaturated zone and flow through the aquifers 2 5 mass balance calculations and binary mixing models if sufficiently large the difference in major ion concentration stable isotope ratios 3h or 222rn activities in subsurface water and rainwater can be used to estimate the contributions of baseflow and storm event water sklash and farvolden 1979 godsey et al 2009 via 5 q out c out q event c event q base c base c out and q out are the flow and tracer concentration at the catchment outlet q event and c event are the flow generated by surface runoff and interflow and tracer concentrations of rainfall and q base and c base are the flow and tracer concentration of subsurface catchment water stores 3 results the presentation of the results is split in two parts first the monthly sampling that constrains general catchment behaviour and second the short term storm event sampling that encapsulates catchment behaviour following storm events the distinction is made on the frequency occurrence of flows where 0 to 10 q10 represents high flows and 10 represents low flows fig 2 the equivalent flow value for q10 is 5 ml day the results from monthly observations are discussed first 3 1 tritium activities an accumulated rainwater sample collected at monash university between may and december 2013 had a 3h activity of 2 72 tu a 12 months rainfall sample from yarra junction 30 km nw of the study area collected in 2016 had a similar 3h activity of 2 76 tu cartwright unpublished data the highest 3h activity measured in lyrebird creek stream water at olinda road was 2 4 tu while water from the interflow through macro pores had a 3h activities of 2 9 tu table 1 the 3h activities of the 13 monthly stream samples from olinda road and the 5 samples at boundary road ranged from 1 43 to 2 38 tu and 1 69 and 2 23 tu respectively table 1 3h activities in the stream water were correlated with streamflow r2 0 91 but were always lower than those of rainfall fig 3 b the lowest 3h activity 1 43 tu was recorded in april 2013 at the end of the austral summer when flow at olinda rd was 1 31 ml day 1 fig 3a the activities increased slightly to 1 84 tu after a few storm events at the end of may and the beginning of june 3h activities decreased to below 1 6 tu at multiple times during the sampling year highest overall streamflows in the winter and spring were 20 25 ml day 1 and 3h activities at these times were as high as 2 4 tu the 3h activities at boundary road were approximately 6 3 to 10 2 higher than at olinda road but displayed a similar relationship to streamflow fig 3b 3 2 stable isotopes the δ 18 o and δ 2 h values of stream water from lyrebird creek from all sampling rounds were close to the local meteoric water line for melbourne global network or isotopes in precipiation 2016 which has a slope of 7 48 and a d excess of 8 75 fig 4 the δ 18 o and δ 2 h values of the rainfall from the lyrebird catchment had a slope of 6 02 δ 18 o values were between 6 8 and 1 1 a range of 5 7 and the and δ 2 h values were between 44 and 6 a range of 50 rainfall from melbourne monash university had a much larger range 12 2 for δ 18 o and 79 9 for δ 2 h some of the difference can be attributed to the samples for melbourne being collected on an event basis while those for lyrebird creek catchment were composite samples the δ 18 o and δ 2 h values of stream water for lyrebird creek at olinda road over the sample period varied between 6 0 and 5 1 and 35 and 26 respectively fig 4 the average δ 18 o and δ 2 h values in the stream water were similar to those of rainfall however the ranges are much less in the stream water the δ 18 o and δ 2 h values at boundary road higher in the catchment were more variable ranging between 6 5 and 3 1 and 39 and 16 respectively the stable isotope values of the soil water samples had a similar spatial variability as the stream water stable isotope ratios the δ 18 o and δ 2 h values of the soil waters ranged from 6 5 to 3 1 and 39 to 16 at boundary road and 5 8 to 3 0 and 37 to 29 at olinda road respectively 3 3 major ions and 222rn the ec of rainfall ranged from 10 to 51 μs cm and is similar to rainfall ec values in southeast australia blackburn and mcleod 1983 ec values of lyrebird creek at olinda road ranged from 86 to 115 μs cm and those at boundary road ranged from 82 to 96 μs cm respectively there is no correlation of the monthly measured ec values with streamflow groundwater from the fractured rock basement is not accessible in the study area but soil water ec values in the lyrebird catchment were lower than those of the groundwater ranging from 56 μs cm in the upper catchment at boundary road to 195 μs cm in the lower catchment at olinda road the temporal variability of ec in the soil water samples is minor there was a general downstream increase in ec values in lyrebird creek from 62 to 101 μs cm at boundary road to 81 to 115 μs cm at olinda road while some of the high storm events are missing continuous ec data due to clogging of the logger by sediments there was a general decrease of ec values with increasing streamflows following storm events the lowest ec value of 62 2 μs cm was recorded during a major storm event in october 2013 the major ion chemistry of the stream water was dominated by na cl and hco3 na concentrations ranged from 9 to 16 48 mg l 1 at boundary road and from 11 11 to 18 38 mg l 1 at olinda road fig 5 a k concentrations ranged from 1 14 to 2 0 mg l 1 at boundary road 1 3 to 2 3 mg l 1 at olinda road ca and mg concentrations ranged from 1 1 to 2 1 mg l 1 and 1 2 to 2 2 mg l 1 at boundary road and 1 2 to 2 3 mg l 1 and 1 5 to 2 5 mg l 1 at olinda road rainfall had na concentrations of 1 9 to 13 5 mg l 1 k concentrations of 1 0 to 4 1 mg l 1 ca concentrations of 1 1 to 7 4 mg l 1 and mg concentrations of 0 36 to 3 2 mg l 1 soil water na concentrations ranged from 7 3 to 13 8 mg k from 1 1 to 3 3 mg l 1 ca from 0 2 to 3 5 mg l 1 and mg from 0 8 to 3 2 mg l 1 na ca and mg concentrations were generally higher in the shallow groundwater from piezometers compared to the soil water with concentrations ranging from 16 1 to 23 3 mg l 1 3 6 to 6 9 mg l 1 and 2 8 to 5 mg l 1 while k concentrations were lower ranging from 1 1 to 1 9 mg l 1 the major anions were cl and hco3 cl concentrations ranged from 12 to 18 6 mg l 1 at boundary road and from 5 9 to 19 45 at olinda road hco3 concentrations ranged from 4 7 to 8 4 at boundary road and from 3 9 to 11 3 mg l 1 at olinda road so4 concentrations ranged from 1 8 to 2 9 mg l 1 at boundary road and 0 3 to 3 1 mg l 1 at olinda road rainfall had between 0 9 and 36 5 mg l 1 cl and 0 14 to 4 5 mg l 1 so4 cl concentrations in soil water ranged from 8 to 17 mg l 1 which is similar to those in the shallow groundwater ranging from 11 6 to 16 42 mg l 1 hco3 was also only measures for a small number of samples due to the lack of sufficient sample concentrations that were measured in the soil water ranged from 1 8 to 4 9 mg l 1 so4 in the soil water ranged from 1 to 3 3 mg l 1 at boundary road and 0 1 to 6 4 at olinda road no3 concentrations in the stream were 0 7 to 8 9 mg l 1 at boundary road and 0 45 to 9 1 mg l 1 at olinda road no3 concentrations in rainfall were generally below 1 mg l 1 upper catchment soil water no3 concentrations were also very low and comparable to those of rainfall ranging from 0 to 0 15 mg l 1 soil water no3 concentrations were significantly higher in the lower catchment ranging from 0 1 to 8 7 mg l 1 fig 5b stream water 222rn activities were generally lower in the upper catchment than in the lower catchment ranging from 213 8 bq m 3 to 1 038 0 bq m 3 at boundary road and 400 8 bq m 3 to 1 611 0 bq m 3 median of 884 4 bq m 3 at olinda road 222rn activities of the water samples from the discrete discharge points in the road cutting at boundary during the major storm event in november 2013 were 1 930 5 208 and 5 146 bq m 3 calculated 222rn emanation rates γ from the soils were higher 8 947 449 bq m 3 day 1 for sediments at boundary road than those in the middle and the lower parts of the catchment γ 4364 232 bq m 3 day 1 at eagles nest and 2 513 118 bq m 3 day 1 at olinda road equilibrium 222rn are given by

major ion chemistry during storm events storm runoff was sampled during three storm events at the beginning of october 2013 e1 late october 2013 e2 and middle of november 2013 e3 the three storm events had different streamflow magnitudes with maximum streamflows of 5 6 ml day 1 e1 9 06 ml day 1 e2 and 34 08 ml day 1 e3 recorded at olinda road fig 6 table 2 storm events e1 and e2 lasted for approximately three days while the higher streamflows during the event e3 had the highest flow and lasted for more than a week fig 6 event e3 has a double flow peak with streamflows of 28 04 ml day 1 at 14 00 on the 13th nov and 34 08 ml day 1 at 03 35 on the 14th nov the 3h activities of stream water at olinda road during the e3 event increased with increasing flow from 1 56 tu prior to the storm event at streamflows of 3 64 ml day 1 to a maximum of 2 49 tu at 20 92 ml day 1 streamflow close to the peak of the storm event there was a similar increase in 3h activities at boundary road from 1 7 tu prior to storm event e3 to 2 3 tu during the storm event 3h activities declined as streamflow fell but on november 18 4 days after the peak when streamflow was 6 8 ml day 1 the 3h activity was still higher 1 8 tu than those recorded before storm event e3 the interflow sample at boundary road collected during storm event e3 had a 3h activity of 2 9 tu which is higher than those recorded in the stream the δ 18 o values of the monthly stream samples averaged 5 6 and lyrebird creek had similar δ 18 o values at the start of each of the storm events the first storm event e1 was not captured entirely and samples were only taken as streamflow receded fig 7 a during the second storm event e2 δ 18 o values of rainfall was 1 8 which was higher than the average δ 18 o values of stream and groundwater δ 18 o values as a consequence δ 18 o values of the stream increased to 4 8 close to peak streamflows decreased to 5 6 as the streamflows decreased the δ 18 o value of rainfall during storm event e3 was 10 63 and the δ 18 o values of the stream water decreased with increasing flow the minimum δ 18 o value of 7 1 was reached on the 13th november at 9 15 approximately 5 h before the first flow peak the δ 18 o values increased to 5 6 and reached a second low of 6 6 at 6 15 on november 14 approximately 3 h after the second peak table 2 δ 18 o values subsequently increased to those close to the average δ 18 o values in the stream water within a 3 h and remained stable as streamflows decreased ec values were lower than the average of the stream water during each of the storm events and reached a minimum value of 62 μs cm at the first peak of e3 fig 6a the ec increased between the two flow peaks and reached a second minimum at the second flow peak while the streamflow of this peak was higher than the first the decrease in ec was less to 72 μs cm this is similar to the behaviour of the stable isotope data some of the major ion concentrations decreased during the peak streamflows while others increased na concentrations for example decreased during the peak streamflow of e3 but na cl ratios remained nearly constant fig 7b and c k concentrations and li cl ratios increased from 1 2 to 1 3 mg l 1 and 0 1 to 0 16 to 2 06 mg l 1 and 0 50 respectively fig 7d and f no3 concentrations increased significantly with a peak of 9 mg l 1 at shortly after the second peak during e3 fig 7e stream water 222rn activity was 784 bq m 3 on the 6th november at low flows the 222rn activities of the stream water in the middle of the large storm event e3 on 14th november was 1 357 bq m 3 water emerging from macropores of 1 2 cm in diameter had 222rn activities of 5 146 and 5 208 bq m 3 on the same day the macropores were approximately 50 100 cm underneath the surface and were accessible at the road cut of boundary road the 222rn activity of one of these macropores that was still flowing a week later was 1 930 bq m 3 4 discussion the small variation in major ion chemistry and stable isotopes at baseflow in the stream suggests that there is a single store of water generating the streamflow similar to catchments elsewhere in southeast australia cartwright and morgenstern 2016 the lyrebird creek catchment is envisaged to be fed by a single store of water that becomes progressively older as the catchment receives less rainfall and dries up water originates then from deeper soils horizons and the saprolite the greater variability in major ion chemistry and stable isotopes during the storm events suggest that discrete mixing between different water stores occurs at these times a two component hydrograph separation was used to separate between old and a young components of storm event streamflow at olinda road we deliberately use the terms old and young and not ground water and surface water as we will show that surface water contributions are negligible and most of the runoff derives from subsurface stores with rainwater tritium activities of 3 tu median of measured rain water activities and old water activities of 1 56 tu in the week preceding the storm event the hydrograph separation reveals an overall old water contribution of 48 fig 8 table 2 similar results are achieved using ec and no3 with 45 and 42 old water component respectively ec values for old and new water were estimated from existing ec values for soil water average of 154 μs cm and rain water average of 30 μs cm no3 concentrations in shallow groundwater are lower than those in the soil water during peak flow no3 increases to 9 mg l 1 indicating runoff generation from shallow soil and interception the rainfall δ 18 o value was 10 6 during e3 the old water δ 18 o value is estimated as 5 5 0 3 based on the average of baseflow groundwater and soil water the large difference between the rainwater δ 18 o value of 10 6 and the δ 18 o values of the streamflow during the storm event results in very high estimated old water contributions of 83 fig 8 the fact that the stable isotope values decrease towards rainfall values indicate that there is a change in water stores over the storm event with the majority of water from stores that do not have average δ 18 o values furthermore the observation that all three storm events have different shifts in δ 18 o values implies that there is a component of inhomogenised water mixing with water from older stores discharging to the stream at these times fig 7a the mixing model indicates that the total flow during major storm events consists of at least half of old water sources of decadal time scales and a younger water from a source or sources which is most likely in the range of multiple months to 5 years the proportion of old water is 90 during low flow periods and gets to a minimum of 50 at high flow over entire storm events 3h mass balance the old water proportion is still 35 at peak flow fig 8 which was shown during the storm event e3 in november 2013 direct surface runoff only occurs to a small degree during very large storm events in the absence of larger alluvial aquifers all water stores must be located in the soil profile or saprolite the flow age differences likely reflect which part of the soil profile is active younger water is likely stored in the upper parts of the soil while older water fills the deeper parts of the soils and the saprolite 4 1 mean transit times during baseflow during baseflow streamflow is generated from a single store assuming that groundwater inflow from the deeper fractured rock aquifers is minimal most of the subsurface water will come from the soil and or the saprolite bedrock interface in common with flow systems elsewhere in australia it is assumed that flow through the unsaturated zone follows a piston flow distribution while the deeper soils saprolite and fractured rock is characterised by exponential flow morgenstern et al 2010 stewart and fahey 2010 duvert et al 2016 based on the studies by morgenstern et al 2010 stewart and fahey 2010 duvert et al 2016 that address flow in similar scale catchments we calculated mean transit times using an exponential piston flow model a value for f of 0 85 successfully reproduced the time series variation of tracers in some of those catchments and we initially adopt this value here fig 9 a table 1 morgenstern and daughney 2012 to assess the sensitivity of the transit time estimations to choice of model mean transit times were also calculated using the exponential flow model f 1 and the dispersion model fig 9b melbourne has a long annual and sub annual record of rainfall 3h activities the 3h activity of rainfall in melbourne peaked at 62 tu in 1965 and decreased exponentially to modern day rainfall weighted activities of between 2 8 and 3 2 tu by 1995 international atomic energy agency global network of isotopes in precipitation program tadros et al 2014 the 3h input function was based on the data of tadros et al 2014 which is derived from rainfall at melbourne airport 60 km from the study area with missing values estimated by the function that describes the atmospheric 3h activities for melbourne based on the study of tadros et al 2014 the 3h activity of modern rainfall collected at monash university and the water samples from the discrete discharge points in the road cutting at boundary road during one of the major storm events a 3h activity of modern rainfall of 3 tu was utilised the estimated mean transit times differ between the models the epm produces generally younger estimates compared with the exponential model and the dispersion model fig 9b for the monthly samples which represent the q10 flows mean transit times estimated using the epm vary from 43 years at the lowest streamflows 3h 1 43 tu to 33 years at higher streamflow 3h 2 1 tu these calculations used a 3h activity of modern rainfall of 3 tu the mean transit times of baseflow are relatively insensitive to the assumed 3h activities of modern rainfall for example varying the 3h activity of modern rainfall between 2 4 tu highest value in stream water and 3 5 tu based on tadros et al 2014 results in a range of mean transit times from the epm of 0 to 46 years the decrease in mean transit times with increasing streamflow fig 9a suggests progressive activation of shallower younger water stores probably as the catchment wets up the mean transit times of the stream water during storm events is difficult to constrain with lumped parameter model as it is likely that there is discrete mixing between older and younger water stores in the catchment this is discussed further below however the rapid decrease of 3h activities in the stream after storm events suggests that most of the streamflow consists of several decades old water independent of the lumped parameter model approach taken or rainfall input function variability 3h activities lower than 1 8 tu imply mean transit times of 10 years which is the upper limit of baseflow monthly rainfall δ 18 o records from the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip for melbourne were analysed for a better understanding of long term stable isotope fluctuations and seasonal trends the long term monthly average δ 18 o indicate a clear seasonality for melbourne with higher δ 18 o values during summers and lower values during winter fig 10 the δ 18 o values of the stream water varied in a narrow range with higher values in winter and lower values in summer inverse to the rainfall trends transit times cannot be estimated from the stable isotopes but the dampening of the rainfall stable isotope variations in the stream water implies that transit times are longer and that there is little direct input of rainfall or runoff 4 2 source of water in the catchment the water stores in the catchment most likely comprise soil water groundwater from the fractured basement and groundwater flowing along the boundary between the saprolite and the basement rocks groundwater flow through the fractured basement is probably a minor contributor to the overall streamflow of lyrebird creek and most streamflow is likely generated by water stored in the micro pores of the soil and saprolite macropore flow contributes significantly during storm events but ceases shortly after the rainfall has ceased the higher cation cl ratios in stream water soilwater and shallow groundwater from the piezometers are compared to those of rainfall implies that mineral weathering occurs in the catchment na concentrations in the stream decrease during higher flows mg and ca concentrations remain more or less constant while k concentrations and li cl ratios increase fig 3 a and b indicating the weathered soil profile and the saprolite as main sources for the generated flow fig 11 soils on the higher slopes have less undergrowth and have much lower organic matter content and the stream banks have finer sediments with much higher content of accumulated decomposing organic matter higher concentrations of no3 and k in the soil water are observed on the higher slopes of the catchment these parts of the catchment then also get activated by the hydraulic loading during the storm events which increases no3 and k concentrations in the stream water goulding and stevens 1988 thiffault et al 2011 oni et al 2013 the fact that both no3 and k are relatively low during low flow baseflow indicates that the stores in the top soil are inactive at these times at high flows low na cl ratios and low tritium activities point towards a second subsurface water store this water store is most likely in the saprolite which has most likely the longest flow paths from infiltration to discharge hence an increase of solutes and older water ages are produced in general the large difference in hydraulic conductivity between bedrock and saprolite produces groundwater flow parallel to the slope along the boundary between the bedrock and the saprolite brantley et al 2011 the fact that the soils stores water during baseflow conditions and release water during storm events is also supported by the change in 222rn activities while the use of 222rn is challenging as a quantitative tracer due to the difficulties in constraining degassing processes it is an excellent tracer to detect subsurface discharge to a stream the source of elevated 222rn activities in surface water is discharge of water from the sediments to the stream genereux and hemond 1990 cartwright et al 2014a simultaneous increase of 222rn with higher streamflow at both sites suggests that most of the streamflow is generated from water displaced from the soils this argument is further supported by 222rn activities in water from two macropores at boundary road during the major storm event in november 2013 which had 222rn activities that were much higher than those of the stream 5 146 and 5 208 bq m 3 one of the macropores was resampled a week later when flow had receded and had a 222rn activity of 1 930 bq m 3 the decrease in 222rn activities shortly after the main storm event suggests that preferential flow paths in the upper soils are activated during storm events and contribute the remaining part of the water to the total flow that is not coming from the deeper parts of the soil or from micropore flow the water from the macropores at boundary road during e3 with the highest 222rn concentrations measured in the catchment and increasing k and no3 concentrations at olinda road suggest that the infiltrating water must have mixed with the existing water in the catchment 5 conclusions and implications the use of 3h time series in the lyrebird catchment allowed a unique insight in the mean transit time distributions and flow system of this small temperate catchment in victoria the low 3h activities at a range of streamflows and the fact that stream 3h never reaches those of rainfall indicate that most of the flow in the stream derives from stores with long transit times calculated mtts range from 6 to 40 years which indicates the large retention potential for the catchment this retention is most likely related to the micropore flow and flow through the saprolite at the soil bedrock interface a slight discrimination along the flow paths is present most chemical parameter concentrations increase slightly from the headwater to the catchment outlet the small increase however can be attributed to accumulation of major ions by mineral weathering major cations hco3 through longer flow paths through deeper soil layers there are three major stores in the catchment the first is a deeper soil storage in the saprolite where water slowly flows to the stream this causes the largest retention of the water due to longer flow paths as well as possibly lower hydraulic conductivities which produce the oldest ages in the catchment simultaneously weathering of the bedrock increases na k ca mg towards the lower parts of the catchment the second and third stores are both located in the top soils and are possibly represented by a fast reacting store and one that has moderate transit times a likely model for these two types of stores could be the difference in flow in micro and macro pores in the soil micro pores are the voids between mineral grains of the soil whereas macro pores are sub surface channels resulting from either biological activity such as root channels or worm holes or geological forces such as subsurface erosion desiccation or synaeresis cracks and fractures micro pore flow is active once the catchment starts wetting up increasing no3 and k concentrations as well as higher 222rn activities macro pore flow occurs during larger storm events a significant increase in no3 k concentrations and 222rn activities at higher flows represents fast infiltrating rain water and a relatively rapid transfer towards the catchment s surface drainage systems the high 3h activities sample from the macro pore flow at boundary road during a storm event are consistent with the hypothesis that storm flow during very large storm events is very young water and must have infiltrated recently the macro pore flow most likely mixes with some of the micro pore water along the flow paths in the top soil higher 222rn and no3 concentrations during the tail of the peak flows november 2013 indicate that the micro pore flow can be active for several weeks until the catchment is restored baseflow conditions the results of this study have several implications mean transit times in headwater catchments are much longer than previously thought in particular in a catchment that has high rainfall protection of headwater catchments is crucial for river flow further downstream as the water stores in the headwater are susceptible to land use changes deforestation might cause larger overland flow and less infiltration which subsequently influences long term runoff from these catchments and the ability of catchments to buffer longer periods of little rainfall or droughts more generally this study illustrates the utility of 3h for catchment studies especially in the southern hemisphere and indicates that the traditional mean transit time estimations on flow data and stable isotope tracers underestimate the actual transit times by decades acknowledgements funding for this project was provided by monash university and the national

7293,headwater catchments provide substantial streamflow to rivers even during long periods of drought documenting the mean transit times mtt of stream water in headwater catchments and therefore the retention capacities of these catchments is crucial for water management this study uses time series of 3h activities in combination with major ion concentrations stable isotope ratios and radon activities 222rn in the lyrebird creek catchment in victoria australia to provide a unique insight into the mean transit time distributions and flow systems of this small temperate headwater catchment at all streamflows the stream has 3h activities 2 4 tu that are significantly below those of rainfall 3 2 tu implying that most of the water in the stream is derived from stores with long transit times if the water in the catchment can be represented by a single store with a continuum of ages mean transit times of the stream water range from 6 up to 40 years which indicates the large retention potential for this catchment alternatively variations of 3h activities stable isotopes and major ions can be explained by mixing between of young recent recharge and older water stored in the catchment while surface runoff is negligible the variation in stable isotope ratios major ion concentrations and radon activities during most of the year is minimal 12 and only occurs during major storm events this suggests that different subsurface water stores are activated during the storm events and that these cease to provide water to the stream within a few days or weeks after storm events the stores comprise micro and macropore flow in the soils and saprolite as well as the boundary between the saprolite and the fractured bed rock hydrograph separations from three major storm events using tritium electrical conductivity and selected major ions as well a δ 18 o suggest a minimum of 50 baseflow at most flow conditions we demonstrate that headwater catchments can have a significant storage capacity and that the relationship between long water stores and fast storm event subsurface flow is complex the study also illustrates that using 3h to determine mean transit times is probably only valid for baseflow conditions where the catchment can be represented as a single store the results of this study reinforce the need to protect headwater catchments from contamination and extreme land use changes keywords mean transit times tritium time series headwater catchment hydrograph separation 1 introduction documenting the time taken for water to flow through a catchment until it discharges into the stream network the transit time is crucial for understanding catchment hydrological responses and for water resource protection and management kirchner et al 2010 mcdonnell et al 2010 morgenstern et al 2010 hrachowitz et al 2013 water management authorities have mostly focussed on lowland rivers and larger catchments where rivers flow through low gradient well developed alluvial valleys while neglecting the storage capacities of headwater catchments however headwater streams typically comprise over two thirds of total stream length and contribute a significant proportion of the total flow of many river systems especially at low flow conditions freeman et al 2007 this in turn means that the headwater catchments provide much of the water supply for communities agriculture and industry further downstream groundwater from the near river alluvial sediments generally contributes water to perennial lowland rivers during low flow periods baseflow conditions sophocleous 2002 mccallum et al 2010 cook 2013 by contrast headwater catchments are commonly developed on indurated or crystalline rocks and lack extensive alluvial groundwater systems the observation that many streams in headwater catchments continue to flow over prolonged dry periods indicates that there are stores of water in soils weathered basement rocks or fractures with retention times of at least a few years maloszewski et al 1983 1992 rice and hornberger 1998 protecting headwater catchments is vital while many upper catchments retain native vegetation and are protected under national park legislation increasing population growth as well as economic development have led to progressive changes in landuse in these areas including plantation forestry agriculture and peri urban developments the impacts of such development on the catchments and consequently on the river systems as a whole is currently poorly understood understanding the timescales of water movement within the catchments and the importance of the different water stores is essential for understanding flow generation and providing catchment characteristic baselines for water management authorities 1 1 runoff processes in headwater catchments that headwater catchments provide substantial flow to river systems even during prolonged dry periods implies that they store and eventually release water back into the rivers becker 2005 many geochemical studies suggest that a large component of storm runoff is also composed of water that has been stored in the catchment rather than direct surface runoff this is often termed the old water paradox sklash and farvolden 1979 kirchner 2003 mcdonnell et al 1990 kienzler and naef 2008 there are two main mechanisms by which old water emerges in streams firstly displacement of stored water by infiltrating rainfall and secondly a pressure wave propagation from the infiltrating rain resulting in increased groundwater discharge to the stream hydraulic loading klaus et al 2013 the total groundwater or subsurface flow is a sum of water release from all subsurface stores including deeper groundwater soil water and interflow there has been significant research into distinguishing faster from slower subsurface flow jencso and mcglynn 2011 bogaart et al 2013 berne et al 2005 several studies have shown that flow at the hillslope scale is a combination of matrix flow or displacement mixed with preferential flow the ratios of matrix flow to preferential flow vary widely between studies and catchments and range from 1 to 90 leaney et al 1993 kumar et al 1997 vogel et al 2010 allaire et al 2009 stumpp and maloszewski 2010 the variability of the distribution of matrix flow versus preferential flow is linked to soil types geology and vegetation klaus et al 2015 preferential flow paths such as macropores soil pipes cracks from clay shrinkage root channels and animal burrows provide path ways with a multitude of flow velocities which are generally well above those of water travelling through the soil matrix pores davies et al 2013 kienzler and naef 2008 beven and germann 2013 van schaik et al 2014 the dynamic mixing and displacement of groundwater with these ranges of velocities create a complexity in catchment response and therefore also influence the transit times the mean transit time at a catchment outlet then represents a mix of water from all different flow paths 1 2 determining transit times in headwater catchments there are several methods that may be used to determine the transit times of water in catchments mcdonnell et al 2010 as transit times increase any variation in the geochemistry of rainfall is progressively attenuated thus comparing the temporal variation of stable isotope ratios or major ion concentrations in the stream water with those in rainfall can be used to derive transit times mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 mcdonnell et al 2010 kirchner et al 2010 hrachowitz et al 2013 mean transit times of stream water have also been estimated by fitting the variability of stable isotope ratios in the stream water to those of rainfall with sine wave functions rodgers et al 2005 tetzlaff et al 2007 tekleab et al 2014 alternatively when combined with models that describe the distribution of flow paths in a catchment maloszewski 2000 the variation in stable isotopes or major ion geochemistry at the catchment outlet can be used to quantify mean transit times while this approach has been applied with some success there are several limitations firstly it requires high frequency ideally sub weekly stable isotope and or major ion geochemistry rainfall and streamflow records of at least the duration of the transit time of water in the catchment timbe et al 2015 these records are not commonly available especially where transit times are more than a few years secondly a single estimate of the transit time is commonly made whereas water of different ages may contribute to the stream at baseflow and higher flow conditions morgenstern et al 2010 morgenstern and daughney 2012 finally the above mentioned tracers are ineffective where transit times are in excess of 4 5 years as the initial tracer variation over time is attenuated stewart et al 2010 duvert et al 2016 tritium 3h is an ideal tracer for determining water transit times in catchments 3h is part of the water molecule and its abundance in water isolated from the atmosphere is controlled only by radioactive decay and not by reactions between the water and the aquifer matrix as is the case with some solute tracers it has a half life of 12 32 years and with high precision low background analyses morgenstern and taylor 2009 it can be utilised to estimate mean transit times of over 100 years morgenstern et al 2010 the 3h input function in rainfall has a distinct peak in the 1950s to 1960s due to the production of 3h by the atmospheric thermonuclear tests the so called bomb pulse traditionally the propagation of the bomb pulse has been utilised to trace the flow of water recharged during this period fritz et al 1991 clark and fritz 1997 since the mid 1960s atmospheric 3h activities have declined in the northern hemisphere single 3h measurements currently yield non unique mean transit time estimates although mean transit times may be estimated using 3h time series the bomb pulse 3h peak was several orders of magnitude lower in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere clark and fritz 1997 morgenstern et al 2010 and the 3h activities of remnant bomb pulse water have now decayed well below those of modern rainfall this allows unique mean transit times to be estimated from single 3h activities morgenstern et al 2010 morgenstern and daughney 2012 consequently the transit time of stream water can be determined for a specific time or at different streamflows by extension 3h can be used to test whether older and younger reservoirs contribute water to streamflow at different stages of the hydrological cycle because 3h activities in rainfall have been measured globally for several decades global network or isotopes in precipiation 2016 tadros et al 2014 3h input into many catchments is relatively well known calculating precise transit times may be difficult due to the unknown complexity of the catchment flow system however since the 3h bomb pulse has mostly disappeared in the southern hemisphere relative transit times do not depend on the accuracy of the assumed flow model and water with low 3h activities has longer transit times than water with tritium activities closer to those of rainfall this in turns allows tritium activities to be directly compared to other parameters such as streamflow stable isotopes and major ion concentrations cartwright and morgenstern 2015 1 3 understanding water sources soil water runoff and groundwater from aquifers with different mineralogy most likely have different major ion and trace element geochemistries gaillardet et al 1999 herczeg and edmunds 2000 cartwright et al 2007 2012 cartwright and morgenstern 2012 soulsby and tetzlaff 2008 hofmann and cartwright 2013 edmunds 2009 for example soil water commonly has elevated si and k concentrations waters derived from sedimentary rocks may have higher ca concentrations if carbonate dissolution has occurred and waters from granitic aquifers commonly have high na k or ca concentrations due to the weathering of feldspar and other silicate minerals hofmann and cartwright 2013 the stable isotope ratios of water leaving a catchment progress towards the weighted mean value of annual rainfall when residence times in the catchment are sufficient to attenuate seasonal variations although this precludes their use in terms of transit time estimations they can be used to separate the baseflow during high flow periods via a mass balance hugenschmidt et al 2014 radon 222rn which is part of the 238u to 206pb decay series is commonly used to determine the distribution and quantity of groundwater inflows to streams and rivers cartwright et al 2014b cook 2013 222rn reaches secular equilibrium with its parent isotope 226ra over a few weeks cecil and green 2000 the concentration of 226ra in minerals is several orders of magnitude higher than dissolved 226ra in surface water which results in 222rn activities in groundwater also being orders of magnitude higher than in streams cook 2013 cecil and green 2000 adsorption of 226ra onto hydroxides clays and organic substrates may increase 222rn activities in soils and weathered rocks chabaux et al 2011 high 222rn activities in surface water therefore indicate that groundwater or soil water discharges into the stream the differentiation between groundwater and soil water or interflow using 222rn is difficult 222rn activities in the soil waters are commonly higher than in water from the saprolite or the bedrock due to the higher emanation potential in the weathered soils while 222rn requires approximately three weeks to reach secular equilibrium dissolution of already existing 222rn in the unsaturated zone occurs instantly when rain water infiltrates into the subsurface and mixes with the existing soil air surbeck 1993 1 4 aims and objectives the aim of the project was to investigate headwater mean transit times in a small 7 3 km2 temperate headwater catchments in victoria australia at varying streamflows the project integrates monthly tritium activities major ion concentrations stable isotopes ratios and 222rn activities collected over a years the tritium and stable isotope data are used to estimate the transit times of water in the catchment the catchment behaviour is investigated by high frequency sampling over storm events the combination of stable isotope major ion chemistry and 3h data over storm events is used to assess the changing stores of water in the catchment despite the advantages of 3h in directly understanding the transit times of water during high streamflow it has been little used for this purpose crouzet et al 1970 kennedy et al 1986 with the diminishing of the bomb pulse 3h holds the potential to resolve the inputs from different water stores during high streamflows and thus allows to better understand how catchments respond to rainfall 2 methods 2 1 site description and catchment characteristics the lyrebird creek catchment is part of the yarra river catchment and is located in the dandenong ranges national park west of melbourne australia fig 1 it is a 7 3 km2 headwater catchment and is mostly covered 90 in pristine eucalypt forest with dense undergrowth vegetation lyrebird creek is a first order stream draining the catchment to the northeast the southern catchment boundary is the highest part of the catchment with an elevation of 580 m while the catchment outlet at olinda road is at 220 m fig 1 average yearly rainfall at montrose approximately 5 km west of lyrebird creek between 2009 and 2014 is 1044 mm australian bureau of meteorology 2015 with an average evapotranspiration loss over the same period of 75 in this temperate climate most of the rainfall occurs during the austral winter while the highest evapotranspiration rates occur during summer average summer temperatures range from 11 30 c and winter temperatures range from 3 5 13 c australian bureau of meteorology 2015 lyrebird creek is perennial at the catchment outlet at olinda road however the reaches upstream of boundary road fig 1 may dry up in summer flow at olinda road between 2006 and 2013 ranged from 0 48 to 52 9 ml day 1 the flow varies with annual rainfall with a median flow q50 of 3 91 ml day 1 for the period from 2000 to 2012 samantha imberger university of melbourne personal communications due to the below average rainfall the median flow was 2 1 ml day 1 in 2013 fig 2 the gentle slope of the flow duration curve and a 90 occurrence of flows smaller than 8 43 and 4 64 ml day 1 indicates that surface runoff only occurs after major storm events the average annual flow of lyrebird creek is 1550 ml but the 2013 flow was 67 of the long term average at 1140 ml this is due to rainfall in 2013 being lower 982 6 mm than the average of 1044 mm australian bureau of meteorology 2015 streamflows were low 1 34 ml day 1 during april 2013 and may 2013 as a consequence of a relatively dry summer monthly flows increased to peaks of 34 08 ml day 1 in november 2013 after intensive rainfall with monthly rainfall totals of over 100 mm for august september and october and november the lyrebird catchment lies within dandenong ranges igneous complex which consists of devonian volcanic rhyolitic and dacitic ignimbrites hornfels in the east of the catchment forms the boundary between the devonian volcanics and palaeogene tholeiitic lava flows tweed et al 2005 2006 the volcanic rocks are underlain by palaeozoic marine metasediments of the lachlan fold belt which underlie most of the melbourne region there are minor deposits of quaternary alluvium along the streams in the northern central part of the lyrebird catchment deep saprolitic weathering forms kaolinite rich red loamy soils the total depth is unknown but is estimated at 1 5 m at the top of the catchment to 3 m at the catchment outlet hand augering showed that the root zone of the vegetation penetrates the soils to at least 2 m the lower altitude alluvial areas are rich in clay and organic matter which results in swampy waterlogged areas in the proximity of the lyrebird creek that are regularly flooded the palaeozoic basement comprises an unconfined fractured rock aquifer due to the complex geology and the high degree of fracturing groundwater flow is variable but the general flow direction follows the topography to the north towards the yarra river tweed et al 2005 investigated the larger dandenong ranges area and suggested that the catchment is relatively variable with respect to rainfall and recharge with bore hydrographs responding to seasonal precipitation changes with a lag of 2 to 3 months 2 2 sample collection lyrebird creek was sampled at least monthly at the catchment outlet at olinda road and boundary road which is the furthest upstream location where the stream is perennial between april 2013 and february 2014 fig 1 stream water was sampled directly from the stream into 1 litre high density polyethylene hdpe bottles in addition to the monthly samples stream water was collected at olinda road over three storm events two minor events in october 2013 and a major storm event in november 2013 the storm event samples were taken using an isco 6712 autosampler teledyne isco inc with remote trigger and a 24 1 litre sample carousel the autosampler samples were collected 1 day after the storm events bottled in 1 litre hdpe bottles refrigerated until further processing push point piezometers were driven into the sediments to a depth of approximately 1 m near the stream 1 2 m distance at eagles nest and olinda road fig 1 a small diameter bailer was used to extract water from the push point piezometers soil water was sampled using suction cup soil moisture samplers ums germany at depths of 40 and 80 cm at three locations hilltop mid slope and valley fig 1 four water samples were also taken directly from discrete discharge points from the soils on a road cutting at boundary road during the november storm event flow at the road cutting only occurred during major storm events and were dry during the rest of the study period overland flow was sampled during the november storm event by collecting running water on the hillslope into 125 ml hdpe bottles rainwater was sampled at monash university approximately 30 km from field site on an event basis rainwater was also collected monthly at olinda road using a funnel rain collector mounted 1 5 m above ground the rain collector sampled a mixture of rainfall and throughfall under the canopy cover and was emptied monthly a thin paraffin film was added to the rainwater sampler to prevent evaporation chemical analysis of rainwater is equivalent to those of creek and groundwater which is described below 2 3 geochemical and isotope analyses electrical conductivity ec was measured in the field using a calibrated wtw meter and probe continuous ec was measured at boundary road and olinda road using a winsitu aquatroll 200 on a 15 min time step samples for cation analysis were filtered through 0 45 μm nitrate cellulose filters and acidified to ph 2 with 16 m hno3 and analysed at monash university using a thermofinnigan inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms samples for anion analysis were filtered through 0 45 μm nitrate cellulose filters and analysed using a metrohm ion chromatograph at monash university the precision of anion and cation analyses based on replicates is 2 and the accuracy based on analysis of certified water standards is 5 hco3 and dissolved co2 with a precision of 5 10 were determined by titration using a hach field titration kit rainfall bicarbonate concentrations were not measured due to the small volumes and long residence time in the sample containers δ 18 o and δ 2 h values were measured at monash university using finnigan mat 252 and thermofinnigan deltaplus advantage mass spectrometers δ 18 o was analysed via equilibration with he co2 at 32 c for 24 48 h in a thermofinnigan gas bench δ 2 h was measured by reaction with cr at 850 c using an automated finnigan mat h device δ 18 o and δ 2 h values were measured relative to internal standards calibrated against iaea smow gisp and slap data were normalised following the method by coplen 1988 and are expressed relative to v smow precision 1 σ based on replicate analysis is δ 18 o 0 1 and δ 2 h 1 samples for 3h were vacuum distilled and enriched by electrolysis prior to being analysed by liquid scintillation spectrometry using quantulus ultra low level counters at the institute of geological and nuclear sciences gns new zealand following the improvements from morgenstern and taylor 2009 the sensitivity is now further increased to a lower detection limit of 0 02 tu via tritium enrichment by a factor of 95 and reproducibility of tritium enrichment of 1 is achieved via deuterium calibration for every sample the precision 1 sigma is 1 8 at 2 tu 3h activities are expressed in tritium units tu where 1tu represents a 3h 1h ratio of 1 10 18 222rn activities in stream water and pipe flow were determined using a portable radon in air monitor rad 7 durridge co following methods described by burnett and dulaiova 2006 a glass flask of 0 5 l was filled and 222rn was degassed for 5 min into a closed air loop of fixed volume calibrated by manufacturer incorporating the rad 7 counting times were 1 2 h for stream water typical relative precision is 3 at 10 000 bq m 3 and 10 at 100 bq m 3 soil water samples from suction cups were too small for 222rn analysis and the vacuum in the sample container would induce degassing 222rn emanation rates were estimated from three soil samples collected at the top of the catchment at boundary road in the middle of the catchment at eagles nest and at the lower catchment at olinda road dried soil samples of known weight were filled in airtight containers distilled water was then added and the container was closed for 5 weeks by which time the rate of 222rn production and decay have reached secular equilibrium after 5 weeks 40 ml of pore water was extracted and analysed for 222rn using the same method as described above but with counting times of 12 h emanation rates γ and equilibrium 222rn activities of the sediments in the catchment were calculated from the 222rn activity of the extracted pore water following lamontagne and cook 2007 assuming a matrix density of 2800 kg m 3 and a porosity of 0 35 which are appropriate for silty soils with moderate clay content 2 4 estimating transit times the time taken for water to flow through a catchment from where it recharges to where it discharges into a stream the transit time can be estimated using simplified lumped parameter models that reflect the geometry and distribution of flow paths within a catchment stewart and fahey 2010 jurgens et al 2012 these models are based on simplified aquifer geometries and account for effects of dispersion and mixing of water that has followed flow paths of different lengths jurgens et al 2012 for steady state flow the convolution integral relates the tracer input over time c inp and the tracer concentration at the catchment outlet c out maloszewski 2000 1 c out c inp t τ h τ exp λ τ d τ where t is the sampling time τ is the transit time h τ is the flow model or response function of the hydrological system and λ is the decay constant 0 0563 yr 1 for 3h the exponential term represents the radioactive decay of 3h stewart et al 2010 lumped parameter models are most easily applied to conservative tracers such as 3h or the stable isotopes that migrated at the same rate as the water jurgens et al 2012 the application of these models to a specific catchment requires a conceptual understanding of the geometry of the groundwater flow system the exponential flow model em describes mean transit times in a homogeneous unconfined aquifer of constant thickness and with uniform recharge the combined flow to a stream at the outflow constitutes water from flow paths from the entire aquifer that have an exponential transit time distribution stewart et al 2010 the piston flow model pfm assumes linear flow with no mixing within the aquifer such that all water discharging to a stream at one point in time has the same transit time one of the most commonly used models is the exponential piston flow model epm it is a combination of the piston flow model where the catchment has regions of linear flow and regions where the flow paths have an exponential distribution morgenstern et al 2010 the solution to 1 for the exponential piston flow model is given by zuber et al 2005 2 h τ 0 for τ m 1 f 3 h τ f τ m 1 exp τ f τ m 1 f 1 for τ τ m 1 f where τ m is the mean residence time and f the ratio of the volume of the aquifer that exhibits exponential flow to the total aquifer volume the epm is widely used to estimate transit times in catchments where the water in the stream follows flow paths of varying lengths but where parts of the aquifer are confined or where there is vertical recharge through the unsaturated zone above an aquifer that exhibits exponential flow stewart et al 2010 cartwright and hofmann 2016 the dispersion model dm is based on the one dimensional advection dispersion equation for fluid flow in porous media maloszewski 2000 jurgens et al 2012 while not always considered to be a realistic conceptualisation of the flow system it has been shown to reproduce time series of tracer activities stewart et al 2010 it incorporates two parameters a mean age and a dimensionless dispersion parameter dp dp is the inverse of the peclet number and describes the relative importance of dispersion and advection dp d v x where d is the dispersion coefficient in m2 day 1 v is velocity in m day 1 and x is distance in m jurgens et al 2012 4 h τ 1 τ 4 π dp τ τ m exp 1 τ τ m 2 4 dp τ τ m dp dispersion parameter dispersion coefficient d vx together these are the most commonly used lumped parameter models for determining mean transit times mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 in catchments where long time series i e several years data are available they have reproduced the measured variation in 3h activities over time maloszewski and zuber 1982 zuber et al 2005 gusyev et al 2013 morgenstern et al 2015 the mean transit times were calculated by comparing the observed 3h activity with those predicted by the transit time model jurgens et al 2012 because 3h activities are not affected by reactions in the unsaturated zone the estimated mean transit times reflect both recharge through the unsaturated zone and flow through the aquifers 2 5 mass balance calculations and binary mixing models if sufficiently large the difference in major ion concentration stable isotope ratios 3h or 222rn activities in subsurface water and rainwater can be used to estimate the contributions of baseflow and storm event water sklash and farvolden 1979 godsey et al 2009 via 5 q out c out q event c event q base c base c out and q out are the flow and tracer concentration at the catchment outlet q event and c event are the flow generated by surface runoff and interflow and tracer concentrations of rainfall and q base and c base are the flow and tracer concentration of subsurface catchment water stores 3 results the presentation of the results is split in two parts first the monthly sampling that constrains general catchment behaviour and second the short term storm event sampling that encapsulates catchment behaviour following storm events the distinction is made on the frequency occurrence of flows where 0 to 10 q10 represents high flows and 10 represents low flows fig 2 the equivalent flow value for q10 is 5 ml day the results from monthly observations are discussed first 3 1 tritium activities an accumulated rainwater sample collected at monash university between may and december 2013 had a 3h activity of 2 72 tu a 12 months rainfall sample from yarra junction 30 km nw of the study area collected in 2016 had a similar 3h activity of 2 76 tu cartwright unpublished data the highest 3h activity measured in lyrebird creek stream water at olinda road was 2 4 tu while water from the interflow through macro pores had a 3h activities of 2 9 tu table 1 the 3h activities of the 13 monthly stream samples from olinda road and the 5 samples at boundary road ranged from 1 43 to 2 38 tu and 1 69 and 2 23 tu respectively table 1 3h activities in the stream water were correlated with streamflow r2 0 91 but were always lower than those of rainfall fig 3 b the lowest 3h activity 1 43 tu was recorded in april 2013 at the end of the austral summer when flow at olinda rd was 1 31 ml day 1 fig 3a the activities increased slightly to 1 84 tu after a few storm events at the end of may and the beginning of june 3h activities decreased to below 1 6 tu at multiple times during the sampling year highest overall streamflows in the winter and spring were 20 25 ml day 1 and 3h activities at these times were as high as 2 4 tu the 3h activities at boundary road were approximately 6 3 to 10 2 higher than at olinda road but displayed a similar relationship to streamflow fig 3b 3 2 stable isotopes the δ 18 o and δ 2 h values of stream water from lyrebird creek from all sampling rounds were close to the local meteoric water line for melbourne global network or isotopes in precipiation 2016 which has a slope of 7 48 and a d excess of 8 75 fig 4 the δ 18 o and δ 2 h values of the rainfall from the lyrebird catchment had a slope of 6 02 δ 18 o values were between 6 8 and 1 1 a range of 5 7 and the and δ 2 h values were between 44 and 6 a range of 50 rainfall from melbourne monash university had a much larger range 12 2 for δ 18 o and 79 9 for δ 2 h some of the difference can be attributed to the samples for melbourne being collected on an event basis while those for lyrebird creek catchment were composite samples the δ 18 o and δ 2 h values of stream water for lyrebird creek at olinda road over the sample period varied between 6 0 and 5 1 and 35 and 26 respectively fig 4 the average δ 18 o and δ 2 h values in the stream water were similar to those of rainfall however the ranges are much less in the stream water the δ 18 o and δ 2 h values at boundary road higher in the catchment were more variable ranging between 6 5 and 3 1 and 39 and 16 respectively the stable isotope values of the soil water samples had a similar spatial variability as the stream water stable isotope ratios the δ 18 o and δ 2 h values of the soil waters ranged from 6 5 to 3 1 and 39 to 16 at boundary road and 5 8 to 3 0 and 37 to 29 at olinda road respectively 3 3 major ions and 222rn the ec of rainfall ranged from 10 to 51 μs cm and is similar to rainfall ec values in southeast australia blackburn and mcleod 1983 ec values of lyrebird creek at olinda road ranged from 86 to 115 μs cm and those at boundary road ranged from 82 to 96 μs cm respectively there is no correlation of the monthly measured ec values with streamflow groundwater from the fractured rock basement is not accessible in the study area but soil water ec values in the lyrebird catchment were lower than those of the groundwater ranging from 56 μs cm in the upper catchment at boundary road to 195 μs cm in the lower catchment at olinda road the temporal variability of ec in the soil water samples is minor there was a general downstream increase in ec values in lyrebird creek from 62 to 101 μs cm at boundary road to 81 to 115 μs cm at olinda road while some of the high storm events are missing continuous ec data due to clogging of the logger by sediments there was a general decrease of ec values with increasing streamflows following storm events the lowest ec value of 62 2 μs cm was recorded during a major storm event in october 2013 the major ion chemistry of the stream water was dominated by na cl and hco3 na concentrations ranged from 9 to 16 48 mg l 1 at boundary road and from 11 11 to 18 38 mg l 1 at olinda road fig 5 a k concentrations ranged from 1 14 to 2 0 mg l 1 at boundary road 1 3 to 2 3 mg l 1 at olinda road ca and mg concentrations ranged from 1 1 to 2 1 mg l 1 and 1 2 to 2 2 mg l 1 at boundary road and 1 2 to 2 3 mg l 1 and 1 5 to 2 5 mg l 1 at olinda road rainfall had na concentrations of 1 9 to 13 5 mg l 1 k concentrations of 1 0 to 4 1 mg l 1 ca concentrations of 1 1 to 7 4 mg l 1 and mg concentrations of 0 36 to 3 2 mg l 1 soil water na concentrations ranged from 7 3 to 13 8 mg k from 1 1 to 3 3 mg l 1 ca from 0 2 to 3 5 mg l 1 and mg from 0 8 to 3 2 mg l 1 na ca and mg concentrations were generally higher in the shallow groundwater from piezometers compared to the soil water with concentrations ranging from 16 1 to 23 3 mg l 1 3 6 to 6 9 mg l 1 and 2 8 to 5 mg l 1 while k concentrations were lower ranging from 1 1 to 1 9 mg l 1 the major anions were cl and hco3 cl concentrations ranged from 12 to 18 6 mg l 1 at boundary road and from 5 9 to 19 45 at olinda road hco3 concentrations ranged from 4 7 to 8 4 at boundary road and from 3 9 to 11 3 mg l 1 at olinda road so4 concentrations ranged from 1 8 to 2 9 mg l 1 at boundary road and 0 3 to 3 1 mg l 1 at olinda road rainfall had between 0 9 and 36 5 mg l 1 cl and 0 14 to 4 5 mg l 1 so4 cl concentrations in soil water ranged from 8 to 17 mg l 1 which is similar to those in the shallow groundwater ranging from 11 6 to 16 42 mg l 1 hco3 was also only measures for a small number of samples due to the lack of sufficient sample concentrations that were measured in the soil water ranged from 1 8 to 4 9 mg l 1 so4 in the soil water ranged from 1 to 3 3 mg l 1 at boundary road and 0 1 to 6 4 at olinda road no3 concentrations in the stream were 0 7 to 8 9 mg l 1 at boundary road and 0 45 to 9 1 mg l 1 at olinda road no3 concentrations in rainfall were generally below 1 mg l 1 upper catchment soil water no3 concentrations were also very low and comparable to those of rainfall ranging from 0 to 0 15 mg l 1 soil water no3 concentrations were significantly higher in the lower catchment ranging from 0 1 to 8 7 mg l 1 fig 5b stream water 222rn activities were generally lower in the upper catchment than in the lower catchment ranging from 213 8 bq m 3 to 1 038 0 bq m 3 at boundary road and 400 8 bq m 3 to 1 611 0 bq m 3 median of 884 4 bq m 3 at olinda road 222rn activities of the water samples from the discrete discharge points in the road cutting at boundary during the major storm event in november 2013 were 1 930 5 208 and 5 146 bq m 3 calculated 222rn emanation rates γ from the soils were higher 8 947 449 bq m 3 day 1 for sediments at boundary road than those in the middle and the lower parts of the catchment γ 4364 232 bq m 3 day 1 at eagles nest and 2 513 118 bq m 3 day 1 at olinda road equilibrium 222rn are given by γ λ cartwright et al 2014b the estimated γ values result in equilibrium 222rn activities of 49 709 2 498 242 248 1 228 and 13 963 659 bq m 3 for the three locations 3 4 tritium stable isotopes and major ion chemistry during storm events storm runoff was sampled during three storm events at the beginning of october 2013 e1 late october 2013 e2 and middle of november 2013 e3 the three storm events had different streamflow magnitudes with maximum streamflows of 5 6 ml day 1 e1 9 06 ml day 1 e2 and 34 08 ml day 1 e3 recorded at olinda road fig 6 table 2 storm events e1 and e2 lasted for approximately three days while the higher streamflows during the event e3 had the highest flow and lasted for more than a week fig 6 event e3 has a double flow peak with streamflows of 28 04 ml day 1 at 14 00 on the 13th nov and 34 08 ml day 1 at 03 35 on the 14th nov the 3h activities of stream water at olinda road during the e3 event increased with increasing flow from 1 56 tu prior to the storm event at streamflows of 3 64 ml day 1 to a maximum of 2 49 tu at 20 92 ml day 1 streamflow close to the peak of the storm event there was a similar increase in 3h activities at boundary road from 1 7 tu prior to storm event e3 to 2 3 tu during the storm event 3h activities declined as streamflow fell but on november 18 4 days after the peak when streamflow was 6 8 ml day 1 the 3h activity was still higher 1 8 tu than those recorded before storm event e3 the interflow sample at boundary road collected during storm event e3 had a 3h activity of 2 9 tu which is higher than those recorded in the stream the δ 18 o values of the monthly stream samples averaged 5 6 and lyrebird creek had similar δ 18 o values at the start of each of the storm events the first storm event e1 was not captured entirely and samples were only taken as streamflow receded fig 7 a during the second storm event e2 δ 18 o values of rainfall was 1 8 which was higher than the average δ 18 o values of stream and groundwater δ 18 o values as a consequence δ 18 o values of the stream increased to 4 8 close to peak streamflows decreased to 5 6 as the streamflows decreased the δ 18 o value of rainfall during storm event e3 was 10 63 and the δ 18 o values of the stream water decreased with increasing flow the minimum δ 18 o value of 7 1 was reached on the 13th november at 9 15 approximately 5 h before the first flow peak the δ 18 o values increased to 5 6 and reached a second low of 6 6 at 6 15 on november 14 approximately 3 h after the second peak table 2 δ 18 o values subsequently increased to those close to the average δ 18 o values in the stream water within a 3 h and remained stable as streamflows decreased ec values were lower than the average of the stream water during each of the storm events and reached a minimum value of 62 μs cm at the first peak of e3 fig 6a the ec increased between the two flow peaks and reached a second minimum at the second flow peak while the streamflow of this peak was higher than the first the decrease in ec was less to 72 μs cm this is similar to the behaviour of the stable isotope data some of the major ion concentrations decreased during the peak streamflows while others increased na concentrations for example decreased during the peak streamflow of e3 but na cl ratios remained nearly constant fig 7b and c k concentrations and li cl ratios increased from 1 2 to 1 3 mg l 1 and 0 1 to 0 16 to 2 06 mg l 1 and 0 50 respectively fig 7d and f no3 concentrations increased significantly with a peak of 9 mg l 1 at shortly after the second peak during e3 fig 7e stream water 222rn activity was 784 bq m 3 on the 6th november at low flows the 222rn activities of the stream water in the middle of the large storm event e3 on 14th november was 1 357 bq m 3 water emerging from macropores of 1 2 cm in diameter had 222rn activities of 5 146 and 5 208 bq m 3 on the same day the macropores were approximately 50 100 cm underneath the surface and were accessible at the road cut of boundary road the 222rn activity of one of these macropores that was still flowing a week later was 1 930 bq m 3 4 discussion the small variation in major ion chemistry and stable isotopes at baseflow in the stream suggests that there is a single store of water generating the streamflow similar to catchments elsewhere in southeast australia cartwright and morgenstern 2016 the lyrebird creek catchment is envisaged to be fed by a single store of water that becomes progressively older as the catchment receives less rainfall and dries up water originates then from deeper soils horizons and the saprolite the greater variability in major ion chemistry and stable isotopes during the storm events suggest that discrete mixing between different water stores occurs at these times a two component hydrograph separation was used to separate between old and a young components of storm event streamflow at olinda road we deliberately use the terms old and young and not ground water and surface water as we will show that surface water contributions are negligible and most of the runoff derives from subsurface stores with rainwater tritium activities of 3 tu median of measured rain water activities and old water activities of 1 56 tu in the week preceding the storm event the hydrograph separation reveals an overall old water contribution of 48 fig 8 table 2 similar results are achieved using ec and no3 with 45 and 42 old water component respectively ec values for old and new water were estimated from existing ec values for soil water average of 154 μs cm and rain water average of 30 μs cm no3 concentrations in shallow groundwater are lower than those in the soil water during peak flow no3 increases to 9 mg l 1 indicating runoff generation from shallow soil and interception the rainfall δ 18 o value was 10 6 during e3 the old water δ 18 o value is estimated as 5 5 0 3 based on the average of baseflow groundwater and soil water the large difference between the rainwater δ 18 o value of 10 6 and the δ 18 o values of the streamflow during the storm event results in very high estimated old water contributions of 83 fig 8 the fact that the stable isotope values decrease towards rainfall values indicate that there is a change in water stores over the storm event with the majority of water from stores that do not have average δ 18 o values furthermore the observation that all three storm events have different shifts in δ 18 o values implies that there is a component of inhomogenised water mixing with water from older stores discharging to the stream at these times fig 7a the mixing model indicates that the total flow during major storm events consists of at least half of old water sources of decadal time scales and a younger water from a source or sources which is most likely in the range of multiple months to 5 years the proportion of old water is 90 during low flow periods and gets to a minimum of 50 at high flow over entire storm events 3h mass balance the old water proportion is still 35 at peak flow fig 8 which was shown during the storm event e3 in november 2013 direct surface runoff only occurs to a small degree during very large storm events in the absence of larger alluvial aquifers all water stores must be located in the soil profile or saprolite the flow age differences likely reflect which part of the soil profile is active younger water is likely stored in the upper parts of the soil while older water fills the deeper parts of the soils and the saprolite 4 1 mean transit times during baseflow during baseflow streamflow is generated from a single store assuming that groundwater inflow from the deeper fractured rock aquifers is minimal most of the subsurface water will come from the soil and or the saprolite bedrock interface in common with flow systems elsewhere in australia it is assumed that flow through the unsaturated zone follows a piston flow distribution while the deeper soils saprolite and fractured rock is characterised by exponential flow morgenstern et al 2010 stewart and fahey 2010 duvert et al 2016 based on the studies by morgenstern et al 2010 stewart and fahey 2010 duvert et al 2016 that address flow in similar scale catchments we calculated mean transit times using an exponential piston flow model a value for f of 0 85 successfully reproduced the time series variation of tracers in some of those catchments and we initially adopt this value here fig 9 a table 1 morgenstern and daughney 2012 to assess the sensitivity of the transit time estimations to choice of model mean transit times were also calculated using the exponential flow model f 1 and the dispersion model fig 9b melbourne has a long annual and sub annual record of rainfall 3h activities the 3h activity of rainfall in melbourne peaked at 62 tu in 1965 and decreased exponentially to modern day rainfall weighted activities of between 2 8 and 3 2 tu by 1995 international atomic energy agency global network of isotopes in precipitation program tadros et al 2014 the 3h input function was based on the data of tadros et al 2014 which is derived from rainfall at melbourne airport 60 km from the study area with missing values estimated by the function that describes the atmospheric 3h activities for melbourne based on the study of tadros et al 2014 the 3h activity of modern rainfall collected at monash university and the water samples from the discrete discharge points in the road cutting at boundary road during one of the major storm events a 3h activity of modern rainfall of 3 tu was utilised the estimated mean transit times differ between the models the epm produces generally younger estimates compared with the exponential model and the dispersion model fig 9b for the monthly samples which represent the q10 flows mean transit times estimated using the epm vary from 43 years at the lowest streamflows 3h 1 43 tu to 33 years at higher streamflow 3h 2 1 tu these calculations used a 3h activity of modern rainfall of 3 tu the mean transit times of baseflow are relatively insensitive to the assumed 3h activities of modern rainfall for example varying the 3h activity of modern rainfall between 2 4 tu highest value in stream water and 3 5 tu based on tadros et al 2014 results in a range of mean transit times from the epm of 0 to 46 years the decrease in mean transit times with increasing streamflow fig 9a suggests progressive activation of shallower younger water stores probably as the catchment wets up the mean transit times of the stream water during storm events is difficult to constrain with lumped parameter model as it is likely that there is discrete mixing between older and younger water stores in the catchment this is discussed further below however the rapid decrease of 3h activities in the stream after storm events suggests that most of the streamflow consists of several decades old water independent of the lumped parameter model approach taken or rainfall input function variability 3h activities lower than 1 8 tu imply mean transit times of 10 years which is the upper limit of baseflow monthly rainfall δ 18 o records from the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip for melbourne were analysed for a better understanding of long term stable isotope fluctuations and seasonal trends the long term monthly average δ 18 o indicate a clear seasonality for melbourne with higher δ 18 o values during summers and lower values during winter fig 10 the δ 18 o values of the stream water varied in a narrow range with higher values in winter and lower values in summer inverse to the rainfall trends transit times cannot be estimated from the stable isotopes but the dampening of the rainfall stable isotope variations in the stream water implies that transit times are longer and that there is little direct input of rainfall or runoff 4 2 source of water in the catchment the water stores in the catchment most likely comprise soil water groundwater from the fractured basement and groundwater flowing along the boundary between the saprolite and the basement rocks groundwater flow through the fractured basement is probably a minor contributor to the overall streamflow of lyrebird creek and most streamflow is likely generated by water stored in the micro pores of the soil and saprolite macropore flow contributes significantly during storm events but ceases shortly after the rainfall has ceased the higher cation cl ratios in stream water soilwater and shallow groundwater from the piezometers are compared to those of rainfall implies that mineral weathering occurs in the catchment na concentrations in the stream decrease during higher flows mg and ca concentrations remain more or less constant while k concentrations and li cl ratios increase fig 3 a and b indicating the weathered soil profile and the saprolite as main sources for the generated flow fig 11 soils on the higher slopes have less undergrowth and have much lower organic matter content and the stream banks have finer sediments with much higher content of accumulated decomposing organic matter higher concentrations of no3 and k in the soil water are observed on the higher slopes of the catchment these parts of the catchment then also get activated by the hydraulic loading during the storm events which increases no3 and k concentrations in the stream water goulding and stevens 1988 thiffault et al 2011 oni et al 2013 the fact that both no3 and k are relatively low during low flow baseflow indicates that the stores in the top soil are inactive at these times at high flows low na cl ratios and low tritium activities point towards a second subsurface water store this water store is most likely in the saprolite which has most likely the longest flow paths from infiltration to discharge hence an increase of solutes and older water ages are produced in general the large difference in hydraulic conductivity between bedrock and saprolite produces groundwater flow parallel to the slope along the boundary between the bedrock and the saprolite brantley et al 2011 the fact that the soils stores water during baseflow conditions and release water during storm events is also supported by the change in 222rn activities while the use of 222rn is challenging as a quantitative tracer due to the difficulties in constraining degassing processes it is an excellent tracer to detect subsurface discharge to a stream the source of elevated 222rn activities in surface water is discharge of water from the sediments to the stream genereux and hemond 1990 cartwright et al 2014a simultaneous increase of 222rn with higher streamflow at both sites suggests that most of the streamflow is generated from water displaced from the soils this argument is further supported by 222rn activities in water from two macropores at boundary road during the major storm event in november 2013 which had 222rn activities that were much higher than those of the stream 5 146 and 5 208 bq m 3 one of the macropores was resampled a week later when flow had receded and had a 222rn activity of 1 930 bq m 3 the decrease in 222rn activities shortly after the main storm event suggests that preferential flow paths in the upper soils are activated during storm events and contribute the remaining part of the water to the total flow that is not coming from the deeper parts of the soil or from micropore flow the water from the macropores at boundary road during e3 with the highest 222rn concentrations measured in the catchment and increasing k and no3 concentrations at olinda road suggest that the infiltrating water must have mixed with the existing water in the catchment 5 conclusions and implications the use of 3h time series in the lyrebird catchment allowed a unique insight in the mean transit time distributions and flow system of this small temperate catchment in victoria the low 3h activities at a range of streamflows and the fact that stream 3h never reaches those of rainfall indicate that most of the flow in the stream derives from stores with long transit times calculated mtts range from 6 to 40 years which indicates the large retention potential for the catchment this retention is most likely related to the micropore flow and flow through the saprolite at the soil bedrock interface a slight discrimination along the flow paths is present most chemical parameter concentrations increase slightly from the headwater to the catchment outlet the small increase however can be attributed to accumulation of major ions by mineral weathering major cations hco3 through longer flow paths through deeper soil layers there are three major stores in the catchment the first is a deeper soil storage in the saprolite where water slowly flows to the stream this causes the largest retention of the water due to longer flow paths as well as possibly lower hydraulic conductivities which produce the oldest ages in the catchment simultaneously weathering of the bedrock increases na k ca mg towards the lower parts of the catchment the second and third stores are both located in the top soils and are possibly represented by a fast reacting store and one that has moderate transit times a likely model for these two types of stores could be the difference in flow in micro and macro pores in the soil micro pores are the voids between mineral grains of the soil whereas macro pores are sub surface channels resulting from either biological activity such as root channels or worm holes or geological forces such as subsurface erosion desiccation or synaeresis cracks and fractures micro pore flow is active once the catchment starts wetting up increasing no3 and k concentrations as well as higher 222rn activities macro pore flow occurs during larger storm events a significant increase in no3 k concentrations and 222rn activities at higher flows represents fast infiltrating rain water and a relatively rapid transfer towards the catchment s surface drainage systems the high 3h activities sample from the macro pore flow at boundary road during a storm event are consistent with the hypothesis that storm flow during very large storm events is very young water and must have infiltrated recently the macro pore flow most likely mixes with some of the micro pore water along the flow paths in the top soil higher 222rn and no3 concentrations during the tail of the peak flows november 2013 indicate that the micro pore flow can be active for several weeks until the catchment is restored baseflow conditions the results of this study have several implications mean transit times in headwater catchments are much longer than previously thought in particular in a catchment that has high rainfall protection of headwater catchments is crucial for river flow further downstream as the water stores in the headwater are susceptible to land use changes deforestation might cause larger overland flow and less infiltration which subsequently influences long term runoff from these catchments and the ability of catchments to buffer longer periods of little rainfall or droughts more generally this study illustrates the utility of 3h for catchment studies especially in the southern hemisphere and indicates that the traditional mean transit time

7294,snow is an important component of the hydrological cycle as a major part of the cryosphere snow cover also represents a valuable terrestrial water resource in the context of climate change the dynamics of snow cover play a crucial role in rebalancing the global energy and water budgets remote sensing hydrological modeling and in situ observations are three techniques frequently utilized for snow cover investigations however the uncertainties caused by systematic errors scale gaps and complicated snow physics among other factors limit the usability of these three approaches in snow studies in this paper an overview of the advantages limitations and recent progress of the three methods is presented and more effective ways to estimate snow cover properties are evaluated the possibility of improving remotely sensed snow information using ground based observations is discussed as a rapidly growing source of volunteered geographic information vgi web based geotagged photos have great potential to provide ground truth data for remotely sensed products and hydrological models and thus contribute to procedures for cloud removal correction validation forcing and assimilation finally this review proposes a synergistic framework for the future of snow cover research this framework highlights the cross scale integration of in situ and remotely sensed snow measurements and the assimilation of improved remote sensing data into hydrological models keywords remote sensing hydrological model field measurement snow cover geotagged photo 1 introduction snow is precipitation in the form of ice crystals that fall to earth s surface and become snow cover the process of snowfall represents the transfer of water from the atmosphere to the ground surface which is part of the natural water cycle as a major component of the cryosphere snow cover plays an important role in the earth s climate system through its impact on the surface energy budget water cycle primary productivity and surface gas exchange ipcc 2013 snow cover is also an indicator of a changing climate especially because snow accumulation and ablation are closely related to temperature brown and mote 2009 in addition because more than one sixth of the earth s population relies on glaciers and seasonal snowpacks for their water supply the consequences of hydrological changes due to global warming are likely to be severe barnett et al 2005 thus it is imperative to decipher the current changes in snow cover at various scales using our knowledge of hydrology and climatology according to previous estimations based on observations reanalysis products and model simulations hirabayashi et al 2008 hoinkes 1967 snowfall accounts for 5 11 of the total global precipitation the significant disagreement in the estimated fractions of the total precipitation in the form of snow or rain between estimation approaches reveals our insufficient understanding of the spatial distribution of snow nasa s global precipitation measurement gpm is an international satellite mission specifically designed to accurately measure precipitation from space and to provide a new generation of global rainfall and snowfall observations at hourly intervals with full coverage for latitudes 60 n 60 s and partial coverage for the remaining high latitude areas up to 90 hou et al 2014 omranian and sharif 2018 recently intense warming has led to a general reduction in the fraction of solid precipitation snow and an earlier occurrence of snowmelt moreover a shift from spring snowmelt to winter runoff due to climate change is expected to increase risks of winter flooding and summer drought arnell 1999 feng and hu 2007 knowles et al 2006 mote 2003 snow cover in temperate regions e g central and western europe is often close to the melting point and both continental and alpine snow covers are consequently highly sensitive to climate change fitzharris 1996 however although statistically significant snow recession has been reported since the late 1970s or early 1980s over the northern hemisphere brown 2000 brown et al 2010 brown and robinson 2011 estilow et al 2015 ipcc 2013 laternser and schneebeli 2003 the snow cover dynamics in the spatial and temporal dimensions remain poorly quantified this situation is due to not only the high heterogeneity of the snow distribution but also by the divergence of different snow data sources moreover measuring the exact impact of changing temperatures and precipitation on snow is difficult due to differences in the impacts over time and in different regions serquet et al 2011 therefore considerable effort is required to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of snow cover and snow processes in a changing climate this paper introduces the snow cover parameters that are typically first applied by hydrologists then the advantages shortcomings and recent progress of the three snow measurement approaches e g in situ monitoring remote sensing and hydrological modeling are reviewed finally a critical appraisal of the potential of integrating the three techniques into snow cover research is provided efforts that use ground based meteorological data to improve remotely sensed snow products are highlighted the potential contribution of fusing multi source snow observations to update snow hydrological models with data assimilation schemes is then discussed 2 snow cover properties and parameters several variables such as density albedo specific surface area crystal size and shape thermal conductivity permeability diffusivity and shear resistance are required for a complete physical description of a snowpack domine 2011 understanding the physical thermal and optical properties of snow is essential for hydrologic research of snow singh and singh 2001 consequently much attention has been given to snow properties in studies in the literature e g brucker et al 2010 gallet et al 2009 jin et al 2008 koenig et al 2007 montpetit et al 2011 warren 1982 due to the special properties of snow which are summarized by pomeroy and brun 2001 snow cover functions as an energy bank radiation shield insulator reservoir and water transport medium in the global climate eco system in detail snow cover stores latent heat and crystal bonding forces during its formation and releases energy through fusion and sublimation because of its high albedo fresh snow cover reflects most shortwave radiation although albedo decreases with snowmelt as a near black body cold snow absorbs and re emits most longwave radiation but the emission is limited to a snow surface temperature of less than 0 c and thus snow cover hampers rapid warming of the adjacent air relative to a snow free surface street and melnikov 1990 snow cover also acts as an insulator minimizing the thawing of permafrost and protecting microorganisms and plants from wind and severe winter temperatures consequently snow cover plays an important role in influencing surface radiative exchange and heat transfer in addition as a solid water resource snow directly participates in natural water distribution and redistribution through a series of processes environmental factors interact with snow in complex ways and this makes it difficult to investigate snow processes e g snowfall snowmelt sublimation interception snowdrift snow avalanches and rain on snow events several snow cover parameters are used to study the behavior of snowpack at different spatial and temporal scales table 1 shows some of the snow cover parameters that are normally used in hydrological applications ipcc 2013 xie et al 2015 snow covered area sca is an index quantifying the extent of snow cover in a region and is generally derived from snow cover maps and calculated as follows 1 sca n s n t 100 where ns and nt are the numbers of snow pixels and total cloud free pixels respectively in a snow cover map for the study area or subregion because the sca only indicates the extent of snow presence in a region the snow mass or volume information cannot be interpreted based on this index however sca maps have great value for investigating the spatial and temporal variations in snow cover especially when it is difficult to estimate the snow mass over a large area because of varied topography and inhomogeneous snowfall in addition sca information is essential for studying the coupled land air system because the extent of snow cover rather than snow mass has more influence on the interactions between the snow surface and the atmosphere xu and dirmeyer 2013 the higher albedo and lower aerodynamic roughness height of snow cover comparing to the land surface significantly change the thermal and motion states of the atmosphere through direct and indirect feedbacks for hydrologists snow mass and volume parameters are more critical because the water volume stored in the snowpack and subsequent snowmelt runoff can be estimated snow water equivalent swe and snow depth sd are normally measured and used for this purpose the relation between swe mm and sd cm is described by the followed equation 2 swe 10 sd ρ s ρ w where ρs is the snowpack density kg m 3 and ρw is the density of liquid water which is approximately 1 103 kg m 3 to monitor temporal variations in the snowpack snow cover duration scd d snow onset date sod and snow end date sed are three indices used to monitor snowpack via seasonal snow cover behavior the sod and sed represent the dates of the first and last snowfalls respectively during a snow season and are often recorded in julian dates for hydrological applications scd represents the number of days between the sod and the sed during a snow season for regions that have persistent snow cover a hydrological year should be defined in advance e g 1st august to 31st july of the following year in this case the sed represents the date of the last snowfall during a hydrological year for regions that rarely receive snow it may be more appropriate to calculate julian dates for both sod and sed based on a hydrological year beginning on january 1st therefore the sod and sed may have values higher than 366 which indicate a delayed snow onset or early snow ending the six snow cover parameters listed in table 1 include spatial and temporal snow cover distribution parameters sca scd sod and sed and snowpack quantity parameters swe and sd the continuous time series of these six parameters can be utilized to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of snow cover and to estimate the water storage in the snowpack which have crucial significance for climate change assessments and water resource management currently three approaches are frequently used to derive the above mentioned snow parameters one approach is the traditional ground based and mostly manual process of monitoring snow characteristics fig 1 a and these data are typically collected in combination with other variables at meteorological stations however the sparse distribution of meteorological stations with appropriate snow monitoring protocols hinders the ability to conduct a detailed snow survey at a large spatial scale as a result traditional snow measurements cannot provide sufficient snowpack information for water resource management at the basin scale despite point scale accuracy to obtain basin scale information regarding snow cover remote sensing may be used as a substitute fig 1b remotely sensed images have the ability to monitor the near real time snow cover over large areas recently snow remote sensing has been vigorously developed around the world an increasing number of sensors aboard multiple platforms e g satellites drones and aerial and terrestrial assets have been used to make snow observations and they have performed well in measuring snow properties at different scales however compared with in situ snow measurements remotely sensed snow data are limited by the short term nature of the observations the longest satellite based snow dataset i e the noaa weekly snow cover maps only dates to 1966 robinson et al 1993 while some climate stations have snow records spanning more than 100 years e g armstrong 2001 cdiac et al 1991 remotely sensed snow information is also influenced by cloud obstruction and the large errors due to weather influences and the spectral confusion associated with different land surface features misclassifications frequently occur in remote sensing data deems et al 2013 hydrological modeling physically based conceptual and black box models is another robust approach for snow estimation fig 1c based on the input of climatic geomorphologic and other environmental information snow cover can be simulated using numerical models furthermore snowpack models are able to predict snow variations in the future under specific climate scenarios nevertheless snow modeling is often restricted by the scarcity of reliable meteorological observations as model inputs essery et al 2013 moreover the extremely complicated physics of snow are still not sufficiently understood which hinders the development of snowpack models therefore each snow measurement approach i e in situ observations remote sensing and hydrological modeling possesses obvious advantages and shortcomings it is necessary to compare the usability of the three methods and evaluate the possibility of integrating them in snow cover research close relationships exist among the three approaches in situ observations and remote sensing can both be used to collect snow data while the data are an essential input for developing hydrological models currently point based observations are also frequently utilized to improve and validate remote sensing algorithms as snowpack models are highly dependent on data input improving the data quality in situ or remote sensing is critical for successful simulations 3 measurements of snow cover 3 1 in situ monitoring before the development of remote sensing and hydrological modeling in situ snow monitoring had a long history of being used for snowfall and snow cover measurement during the 1500 1800 s modern meteorological observations began in europe and north america with the invention of meteorological instruments and the daily sd and new snowfall amounts were observed by various methods in many countries e g switzerland usa and finland the national rainfall and snowfall archives of the qing dynasty of china date back to 1693 and document systematic records of the rainfall amounts and sd in 268 counties until 1911 snow depth and swe measurements became widespread by 1950 in the mountainous regions of western north america and europe ipcc 2007 with global warming attracting much attention during the second half of the 20th century large scale snow studies called for snow observation data exchanges among different countries the inconsistent monitoring criteria restricted the comparability of snow measurements from various stations and regions for example according to the results of the wmo world meteorological organization solid precipitation measurement intercomparison project at a wind speed of 6 m s the national gauges with wind shield used in sweden norway and finland captured less than 40 of the solid precipitation the instruments used in the usa and canada captured approximately 75 and the national gauges without wind shield used in germany hungary denmark and russia captured only 10 20 of the solid precipitation goodison et al 1998 to improve the quality and consistency of in situ snowfall sd and swe observations several international and national projects have been implemented worldwide and several station based snow datasets have been established table 2 in addition the global synop surface synoptic observations network is sponsored by the wmo and is responsible for the data collection and exchange of coordinated international weather observations from the rbscn regional basic synoptic climatological network stations in situ sd measurements from the station network are provided by the synop reports in near real time at meteorological stations sd is generally observed one or two times per day by a surveyor and the swe is measured at a very low frequency in past years automatic snow stations e g stations equipped with ultrasonic snow height sensors or a swe weighing system have been widely used to monitor sd and swe at high temporal resolutions e g hourly in addition time lapse photography has recently shown the ability to collect sd data parajka et al 2012 and quantify snow canopy interception garvelmann et al 2013 thus this technique represents a low cost and feasible method for monitoring snow processes in remote mountainous areas fig 2 as digital cameras can be easily installed in forested regions to monitor the interactions between snow and vegetation they are useful supplements to weather stations and manual measurements and serve to collect critical process information for snow models dong and menzel 2017 for regions that have an adequate density of point observations the spatial distribution of snow hydrological variables can be estimated using geostatistical interpolation techniques foppa et al 2007 such as inverse distance weighting jarvis and stuart 2001 kriging carrera hernández and gaskin 2007 and regression tree models molotch et al 2005 however estimating the areal spatial distribution of snow cover using point scale snow monitoring is particularly difficult in mountainous environments given the complex topography vegetation transition and scarce meteorological stations lópez moreno and nogués bravo 2006 evaluated the performance of several local geostatistical and global interpolation methods for mapping the snowpack distribution on the iberian peninsula and they concluded that local and geostatistical interpolators did not provide satisfactory predictions of sd whereas generalized additive models gams performed better but still produced remarkable overestimates for some regions meromy et al 2013 validated the representativeness of the sd and swe observations at 15 snow stations in the usa with more than 30 000 field based snow observations in the surrounding area these data were interpolated using regression tree models and were then compared with station data the biases for all sites ranged from 74 overestimated to 77 underestimated which indicates a poor relationship between the point scale and regional scale snow measurements in mountainous regions therefore remote sensing and hydrological simulations possess greater potential to provide accurate predictions of snowpack distributions at large scales 3 2 remote sensing remote sensing technology has had a major impact on data collection in the measurement of snow accumulation and ablation dewalle and rango 2008 during the last several decades many remotely sensed snow products including both sca and swe data have been developed to investigate snow cover in addition recent satellite products mainly gpm provide algorithms to capture solid precipitation snow comparing to previous versions which were not able to distinguish between snow and rain omranian and sharif 2018 skofronick jackson et al 2017 snowfall measurement from space is important to understand the global precipitation and hydrologic cycle adhikari et al 2018 table 3 shows some optical satellite sensors that have been widely used in snow cover mapping optical sensors loaded on satellites or aircraft can distinguish objects on the ground by examining the reflected visible light vis 0 39 0 70 μm and infrared radiation ir 0 70 μm 1 00 mm fig 3 illustrates the spectral reflectances of several land features in the vis and ir range and shows that snow has a high vis reflectance and low ir reflectance thus the normalized difference snow index ndsi has been developed to detect snow cover in optical remote sensing data for example modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer band 4 0 545 0 565 μm and band 6 1 628 1 652 μm are used to calculate the ndsi and map snow cover this method can discriminate snow from most land cover classes and from water clouds since they have different characteristics on the electromagnetic spectrum however ice clouds upper tropospheric cirrus clouds have reflection characteristics that are similar to those of snow and the ndsi is thus prone to incorrectly labeling ice clouds as snow in mountainous regions where cloud cover is a typical and predominant feature confusion between snow and clouds is common in addition dense cloud cover can seriously block the snow observations of space based optical sensors microwave remote sensing is an appropriate substitute in this situation the emitted microwave radiation with a wavelength of 0 1 100 cm from the underlying surface is attenuated by snow cover and a passive microwave pm sensor on a remote sensing platform can quantify the snow mass e g swe of a snowpack by analyzing the characteristics of the received microwave signal since 1978 space borne passive microwave sensors e g smmr have made it possible to globally monitor snow cover sd and swe without being affected by cloud cover and winter darkness ipcc 2007 the parameters of five representative satellite based passive microwave sensors are provided in table 4 since the microwave radiation emitted from the earth s surface itself is at a low level passive microwave sensors cannot provide snow parameters at a fine scale although a high temporal resolution can be achieved thus active microwave am remote sensing has advantages over passive microwave sensing by continuously transmitting a microwave signal to the ground surface and receiving the reflected signal an am instrument can map snow properties at high spatial resolution but at the expense of the repeat pass interval table 4 however microwave reflectivity and scattering characteristics of snow depend on many different factors such as sd swe grain size crystal shape liquid water content impurities temperature stratification ice content and the terrain located beneath the snow cover dietz et al 2012 foster et al 2005 hall and martinec 1985 kelly et al 2003 painter et al 2009 the multiple influences of the snowpack on the microwave signal lead to a large degree of uncertainty and a low accuracy in swe measurements using microwave remote sensing therefore microwave remote sensing of snow needs further improvement of the algorithms used to quantify the relations between snow cover parameters and microwave signals since optical sensor data have a high spatial resolution e g 1 10 m but is limited to cloud free days whereas passive microwave sensors have a coarse spatial resolution e g 5 50 km but are sensitive to multiple snowpack properties the synergistic application of optical and microwave spectral bands with multi sensor fusion techniques provides an opportunity to improve snowpack property estimations muñoz et al 2013 in addition some state of the art remote sensing techniques have recently been developed to obtain snow measurements including gps reflectometry e g jin et al 2016 larson 2016 mccreight et al 2014 and airborne lidar deems et al 2013 kirchner et al 2014 to derive sd gps reflectometry utilizes active microwave reflectometry with a bistatic geometry rather than a monostatic geometry which is typically used in satellite based remote sensing mccreight et al 2014 this technique has an intermediate spatial scale of 1000 m2 and is therefore considered a complementary snow measurement to those of in situ sensors 1 m2 and satellites images 100 km2 larson 2016 in addition this technique can be used for other navigation constellations e g glonass galileo and beidou and thus it may potentially provide new sd data for thousands of sites around the world larson 2016 airborne lidar uses a laser scanning system to detect sd by analyzing changes in the signal return time for snow covered and snow free conditions due to the significant volumetric scattering component of snow more work is needed in terms of error estimation when lidar is applied to the retrieval of snowpack parameters nevertheless both gps reflectometry and lidar have the potential to provide accurate sd and swe information at high spatial resolutions in the future 3 3 hydrological modeling since the 1960s the application of digital computers has allowed hydrologists to simulate snow accumulation and ablation processes using numerical models i e a set of equations depicting the relationships between various environmental elements armstrong and brun 2008 hydrological models have developed from lumped conceptual models e g snow 17 model to physically based distributed models e g noah lsm model table 5 lists some selected hydrological models that include a snow module due to the sparse observation network of meteorological stations snowpack models have made great contributions to the estimation of seasonal snow cover distribution and snowmelt runoff in addition an increasing number of snow parameters can be simulated using hydrological models including swe e g train sd e g crhm snow covered fraction e g jules snow interception e g swap snow albedo e g ncep and snowmelt runoff e g vic however using hydrological models to investigate seasonal snow cover and snow processes is a challenging task for example complicated topography and consequent high variability in snow cover frequent alternations between rain and snow in some regions complicated relationships between the vegetation canopy and snow and wind driven snow redistribution snow drift significantly add to the difficulty of modeling snow processes slater et al 2001 compared snow simulations for a grassland catchment in valdai russia using 21 different land surface models as part of the project for the intercomparison of land surface parameterization schemes pilps phase 2 d systematic differences between the simulations from each model were found such as in simulations of early season ablation events although the models captured the broad features of the snow regime at both intra and interannual scales slater et al 2001 model differences were evident in the vapor exchange and energy budgets which are closely related to snow albedo fractional snow cover and the interplay of these parameters slater et al 2001 rutter et al 2009 conducted a similar project snowmip2 that was more focused on forest snow processes and the simulations of 33 snowpack models were evaluated across a wide range of hydrometeorological and forest canopy conditions at five northern hemisphere locations precipitation phase and duration of above freezing air temperatures are largely responsible for the divergence and convergence of sub canopy snow modeling and the swe estimates showed lower performances at forested sites than open sites rutter et al 2009 in addition the calibration of models contributed to decreasing errors although the benefits of calibration did not translate across years models or forested open conditions rutter et al 2009 rutter et al 2009 concluded that there was no universal best model for all sites or locations because of the high complexity of snow processes in forest environments and the model performance showed large differences between individual models as well as between forested and open sites 4 integration and difficulties of different approaches as discussed above each approach of in situ monitoring remote sensing and hydrological modeling has specific advantages and disadvantages for snow cover measurements sturm 2015 compared these three approaches in a paper fig 4 field measurements have the greatest reliability and are essential to successful modeling but they often fail to capture the local heterogeneity due to either a sparse network or the wrong observing locations remote sensing products have optimal coverage in space but also have fewer snow parameters outright errors and sometimes coarse resolutions snow modeling can partly offset the shortcomings of the above two methods but errors frequently arise from the numerical simplifications of the complicated physics of snow covered areas and from our insufficient understanding of the boundary conditions and forcing functions the best solution for this issue is to integrate the three techniques which can strengthen our ability to monitor estimate and predict snow cover variation and snow related processes in future hydrological research in situ and remote sensing snow observation data can be independently or jointly applied in the calibration process in hydrologic modeling e g ahl et al 2008 franz and karsten 2013 in situ monitoring data are frequently used as ground truth data to support the algorithm development of remote sensing products e g gafurov et al 2015 additionally remotely sensed data are useful in extending the point based station measurements to areal scales e g takala et al 2011 sturm 2015 regarded the three methods used in snow research as a system with three legs fig 4 and he described how to combine them to obtain an accurate understanding of snow in addition the three snow measuring techniques can be connected for confirmation purposes and both ground observations and remotely sensed snow data can be applied to force snow models sturm 2015 within the snow modeling measuring and remote sensing communities a consensus has been building that modeling ultimately achieves its best results and greatest accuracy when it is paired with the other two approaches sturm 2015 during the past two decades remote sensing has experienced the most rapid progress many snow research groups are working on better satellite based and airborne sensors and algorithms to derive more precise sca sd and swe products besides the field observation technology is developing quickly more and more cheap but effective instruments e g sonic sounder time lapse camera have been applied to observe snow dynamics in remote and unattended regions these field based data will contribute to the development of both remote sensing algorithms and snowpack models calibration data assimilation and validation however scale transformation should be considered when using any two of the three methods in snow water research as in other aspects of hydrology we either must upscale from too few measurements or downscale from measurements that are too coarse and imprecise i e remote sensing products sturm 2015 when the strengths of one leg are used to compensate for the weaknesses of the other legs snow researchers should be able to achieve more realistic snow measurements recently data assimilation da has provided an outstanding solution for improving hydrological modeling by synchronously integrating observations from in situ stations or remote sensors an ensemble kalman filter enkf was applied by slater and clark 2006 to assimilate in situ swe data into the snow 17 model and evident improvements in the resulting swe were achieved during the accumulation and melt periods thirel et al 2013 successfully improved the modeled sca and discharges by assimilating modis snow cover products into a distributed hydrological model using a particle filter pf liu et al 2013 assimilated satellite based snow products into the noah land surface model which includes the standard modis sca and amsr e sd data as well as bias adjusted versions compared to in situ observations those authors concluded that the assimilation of bias corrected snow data consistently improved the snow and streamflow predictions therefore it is essential to improve the snow observation data quality before assimilation into hydrological models otherwise the model performance will deteriorate as evidenced in the study by molotch and margulis 2008 there are still few studies about the integration of field measurements and remote sensing products in snow hydrology although some researchers have recently made attempts gafurov et al 2015 provided a novel approach that utilized in situ snow measurements to extrapolate cloud covered pixels on modis snow maps based on the conditional probability between pixels dong and menzel 2016a b introduced a similar method to generate cloud free modis snow cover products and they also used in situ snow observations to reject overestimated snow in satellite data at present due to the scale gap between the two observation approaches the sparse in situ station network has hindered the fusion of these two approaches adding more stations might be helpful but the benefits would be offset by the enormous expense time lapse photography has inspired us to utilize another data source internet based digital pictures that are shared voluntarily by individuals as suggested by goodchild 2007 volunteered geographic information vgi has the potential to provide geographers with a significant source of information on the earth s surface today citizens and travelers worldwide are sharing an increasing number of digital photos with geotags derived from their personal devices such as cameras cell phones and driving recorders and in the future drones and driverless automobiles will also likely contribute such data fig 5 in many countries a large number of weather cameras and traffic monitoring cameras have been connected to the internet and thus can provide real time photos all these web based photos provide valuable geographic information that can be extracted using pattern recognition techniques giuliani et al 2016 yuan et al 2010 moreover some government agencies have already set up platforms to make use of vgi for weather observation purposes for example noaa s citizen weather observer program cwop http wxqa com invites volunteers to collect and share weather data using their private instruments and noaa provides technical support to ensure data quality the australian weather observations website wow http bom wow metoffice gov uk also provides the public with the ability to share their weather observations information and photos by being fused with these new ground based observations e g snow presence or absence the remotely sensed snow cover products can be significantly improved which could help enable retrieval of cloud obstructed pixels and eliminate cloud snow confusion therefore the three leg system proposed by sturm 2015 fig 4 might be modified as shown in fig 6 i e the arrow from in situ observations to remote sensing observations indicates the correction function of the former for the latter the fused ground based and remotely sensed snow observations would better serve hydrological models as data sources for forcing validation and assimilation data due to their increased accuracy and reliability and the resulting models would better approximate the extremely complicated snow physics 5 discussion and conclusions blöschl 2011 emphasized the scale issues in hydrology but these issues are also very important in snow studies as two kinds of snow observations in situ monitoring and remote sensing can provide snowpack information at the point scale 1 d data and areal scale 2 d data respectively with the high reliability and accuracy of modern meteorological instruments field measurements can partly achieve what you see is what you get at the point scale however such accuracy is never achieved at the areal scale e g basin scale because of the large heterogeneity in the hydrological variables due to frequent errors remotely sensed data are often what you see is not what you get even at the areal scale to improve the remote sensing data to what you see is what you get one potential solution involves incorporating ground observations and the applicability of this technique has been proven by several studies dong and menzel 2016b gafurov et al 2015 however remote sensing cannot provide the snow information most important to hydrologists e g snowmelt runoff surface energy balance and snow prediction whereas snow models can i e their major advantage is that they provide what you want due to the ability to offer large scale spatially distributed observations remote sensing has opened new opportunities for the development of fully distributed hydrologic and land surface models xu et al 2014 moreover it is more appropriate to update the model output by assimilating remote sensing observations instead of point based ground measurements zhang et al 2014 utilized only remotely sensed data to force calibrate and update a hydrologic model towards streamflow simulations in an ungauged basin and promising results were achieved as great uncertainty still exists in the inversion algorithms of remote sensing for snow parameters considerable potential improvements remain in the development of remotely sensed snow products more optimization is also needed for snow hydrological models as they are currently unlikely to produce a snow model corresponding to reality due to the lack of local input boundary data and calibration sturm 2015 in situ observations and remote sensing do not easily reveal the snow reality because distinct realities exist at different scales for example a station located within a city may not observe the snowfall that occurred in the surrounding mountains the station record of snow free was the reality in the city but not in the mountainous area a satellite based sensor might capture the snow cover by labeling a coarse pixel as snow covered despite the absence of snow in the city the snow reality for a citizen is snow free while the snow covered conditions in the adjacent mountains is very important for a hydrologist because the subsequent snowmelt will add to rivers through runoff therefore hydrologists can find the best approximation of the snow reality with the full utilization of the three leg system containing in situ observations remote sensing and hydrological modeling noaa s national operational hydrologic remote sensing center nohrsc has made some progress in this direction by providing snow data assimilation system snodas data products which estimate daily sd swe and other parameters based on the assimilation of satellite derived airborne and ground based observations of snow using numerical weather prediction nwp models nohrsc 2004 as snow cover plays an important role at both local and continental scales data assimilation is useful in bridging the scale gap between local observations and hydrological models for example javaheri et al 2018 have assimilated catchment scale water level observations into national water model for flood forecasting at the continental scale and they significantly improved the model predictions thus similar data assimilation schemes can also be applied to increase the accuracy of snow simulations at both local and larger continental scales however as data assimilation highly depends on accurate observations continuous monitoring of snow characteristics is critical for improving model performance especially in mountainous areas where snow plays a key role in the hydrological cycle in alpine and polar regions glaciers have also been remarkably influenced by climate change e g immerzeel et al 2010 yao et al 2007 as this review mainly focuses on the measurements of seasonal snow cover approaches for glacier monitoring are not discussed above traditionally glacier mass balance was measured with the in situ glaciological method which involves placing a network of stakes and pits on the glacier surface and measuring the surface changes kaser et al 2002 recently remote sensing has become a powerful and efficient approach for studying glaciers which are usually located in remote and inaccessible environments gao and liu 2001 optical remote sensing data have been used to map glaciers e g paul et al 2004 however cloud obstruction remains a challenge for optical sensors aboard aircraft or satellites veettil and kamp 2017 unmanned aerial vehicle uav photogrammetry and microwave remote sensing have performed well in mapping cloud covered glaciers e g wigmore and bryan 2017 winsvold et al 2018 furthermore non imaging radar systems such as airborne laser altimeter ala and radio echo sounding offer great potential for remote sensing of glacier microtopography ice thickness and glacier temperature gao and liu 2001 macgregor et al 2015 moreover the modeling approach is a powerful tool in studying glacier dynamics and it can be used for avalanche forecasting glacier melt estimation and assessing the response of glaciers to climate change stahl et al 2008 thus the three leg integration system fig 6 for snow research can also be applied to glacier studies as a concluding remark the author wishes to emphasize the significance of improving the quality of remotely sensed hydrological datasets using ground observations although the different scales lead to a great gap between the two data sources in situ meteorological records still have the potential to contribute to error minimization and cloud removal in remote sensing data the assimilation of remotely sensed observations is an effective technique for relieving the uncertainty of hydrological models but inferior observations may weaken the performance of a model therefore the fusion of ground based and remotely sensed observations is indispensable for achieving superior data assimilation in hydrological research acknowledgments the author would like to acknowledge the financial support of daad stipendien und betreuungsprogramm and kurt hiehle foundation lucas menzel zhiyong liu matthias stork and tobias törnros provided helpful comments and suggestions for this article the author appreciates the constructive comments made by the two reviewers 
7294,snow is an important component of the hydrological cycle as a major part of the cryosphere snow cover also represents a valuable terrestrial water resource in the context of climate change the dynamics of snow cover play a crucial role in rebalancing the global energy and water budgets remote sensing hydrological modeling and in situ observations are three techniques frequently utilized for snow cover investigations however the uncertainties caused by systematic errors scale gaps and complicated snow physics among other factors limit the usability of these three approaches in snow studies in this paper an overview of the advantages limitations and recent progress of the three methods is presented and more effective ways to estimate snow cover properties are evaluated the possibility of improving remotely sensed snow information using ground based observations is discussed as a rapidly growing source of volunteered geographic information vgi web based geotagged photos have great potential to provide ground truth data for remotely sensed products and hydrological models and thus contribute to procedures for cloud removal correction validation forcing and assimilation finally this review proposes a synergistic framework for the future of snow cover research this framework highlights the cross scale integration of in situ and remotely sensed snow measurements and the assimilation of improved remote sensing data into hydrological models keywords remote sensing hydrological model field measurement snow cover geotagged photo 1 introduction snow is precipitation in the form of ice crystals that fall to earth s surface and become snow cover the process of snowfall represents the transfer of water from the atmosphere to the ground surface which is part of the natural water cycle as a major component of the cryosphere snow cover plays an important role in the earth s climate system through its impact on the surface energy budget water cycle primary productivity and surface gas exchange ipcc 2013 snow cover is also an indicator of a changing climate especially because snow accumulation and ablation are closely related to temperature brown and mote 2009 in addition because more than one sixth of the earth s population relies on glaciers and seasonal snowpacks for their water supply the consequences of hydrological changes due to global warming are likely to be severe barnett et al 2005 thus it is imperative to decipher the current changes in snow cover at various scales using our knowledge of hydrology and climatology according to previous estimations based on observations reanalysis products and model simulations hirabayashi et al 2008 hoinkes 1967 snowfall accounts for 5 11 of the total global precipitation the significant disagreement in the estimated fractions of the total precipitation in the form of snow or rain between estimation approaches reveals our insufficient understanding of the spatial distribution of snow nasa s global precipitation measurement gpm is an international satellite mission specifically designed to accurately measure precipitation from space and to provide a new generation of global rainfall and snowfall observations at hourly intervals with full coverage for latitudes 60 n 60 s and partial coverage for the remaining high latitude areas up to 90 hou et al 2014 omranian and sharif 2018 recently intense warming has led to a general reduction in the fraction of solid precipitation snow and an earlier occurrence of snowmelt moreover a shift from spring snowmelt to winter runoff due to climate change is expected to increase risks of winter flooding and summer drought arnell 1999 feng and hu 2007 knowles et al 2006 mote 2003 snow cover in temperate regions e g central and western europe is often close to the melting point and both continental and alpine snow covers are consequently highly sensitive to climate change fitzharris 1996 however although statistically significant snow recession has been reported since the late 1970s or early 1980s over the northern hemisphere brown 2000 brown et al 2010 brown and robinson 2011 estilow et al 2015 ipcc 2013 laternser and schneebeli 2003 the snow cover dynamics in the spatial and temporal dimensions remain poorly quantified this situation is due to not only the high heterogeneity of the snow distribution but also by the divergence of different snow data sources moreover measuring the exact impact of changing temperatures and precipitation on snow is difficult due to differences in the impacts over time and in different regions serquet et al 2011 therefore considerable effort is required to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of snow cover and snow processes in a changing climate this paper introduces the snow cover parameters that are typically first applied by hydrologists then the advantages shortcomings and recent progress of the three snow measurement approaches e g in situ monitoring remote sensing and hydrological modeling are reviewed finally a critical appraisal of the potential of integrating the three techniques into snow cover research is provided efforts that use ground based meteorological data to improve remotely sensed snow products are highlighted the potential contribution of fusing multi source snow observations to update snow hydrological models with data assimilation schemes is then discussed 2 snow cover properties and parameters several variables such as density albedo specific surface area crystal size and shape thermal conductivity permeability diffusivity and shear resistance are required for a complete physical description of a snowpack domine 2011 understanding the physical thermal and optical properties of snow is essential for hydrologic research of snow singh and singh 2001 consequently much attention has been given to snow properties in studies in the literature e g brucker et al 2010 gallet et al 2009 jin et al 2008 koenig et al 2007 montpetit et al 2011 warren 1982 due to the special properties of snow which are summarized by pomeroy and brun 2001 snow cover functions as an energy bank radiation shield insulator reservoir and water transport medium in the global climate eco system in detail snow cover stores latent heat and crystal bonding forces during its formation and releases energy through fusion and sublimation because of its high albedo fresh snow cover reflects most shortwave radiation although albedo decreases with snowmelt as a near black body cold snow absorbs and re emits most longwave radiation but the emission is limited to a snow surface temperature of less than 0 c and thus snow cover hampers rapid warming of the adjacent air relative to a snow free surface street and melnikov 1990 snow cover also acts as an insulator minimizing the thawing of permafrost and protecting microorganisms and plants from wind and severe winter temperatures consequently snow cover plays an important role in influencing surface radiative exchange and heat transfer in addition as a solid water resource snow directly participates in natural water distribution and redistribution through a series of processes environmental factors interact with snow in complex ways and this makes it difficult to investigate snow processes e g snowfall snowmelt sublimation interception snowdrift snow avalanches and rain on snow events several snow cover parameters are used to study the behavior of snowpack at different spatial and temporal scales table 1 shows some of the snow cover parameters that are normally used in hydrological applications ipcc 2013 xie et al 2015 snow covered area sca is an index quantifying the extent of snow cover in a region and is generally derived from snow cover maps and calculated as follows 1 sca n s n t 100 where ns and nt are the numbers of snow pixels and total cloud free pixels respectively in a snow cover map for the study area or subregion because the sca only indicates the extent of snow presence in a region the snow mass or volume information cannot be interpreted based on this index however sca maps have great value for investigating the spatial and temporal variations in snow cover especially when it is difficult to estimate the snow mass over a large area because of varied topography and inhomogeneous snowfall in addition sca information is essential for studying the coupled land air system because the extent of snow cover rather than snow mass has more influence on the interactions between the snow surface and the atmosphere xu and dirmeyer 2013 the higher albedo and lower aerodynamic roughness height of snow cover comparing to the land surface significantly change the thermal and motion states of the atmosphere through direct and indirect feedbacks for hydrologists snow mass and volume parameters are more critical because the water volume stored in the snowpack and subsequent snowmelt runoff can be estimated snow water equivalent swe and snow depth sd are normally measured and used for this purpose the relation between swe mm and sd cm is described by the followed equation 2 swe 10 sd ρ s ρ w where ρs is the snowpack density kg m 3 and ρw is the density of liquid water which is approximately 1 103 kg m 3 to monitor temporal variations in the snowpack snow cover duration scd d snow onset date sod and snow end date sed are three indices used to monitor snowpack via seasonal snow cover behavior the sod and sed represent the dates of the first and last snowfalls respectively during a snow season and are often recorded in julian dates for hydrological applications scd represents the number of days between the sod and the sed during a snow season for regions that have persistent snow cover a hydrological year should be defined in advance e g 1st august to 31st july of the following year in this case the sed represents the date of the last snowfall during a hydrological year for regions that rarely receive snow it may be more appropriate to calculate julian dates for both sod and sed based on a hydrological year beginning on january 1st therefore the sod and sed may have values higher than 366 which indicate a delayed snow onset or early snow ending the six snow cover parameters listed in table 1 include spatial and temporal snow cover distribution parameters sca scd sod and sed and snowpack quantity parameters swe and sd the continuous time series of these six parameters can be utilized to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of snow cover and to estimate the water storage in the snowpack which have crucial significance for climate change assessments and water resource management currently three approaches are frequently used to derive the above mentioned snow parameters one approach is the traditional ground based and mostly manual process of monitoring snow characteristics fig 1 a and these data are typically collected in combination with other variables at meteorological stations however the sparse distribution of meteorological stations with appropriate snow monitoring protocols hinders the ability to conduct a detailed snow survey at a large spatial scale as a result traditional snow measurements cannot provide sufficient snowpack information for water resource management at the basin scale despite point scale accuracy to obtain basin scale information regarding snow cover remote sensing may be used as a substitute fig 1b remotely sensed images have the ability to monitor the near real time snow cover over large areas recently snow remote sensing has been vigorously developed around the world an increasing number of sensors aboard multiple platforms e g satellites drones and aerial and terrestrial assets have been used to make snow observations and they have performed well in measuring snow properties at different scales however compared with in situ snow measurements remotely sensed snow data are limited by the short term nature of the observations the longest satellite based snow dataset i e the noaa weekly snow cover maps only dates to 1966 robinson et al 1993 while some climate stations have snow records spanning more than 100 years e g armstrong 2001 cdiac et al 1991 remotely sensed snow information is also influenced by cloud obstruction and the large errors due to weather influences and the spectral confusion associated with different land surface features misclassifications frequently occur in remote sensing data deems et al 2013 hydrological modeling physically based conceptual and black box models is another robust approach for snow estimation fig 1c based on the input of climatic geomorphologic and other environmental information snow cover can be simulated using numerical models furthermore snowpack models are able to predict snow variations in the future under specific climate scenarios nevertheless snow modeling is often restricted by the scarcity of reliable meteorological observations as model inputs essery et al 2013 moreover the extremely complicated physics of snow are still not sufficiently understood which hinders the development of snowpack models therefore each snow measurement approach i e in situ observations remote sensing and hydrological modeling possesses obvious advantages and shortcomings it is necessary to compare the usability of the three methods and evaluate the possibility of integrating them in snow cover research close relationships exist among the three approaches in situ observations and remote sensing can both be used to collect snow data while the data are an essential input for developing hydrological models currently point based observations are also frequently utilized to improve and validate remote sensing algorithms as snowpack models are highly dependent on data input improving the data quality in situ or remote sensing is critical for successful simulations 3 measurements of snow cover 3 1 in situ monitoring before the development of remote sensing and hydrological modeling in situ snow monitoring had a long history of being used for snowfall and snow cover measurement during the 1500 1800 s modern meteorological observations began in europe and north america with the invention of meteorological instruments and the daily sd and new snowfall amounts were observed by various methods in many countries e g switzerland usa and finland the national rainfall and snowfall archives of the qing dynasty of china date back to 1693 and document systematic records of the rainfall amounts and sd in 268 counties until 1911 snow depth and swe measurements became widespread by 1950 in the mountainous regions of western north america and europe ipcc 2007 with global warming attracting much attention during the second half of the 20th century large scale snow studies called for snow observation data exchanges among different countries the inconsistent monitoring criteria restricted the comparability of snow measurements from various stations and regions for example according to the results of the wmo world meteorological organization solid precipitation measurement intercomparison project at a wind speed of 6 m s the national gauges with wind shield used in sweden norway and finland captured less than 40 of the solid precipitation the instruments used in the usa and canada captured approximately 75 and the national gauges without wind shield used in germany hungary denmark and russia captured only 10 20 of the solid precipitation goodison et al 1998 to improve the quality and consistency of in situ snowfall sd and swe observations several international and national projects have been implemented worldwide and several station based snow datasets have been established table 2 in addition the global synop surface synoptic observations network is sponsored by the wmo and is responsible for the data collection and exchange of coordinated international weather observations from the rbscn regional basic synoptic climatological network stations in situ sd measurements from the station network are provided by the synop reports in near real time at meteorological stations sd is generally observed one or two times per day by a surveyor and the swe is measured at a very low frequency in past years automatic snow stations e g stations equipped with ultrasonic snow height sensors or a swe weighing system have been widely used to monitor sd and swe at high temporal resolutions e g hourly in addition time lapse photography has recently shown the ability to collect sd data parajka et al 2012 and quantify snow canopy interception garvelmann et al 2013 thus this technique represents a low cost and feasible method for monitoring snow processes in remote mountainous areas fig 2 as digital cameras can be easily installed in forested regions to monitor the interactions between snow and vegetation they are useful supplements to weather stations and manual measurements and serve to collect critical process information for snow models dong and menzel 2017 for regions that have an adequate density of point observations the spatial distribution of snow hydrological variables can be estimated using geostatistical interpolation techniques foppa et al 2007 such as inverse distance weighting jarvis and stuart 2001 kriging carrera hernández and gaskin 2007 and regression tree models molotch et al 2005 however estimating the areal spatial distribution of snow cover using point scale snow monitoring is particularly difficult in mountainous environments given the complex topography vegetation transition and scarce meteorological stations lópez moreno and nogués bravo 2006 evaluated the performance of several local geostatistical and global interpolation methods for mapping the snowpack distribution on the iberian peninsula and they concluded that local and geostatistical interpolators did not provide satisfactory predictions of sd whereas generalized additive models gams performed better but still produced remarkable overestimates for some regions meromy et al 2013 validated the representativeness of the sd and swe observations at 15 snow stations in the usa with more than 30 000 field based snow observations in the surrounding area these data were interpolated using regression tree models and were then compared with station data the biases for all sites ranged from 74 overestimated to 77 underestimated which indicates a poor relationship between the point scale and regional scale snow measurements in mountainous regions therefore remote sensing and hydrological simulations possess greater potential to provide accurate predictions of snowpack distributions at large scales 3 2 remote sensing remote sensing technology has had a major impact on data collection in the measurement of snow accumulation and ablation dewalle and rango 2008 during the last several decades many remotely sensed snow products including both sca and swe data have been developed to investigate snow cover in addition recent satellite products mainly gpm provide algorithms to capture solid precipitation snow comparing to previous versions which were not able to distinguish between snow and rain omranian and sharif 2018 skofronick jackson et al 2017 snowfall measurement from space is important to understand the global precipitation and hydrologic cycle adhikari et al 2018 table 3 shows some optical satellite sensors that have been widely used in snow cover mapping optical sensors loaded on satellites or aircraft can distinguish objects on the ground by examining the reflected visible light vis 0 39 0 70 μm and infrared radiation ir 0 70 μm 1 00 mm fig 3 illustrates the spectral reflectances of several land features in the vis and ir range and shows that snow has a high vis reflectance and low ir reflectance thus the normalized difference snow index ndsi has been developed to detect snow cover in optical remote sensing data for example modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer band 4 0 545 0 565 μm and band 6 1 628 1 652 μm are used to calculate the ndsi and map snow cover this method can discriminate snow from most land cover classes and from water clouds since they have different characteristics on the electromagnetic spectrum however ice clouds upper tropospheric cirrus clouds have reflection characteristics that are similar to those of snow and the ndsi is thus prone to incorrectly labeling ice clouds as snow in mountainous regions where cloud cover is a typical and predominant feature confusion between snow and clouds is common in addition dense cloud cover can seriously block the snow observations of space based optical sensors microwave remote sensing is an appropriate substitute in this situation the emitted microwave radiation with a wavelength of 0 1 100 cm from the underlying surface is attenuated by snow cover and a passive microwave pm sensor on a remote sensing platform can quantify the snow mass e g swe of a snowpack by analyzing the characteristics of the received microwave signal since 1978 space borne passive microwave sensors e g smmr have made it possible to globally monitor snow cover sd and swe without being affected by cloud cover and winter darkness ipcc 2007 the parameters of five representative satellite based passive microwave sensors are provided in table 4 since the microwave radiation emitted from the earth s surface itself is at a low level passive microwave sensors cannot provide snow parameters at a fine scale although a high temporal resolution can be achieved thus active microwave am remote sensing has advantages over passive microwave sensing by continuously transmitting a microwave signal to the ground surface and receiving the reflected signal an am instrument can map snow properties at high spatial resolution but at the expense of the repeat pass interval table 4 however microwave reflectivity and scattering characteristics of snow depend on many different factors such as sd swe grain size crystal shape liquid water content impurities temperature stratification ice content and the terrain located beneath the snow cover dietz et al 2012 foster et al 2005 hall and martinec 1985 kelly et al 2003 painter et al 2009 the multiple influences of the snowpack on the microwave signal lead to a large degree of uncertainty and a low accuracy in swe measurements using microwave remote sensing therefore microwave remote sensing of snow needs further improvement of the algorithms used to quantify the relations between snow cover parameters and microwave signals since optical sensor data have a high spatial resolution e g 1 10 m but is limited to cloud free days whereas passive microwave sensors have a coarse spatial resolution e g 5 50 km but are sensitive to multiple snowpack properties the synergistic application of optical and microwave spectral bands with multi sensor fusion techniques provides an opportunity to improve snowpack property estimations muñoz et al 2013 in addition some state of the art remote sensing techniques have recently been developed to obtain snow measurements including gps reflectometry e g jin et al 2016 larson 2016 mccreight et al 2014 and airborne lidar deems et al 2013 kirchner et al 2014 to derive sd gps reflectometry utilizes active microwave reflectometry with a bistatic geometry rather than a monostatic geometry which is typically used in satellite based remote sensing mccreight et al 2014 this technique has an intermediate spatial scale of 1000 m2 and is therefore considered a complementary snow measurement to those of in situ sensors 1 m2 and satellites images 100 km2 larson 2016 in addition this technique can be used for other navigation constellations e g glonass galileo and beidou and thus it may potentially provide new sd data for thousands of sites around the world larson 2016 airborne lidar uses a laser scanning system to detect sd by analyzing changes in the signal return time for snow covered and snow free conditions due to the significant volumetric scattering component of snow more work is needed in terms of error estimation when lidar is applied to the retrieval of snowpack parameters nevertheless both gps reflectometry and lidar have the potential to provide accurate sd and swe information at high spatial resolutions in the future 3 3 hydrological modeling since the 1960s the application of digital computers has allowed hydrologists to simulate snow accumulation and ablation processes using numerical models i e a set of equations depicting the relationships between various environmental elements armstrong and brun 2008 hydrological models have developed from lumped conceptual models e g snow 17 model to physically based distributed models e g noah lsm model table 5 lists some selected hydrological models that include a snow module due to the sparse observation network of meteorological stations snowpack models have made great contributions to the estimation of seasonal snow cover distribution and snowmelt runoff in addition an increasing number of snow parameters can be simulated using hydrological models including swe e g train sd e g crhm snow covered fraction e g jules snow interception e g swap snow albedo e g ncep and snowmelt runoff e g vic however using hydrological models to investigate seasonal snow cover and snow processes is a challenging task for example complicated topography and consequent high variability in snow cover frequent alternations between rain and snow in some regions complicated relationships between the vegetation canopy and snow and wind driven snow redistribution snow drift significantly add to the difficulty of modeling snow processes slater et al 2001 compared snow simulations for a grassland catchment in valdai russia using 21 different land surface models as part of the project for the intercomparison of land surface parameterization schemes pilps phase 2 d systematic differences between the simulations from each model were found such as in simulations of early season ablation events although the models captured the broad features of the snow regime at both intra and interannual scales slater et al 2001 model differences were evident in the vapor exchange and energy budgets which are closely related to snow albedo fractional snow cover and the interplay of these parameters slater et al 2001 rutter et al 2009 conducted a similar project snowmip2 that was more focused on forest snow processes and the simulations of 33 snowpack models were evaluated across a wide range of hydrometeorological and forest canopy conditions at five northern hemisphere locations precipitation phase and duration of above freezing air temperatures are largely responsible for the divergence and convergence of sub canopy snow modeling and the swe estimates showed lower performances at forested sites than open sites rutter et al 2009 in addition the calibration of models contributed to decreasing errors although the benefits of calibration did not translate across years models or forested open conditions rutter et al 2009 rutter et al 2009 concluded that there was no universal best model for all sites or locations because of the high complexity of snow processes in forest environments and the model performance showed large differences between individual models as well as between forested and open sites 4 integration and difficulties of different approaches as discussed above each approach of in situ monitoring remote sensing and hydrological modeling has specific advantages and disadvantages for snow cover measurements sturm 2015 compared these three approaches in a paper fig 4 field measurements have the greatest reliability and are essential to successful modeling but they often fail to capture the local heterogeneity due to either a sparse network or the wrong observing locations remote sensing products have optimal coverage in space but also have fewer snow parameters outright errors and sometimes coarse resolutions snow modeling can partly offset the shortcomings of the above two methods but errors frequently arise from the numerical simplifications of the complicated physics of snow covered areas and from our insufficient understanding of the boundary conditions and forcing functions the best solution for this issue is to integrate the three techniques which can strengthen our ability to monitor estimate and predict snow cover variation and snow related processes in future hydrological research in situ and remote sensing snow observation data can be independently or jointly applied in the calibration process in hydrologic modeling e g ahl et al 2008 franz and karsten 2013 in situ monitoring data are frequently used as ground truth data to support the algorithm development of remote sensing products e g gafurov et al 2015 additionally remotely sensed data are useful in extending the point based station measurements to areal scales e g takala et al 2011 sturm 2015 regarded the three methods used in snow research as a system with three legs fig 4 and he described how to combine them to obtain an accurate understanding of snow in addition the three snow measuring techniques can be connected for confirmation purposes and both ground observations and remotely sensed snow data can be applied to force snow models sturm 2015 within the snow modeling measuring and remote sensing communities a consensus has been building that modeling ultimately achieves its best results and greatest accuracy when it is paired with the other two approaches sturm 2015 during the past two decades remote sensing has experienced the most rapid progress many snow research groups are working on better satellite based and airborne sensors and algorithms to derive more precise sca sd and swe products besides the field observation technology is developing quickly more and more cheap but effective instruments e g sonic sounder time lapse camera have been applied to observe snow dynamics in remote and unattended regions these field based data will contribute to the development of both remote sensing algorithms and snowpack models calibration data assimilation and validation however scale transformation should be considered when using any two of the three methods in snow water research as in other aspects of hydrology we either must upscale from too few measurements or downscale from measurements that are too coarse and imprecise i e remote sensing products sturm 2015 when the strengths of one leg are used to compensate for the weaknesses of the other legs snow researchers should be able to achieve more realistic snow measurements recently data assimilation da has provided an outstanding solution for improving hydrological modeling by synchronously integrating observations from in situ stations or remote sensors an ensemble kalman filter enkf was applied by slater and clark 2006 to assimilate in situ swe data into the snow 17 model and evident improvements in the resulting swe were achieved during the accumulation and melt periods thirel et al 2013 successfully improved the modeled sca and discharges by assimilating modis snow cover products into a distributed hydrological model using a particle filter pf liu et al 2013 assimilated satellite based snow products into the noah land surface model which includes the standard modis sca and amsr e sd data as well as bias adjusted versions compared to in situ observations those authors concluded that the assimilation of bias corrected snow data consistently improved the snow and streamflow predictions therefore it is essential to improve the snow observation data quality before assimilation into hydrological models otherwise the model performance will deteriorate as evidenced in the study by molotch and margulis 2008 there are still few studies about the integration of field measurements and remote sensing products in snow hydrology although some researchers have recently made attempts gafurov et al 2015 provided a novel approach that utilized in situ snow measurements to extrapolate cloud covered pixels on modis snow maps based on the conditional probability between pixels dong and menzel 2016a b introduced a similar method to generate cloud free modis snow cover products and they also used in situ snow observations to reject overestimated snow in satellite data at present due to the scale gap between the two observation approaches the sparse in situ station network has hindered the fusion of these two approaches adding more stations might be helpful but the benefits would be offset by the enormous expense time lapse photography has inspired us to utilize another data source internet based digital pictures that are shared voluntarily by individuals as suggested by goodchild 2007 volunteered geographic information vgi has the potential to provide geographers with a significant source of information on the earth s surface today citizens and travelers worldwide are sharing an increasing number of digital photos with geotags derived from their personal devices such as cameras cell phones and driving recorders and in the future drones and driverless automobiles will also likely contribute such data fig 5 in many countries a large number of weather cameras and traffic monitoring cameras have been connected to the internet and thus can provide real time photos all these web based photos provide valuable geographic information that can be extracted using pattern recognition techniques giuliani et al 2016 yuan et al 2010 moreover some government agencies have already set up platforms to make use of vgi for weather observation purposes for example noaa s citizen weather observer program cwop http wxqa com invites volunteers to collect and share weather data using their private instruments and noaa provides technical support to ensure data quality the australian weather observations website wow http bom wow metoffice gov uk also provides the public with the ability to share their weather observations information and photos by being fused with these new ground based observations e g snow presence or absence the remotely sensed snow cover products can be significantly improved which could help enable retrieval of cloud obstructed pixels and eliminate cloud snow confusion therefore the three leg system proposed by sturm 2015 fig 4 might be modified as shown in fig 6 i e the arrow from in situ observations to remote sensing observations indicates the correction function of the former for the latter the fused ground based and remotely sensed snow observations would better serve hydrological models as data sources for forcing validation and assimilation data due to their increased accuracy and reliability and the resulting models would better approximate the extremely complicated snow physics 5 discussion and conclusions blöschl 2011 emphasized the scale issues in hydrology but these issues are also very important in snow studies as two kinds of snow observations in situ monitoring and remote sensing can provide snowpack information at the point scale 1 d data and areal scale 2 d data respectively with the high reliability and accuracy of modern meteorological instruments field measurements can partly achieve what you see is what you get at the point scale however such accuracy is never achieved at the areal scale e g basin scale because of the large heterogeneity in the hydrological variables due to frequent errors remotely sensed data are often what you see is not what you get even at the areal scale to improve the remote sensing data to what you see is what you get one potential solution involves incorporating ground observations and the applicability of this technique has been proven by several studies dong and menzel 2016b gafurov et al 2015 however remote sensing cannot provide the snow information most important to hydrologists e g snowmelt runoff surface energy balance and snow prediction whereas snow models can i e their major advantage is that they provide what you want due to the ability to offer large scale spatially distributed observations remote sensing has opened new opportunities for the development of fully distributed hydrologic and land surface models xu et al 2014 moreover it is more appropriate to update the model output by assimilating remote sensing observations instead of point based ground measurements zhang et al 2014 utilized only remotely sensed data to force calibrate and update a hydrologic model towards streamflow simulations in an ungauged basin and promising results were achieved as great uncertainty still exists in the inversion algorithms of remote sensing for snow parameters considerable potential improvements remain in the development of remotely sensed snow products more optimization is also needed for snow hydrological models as they are currently unlikely to produce a snow model corresponding to reality due to the lack of local input boundary data and calibration sturm 2015 in situ observations and remote sensing do not easily reveal the snow reality because distinct realities exist at different scales for example a station located within a city may not observe the snowfall that occurred in the surrounding mountains the station record of snow free was the reality in the city but not in the mountainous area a satellite based sensor might capture the snow cover by labeling a coarse pixel as snow covered despite the absence of snow in the city the snow reality for a citizen is snow free while the snow covered conditions in the adjacent mountains is very important for a hydrologist because the subsequent snowmelt will add to rivers through runoff therefore hydrologists can find the best approximation of the snow reality with the full utilization of the three leg system containing in situ observations remote sensing and hydrological modeling noaa s national operational hydrologic remote sensing center nohrsc has made some progress in this direction by providing snow data assimilation system snodas data products which estimate daily sd swe and other parameters based on the assimilation of satellite derived airborne and ground based observations of snow using numerical weather prediction nwp models nohrsc 2004 as snow cover plays an important role at both local and continental scales data assimilation is useful in bridging the scale gap between local observations and hydrological models for example javaheri et al 2018 have assimilated catchment scale water level observations into national water model for flood forecasting at the continental scale and they significantly improved the model predictions thus similar data assimilation schemes can also be applied to increase the accuracy of snow simulations at both local and larger continental scales however as data assimilation highly depends on accurate observations continuous monitoring of snow characteristics is critical for improving model performance especially in mountainous areas where snow plays a key role in the hydrological cycle in alpine and polar regions glaciers have also been remarkably influenced by climate change e g immerzeel et al 2010 yao et al 2007 as this review mainly focuses on the measurements of seasonal snow cover approaches for glacier monitoring are not discussed above traditionally glacier mass balance was measured with the in situ glaciological method which involves placing a network of stakes and pits on the glacier surface and measuring the surface changes kaser et al 2002 recently remote sensing has become a powerful and efficient approach for studying glaciers which are usually located in remote and inaccessible environments gao and liu 2001 optical remote sensing data have been used to map glaciers e g paul et al 2004 however cloud obstruction remains a challenge for optical sensors aboard aircraft or satellites veettil and kamp 2017 unmanned aerial vehicle uav photogrammetry and microwave remote sensing have performed well in mapping cloud covered glaciers e g wigmore and bryan 2017 winsvold et al 2018 furthermore non imaging radar systems such as airborne laser altimeter ala and radio echo sounding offer great potential for remote sensing of glacier microtopography ice thickness and glacier temperature gao and liu 2001 macgregor et al 2015 moreover the modeling approach is a powerful tool in studying glacier dynamics and it can be used for avalanche forecasting glacier melt estimation and assessing the response of glaciers to climate change stahl et al 2008 thus the three leg integration system fig 6 for snow research can also be applied to glacier studies as a concluding remark the author wishes to emphasize the significance of improving the quality of remotely sensed hydrological datasets using ground observations although the different scales lead to a great gap between the two data sources in situ meteorological records still have the potential to contribute to error minimization and cloud removal in remote sensing data the assimilation of remotely sensed observations is an effective technique for relieving the uncertainty of hydrological models but inferior observations may weaken the performance of a model therefore the fusion of ground based and remotely sensed observations is indispensable for achieving superior data assimilation in hydrological research acknowledgments the author would like to acknowledge the financial support of daad stipendien und betreuungsprogramm and kurt hiehle foundation
