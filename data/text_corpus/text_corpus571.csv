2855,this paper presents the first study assessing the climate change impact on groundwater levels of the zagreb alluvial aquifer in croatia by coupling climate projections under rcp8 5 for the period 2040 2070 with local scale groundwater flow modelling as a novelty in groundwater modelling of climate change impacts this study utilizes an ensemble of five climate models and two land surface models for providing projections of relevant boundary conditions to the groundwater model the groundwater model is used for predicting climate driven changes in groundwater levels in the aquifer system influenced by both changes in local groundwater recharge and changes in river flow both boundary conditions are obtained from the land surface models in addition the uncertainty contributions to groundwater levels from both climate models and land surface models were quantified using variance decomposition the results revealed that the spatial pattern of changes in groundwater levels can be related to different processes influencing groundwater dynamics in areas dominated by a strong groundwater surface water interaction close to the sava river the multi model ensemble mean change in groundwater levels is negligible for low and average water levels however for high water levels an increase was identified in contrast a decline in groundwater levels prevails in all areas where aquifer recharge is largely driven by rainfall infiltration for the variance decomposition analysis climate models were identified as the main source of uncertainty for groundwater levels however the uncertainty contribution of the choice of land surface model to the impact simulations was found to be more important in the area affected by a strong groundwater surface water interaction and for periods of high groundwater levels also specific local issues related to low and high groundwater levels that are associated with extreme hydrological regimes were found to exacerbate under climate projections keywords climate change impact groundwater flow modelling groundwater dynamics uncertainties data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the ongoing global warming haeberli et al 1999 kargel et al 2005 is triggering global consequences and it is likely to also alter natural systems at the local scale nistor et al 2016 it is expected that climate change impacts such as changes in precipitation patterns and occurrences of floods and droughts will have a large influence on the availability of groundwater resources hughes et al 2021 the first published papers on the impact of climate change on groundwater resources appeared in the early 1990s treidel et al 2012 the beginning of the new century brings a more intense focus of the scientific research community on the need for a better understanding of how groundwater resources might respond to global change green et al 2011 especially the impact on recharge has received increasing attention scibek allen 2006 ghazavi ebrahimi 2019 epting et al 2021 hughes et al 2021 the impact of climate change on groundwater resources is usually assessed through the propagation of climate change projections through a recharge model that provides recharge input to the groundwater flow models e g paradis et al 2016 akbarpour niksokhan 2018 kambale et al 2017 the complexity of different studies varies with regard to the number of included emission scenarios and climate model projections the approach to the definition of climate change scenarios downscaling methods the choice of groundwater recharge models numerical groundwater flow modelling codes etc thus some studies have utilised multi model ensembles of climate projections ou et al 2018 goodarzi et al 2019 while the others are limited to only one ghazavi ebrahimi 2019 kaur et al 2015 climate change scenarios can be defined for the selected future period or for specific level of global warming e g collados lara et

by feflow iyalomhe et al 2015 vrzel et al 2019 climate change projections are associated with numerous sources of uncertainties jiménez cisneros et al 2014 which makes the inclusion of climate change impacts into water resources management a challenging task uncertainties are associated with each link of the computational chain from greenhouse gas emission scenarios to general circulation models gcms regional climate models rcms downscaling and bias correction methods and hydrological impact models this chain is referred to as the cascade of uncertainty foley 2010 refsgaard et al 2012 refsgaard et al 2016 assessed the relative importance of the different sources in the uncertainty cascade in climate change impact projections with focus on groundwater from several coordinated studies in denmark they found that climate model uncertainty along with natural climate variability often dominate groundwater variables however several studies have also shown that the influence of the hydrological model to the uncertainty increases when moving from mean to extreme values e g karlsson et al 2016 vansteenkiste et al 2014 there are several studies related to climate change impact uncertainties on surface water some deal with uncertainties related to the effect of hydrological model selection on streamflow discharges e g bastola et al 2011 karlsson et al 2016 najafi et al 2011 in contrast those performed for groundwater resources are less common and to our knowledge no study exists with an evaluation of uncertainty contribution from recharge model in this case land surface model choice to climate change impact on spatial groundwater level changes the groundwater dynamics of the zagreb aquifer system are equally influenced by both surface water groundwater interaction and local recharge brkić et al 2010 combining both aspects in the studies of climate change impact on groundwater resources is rare as the focus is usually on either aquifers dominated by local rainfall infiltration e g akbarpour niksokhan 2018 kambale et al 2017 ou et al 2018 or interaction with surface water network allen et al 2004 scibek allen 2006 scibek et al 2007 iyalomhe et al 2015 the exception is the use of catchment scale integrated surface water groundwater models that include the entire hydrological cycle from evapotranspiration to groundwater flow e g seidenfaden et al 2022 de lange et al 2014 which are more advanced but computationally demanding the objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of climate change on groundwater resources in the zagreb alluvial aquifer in general and specifically in the context of the existing groundwater related issues associated with extreme low and high groundwater levels as both issues of low operational water levels in pumping wells and groundwater flooding have occurred previously in the catchment as a novelty in groundwater modelling of climate change impacts the study utilizes an ensemble for both local recharge and regional river stage based on five general circulation models gcms and two land surface models lsms for predicting changes in groundwater levels caused by both upstream changes in surface water contributions and changes in local recharge patterns in addition the uncertainty contribution to groundwater heads from both gcms and lsms serving as boundary conditions for the hydrological impact model is quantified first a numerical model of groundwater flow is designed sec 3 1 and the calibration of the model is conducted sec 3 2 secondly the climate signals are propagated through the system sec 3 3 and the impacts are assessed thirdly the uncertainty of projected changes in groundwater levels is investigated by means of a variance decomposition analysis sec 3 4 2 study area the study area is located in northern croatia in the southwestern part of the pannonian basin and covers 880 km2 fig 1 in the northwest it borders with slovenia and encompasses the western part of the sava valley and the slopes of the surrounding mountains medvednica 1035 m a s l samoborsko gorje 879 m a s l and hills marijagorička brda 312 m a s l and vukomeričke gorice 255 m a s l fig 1 the altitude of the studied area varies between 100 m a s l and 350 m a s l the sava valley extends in a northwest southeast direction and is filled with deposits of neogene and quaternary age according to köppen s classification the study area has a moderately warm humid climate with a warm summer šegota filipčić 2003 more detail can be found in zaninović et al 2008 in the period 1961 1990 the maximum minimum and mean air temperatures were measured at 37 5 c 24 0 c and 10 3 c respectively and in the period 1971 2000 38 5 c 22 6 c and 10 7 c respectively in the period 1961 1990 the maximum minimum and mean precipitation were 1092 mm 558 mm and 852 mm respectively and in the period 1971 2000 1091 mm 558 and 840 mm respectively on average the highest rainfall was in late spring the sava is the most important river in the region fig 1 it originates in slovenia and upon entering croatia flows like a typical lowland river a meandering course lacking rapids with riverbed dominated by fine sediments and higher water temperatures in the period from 1926 to 2006 the minimum average and maximum daily flows of the sava river were 82 m3 s 309 m3 s and 1776 m3 s respectively trninić bošnjak 2009 the riverbed cuts into an underlying gravel sand aquifer unit 1 see below whereby a strong interconnection is evident between the river stages and the nearby groundwater levels marković et al 2013 there are several groundwater abstraction sites fig 1 with a total abstraction rate of approximately 4 0 m3 s which covers the water supply needs for more than 1 million people the aquifer structure is mapped using borehole logs published research results nowinski et al 1967 miletić and borčić 1967 borčić et al 1968a 1968b čakarun et al 1987 velić durn 1993 velić et al 1999 nakić et al 2013 the data base of the croatian geological survey and unpublished reports collected from different sources including geotechnical civil engineering e g geofizika geotehnika and utility companies in total 430 well logs are selected to generate the hydrogeological model presented in this study the aquifer system consists of quaternary sediments within which an alluvial aquifer of intergranular porosity is formed fig 2 the thickness of the alluvial aquifer varies from approximately 10 m in the far west to 100 m in the eastern structural depression two prominent structural depressions are also found in the central part of the studied area fig 2 conceptually the aquifer system consists of three hydrogeological units namely an upper aquifer unit 1 a lower aquifer unit 2 and an underlying low permeable layer unit 3 impervious neogene sediments underlie unit 3 the upper aquifer unit 1 consists of holocene fluvial deposits comprised mainly of coarse gravel and sand with only minor shares of fine grain particles the hydraulic conductivity is very high and based on pumping test results reaches up to 3600 m d close to the sava river due to its hydrogeological features the majority of the production wells are screened in the upper aquifer and hence it represents the most important hydrogeological unit for water supply the aquifer is covered by relatively thin semipermeable silty clayey deposits moving away from the sava river towards the marginal area of the aquifer their thickness generally increases and reaches 4 6 m the aquifer is unconfined and recharged by both rainfall infiltration and leakage from the sava riverbed the general flow of groundwater is from west to southeast fig 1 at some reaches the sava river receives water from the aquifer while at others the river recharges the aquifer the lower aquifer unit 2 is formed in a middle and upper pleistocene lacustrine marshy depositional environment the coarse to fine grained gravel and sand dominate the grain size distribution followed by silt and clay there are also many semipermeable lenses composed of silt and clay which are disconnected and consequently the aquifer represents a uniform hydraulic unit overall the lower aquifer has significantly lower hydraulic conductivity in comparison to the upper aquifer hence it is used to a much lesser extent for water supply close to the northern and southern aquifer boundaries both upper and lower aquifers are in lateral contact with plio quaternary sediments which close to the northern boundary of the model domain borders with upper pontian or pannonian deposits supplementary fig s1 they are characterised by heterogeneous lithological composition and have low to medium permeability fig 3 the underlying low permeable layer unit 3 consists of lower pleistocene and neogene clays and marls 2 1 local groundwater abstraction and flooding issues although the upper aquifer unit 1 has extremely high hydraulic conductivity its thickness is locally relatively small which causes problems with groundwater exploitation during periods with low groundwater levels usually during the summer and early autumn in such conditions the groundwater level at several pumping sites falls below the top of the well screens and consequently the abstraction rates decrease posavec 2006 the issue was further exaggerated by the long term downward trend in groundwater levels in the study area in the past the decline in groundwater levels was on average 1 2 m per decade bačani et al 2010 and primarily caused by a decrease in sava river stages due to anthropogenic factors such as regulation of the river and its tributaries construction of levees and gravel exploitation although the trend was stopped at the beginning of the 1990s after construction of the river dam for the purpose of thermal power plant te to zagreb operations brkić et al 2010 the issues with low groundwater levels in dry season may still exacerbate in the future as a consequence of climate change the mala mlaka groundwater abstraction site fig 1 is one of the largest in the study area with average pumping rate of 1200 l s and most affected by the occasionally low groundwater levels in the catchment area posavec 2006 the drawdowns below the suction baskets of the pumps in the dug wells occurred frequently in the past especially in low hydrological regime this prompted development of six new deeper wells but low operational groundwater levels still remain a limiting factor often causing the drop of groundwater levels below the top of the screen of individual wells thus in the very dry year of 2003 when the groundwater level dropped by approximately 1 3 m below the top of the well screen the capacity of the well was reduced by approximately 60 posavec 2006 in contrast some parts of the study area are endangered by groundwater flooding the groundwater inflow from the upstream parts of the sava valley as well as from the sava river into the neotectonic depression in the eastern part of the study area causes the groundwater level to rise above ground level consequently households and infrastructure are threatened by occasional floods flood hazard maps were created for the purpose of the river basin management plan 2022 2027 barbalić et al 2021 preparation for the scenario of medium flood probability which refers to the probability of the occurrence of a flood of approximately 1 that is for a return period of approximately 100 years the flooded area is shown in fig 1 barbalić et al 2021 the flood depth within our study area would reach 1 5 m and to the southeast of this area it would reach more than 2 5 m 3 methods 3 1 the groundwater flow model setup the numerical model is set up within the groundwater modelling system platform 10 5 aquaveo and simulated using the modflow 2005 code harbaugh et al 2017 and newton raphson formulation to improve the solution of unconfined groundwater flow problems niswonger et al 2011 horizontal discretisation of the model domain is implemented using a grid size of 100 m 100 m a vertical discretisation is based on three layers fig 2 the number of active cells is 265 344 in the central part of the model domain the first model layer corresponds to the upper aquifer hydrogeological unit 1 while the second layer represents the lower aquifer hydrogeological unit 2 and low permeable layer hydrogeological units 3 in the northern and southern marginal areas the first and second layers encompass plio quartenary and or upper pontian deposits characterized by lower transmissivity as compared to the upper aquifer supplementary fig s1 rivers are implemented into the model as head dependent boundaries using the modflow str package prudic 1989 which utilizes simple channel hydraulics and manning s equation to compute the stage in the stream given the stream discharge distributed aquifer recharge rch modflow package groundwater abstraction at pumping sites wel modflow package lateral model domain boundaries and the bottom of the modelling domain are all simulated as specified flux boundaries fig 1 model parameters are initially assigned according to the results of pumping tests the parameter values are subsequently adjusted during the calibration process the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity in the upper aquifer is obtained using the results of pumping tests grain size distribution analysis of aquifer core samples and ordinary kriging interpolation fig 3 in contrast there is limited information on the hydraulic properties of the lower aquifer and especially the low permeable layer hence for each of these hydrogeological units a uniform value of hydraulic conductivity is assumed for the lower aquifer 400 m d is assigned according to the limited data from pumping tests while for low permeability layers 0 001 m d is estimated from literature data bear et al 1968 there is no information on the riverbed conductance in the study area and therefore its initial distribution is obtained indirectly from the river geometry and the estimated thickness of the riverbed material and its hydraulic conductivity 1 1 c rb k v w l m where kv is the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed sediment w is the width of the river reach l is the length of the river reach and m is the thickness of the riverbed sediment three zones are established for aquifer recharge simulation where values are assigned in a range from 0 5 to 25 of annual precipitation fig 3 table 1 depending on the thickness and permeability of the covering semipermeable layer and in accordance with similar hydrogeological setting in the drava river basin urumović et al 1981 patrčević 1995 brkić et al 2021 in the central part of the model domain where the semipermeable covering layer is thin or absent and coarse grain material prevails in lithological composition the recharge is the highest permeable zone it is followed by marginal aquifer areas to the north and south where deposits are composed of fine grain materials semipermeable zone the third recharge zone corresponds to urban area with overall small values of aquifer recharge by infiltration of precipitation urban zone two different model configurations are set up and calibrated a steady state and a transient model the calibrated steady state model is used as a basis for setting up the transient simulation for the 15 year period 1998 2013 using monthly stress periods each stress period is subdivided into 10 time steps in order to help stabilize the numerical solution initial conditions for a transient simulation are specified using groundwater heads from calibrated steady state simulation all forcing data on model boundaries are adjusted to monthly average values hydrogeological properties for the transient simulation are retrieved from the calibrated steady state model additionally the specific yield of the aquifer is set to 0 28 whereas the specific storage coefficients in the underlying deposits were set to 2x10 5 m 1 in accordance with the results of pumping tests monthly recharge values for each stress period are calculated from precipitation for the given month table 1 while the flux across the southeast boundary is obtained from steady state simulation 70000 m3 day and kept constant across all stress periods 3 2 model calibration the model calibration is performed in a two step process with an initial calibration in steady state mode comprising the most sensitive parameters followed by an optimization in transient mode where only the specific yield parameter is adjusted for calibration of the steady state and transient model the parameter estimation tool pest is used doherty 2015 the selection of parameters for the calibration in steady state model is based on the results of a sensitivity analysis which is performed in pest by setting noptmax variable in the pest control file to 1 horizontal hydraulic conductivities of the upper and lower aquifers groundwater recharge and the sava riverbed conductance are identified as sensitive parameters in total five calibration parameters are used for the steady state calibration the initial values of hydraulic conductivity in the upper aquifer were assigned based on pumping tests and geostatistical interpolation and therefore to preserve the distribution from the measurements a scaling factor and offset are used for updating the parameter field for this the initial parameter field is first normalized with its maximum and then multiplied with the scaling factor and lastly the offset is added additionally two scaling factors are used one for recharge zones and the other for the sava riverbed conductance hydraulic conductivity of the lower aquifer is estimated using its initial value subsequently a transient calibration is performed for the entire simulation period 1998 2013 without spin up period during the calibration in transient mode only specific yield is optimized while all other parameters are obtained from the steady state calibration during calibration model performance is assessed based on observed groundwater heads obtained from a network of observation wells fig 1 a total of 171 individual observation wells are used for extracting hydraulic head datasets representing average head targets for steady state simulation and monthly average head targets for transient simulation in the period 1998 2013 because only one kind of observation is used head targets which are measured and simulated with errors of apparently equal variance all weights are set 1 2 hill tiedeman 2007 during calibration the fit between simulated model values and associated observations is quantified using a weighted least squares objective function 2 hill tiedeman 2007 nonlinear regression adjusts the parameter values to minimize the sum of squared weighted residuals 2 φ i 1 n t 1 t i w hi h m h s i t 2 where n is the number of targets whi is the weight for the ith head observation hm is the observed head target hs is the simulated head t is the number of observations in time series for transient calibration after calibration the goodness of

groundwater recharge and streamflow are obtained from the copernicus project edge end to end demonstrator for improved decision making in the water sector in europe https climate copernicus eu decision making water sector europe the edge project provides results from combinations of climate models and land surface models expressed as delta change values from the reference period 1971 2000 to a selected future period the ranges of uncertainty in annual temperature and precipitation projections of the set of five gcms hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc esm chem gfdl esm2m and noresm1 m are comparable with those of all models from the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 samaniego et al 2017 in order to capture as much uncertainty within hydrological model component in total four lsms mesoscale hydrological model mhm the pcraster global water balance model 2 pcr globwb the variable infiltration capacity model vic and the noah land surface model with multiparametrization options noah mp were selected based on diversity of the underlying process representations and their widespread use in hydrological applications samaniego et al 2019 further information on the edge project including technical features of the modelling chain and discussion on the continental scale application of the underlying model components and the forcing data can be found in samaniego et al 2019 we have selected results from five bias corrected climate models that were used to force two lsms mhm and noah mp for the future period 2040 2070 under the emission scenario rcp 8 5 pcr globwb and vic model datasets were incomplete therefore they are not used in this study the mhm kumar et al 2013 samaniego et al 2010 uses grid cells as a primary hydrologic unit and accounts for the following processes canopy interception snow accumulation and melting soil moisture dynamics infiltration and surface runoff evapotranspiration subsurface storage and discharge generation deep percolation and baseflow and discharge attenuation and flood routing noah mp is a 1 d column model that simulates soil moisture soil temperature snow depth snow water equivalent canopy water content and water and energy flux terms of the surface water and energy balance mitchell et al 2004 it uses multiple options for key land atmosphere interaction processes niu et al 2011 it contains a separate vegetation canopy defined by a canopy top and bottom crown radius and leaves with prescribed dimensions orientation density and radiometric properties the canopy employs a two stream radiation transfer approach along with shading effects necessary to achieve proper surface energy and water transfer processes including under canopy snow processes dickinson 1983 niu yang 2004 noah mp contains a multi layer snow pack with liquid water storage and melt refreeze capability and a snow interception model describing loading unloading melt refreeze capability and sublimation of canopy intercepted snow niu yang 2004 yang niu 2003 in terms of groundwater recharge both lsms calculate actual recharge to groundwater table of unconfined aquifer the hydrologic response to the climate change forcing is evaluated following these five steps 1 modelling results from the ten gcm lsm combinations are used for setting up groundwater recharge and streamflow boundary input data for the transient groundwater flow model while other boundary conditions input data are the same as in historic simulation the relative change in groundwater recharge and streamflow delta change factors between the current 1971 2000 and future climate 2040 2070 is calculated on a monthly scale table 2 and multiplied onto the observational data 1998 2013 whereby the aquifer recharge zones and associated relationship in groundwater recharge rates among the zones are kept the same as in historical simulations fig 3 table 1 2 monthly delta change values are available at a 5 km spatial resolution and several grid cells thus cover the zagreb study area the delta change values for groundwater recharge from all the cells are therefore averaged in order to produce one delta change set as a representative for the entire model domain in contrast the streamflow delta change values are extracted from the grid cell coinciding with point where the stream network enters the model domain 3 the groundwater flow model is then run with the new forcing data for all ten scenarios 4 the impact of climate change on the groundwater resources is then assessed as the difference between future and current groundwater heads for low 5th percentile q5 medium 50th percentile q50 and high groundwater levels 95 percentile q95 groundwater flooding and dry wells are assessed by comparing historic and future groundwater flow dynamics in the historically affected areas see section 2 1 5 aggregated statistics and the variance decomposition method are subsequently used to evaluate the uncertainty contribution from gcms and lsms to changes in simulated groundwater heads 3 4 variance decomposition variance decomposition vd is a statistical method for decomposing or separating the variance exerted by different factors to the variable in question déqué et al 2007 the vd thus identifies the contribution to the uncertainty by the factors in this case we investigate the influence of the two factors gcms and lsms on the variable groundwater level change x the variance decomposition is performed in 3 steps first the variance contribution for each of the factors are calculated e g for the variance contribution of the climate model 6 v a r g c m 1 ngcm i 1 ngcm x ij x m 2 here the ngcm is the number of climate models and i denotes the climate model in question i 1 2 3 ngcm and j is the land surface model j 1 2 3 nlsm in this case xij is the mean values of x for the given i across all j s all land surface models while xm is the mean groundwater level change of all i and j s a similarly calculation of the variance contribution can be performed for the land surface model at the second step the combined variance contribution of the factors is calculated as 7 v a r c l 1 ngcm n l s m i 1 ngcm j 1 nlsm x ij x ij x ij x m 2 thus for each factor the variance contribution and the combined variance contribution of the two factors are calculated thirdly the factors percentage of the total variance contribution of all factors is calculated this is called the variance term 8 v g m c v a r g c m v a r c l v a r g c m v a r l s m v a r c l the variance term is thus given as a percentage of variance contribution for each factor in this case the climate model the larger the value the larger the contribution to the uncertainty of the variable the sum of the variance term for the factors climate and land surface model can therefore be more than 100 as also the combined variance contribution is included 4 results 4 1 groundwater model calibration the steady state model performance is evaluated using the performance measures mentioned in section 3 2 fig 4 plotted simulated and observed values fall close to the 1 1 with a slight underestimation of the highest head values fig 4 the model has a low rmse less than 1 5 m and a small mae value less than 1 m the model performance criteria show smaller residuals than the uncertainty on observation data calculated as a square root of the sum of the squared uncertainty estimates relating to measurement scale and non stationarity of groundwater levels thus the model is overall performing well all off diagonal elements of parameter correlation coefficient matrix supplementary table s1 are in the interval 0 5 0 5 and none of them is high enough to suggest nonuniqueness of estimability of the pertinent parameters the estimated horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the lower aquifer and groundwater recharge from rainfall are close to the initial values while the estimates of horizontal hydraulic conductivities in the upper aquifer and the sava riverbed conductance are 45 and 27 lower respectively table 3 the uncertainty in model forecasts can be related to the uncertainty in calibrated parameters hill tiedeman 2007 calculated 95 confidence limits to the calibrated parameters supplementary table s2 have relatively narrow intervals for riverbed conductance and groundwater recharge scaling factors while the intervals for scaling factors for hydraulic conductivity of the first aquifer and especially the second aquifer points to higher uncertainty of estimated parameters the performance of the transient model is shown in fig 4 the performances of the transient and steady state models are very similar but generally the transient model performance is improved in comparison to the steady state observation wells close to the river are expected to have a strong influence from the sava river and thus a strong influence from the applied boundary conditions govern the river while moving away from the river other factors influencing the groundwater flow become important thus the model domain was divided into two regions one within a 2 km buffer around the river and the other outside the buffer fig 6 the values of specific yield estimated in the calibration of the transient model are found to range from 0 11 to 0 30 the higher values are associated with the area close to the river within 2 km buffer where aquifer material is more course than far away from the river and hydraulic conductivities are also the highest subsequently the model performance was assessed for each zone separately and the gain from adjusting the specific yield through calibration can be analysed by comparing the performance before and after calibration of the transient model it can be seen that the boreholes within the river zone show a more dynamic groundwater table than outside the river zone table 4 fig 5 the optimisation of specific yield improved the model performance outside the buffer and a better match between observed and simulated head amplitudes and groundwater table is obtained outside the buffer zone fig 5b the spatial distribution of the mean mae of the transient simulation performance is shown in fig 6 and table 5 more than 50 of observation wells both inside and outside the buffer have a mae below 0 5 m however the proportion of observation wells with a mae above 2 m outside the buffer is higher than that within the buffer 4 2 climate change impact assessment from the climate change impact results the aquifer response to climate change projections expressed as a difference between future and reference groundwater head for mean low and high groundwater levels differs in direction and magnitude of change across the 10 combinations of gcms and lsms supplementary fig s2 6 however when both lsms are forced with the same gcms projections they produce predominantly the same direction of groundwater level change differing only in the magnitude of change whereas noah mp produces generally higher groundwater levels than mhm the only exception is q95 for the combination of noresm1 m hadgem2 es and gfdl esm2m where noah mp unlike mhm generates increases in groundwater levels close to the sava river for the climate models the ipsl cm5a lr and miroc esm chem are generally wet with annual mean changes in groundwater recharge of 1 and 4 respectively and mean monthly changes of up to 40 for the ipsl cm5a lr and 24 for the miroc esm chem in wet season november march when the majority of groundwater recharge occurs table 2 fig 7 d e therefore there is predominantly an increase in groundwater levels in all hydrological conditions supplementary figs s5 6 only locally in the northern marginal area the decline in groundwater levels is observed and also close to the sava river in the western and eastern parts of the study area but only for q5 and ipsl cm5a lr noah mp combination in contrast the annual mean changes in groundwater recharge for climate models noresm1 m hadgem2 es and gfdl esm2m are 7 19 and 18 respectively considering the average monthly changes there is 20 80 less groundwater recharge in the summer months while there is also a decline in november december and march except for noresm1 m noah mp and hadgem2 e mhm combinations in december and march respectively table 2 fig 7a c consequently there is mainly a decrease in groundwater levels supplementary fig s2 4 only in combination with noah mp gcms generate a rise in groundwater levels near the sava river for q95 whereas noresm1 m mhm combination for q95 and the area close to the sava river results in a small 0 1 0 25 m and only locally present increase in groundwater levels the multi model ensemble mean change fig 8 and variability fig 9 in groundwater levels are generated in order to assess the uncertainty originating from different combinations of gcms and lsms the ensemble mean ranges spatially from 1 7 to 0 6 m fig 8 and the median displays similar patterns and values not shown here the general pattern of changes in groundwater levels for q5 and q50 indicates a decline in future groundwater levels when moving away from the river towards marginal parts of the study area where the aquifer is recharged mainly by infiltration of precipitation for q95 two distinct zones with opposite direction of change in future groundwater levels stand out far away from the river the pattern is similar to that for q5 and q50 where the total drop in groundwater levels is even more prominent in contrast there is an increasing trend in future groundwater levels in the central area where groundwater dynamics are strongly influenced by the aquifer interaction with the sava river the standard deviation of the climate change impact results varies from 1e 5 to 1 m it generally increases for high groundwater level conditions q95 and moving from the central parts to the marginal areas indicating that the climate change impacts across models are similar in the area dominated by surface water groundwater interaction fig 9 the uncertainty contribution of five gcms and two lsms to the resulting hydraulic head change was subsequently estimated using vd analysis table 6 the uncertainty contribution from the climate model projections dominates for the groundwater head change with the contribution being highest for dry extremes 98 for q5 and lower for wet 90 for q95 the impact of lsm choice accounts for only 4 and 5 of uncertainty for low and average water levels respectively while the contribution from the climate models to the uncertainty for the q95 remains the most important the choice of lsm here accounts for 10 of the uncertainty an additional vd analysis was also performed for the area covering the 2 km buffer around sava river with the aim to examine potential change in the uncertainty contributions for the area affected more directly by the sava river stage while the results indicate the same trend with dominating influence of climate models the impact of the lsm choice for q95 is here considerable higher i e 25 compared to 10 the prevailing effect of climate model contribution to the uncertainty of the impact assessment is also exemplified in fig 10 while noah mp overall generates higher streamflow and groundwater recharge the pattern of groundwater level changes for both lsms is similar the spread of groundwater level changes std ranges from negligible to 1 m with increasing trend from q5 to q95 in contrast the pattern of mean groundwater level changes over both lsms differs among individual gcms while the spread range is relatively low under 0 5 m for q5 and q50 not shown here for high water levels q95 the spread is the highest up to 1 m which is consistent with the results of vd analysis table 6 indicating an increase in the lsms uncertainty contribution to the climate change impact results for q95 4 3 implications of groundwater flow dynamics under climate change several groundwater related issues have been encountered over the past decades in the study area during both low and high groundwater levels primarily in relation to drinking water supply and groundwater flooding in this study we focus on two specific problems and how climate change projections could potentially affect them groundwater abstraction site efficiency issue during dry season and groundwater flooding in the eastern part of the study area the mala mlaka groundwater abstraction site fig 1 is one of the most important sources of drinking water for public water supply over the years abstraction rates have been limited by relatively low operational groundwater levels in wells in dry season the impact of climate change in the catchment area of the groundwater abstraction site is evaluated by comparison of historical and future monthly minimum groundwater heads fig 11 in a response to climate projections the mean monthly minimum in the dry season from september to november is up to 0 1 m lower as compared to historical values while it is predicted to be higher from february to may moreover considering the spread of the results among different gcm lsm combinations the decline could potentially reach more than 0 3 m which would impose additional limitations on the future peak groundwater abstraction rates in the dry season unless appropriate adaptation measures are taken the groundwater flooding in the eastern part of the study area occurs occasionally during severe wet weather conditions most recently in 2014 when numerous households were under water after several days of extremely high precipitation the mean monthly maximum of the future groundwater heads is up to 0 8 m higher from february to may than for the reference period and is above the ground surface in april which overall indicates a higher future risk of groundwater flooding under projected climate conditions fig 12 moreover if the spread is also accounted for then there is a risk of groundwater flooding in the first half of the year with the potential rise in maximum groundwater levels up to 1 8 m as compared to the reference period 5 discussion in this study we investigate the impact of climate change projections on groundwater resources in the zagreb aquifer which is complicated by the dual impacts of changes in local recharge and regional runoff impacting water levels in the sava river the impact is assessed through coupling of a groundwater flow model and climate projections from ten combinations of gcms and lsms from the copernicus edge project in comparison with more advanced and complex integrated modelling approaches the modelling framework applied in the current study which consists of independent lsms and groundwater flow simulations facilitates the assessment of uncertainty contribution from both gcms and lsms in contrast integrated models e g seidenfaden et al 2022 are usually coupled to one particular land surface scheme therefore the inclusion of additional lsms would require as many different integrated models considering large computational burden usually associated with integrated models the use of independent lsm groundwater flow simulation framework is therefore deemed more appropriate to achieve the objectives of the current study 5 1 groundwater flow model decent calibration results are achieved for both steady state and transient simulations however a drop in model performance is observed when moving away from the central part of the domain towards marginal areas this is evident from spatial distribution of mae and the ability of the model to simulate the amplitudes in observed groundwater time series tables 4 5 fig 5 6 the key reason for this is a lack of data on the aquifer system structure and hydrogeological parameters in this area because the majority of exploratory works have been concentrated in the central area of the sava river valley additionally groundwater heads close to the river are largely influenced by the river stages and if the boundary condition is set up properly then it is easier to achieve a better fit between simulated and observed heads close to the river than further away where groundwater dynamics is more affected by groundwater recharge and geological heterogeneity furthermore using only groundwater heads for calibration targets implies non uniqueness of inverse problem because different combinations of hydraulic conductivity and groundwater recharge values can lead to the same results although in the current study the parameters are not strongly correlated supplementary table s1 the reliability of the groundwater flow models both steady state and transient can be further improved by including additional calibration targets e g river flows overall automatic calibration improved the model performance especially optimisation of specific yield in transient mode however further investigation aimed at filling a gap in knowledge about the structure of the aquifer system and groundwater flow parameters in marginal areas of the model domain is needed to improve the model performance and reliability of model predictions 5 2 climate change impact assessment the projected changes in groundwater levels differ in both magnitude and direction of change among different combinations of gcms and lsms in contrast a multi model mean shows a clear pattern of groundwater level decline when moving away from the sava river towards marginal areas of the study area where the aquifer is recharged predominantly by infiltration of precipitation this is consistent with results from other studies in the region that found indications of an increase in annual evapotranspiration and decrease in precipitation and therefore also in groundwater recharge gampe et al 2016 nistor 2019 reinecke et al 2021 similarly findings from other studies from a broader geographical context and the same climatic zone also indicate a prevalent decline in groundwater recharge and groundwater levels of the shallow aquifer systems under future climate projections erler et al 2019 goderniaux et al 2015 jang et al 2015 lemieux et al 2015 previous studies of climate change impacts on groundwater resources usually focused on aquifers dominated by either rainfall infiltration or surface water groundwater interaction as an example schibek and allan 2006 observed a higher impact of river water perturbation than recharge perturbation on the groundwater table in an unconfined alluvial aquifer near grand forks canada in contrast the pattern of multi model mean aquifer response to climate change projections in our study reflects the important role of both boundary conditions rainfall infiltration and regional river stage this is most evident from the impact results for the extreme wet season q95 fig 8 where the opposite direction of change is predicted for areas dominated by different boundary conditions furthermore the divergent spatial distribution of results for q95 also highlights differences in local and regional climate signals thus the sava river boundary condition applied to the groundwater flow model carries a regional climate signal of the upstream catchment covering 10 770 km2 in the neighbouring slovenia fig 1 which impacts the river water and causes the rise in groundwater levels in the area dominated by river water groundwater interaction conversely a local climate signal causes the decline in groundwater recharge and consequently the decline in groundwater levels in the marginal areas of the aquifer system the differences in climate change impacts on groundwater levels caused by local and regional climate signals is most pronounced in wet season while for q5 and q50 the difference is less prominent leading to smaller dissimilarity in future groundwater level changes between the central and marginal areas the variability of climate change impact on groundwater heads is found to increase for q95 as compared to q5 and q50 and particularly when moving from the central part of the model domain to the marginal areas fig 9 this aligns with the results from the study on the hydrological system behaviour of an alluvial aquifer under climate change in the sava river basin in the neighbouring slovenia where vrzel et al 2019 found that the system is more sensitive to climate conditions when only one source of groundwater prevails in this study the rainfall recharge is practically the only source of groundwater in the marginal areas of the aquifer system leading to the higher variability of climate change impact results in contrast close to the sava river although the groundwater dynamics are dominated by surface water groundwater interaction the rainfall recharge also cannot be neglected thus two sources of groundwater combined with differences in local and regional climate signals resulted in lower variability of changes in groundwater levels the prevailing belief among researchers studying climate change impacts is that climate models represent the main source of uncertainty prudhomme et al 2003 chen et al 2011 refsgaard et al 2016 however the uncertainty contribution from lsms on groundwater heads has to our knowledge not yet been considered in studies of climate change impacts on groundwater levels the results in this study showing that contribution from the climate model projections dominates for the groundwater head change are consistent with those from the previous studies still with lsms contribution of 10 for q95 the influence of lsm choice on climate change impact results for high waters cannot be neglected similar findings were reported by karlsson et al 2016 albeit in a study assessing the uncertainty contribution from different sources on stream discharge however an increase in the influence of hydrological model choice in that study was obtained for both extremes while the results from the current study indicate that the influence of lsms for q5 has even smaller effect than for the average hydrological regime 5 3 implications of groundwater flow dynamics under climate change the risk of flooding and droughts in the context of climate change has been identified as an important topic and therefore numerous studies have been recently carried out worldwide e g hughes et al 2011 lavers and villarini 2013 chan et al 2021 wang et al 2021 pal et al 2022 thus green et al 2011 argue that increasing precipitation in the future can raise the hydraulic head and increase the risk of flooding while secci et al 2021 conclude that groundwater droughts related issues will exacerbate under future climate projections the results presented in this study indicate the risk of more extreme events under climate change at both sides of the hydrological spectrum as compared to the reference period and accordingly they have potential implications on future groundwater resource and flood risk management a projected decline in groundwater levels in the dry season would restrict peak abstraction rates at the mala mlaka abstraction site in this regard managed aquifer recharge mar which is already evaluated as an option for mitigation of the existing issues associated with low operational groundwater levels at the abstraction site meaški et al 2021 is an adaptation measure to consider however positive impact of the proposed mar options for the existing climate conditions needs to be verified in the context of climate change in extreme wet conditions a rise in groundwater heads poses a risk of groundwater flooding which is overall still relatively poorly understood and often mixed with surface water flooding and has therefore not been widely recognised at an international level hughes et al 2011 it usually occurs in low lying areas which is also the case in the current study where it creates a threat for households and transport infrastructure since a detailed spatio temporal evolution of groundwater flooding events is crucial for a comprehensive flood risk assessment and design of appropriate mitigation measures further investigation is needed to improve current understanding of the response of the aquifer system to extreme wet events 5 4 limitations in this study the applied climate change scenarios are defined for the future time horizon however it can be also defined for specific levels of global warming collados lara et al 2020 king and harrington 2018 furthermore climate projections for the time period 2040 2070 are used and no other future time frames are considered also uncertainties arising from emission scenarios are not accounted for as only the most pessimistic ipcc scenario rcp8 5 is taken into account while other scenarios would yield different climate projections land use change and modifications of abstraction rates at the existing groundwater abstraction sites in response to climate change have not been considered however they can notably influence the simulated impact on groundwater heads under projected climate groundwater flow modelling was performed at a monthly time step because climate projections from the edge project were available monthly and the primary focus of this work lies in the groundwater resource assessment which is adequately captured at monthly timescale this can be considered a limiting factor for a comprehensive assessment of the impact of climate projections for extreme hydrological events in this regard the modelling with daily time step along with refined spatial discretisation and establishment of a more adequate groundwater recharge model would provide a better option for the analysis of the impacts on both sides of the hydrological spectrum instead of all four models which were used for simulation of groundwater recharge in response to climate projections in the scope of the edge project in the current study the future groundwater recharge projections are obtained only from two lsms mhm and noah mp ideally we would have used more lsms but unfortunately we were limited to only two due to incomplete groundwater recharge datasets for vic and pcr globwb consequently the range of uncertainty in groundwater recharge projections originating from the lsm selection may not be completely covered finally instead of the delta change downscaling method which is well tested and suitable for studies aimed at assessing effects of average climate factors such as groundwater recharge van roosmalen et al 2007 van roosmalen et al 2011 other methods that are better suited for extreme values should be considered such as distribution based scaling dbs piani et al 2010 6 conclusion the climate change impact on groundwater resources of the zagreb aquifer is assessed for the first time through numerical modelling of groundwater flow including analysis of both local recharge and upstream river water level effects to this end the modelling results from ten combinations of gcms and lsms for rcp 8 5 from copernicus edge project for the period 2040 2070 are used as forcing data for the groundwater flow model furthermore uncertainty assessment and contributions from gcms and lsms to simulated groundwater heads are performed finally implications of climate change impact on the existing groundwater related issues in the study area are discussed the key findings are multi model mean change of groundwater levels under climate change conditions is negligible for q5 and q50 in the central part of the study area dominated by a strong groundwater surface water interaction moving away from the river towards northern and southern marginal areas where infiltration of precipitation is dominant source of groundwater recharge a decline in groundwater levels is a dominant feature in all hydrological regimes only for q95 an increase in groundwater levels was identified close to the sava river as a consequence of a different climate signal brought by the river from the upstream catchment in the neighbouring slovenia the uncertainty of the results of climate change impact on groundwater heads expressed as standard deviation generally increases from q5 to q95 and from central to marginal areas indicating that the climate change impacts across models are similar in the area dominated by surface water groundwater interaction climate models are found to be the dominating source of the uncertainty for climate change impact results for groundwater levels the impact of lsm choice accounts for only a small part of the uncertainty for low and average water levels while increasing for q95 the impact of lsm choice on uncertainty contributions slightly increases in the area affected by the sava river dynamics the impact of climate change projections on groundwater levels indicates the possibility of exacerbations of the issues related to high drawdowns in the catchment area of the mala mlaka pumping site the projected decline in groundwater levels could reach more than 0 3 m and lead to well capacity reduction of more than 60 as recorded during extremely dry season in 2003 higher risk of flooding is identified in the eastern part of the study area with the rise of groundwater levels potentially reaching more than 1 5 m in comparison to the reference period this study also demonstrates the importance of inclusion of multiple gcms and lsms in evaluation of climate change impacts on groundwater resources as individual results can differ largely in magnitude and direction of change separation of uncertainty contributions facilitates identification of

2855,this paper presents the first study assessing the climate change impact on groundwater levels of the zagreb alluvial aquifer in croatia by coupling climate projections under rcp8 5 for the period 2040 2070 with local scale groundwater flow modelling as a novelty in groundwater modelling of climate change impacts this study utilizes an ensemble of five climate models and two land surface models for providing projections of relevant boundary conditions to the groundwater model the groundwater model is used for predicting climate driven changes in groundwater levels in the aquifer system influenced by both changes in local groundwater recharge and changes in river flow both boundary conditions are obtained from the land surface models in addition the uncertainty contributions to groundwater levels from both climate models and land surface models were quantified using variance decomposition the results revealed that the spatial pattern of changes in groundwater levels can be related to different processes influencing groundwater dynamics in areas dominated by a strong groundwater surface water interaction close to the sava river the multi model ensemble mean change in groundwater levels is negligible for low and average water levels however for high water levels an increase was identified in contrast a decline in groundwater levels prevails in all areas where aquifer recharge is largely driven by rainfall infiltration for the variance decomposition analysis climate models were identified as the main source of uncertainty for groundwater levels however the uncertainty contribution of the choice of land surface model to the impact simulations was found to be more important in the area affected by a strong groundwater surface water interaction and for periods of high groundwater levels also specific local issues related to low and high groundwater levels that are associated with extreme hydrological regimes were found to exacerbate under climate

global warming haeberli et al 1999 kargel et al 2005 is triggering global consequences and it is likely to also alter natural systems at the local scale nistor et al 2016 it is expected that climate change impacts such as changes in precipitation patterns and occurrences of floods and droughts will have a large influence on the availability of groundwater resources hughes et al 2021 the first published papers on the impact of climate change on groundwater resources appeared in the early 1990s treidel et al 2012 the beginning of the new century brings a more intense focus of the scientific research community on the need for a better understanding of how groundwater resources might respond to global change green et al 2011 especially the impact on recharge has received increasing attention scibek allen 2006 ghazavi ebrahimi 2019 epting et al 2021 hughes et al 2021 the impact of climate change on groundwater resources is usually assessed through the propagation of climate change projections through a recharge model that provides recharge input to the groundwater flow models e g paradis et al 2016 akbarpour niksokhan 2018 kambale et al 2017 the complexity of different studies varies with regard to the number of included emission scenarios and climate model projections the approach to the definition of climate change scenarios downscaling methods the choice of groundwater recharge models numerical groundwater flow modelling codes etc thus some studies have utilised multi model ensembles of climate projections ou et al 2018 goodarzi et al 2019 while the

by feflow iyalomhe et al 2015 vrzel et al 2019 climate change projections are associated with numerous sources of uncertainties jiménez cisneros et al 2014 which makes the inclusion of climate change impacts into water resources management a challenging task uncertainties are associated with each link of the computational chain from greenhouse gas emission scenarios to general circulation models gcms regional climate models rcms downscaling and bias correction methods and hydrological impact models this chain is referred to as the cascade of uncertainty foley 2010 refsgaard et al 2012 refsgaard et al 2016 assessed the relative importance of the different sources in the uncertainty cascade in climate change impact projections with focus on groundwater from several coordinated studies in denmark they found that climate model uncertainty along with natural climate variability often dominate groundwater variables however several studies have also shown that the influence of the hydrological model to the uncertainty increases when moving from mean to extreme values e g karlsson et al 2016 vansteenkiste et al 2014 there are several studies related to climate change impact uncertainties on surface water some deal with uncertainties related to the effect of hydrological model selection on streamflow discharges e g bastola et al 2011 karlsson et al 2016 najafi et al 2011 in contrast those performed for groundwater resources are less common and to our knowledge no study exists with an evaluation of uncertainty contribution from recharge model in this case land surface model choice to climate change impact on spatial groundwater level changes the groundwater dynamics of the zagreb aquifer system are equally influenced by both surface water groundwater interaction and local recharge brkić et al 2010 combining both aspects in the studies of climate change impact on groundwater resources is rare as the focus is usually on either aquifers dominated by local rainfall infiltration e g akbarpour niksokhan 2018 kambale et al 2017 ou et al 2018 or interaction with surface water network allen et al 2004 scibek allen 2006 scibek et al 2007 iyalomhe et al 2015 the exception is the use of catchment scale integrated surface water groundwater models that include the entire hydrological cycle from evapotranspiration to groundwater flow e g seidenfaden et al 2022 de lange et al 2014 which are more advanced but computationally demanding the objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of climate change on groundwater resources in the zagreb alluvial aquifer in general and specifically in the context of the existing groundwater related issues associated with extreme low and high groundwater levels as both issues of low operational water levels in pumping wells and groundwater flooding have occurred previously in the catchment as a novelty in groundwater modelling of climate change impacts the study utilizes an ensemble for both local recharge and regional river stage based on five general circulation models gcms and two land surface models lsms for predicting changes in groundwater levels caused by both upstream changes in surface water contributions and changes in local recharge patterns in addition the uncertainty contribution to groundwater heads from both gcms and lsms serving as boundary conditions for the hydrological impact model is quantified first a numerical model of groundwater flow is designed sec 3 1 and the calibration of the model is conducted sec 3 2 secondly the climate signals are propagated through the system sec 3 3 and the impacts are assessed thirdly the uncertainty of projected changes in groundwater levels is investigated by means of a variance decomposition analysis sec 3 4 2 study area the study area is located in northern croatia in the southwestern part of the pannonian basin and covers 880 km2 fig 1 in the northwest it borders with slovenia and encompasses the western part of the sava valley and the slopes of the surrounding mountains medvednica 1035 m a s l samoborsko gorje 879 m a s l and hills marijagorička brda 312 m a s l and vukomeričke gorice 255 m a s l fig 1 the altitude of the studied area varies between 100 m a s l and 350 m a s l the sava valley extends in a northwest southeast direction and is filled with deposits of neogene and quaternary age according to köppen s classification the study area has a moderately warm humid climate with a warm summer šegota filipčić 2003 more detail can be found in zaninović et al 2008 in the period 1961 1990 the maximum minimum and mean air temperatures were measured at 37 5 c 24 0 c and 10 3 c respectively and in the period 1971 2000 38 5 c 22 6 c and 10 7 c respectively in the period 1961 1990 the maximum minimum and mean precipitation were 1092 mm 558 mm and 852 mm respectively and in the period 1971 2000 1091 mm 558 and 840 mm respectively on average the highest rainfall was in late spring the sava is the most important river in the region fig 1 it originates in slovenia and upon entering croatia flows like a typical lowland river a meandering course lacking rapids with riverbed dominated by fine sediments and higher water temperatures in the period from 1926 to 2006 the minimum average and maximum daily flows of the sava river were 82 m3 s 309 m3 s and 1776 m3 s respectively trninić bošnjak 2009 the riverbed cuts into an underlying gravel sand aquifer unit 1 see below whereby a strong interconnection is evident between the river stages and the nearby groundwater levels marković et al 2013 there are several groundwater abstraction sites fig 1 with a total abstraction rate of approximately 4 0 m3 s which covers the water supply needs for more than 1 million people the aquifer structure is mapped using borehole logs published research results nowinski et al 1967 miletić and borčić 1967 borčić et al 1968a 1968b čakarun et al 1987 velić durn 1993 velić et al 1999 nakić et al 2013 the data base of the croatian geological survey and unpublished reports collected from different sources including geotechnical civil engineering e g geofizika geotehnika and utility companies in total 430 well logs are selected to generate the hydrogeological model presented in this study the aquifer system consists of quaternary sediments within which an alluvial aquifer of intergranular porosity is formed fig 2 the thickness of the alluvial aquifer varies from approximately 10 m in the far west to 100 m in the eastern structural depression two prominent structural depressions are also found in the central part of the studied area fig 2 conceptually the aquifer system consists of three hydrogeological units namely an upper aquifer unit 1 a lower aquifer unit 2 and an underlying low permeable layer unit 3 impervious neogene sediments underlie unit 3 the upper aquifer unit 1 consists of holocene fluvial deposits comprised mainly of coarse gravel and sand with only minor shares of fine grain particles the hydraulic conductivity is very high and based on pumping test results reaches up to 3600 m d close to the sava river due to its hydrogeological features the majority of the production wells are screened in the upper aquifer and hence it represents the most important hydrogeological unit for water supply the aquifer is covered by relatively thin semipermeable silty clayey deposits moving away from the sava river towards the marginal area of the aquifer their thickness generally increases and reaches 4 6 m the aquifer is unconfined and recharged by both rainfall infiltration and leakage from the sava riverbed the general flow of groundwater is from west to southeast fig 1 at some reaches the sava river receives water from the aquifer while at others the river recharges the aquifer the lower aquifer unit 2 is formed in a middle and upper pleistocene lacustrine marshy depositional environment the coarse to fine grained gravel and sand dominate the grain size distribution followed by silt and clay there are also many semipermeable lenses composed of silt and clay which are disconnected and consequently the aquifer represents a uniform hydraulic unit overall the lower aquifer has significantly lower hydraulic conductivity in comparison to the upper aquifer hence it is used to a much lesser extent for water supply close to the northern and southern aquifer boundaries both upper and lower aquifers are in lateral contact with plio quaternary sediments which close to the northern boundary of the model domain borders with upper pontian or pannonian deposits supplementary fig s1 they are characterised by heterogeneous lithological composition and have low to medium permeability fig 3 the underlying low permeable layer unit 3 consists of lower pleistocene and neogene clays and marls 2 1 local groundwater abstraction and flooding issues although the upper aquifer unit 1 has extremely high hydraulic conductivity its thickness is locally relatively small which causes problems with groundwater exploitation during periods with low groundwater levels usually during the summer and early autumn in such conditions the groundwater level at several pumping sites falls below the top of the well screens and consequently the abstraction rates decrease posavec 2006 the issue was further exaggerated by the long term downward trend in groundwater levels in the study area in the past the decline in groundwater levels was on average 1 2 m per decade bačani et al 2010 and primarily caused by a decrease in sava river stages due to anthropogenic factors such as regulation of the river and its tributaries construction of levees and gravel exploitation although the trend was stopped at the beginning of the 1990s after construction of the river dam for the purpose of thermal power plant te to zagreb operations brkić et al 2010 the issues with low groundwater levels in dry season may still exacerbate in the future as a consequence of climate change the mala mlaka groundwater abstraction site fig 1 is one of the largest in the study area with average pumping rate of 1200 l s and most affected by the occasionally low groundwater levels in the catchment area posavec 2006 the drawdowns below the suction baskets of the pumps in the dug wells occurred frequently in the past especially in low hydrological regime this prompted development of six new deeper wells but low operational groundwater levels still remain a limiting factor often causing the drop of groundwater levels below the top of the screen of individual wells thus in the very dry year of 2003 when the groundwater level dropped by approximately 1 3 m below the top of the well screen the capacity of the well was reduced by approximately 60 posavec 2006 in contrast some parts of the study area are endangered by groundwater flooding the groundwater inflow from the upstream parts of the sava valley as well as from the sava river into the neotectonic depression in the eastern part of the study area causes the groundwater level to rise above ground level consequently households and infrastructure are threatened by occasional floods flood hazard maps were created for the purpose of the river basin management plan 2022 2027 barbalić et al 2021 preparation for the scenario of medium flood probability which refers to the probability of the occurrence of a flood of approximately 1 that is for a return period of approximately 100 years the flooded area is shown in fig 1 barbalić et al 2021 the flood depth within our study area would reach 1 5 m and to the southeast of this area it would reach more than 2 5 m 3 methods 3 1 the groundwater flow model setup the numerical model is set up within the groundwater modelling system platform 10 5 aquaveo and simulated using the modflow 2005 code harbaugh et al 2017 and newton raphson formulation to improve the solution of unconfined groundwater flow problems niswonger et al 2011 horizontal discretisation of the model domain is implemented using a grid size of 100 m 100 m a vertical discretisation is based on three layers fig 2 the number of active cells is 265 344 in the central part of the model domain the first model layer corresponds to the upper aquifer hydrogeological unit 1 while the second layer represents the lower aquifer hydrogeological unit 2 and low permeable layer hydrogeological units 3 in the northern and southern marginal areas the first and second layers encompass plio quartenary and or upper pontian deposits characterized by lower transmissivity as compared to the upper aquifer supplementary fig s1 rivers are implemented into the model as head dependent boundaries using the modflow str package prudic 1989 which utilizes simple channel hydraulics and manning s equation to compute the stage in the stream given the stream discharge distributed aquifer recharge rch modflow package groundwater abstraction at pumping sites wel modflow package lateral model domain boundaries and the bottom of the modelling domain are all simulated as specified flux boundaries fig 1 model parameters are initially assigned according to the results of pumping tests the parameter values are subsequently adjusted during the calibration process the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity in the upper aquifer is obtained using the results of pumping tests grain size distribution analysis of aquifer core samples and ordinary kriging interpolation fig 3 in contrast there is limited information on the hydraulic properties of the lower aquifer and especially the low permeable layer hence for each of these hydrogeological units a uniform value of hydraulic conductivity is assumed for the lower aquifer 400 m d is assigned according to the limited data from pumping tests while for low permeability layers 0 001 m d is estimated from literature data bear et al 1968 there is no information on the riverbed conductance in the study area and therefore its initial distribution is obtained indirectly from the river geometry and the estimated thickness of the riverbed material and its hydraulic conductivity 1 1 c rb k v w l m where kv is the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed sediment w is the width of the river reach l is the length of the river reach and m is the thickness of the riverbed sediment three zones are established for aquifer recharge simulation where values are assigned in a range from 0 5 to 25 of annual precipitation fig 3 table 1 depending on the thickness and permeability of the covering semipermeable layer and in accordance with similar hydrogeological setting in the drava river basin urumović et al 1981 patrčević 1995 brkić et al 2021 in the central part of the model domain where the semipermeable covering layer is thin or absent and coarse grain material prevails in lithological composition the recharge is the highest permeable zone it is followed by marginal aquifer areas to the north and south where deposits are composed of fine grain materials semipermeable zone the third recharge zone corresponds to urban area with overall small values of aquifer recharge by infiltration of precipitation urban zone two different model configurations are set up and calibrated a steady state and a transient model the calibrated steady state model is used as a basis for setting up the transient simulation for the 15 year period 1998 2013 using monthly stress periods each stress period is subdivided into 10 time steps in order to help stabilize the numerical solution initial conditions for a transient simulation are specified using groundwater heads from calibrated steady state simulation all forcing data on model boundaries are adjusted to monthly average values hydrogeological properties for the transient simulation are retrieved from the calibrated steady state model additionally the specific yield of the aquifer is set to 0 28 whereas the specific storage coefficients in the underlying deposits were set to 2x10 5 m 1 in accordance with the results of pumping tests monthly recharge values for each stress period are calculated from precipitation for the given month table 1 while the flux across the southeast boundary is obtained from steady state simulation 70000 m3 day and kept constant across all stress periods 3 2 model calibration the model calibration is performed in a two step process with an initial calibration in steady state mode comprising the most sensitive parameters followed by an optimization in transient mode where only the specific yield parameter is adjusted for calibration of the steady state and transient model the parameter estimation tool pest is used doherty 2015 the selection of parameters for the calibration in steady state model is based on the results of a sensitivity analysis which is performed in pest by setting noptmax variable in the pest control file to 1 horizontal hydraulic conductivities of the upper and lower aquifers groundwater recharge and the sava riverbed conductance are identified as sensitive parameters in total five calibration parameters are used for the steady state calibration the initial values of hydraulic conductivity in the upper aquifer were assigned based on pumping tests and geostatistical interpolation and therefore to preserve the distribution from the measurements a scaling factor and offset are used for updating the parameter field for this the initial parameter field is first normalized with its maximum and then multiplied with the scaling factor and lastly the offset is added additionally two scaling factors are used one for recharge zones and the other for the sava riverbed conductance hydraulic conductivity of the lower aquifer is estimated using its initial value subsequently a transient calibration is performed for the entire simulation period 1998 2013 without spin up period during the calibration in transient mode only specific yield is optimized while all other parameters are obtained from the steady state calibration during calibration model performance is assessed based on observed groundwater heads obtained from a network of observation wells fig 1 a total of 171 individual observation wells are used for extracting hydraulic head datasets representing average head targets for steady state simulation and monthly average head targets for transient simulation in the period 1998 2013 because only one kind of observation is used head targets which are measured and simulated with errors of apparently equal variance all weights are set 1 2 hill tiedeman 2007 during calibration the fit between simulated model values and associated observations is quantified using a weighted least squares objective function 2 hill

groundwater recharge and streamflow are obtained from the copernicus project edge end to end demonstrator for improved decision making in the water sector in europe https climate copernicus eu

snow niu yang 2004 yang niu 2003 in terms of groundwater recharge both lsms calculate actual recharge to groundwater table of unconfined aquifer the hydrologic response to the climate change forcing is evaluated following these five steps 1 modelling results from the ten gcm lsm combinations are used for setting up groundwater recharge and streamflow boundary input data for the transient groundwater flow model while other boundary conditions input data are the same as in historic simulation the relative change in groundwater recharge and streamflow delta change factors between the current 1971 2000 and future climate 2040 2070 is calculated on a monthly scale table 2 and multiplied onto the observational data 1998 2013 whereby the aquifer recharge zones and associated relationship in groundwater recharge rates among the zones are kept the same as in historical simulations fig 3 table 1 2 monthly delta change values are available at a 5 km spatial resolution and several grid cells thus cover the zagreb study area the delta change values for groundwater recharge from all the cells are therefore averaged in order to produce one delta change set as a representative for the entire model domain in contrast the streamflow delta change values are extracted from the grid cell coinciding with point where the stream network enters the model domain 3 the groundwater flow model is then run with the new forcing data for all ten scenarios 4 the impact of climate change on the groundwater resources is then assessed as the difference between future and current groundwater heads for low 5th percentile q5 medium 50th percentile q50 and high groundwater levels 95 percentile q95 groundwater flooding and dry wells are assessed by comparing historic and future groundwater flow dynamics in the historically affected areas see section 2 1 5 aggregated statistics and the variance decomposition method are subsequently used to evaluate the uncertainty contribution from gcms and lsms to changes in simulated groundwater heads 3 4 variance decomposition variance decomposition vd is a statistical method for decomposing or separating the variance exerted by different factors to the variable in question déqué et al 2007 the vd thus identifies the contribution to the uncertainty by the factors in this case we investigate the influence of the two factors gcms and lsms on the variable groundwater level change x the variance decomposition is performed in 3 steps first the variance contribution for each of the factors are calculated e g for the variance contribution of the climate model 6 v a r g c m 1 ngcm i 1 ngcm x ij x m 2 here the ngcm is the number of climate models and i denotes the climate model in question i 1 2 3 ngcm and j is the land surface model j 1 2 3 nlsm in this case xij is the mean values of x for the given i across all j s all land surface models while xm is the mean groundwater level change of all i and j s a similarly calculation of the variance contribution can be performed for the land surface model at the second step the combined variance contribution of the factors is calculated as 7 v a r c l 1 ngcm n l s m i 1 ngcm j 1 nlsm x ij x ij x ij x m 2 thus for each factor the variance contribution and the combined variance contribution of the two factors are calculated thirdly the factors percentage of the total variance contribution of all factors is calculated this is called the variance term 8 v g m c v a r g c m v a r c l v a r g c m v a r l s m v a r c l the variance term is thus given as a percentage of variance contribution for each factor in this case the climate model the larger the value the larger the contribution to the uncertainty of the variable the sum of the variance term for the factors climate and land surface model can therefore be more than 100 as also the combined variance contribution is included 4 results 4 1 groundwater model calibration the steady state model performance is evaluated using the performance measures mentioned in section 3 2 fig 4 plotted simulated and observed values fall close to the 1 1 with a slight underestimation of the highest head values fig 4 the model has a low rmse less than 1 5 m and a small mae value less than 1 m the model performance criteria show smaller residuals than the uncertainty on observation data calculated as a square root of the sum of the squared uncertainty estimates relating to measurement scale and non stationarity of groundwater levels thus the model is overall performing well all off diagonal elements of parameter correlation coefficient matrix supplementary table s1 are in the interval 0 5 0 5 and none of them is high enough to suggest nonuniqueness of estimability of the pertinent parameters the estimated horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the lower aquifer and groundwater recharge from rainfall are close to the initial values while the estimates of horizontal hydraulic conductivities in the upper aquifer and the sava riverbed conductance are 45 and 27 lower respectively table 3 the uncertainty in model forecasts can be related to the uncertainty in calibrated parameters hill tiedeman 2007 calculated 95 confidence limits to the calibrated parameters supplementary table s2 have relatively narrow intervals for riverbed conductance and groundwater recharge scaling factors while the intervals for scaling factors for hydraulic conductivity of the first aquifer and especially the second aquifer points to higher uncertainty of estimated parameters the performance of the transient model is shown in fig 4 the performances of the transient and steady state models are very similar but generally the transient model performance is improved in comparison to the steady state observation wells close to the river are expected to have a strong influence from the sava river and thus a strong influence from the applied boundary conditions govern the river while moving away from the river other factors influencing the groundwater flow become important thus the model domain was divided into two regions one within a 2 km buffer around the river and the other outside the buffer fig 6 the values of specific yield estimated in the calibration of the transient model are found to range from 0 11 to 0 30 the higher values are associated with the area close to the river within 2 km buffer where aquifer material is more course than far away from the river and hydraulic conductivities are also the highest subsequently the model performance was assessed for each zone separately and the gain from adjusting the specific yield through calibration can be analysed by comparing the performance before and after calibration of the transient model it can be seen that the boreholes within the river zone show a more dynamic groundwater table than outside the river zone table 4 fig 5 the optimisation of specific yield improved the model performance outside the buffer and a better match between observed and simulated head amplitudes and groundwater table is obtained outside the buffer zone fig 5b the spatial distribution of the mean mae of the transient simulation performance is shown in fig 6 and table 5 more than 50 of observation wells both inside and outside the buffer have a mae below 0 5 m however the proportion of observation wells with a mae above 2 m outside the buffer is higher than that within the buffer 4 2 climate change impact assessment from the climate change impact results the aquifer response to climate change projections expressed as a difference between future and reference groundwater head for mean low and high groundwater levels differs in direction and magnitude of change across the 10 combinations of gcms and lsms supplementary fig s2 6 however when both lsms are forced with the same gcms projections they produce predominantly the same direction of groundwater level change differing only in the magnitude of change whereas noah mp produces generally higher groundwater levels than mhm the only exception is q95 for the combination of noresm1 m hadgem2 es and gfdl esm2m where noah mp unlike mhm generates increases in groundwater levels close to the sava river for the climate models the ipsl cm5a lr and miroc esm chem are generally wet with annual mean changes in groundwater recharge of 1 and 4 respectively and mean monthly changes of up to 40 for the ipsl cm5a lr and 24 for the miroc esm chem in wet season november march when the majority of groundwater recharge occurs table 2 fig 7 d e therefore there is predominantly an increase in groundwater levels in all hydrological conditions supplementary figs s5 6 only locally in the northern marginal area the decline in groundwater levels is observed and also close to the sava river in the western and eastern parts of the study area but only for q5 and ipsl cm5a lr noah mp combination in contrast the annual mean changes in groundwater recharge for climate models noresm1 m hadgem2 es and gfdl esm2m are 7 19 and 18 respectively considering the average monthly changes there is 20 80 less groundwater recharge in the summer months while there is also a decline in november december and march except for noresm1 m noah mp and hadgem2 e mhm combinations in december and march respectively table 2 fig 7a c consequently there is mainly a decrease in groundwater levels supplementary fig s2 4 only in combination with noah mp gcms generate a rise in groundwater levels near the sava river for q95 whereas noresm1 m mhm combination for q95 and the area close to the sava river results in a small 0 1 0 25 m and only locally present increase in groundwater levels the multi model ensemble mean change fig 8 and variability fig 9 in groundwater levels are generated in order to assess the uncertainty originating from different combinations of gcms and lsms the ensemble mean ranges spatially from 1 7 to 0 6 m fig 8 and the median displays similar patterns and values not shown here the general pattern of changes in groundwater levels for q5 and q50 indicates a decline in future groundwater levels when moving away from the river towards marginal parts of the study area where the aquifer is recharged mainly by infiltration of precipitation for q95 two distinct zones with opposite direction of change in future groundwater levels stand out far away from the river the pattern is similar to that for q5 and q50 where the total drop in groundwater levels is even more prominent in contrast there is an increasing trend in future groundwater levels in the central area where groundwater dynamics are strongly influenced by the aquifer interaction with the sava river the standard deviation of the climate change impact results varies from 1e 5 to 1 m it generally increases for high groundwater level conditions q95 and moving from the central parts to the marginal areas indicating that the climate change impacts across models are similar in the area dominated by surface water groundwater interaction fig 9 the uncertainty contribution of five gcms and two lsms to the resulting hydraulic head change was subsequently estimated using vd analysis table 6 the uncertainty contribution from the climate model projections dominates for the groundwater head change with the contribution being highest for dry extremes 98 for q5 and lower for wet 90 for q95 the impact of lsm choice accounts for only 4 and 5 of uncertainty for low and average water levels respectively while the contribution from the climate models to the uncertainty for the q95 remains the most important the choice of lsm here accounts for 10 of the uncertainty an additional vd analysis was also performed for the area covering the 2 km buffer around sava river with the aim to examine potential change in the uncertainty contributions for the area affected more directly by the sava river stage while the results indicate the same trend with dominating influence of climate models the impact of the lsm choice for q95 is here considerable higher i e 25 compared to 10 the prevailing effect of climate model contribution to the uncertainty of the impact assessment is also exemplified in fig 10 while noah mp overall generates higher streamflow and groundwater recharge the pattern of groundwater level changes for both lsms is similar the spread of groundwater level changes std ranges from negligible to 1 m with increasing trend from q5 to q95 in contrast the pattern of mean groundwater level changes over both lsms differs among individual gcms while the spread range is relatively low under 0 5 m for q5 and q50 not shown here for high water levels q95 the spread is the highest up to 1 m which is consistent with the results of vd analysis table 6 indicating an increase in the lsms uncertainty contribution to the climate change impact results for q95 4 3 implications of groundwater flow dynamics under climate change several groundwater related issues have been encountered over the past decades in the study area during both low and high groundwater levels primarily in relation to drinking water supply and groundwater flooding in this study we focus on two specific problems and how climate change projections could potentially affect them groundwater abstraction site efficiency issue during dry season and groundwater flooding in the eastern part of the study area the mala mlaka groundwater abstraction site fig 1 is one of the most important sources of drinking water for public water supply over the years abstraction rates have been limited by relatively low operational groundwater levels in wells in dry season the impact of climate change in the catchment area of the groundwater abstraction site is evaluated by comparison of historical and future monthly minimum groundwater heads fig 11 in a response to climate projections the mean monthly minimum in the dry season from september to november is up to 0 1 m lower as compared to historical values while it is predicted to be higher from february to may moreover considering the spread of the results among different gcm lsm combinations the decline could potentially reach more than 0 3 m which would impose additional limitations on the future peak groundwater abstraction rates in the dry season unless appropriate adaptation measures are taken the groundwater flooding in the eastern part of the study area occurs occasionally during severe wet weather conditions most recently in 2014 when numerous households were under water after several days of extremely high precipitation the mean monthly maximum of the future groundwater heads is up to 0 8 m higher from february to may than for the reference period and is above the ground surface in april which overall indicates a higher future risk of groundwater flooding under projected climate conditions fig 12 moreover if the spread is also accounted for then there is a risk of groundwater flooding in the first half of the year with the potential rise in maximum groundwater levels up to 1 8 m as compared to the reference period 5 discussion in this study we investigate the impact of climate change projections on groundwater resources in the zagreb aquifer which is complicated by the dual impacts of changes in local recharge and regional runoff impacting water levels in the sava river the impact is assessed through coupling of a groundwater flow model and climate projections from ten combinations of gcms and lsms from the copernicus edge project in comparison with more advanced and complex integrated modelling approaches the modelling framework applied in the current study which consists of independent lsms and groundwater flow simulations facilitates the assessment of uncertainty contribution from both gcms and lsms in contrast integrated models e g seidenfaden et al 2022 are usually coupled to one particular land surface scheme therefore the inclusion of additional lsms would require as many different integrated models considering large computational burden usually associated with integrated models the use of independent lsm groundwater flow simulation framework is therefore deemed more appropriate to achieve the objectives of the current study 5 1 groundwater flow model decent calibration results are achieved for both steady state and transient simulations however a drop in model performance is observed when moving away from the central part of the domain towards marginal areas this is evident from spatial distribution of mae and the ability of the model to simulate the amplitudes in observed groundwater time series tables 4 5 fig 5 6 the key reason for this is a lack of data on the aquifer system structure and hydrogeological parameters in this area because the majority of exploratory works have been concentrated in the central area of the sava river valley additionally groundwater heads close to the river are largely influenced by the river stages and if the boundary condition is set up properly then it is easier to achieve a better fit between simulated and observed heads close to the river than further away where groundwater dynamics is more affected by groundwater recharge and geological heterogeneity furthermore using only groundwater heads for calibration targets implies non uniqueness of inverse problem because different combinations of hydraulic conductivity and groundwater recharge values can lead to the same results although in the current study the parameters are not strongly correlated supplementary table s1 the reliability of the groundwater flow models both steady state and transient can be further improved by including additional calibration targets e g river flows overall automatic calibration improved the model performance especially optimisation of specific yield in transient mode however further investigation aimed at filling a gap in knowledge about the structure of the aquifer system and groundwater flow parameters in marginal areas of the model domain is needed to improve the model performance and reliability of model predictions 5 2 climate change impact assessment the projected changes in groundwater levels differ in both magnitude and direction of change among different combinations of gcms and lsms in contrast a multi model mean shows a clear pattern of groundwater level decline when moving away from the sava river towards marginal areas of the study area where the aquifer is recharged predominantly by infiltration of precipitation this is consistent with results from other studies in the region that found indications of an increase in annual evapotranspiration and decrease in precipitation and therefore also in groundwater recharge gampe et al 2016 nistor 2019 reinecke et al 2021 similarly findings from other studies from a broader geographical context and the same climatic zone also indicate a prevalent decline in groundwater recharge and groundwater levels of the shallow aquifer systems under future climate projections erler et al 2019 goderniaux et al 2015 jang et al 2015 lemieux et al 2015 previous studies of climate change impacts on groundwater resources usually focused on aquifers dominated by either rainfall infiltration or surface water groundwater interaction as an example schibek and allan 2006 observed a higher impact of river water perturbation than recharge perturbation on the groundwater table in an unconfined alluvial aquifer near grand forks canada in contrast the pattern of multi model mean aquifer response to climate change projections in our study reflects the important role of both boundary conditions rainfall infiltration and regional river stage this is most evident from the impact results for the extreme wet season q95 fig 8 where the opposite direction of change is predicted for areas dominated by different boundary conditions furthermore the divergent spatial distribution of results for q95 also highlights differences in local and regional climate signals thus the sava river boundary condition applied to the groundwater flow model carries a regional climate signal of the upstream catchment covering 10 770 km2 in the neighbouring slovenia fig 1 which impacts the river water and causes the rise in groundwater levels in the area dominated by river water groundwater interaction conversely a local climate signal causes the decline in groundwater recharge and consequently the decline in groundwater levels in the marginal areas of the aquifer system the differences in climate change impacts on groundwater levels caused by local and regional climate signals is most pronounced in wet season while for q5 and q50 the difference is less prominent leading to smaller dissimilarity in future groundwater level changes between the central and marginal areas the variability of climate change impact on groundwater heads is found to increase for q95 as compared to q5 and q50 and particularly when moving from the central part of the model domain to the marginal areas fig 9 this aligns with the results from the study on the hydrological system behaviour of an alluvial aquifer under climate change in the sava river basin in the neighbouring slovenia where vrzel et al 2019 found that the system is more sensitive to climate conditions when only one source of groundwater prevails in this study the rainfall recharge is practically the only source of groundwater in the marginal areas of the aquifer system leading to the higher variability of climate change impact results in contrast close to the sava river although the groundwater dynamics are dominated by surface water groundwater interaction the rainfall recharge also cannot be neglected thus two sources of groundwater combined with differences in local and regional climate signals resulted in lower variability of changes in groundwater levels the prevailing belief among researchers studying climate change impacts is that climate models represent the main source of uncertainty prudhomme et al 2003 chen et al 2011 refsgaard et al 2016 however the uncertainty contribution from lsms on groundwater heads has to our knowledge not yet been considered in studies of climate change impacts on groundwater levels the results in this study showing that contribution from the climate model projections dominates for the groundwater head change are consistent with those from the previous studies still with lsms contribution of 10 for q95 the influence of lsm choice on climate change impact results for high waters cannot be neglected similar findings were reported by karlsson et al 2016 albeit in a study assessing the uncertainty contribution from different sources on stream discharge however an increase in the influence of hydrological model choice in that study was obtained for both extremes while the results from the current study indicate that the influence of lsms for q5 has even smaller effect than for the average hydrological regime 5 3 implications of groundwater flow dynamics under climate change the risk of flooding and droughts in the context of climate change has been identified as an important topic and therefore numerous studies have been recently carried out worldwide e g hughes et al 2011 lavers and villarini 2013 chan et al 2021 wang et al 2021 pal et al 2022 thus green et al 2011 argue that increasing precipitation in the future can raise the hydraulic head and increase the risk of flooding while secci et al 2021 conclude that groundwater droughts related issues will exacerbate under future climate projections the results presented in this study indicate the risk of more extreme events under climate change at both sides of the hydrological spectrum as compared to the reference period and accordingly they have potential implications on future groundwater resource and flood risk management a projected decline in groundwater levels in the dry season would restrict peak abstraction rates at the mala mlaka abstraction site in this regard managed aquifer recharge mar which is already evaluated as an option for mitigation of the existing issues associated with low operational groundwater levels at the abstraction site meaški et al 2021 is an adaptation measure to consider however positive impact of the proposed mar options for the existing climate conditions needs to be verified in the context of climate change in extreme wet conditions a rise in groundwater heads poses a risk of groundwater flooding which is overall still relatively poorly understood and often mixed with surface water flooding and has therefore not been widely recognised at an international level hughes et al 2011 it usually occurs in low lying areas which is also the case in the current study where it creates a threat for households and transport infrastructure since a detailed spatio temporal evolution of groundwater flooding events is crucial for a comprehensive flood risk assessment and design of appropriate mitigation measures further investigation is needed to improve current understanding of the response of the aquifer system to extreme wet events 5 4 limitations in this study the applied climate change scenarios are defined for the future time horizon however it can be also defined for specific levels of global warming collados lara et al 2020 king and harrington 2018 furthermore climate projections for the time period 2040 2070 are used and no other future time frames are considered also uncertainties arising from emission scenarios are not accounted for as only the most pessimistic ipcc scenario rcp8 5 is taken into account while other scenarios would yield different climate projections land use change and modifications of abstraction rates at the existing groundwater abstraction sites in response to climate change have not been considered however they can notably influence the simulated impact on groundwater heads under projected climate groundwater flow modelling was performed at a monthly time step because climate projections from the edge project were available monthly and the primary focus of this work lies in the groundwater resource assessment which is adequately captured at monthly timescale this can be considered a limiting factor for a comprehensive assessment of the impact of climate projections for extreme hydrological events in this regard the modelling with daily time step along with refined spatial discretisation and establishment of a more adequate groundwater recharge model would provide a better option for the analysis of the impacts on both sides of the hydrological spectrum instead of all four models which were used for simulation of groundwater recharge in response to climate projections in the scope of the edge project in the current study the future groundwater recharge projections are obtained only from two lsms mhm and noah mp ideally we would have used more lsms but unfortunately we were limited to only two due to incomplete groundwater recharge datasets for vic and pcr globwb consequently the range of uncertainty in groundwater recharge projections originating from the lsm selection may not be completely covered finally instead of the delta change downscaling method which is well tested and suitable for studies aimed at assessing effects of average climate factors such as groundwater recharge van roosmalen et al 2007 van roosmalen et al 2011 other methods that are better suited for extreme values should be considered such as distribution based scaling dbs piani et al 2010 6 conclusion the climate change impact on groundwater resources of the zagreb aquifer is assessed for the first time through numerical modelling of groundwater flow including analysis of both local recharge and upstream river water level effects to this end the modelling results from ten combinations of gcms and lsms for rcp 8 5 from copernicus edge project for the period 2040 2070 are used as forcing data for the groundwater flow model furthermore uncertainty assessment and contributions from gcms and lsms to simulated groundwater heads are performed finally implications of climate change impact on the existing groundwater related issues in the study area are discussed the key findings are multi model mean change of groundwater levels under climate change conditions is negligible for q5 and q50 in the central part of the study area dominated by a strong groundwater surface water interaction moving away from the river towards northern and southern marginal areas where infiltration of precipitation is dominant source of groundwater recharge a decline in groundwater levels is a dominant feature in all hydrological regimes only for q95 an increase in groundwater levels was identified close to the sava river as a consequence of a different climate signal brought by the river from the upstream catchment in the neighbouring slovenia the uncertainty of the results of climate change impact on groundwater heads expressed as standard deviation generally increases from q5 to q95 and from central to marginal areas indicating that the climate change impacts across models are similar in the area dominated by surface water groundwater interaction climate models are found to be the dominating source of the uncertainty for climate change impact results for groundwater levels the impact of lsm choice accounts for only a small part of the uncertainty for low and average water levels while increasing for q95 the impact of lsm choice on uncertainty contributions slightly increases in the area affected by the sava river dynamics the impact of climate change projections on groundwater levels indicates the possibility of exacerbations of the issues related to high drawdowns in the catchment area of the mala mlaka pumping site the projected decline in groundwater levels could reach more than 0 3 m and lead to well capacity reduction of more than 60 as recorded during extremely dry season in 2003 higher risk of flooding is identified in the eastern part of the study area with the rise of groundwater levels potentially reaching more than 1 5 m in comparison to the reference period this study also demonstrates the importance of inclusion of multiple gcms and lsms in evaluation of climate change impacts on groundwater resources as individual results can differ largely in magnitude and direction of change separation of uncertainty contributions facilitates identification of

2856,large scale vegetation restoration projects have been ongoing in the karst region of southwest china for several years however the influence of vegetation restoration alone on soil moisture sm changes in this region remains unclear in this study a random forest model was constructed using meteorological data the era5 land sm dataset and the enhanced vegetation index to analyze sm changes in the karst region of southwest china caused by vegetation restoration alone the results showed that on a monthly scale vegetation restoration introduced an increase in sm that was mainly concentrated in january april and a decrease that was mainly concentrated in june august on a seasonal scale vegetation changes caused an increase in mean sm in spring and winter and a decrease in mean sm in summer and autumn the largest increase in sm owing to vegetation changes was in spring with an average increase of 0 019 m3 m3 and the largest decrease was in summer with an average decrease of 0 010 m3 m3 however the annual average sm increased only slightly on the seasonal and annual scales the coefficient of variation values for changes in sm caused by vegetation restoration alone were

soil moisture sm is an important component of the soil plant atmosphere hydrological continuum that affects the stability of ecosystems via regulating the growth and development of vegetation heathman et al 2003 legates et al 2011 wang et al 2018 yu et al 2018 yu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 climatic factors have a great influence on sm over long periods of time and on a large scale in addition the effect of changes in vegetation on sm cannot be neglected this is especially true for regions in which vegetation has considerably changed in recent years owing to human activity mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 niether et al 2017 therefore exploring the impact of vegetation restoration on sm including its content and stability is an important issue that must be resolved to understand maintenance of ecosystem stability studies that have analyzed the impact of vegetation changes on sm can be categorized as global or regional studies feng and liu 2015 gu et al 2019 the impact of changes in vegetation on sm at the global scale is usually small because large vegetated areas have not considerably varied at the global scale feng 2016 regionally some case studies have been conducted in certain areas with substantial vegetation changes studies in semiarid and subhumid areas have shown that vegetation restoration causes a decrease in sm bellot et al 2004 yang et al 2014 cao et al 2018 liang et al 2018 liu et al 2018 zhang and shangguan 2016 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 however vegetation restoration in humid areas has varying impacts on sm under different environmental conditions adams et al 1991 van hall et al 2017 hiltbrunner et al 2012 the situation in humid regions is complicated because under sufficient precipitation factors such as water depletion by vegetation soil and bedrock water storage capacity affect the relationship between vegetation changes and sm zhang et al 2014 cámara et al 2017 li et al 2017 humid karst areas are humid climate areas with shallow soil layers and bedrock that is highly permeable to water hartmann et al 2014 deng et al 2020 these characteristics are likely to result in a different sm response caused by vegetation restoration compared with other humid areas studies in humid karst areas mainly include case studies conducted on sample sites and regional studies based on remote sensing or reanalysis data in the former few sample plots are usually selected to study the effect of vegetation changes on sm under specific environmental conditions fu et al 2016 zhou et al 2022 however mountainous karst regions have high environmental heterogeneity that a few case studies are not sufficient to illustrate the overall effect in humid karst areas specifically lithology soil thickness topography and vegetation growth conditions can considerably vary in different karst mountain regions and these factors can affect the relationship between vegetation changes and sm yan et al 2021 yan et al 2022 in contrast regional scale studies based on remote sensing or data reanalysis are better able to reflect general patterns in humid karst regions however these previous regional scale studies only analyzed sm trends and did not exclude the influence of climate so as to separately assess the changes in that result from vegetation restoration alone deng et al 2020 therefore changes in sm due to solely vegetation restoration in humid karst areas remains unclear in areas with significant vegetation restoration failing to consider sm changes influenced solely by vegetation restoration may lead to inaccurate understanding of the effects of vegetation restoration on sm if vegetation restoration and climate change lead to sm changes in opposite directions their combined effect will result in smaller sm changes and the effects of climate change and vegetation restoration on sm may be underestimated specifically assessing sm changes influenced by vegetation restoration alone can thus help accurately understand whether vegetation restoration enhances or slows down sm changes caused by climatic factors the relationship between vegetation change and sm change in karst areas in humid regions is complex and vegetation restoration in humid karst areas has been obvious in recent years zhang et al 2019 zhong et al 2022 as mentioned earlier studies conducted in humid karst areas have not excluded the influence of climate change on vegetation restoration in such areas therefore sm changes caused by vegetation restoration alone in humid karst areas as well as whether vegetation restoration mitigates or exacerbates soil moisture changes caused by climatic factors remain unclear given that increased vegetation consumes more water we hypothesized that vegetation restoration alone in the karst region of southwest china would result in obvious changes in sm the aim of this study was to confirm whether and to what extent sm content and its stability have changed in this study the coefficient of variation of sm was used to characterize the stability of sm by constructing a random forest model rfm using sm data from 2001 to 2003 we simulated sm content affected by vegetation restoration alone from 2004 to 2019 to assess changes in soil moisture content and coefficient of variation caused due to vegetation restoration alone the simulated results were compared with sm data collected before vegetation restoration 2001 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study areas in this work were in yunnan province guizhou province and the guangxi autonomous region in southwestern china which accounted for approximately 796 773 km2 fig 1 a the elevation of the area increases from southeast to northwest fig 1b the terrain is dominated by plateaus and mountains the climate is mainly subtropical humid monsoon climate the average annual precipitation is approximately 1021 mm fig 1c and the annual average temperature is approximately 17 6 c fig 1c d the geology of this area is complex with a large area of carbonate rocks mainly consisting of limestone and dolomite fig 1e the soil in the area is mainly haplic alisols common topsoil fractions 40 sand 37 silt and 23 clay chromic luvisols topsoil fractions 27 sand 27 silt and 46 clay rendzic leptosols topsoil fractions 37 sand 44 silt and 19 clay and dystric regosols topsoil fractions 42 sand 37 silt and 21 clay the soil is loose and erodible and forms a thin layer the vegetation types in the area are diverse although areas of carbonate rock area mainly suitable for the growth of shrubs and grasses whereas areas of noncarbonate rock can support arbor forests the unique geological conditions in this area which have led to extensive development of karst landforms is the most typical karst landform in eastern asia the formation of karst landforms has caused severe soil erosion and water shortages which are not conducive to the development of agricultural production transportation and urbanization resulting in limited social and economic development vegetation in this region has been extensively damaged by reclamation of sloping land grazing and firewood cutting before the 1990s since around 2000 various large scale ecological projects were initiated to restore the ecology of the area the main ecological engineering measures taken here are to reduce human interference thereby achieving secondary vegetation succession although additional measures such as afforestation have been implemented in certain places the area covered by these actions is limited 2 2 data source and processing 2 2 1 sm data sm data for the entire study area were obtained in raster format from the global era5 land sm dataset https cds climate copernicus eu compared with the more commonly used types of remote sensing or reanalysis sm data era5 land has a higher spatial resolution and can better detect spatial variations in sm within the highly heterogeneous karst environment although sm products such as those from the soil moisture active and passive satellite have high spatial resolution it only represents sm to a depth of 0 5 cm in the soil layer whereas era5 land detects sm variations in deeper soil levels root zone therefore era5 land data were used in this study the era5 land sm data consists of four vertical layers 0 7 7 28 28 100 and 100 289 cm since the study was conducted in a humid karst area with shallow soil layers only sm data within a 100 cm depth were selected the spatial resolution of the data was 0 1 0 1 the time resolution was daily and the time range was 2000 2019 after preprocessing the sm data to remove erroneous values the average value and coefficient of variation cv of the study area in the spring summer autumn winter active growing season ags and each month were calculated for analysis the field measured sm dataset in this article was obtained from the chinese crop growth and farmland soil moisture dataset compiled by the china national meteorological science data center https data cma cn the sampling depth of the dataset was 0 10 cm the time resolution was 10 days and the time range was 2000 2013 after removing sites lacking data 44 sites in the study area were selected since the measured sm data at the sites were the relative moisture content the relative sm content was multiplied by the field water holding capacity and the soil bulk density to obtain the soil volumetric moisture content owing to the lack of data on field water holding capacity and soil bulk density at each site the values of these two parameters were obtained from studies since the data were measured in farmland it is anthropogenic soil the soil bulk density is 1 37 g cm3 albergel et al 2012 and the field water holding capacity was set at 30 brocca et al 2010 the accuracy of all era5 land sm dataset was verified by converting the relative soil humidity to soil volumetric water content since the available field measured sm data were recorded on a 10 day scale the accuracy of the era5 land sm dataset of the study area could only be verified on a 10 day scale given that the previous sm field observation dataset was limited to surface data a china wide gravimetric based multilayer sm dataset was used for further validation wang and shi 2019 this dataset included month wise data of soil depths of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 40 50 cm 60 70 cm and 90 100 cm from 1992 to 2013 to match the soil layers of the era5 land sm data we used the 0 10 cm and 10 20 cm data from the gravimetric based dataset to match with the 0 7 cm and 7 28 cm sm data from the era5 land dataset we did not validate the 28 100 cm sm data from era5 land due to multiple layers of missing data at 40 100 cm depth in the gravimetric based multilayer sm dataset 2 2 2 enhanced vegetation index and meteorological data the enhanced vegetation index evi data mod13a3 were obtained from the national aeronautics and space administration http reverb echo nasa gov reverb the spatial resolution of the mod13a3 dataset was 1 km the time resolution was monthly and the time range was 2000 2019 after preprocessing the data such as removal of spatial mosaics and erroneous values linear interpolation was performed pixel by pixel in time the higher temporal resolution of evi means that it is more likely to be affected by cloud cover occlusion anomalies and other factors thereby leading to larger errors therefore this paper uses the maximum synthetic monthly scale data so that the evi more truly reflects the vegetation conditions in the study area after linear interpolation the data time resolution was daily after spatial resampling of the data the spatial resolution was 0 1 0 1 the temperature and precipitation data china surface meteorological daily value dataset v3 0 were obtained from the china national meteorological science data center http data cma cn the time resolution of the dataset was daily and the time range was 2000 2019 after preprocessing the original data anusplin software https fennerschool anu edu au research products anusplin was used to perform day to day spatial interpolation the spatial resolution of the data after interpolation was 0 1 0 1 2 3 methods 2 3 1 rfm a rfm was used to analyze the impact of vegetation on sm the rfm was an ensemble learning algorithm based on a decision tree the algorithm can be roughly divided into a classification algorithm and a regression algorithm in this study the regression algorithm was used the regression algorithm is based on a combined model composed of a set of regression decision subtrees h x θt t 1 2 t where θt is a random variable subject to independent and identical distribution x is the independent variable and t is the number of decision trees ensemble learning uses the value of each decision tree h x θt as the regression prediction result as described in eq 1 1 h x 1 t t 1 t h x θ t where h x θt is the output based on and θ the rfm generates different decision trees from different subsets of training data through the bagging process thereby avoiding the effects of multicollinearity between independent variables breiman 2001 segal and xiao 2011 to date rfms have been applied in many ecohydrological studies and their reliability in ecohydrology has been verified by multiple groups carranza et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 because the onset of large scale vegetation restoration in the karst region of southwest china was around 2000 and no clear effects were observed during the initial years the data from 2000 to 2003 were used to establish the rfm and data from 2004 were used for verification the regression algorithm is summarized as the formula in eq 2 2 sm a p b t c e v i d p p e t p f where a to e are regression parameters f is a constant and the independent variables p t evi tp and pp are the daily precipitation temperature evi previous temperature and previous precipitation from 2000 to 2003 respectively and the dependent variable sm is the daily sm from 2000 to 2003 as the hydrological process in the karst area is relatively rapid fu et al 2015 huang et al 2009 the temperature and precipitation data over the preceding three days were used as the previous meteorological elements after constructing the model we substituted the independent variable from 2004 into the model and compared the simulated sm values with those from era5 land to verify the reliability of the model 2001 was chosen as the base period because a large scale vegetation restoration project was implemented around 2000 and evi data for a whole year are available for 2001 which represents the period before vegetation changes we chose 2019 as the period of change which represents the time after vegetation restoration although vegetation changes did occur to a small degree in the first few years after the vegetation restoration was implemented we used only data from 2001 rather than the average from 2001 to 2003 to optimally represent conditions before vegetation restoration we substituted the daily precipitation daily temperature previous precipitation and previous temperature from 2001 along with the evi for 2019 into the model thus simulating the effect sm from vegetation change alone 2 3 2 methods for determining sm under different influencing factors after obtaining the daily sm data under the condition that the vegetation did not change in 2019 through the rfm the change in the mean value and cv of sm caused by the vegetation change alone were calculated according to eq 3 and 4 3 s m v m e a n s m 2019 m e a n s m p m e a n 4 s m v c v s m 2019 c v s m p c v where sm2019 mean and sm2019 cv are the mean value and cv of the sm after vegetation change respectively which was obtained via substituting the daily precipitation daily temperature previous precipitation and previous temperature from 2001 as well as the evi for 2019 into the rfm model smp mean and smp cv are the mean value and cv of the sm before vegetation change and here we used the era5 land data from 2001 base period to represent sm before vegetation changes smv mean and smv cv are the changes in the mean value and cv of sm before and after vegetation restoration caused only by vegetation restoration a positive value for smv mean indicates that vegetation restoration increased the mean value of sm content while a negative value indicates that vegetation restoration decreased the mean value of sm content the smv cv value was calculated similarly the difference between the changes in sm caused by vegetation alone and those caused by comprehensive factors including climate vegetation restoration and other unspecified factors were calculated using eq 5 and eq 6 5 c mean s m y m e a n s m c m e a n 6 c cv s m v c v s m c c v where cmean is the difference between sm changes caused by vegetation restoration alone and those caused by comprehensive factors accordingly ccv is the difference between the cv of sm changes caused by vegetation restoration alone and those caused by comprehensive factors a positive value of cmean indicates that the change to the average sm content caused by vegetation restoration alone is higher than that caused by comprehensive factors whereas a negative value of cmean indicates the opposite and ccv is similar smc mean and smc cv are the mean value and cv of the sm change before and after vegetation restoration under the influence of comprehensive factors smc mean was obtained by subtracting the actual sm value for 2001 from the actual sm for 2019 from the era5 land data smc cv was obtained in a similar way the above calculations were performed on three different time scales monthly seasonally and yearly moreover the significance of all comparisons was tested since the data were not normally distributed the kruskal wallis test was used for analysis 3 results 3 1 accuracy validation and model parameter determination field measured sm data from 2000 to 2013 were used to verify the era5 land sm dataset on a 10 day scale the era5 land sm dataset overestimated the actual sm values the correlation coefficient between the era5 land sm dataset and field measured sm data was 0 3 for 82 61 of the sites and 0 5 for 50 of the sites fig 2 a whereas the root mean square error rmse was 0 1 for 45 45 of the sites fig 2b the bias between value was 0 1 for 77 27 of the sites fig 2c and the abvr was 0 12 for 43 48 of the sites fig 2d the sites were evenly distributed in space indicating that era5 land sm data of the karst region in southwest china were highly accurate and sufficient for this study the gravimetric based sm dataset also showed that era5 land slightly overestimates actual sm the average correlation coefficient between era5 land and the measured sm in the first layer was 0 55 and 44 of the sites had a correlation coefficient greater than 0 6 while the second layer had an average correlation coefficient of 0 48 and 28 of the sites had a correlation coefficient greater than 0 6 fig 3 a e the average rmse of era5 land and the measured sm in the first layer was 0 10 and 52 of the sites had an rmse less than 0 1 while the second layer had an average rmse of 0 09 and 68 of the sites had an rmse less than 0 1 fig 3b f the average bias of era5 land and the measured sm in the first layer was 0 07 and 56 of the sites had a bias between 0 1 while the second layer had an average bias of 0 05 and 76 of the sites had a bias between 0 1 fig 3c g the average avbr of ra5 land and the measured sm in the first layer was 0 09 and 52 of the sites had an avbr less than 0 08 while the second layer had an average avbr of 0 08 and 60 of the sites had an avbr less than 0 08 fig 3d h for 2000 2003 and 2019 when the number of trees in the rfm was 50 100 the ooberror of all soil layers tended to be stable and the rmse of all soil layers reached a minimum when the number of leaf nodes was five figs 4 and 5 considering the high heterogeneity of the karst mountain environment more trees may need to be built in the local area to stabilize the ooberror of the model thus we herein used 100 trees for pixel by pixel modeling the 2004 dataset was used to verify the prediction results of the rfm model overall the rfm model has high prediction accuracy with an average r2 of approximately 0 8 an average rmse of 0 02 and an average pbias of 2 0 fig 6 from the perspective of different seasons the data predicted using the rfm model demonstrated high accuracy during the growing season however there was some difference between the predicted value and the era5 land sm data during the nongrowing season 3 2 temporal and spatial changes in vegetation and sm content the vegetation change from 2000 to 2019 was dominated by a substantial upward trend accounting for approximately 86 99 of the study area fig 7 a b c i only a few areas showed a decreasing trend in evi which were mainly distributed in the western part of the study area fig 7l however sm content remained generally stable with only a slight increase in sm content in the lower layers fig 7a b c the pixel by pixel correlation analysis showed that despite the weak overall correlation between evi and sm content some local areas with high correlation were still identified fig 7d in addition the areas with low sm and evi were mainly distributed in the northwest part of the study area while areas with high sm and evi are mainly found in the northeast part of the study area fig 7e f g h the rates at which vegetation and climate contribute to sm content changes from 2000 to 2019 are shown in fig 8 the contribution of climatic factors to sm variation was 61 8 whereas the contribution of vegetation factors was 38 2 however this feature varies from month to month the contribution rate of climatic factors to sm content changes in autumn and winter was considerably higher than that of vegetation restoration whereas the opposite was true in summer among the summer months the contribution of climatic factors at depths of 0 7 and 7 28 cm in september exceeded 95 there were also differences in the contribution rates of climate and vegetation change factors at different soil layer depths in spring the climate and human activity factors contributed to sm content changes at similar rates in the 0 7 cm soil layer as well as in the deeper soil layers however vegetation restoration contributed more 3 3 response of the average sm to vegetation changes alone on a monthly scale vegetation changes alone lead to an increase in mean sm in the first half of the year and a decrease in mean sm in the second half of the year this increase in sm was mainly concentrated in january april while the decrease was mainly concentrated in june august the average sm decreased with increasing soil depth owing to vegetation change fig 9 the sm content in the 0 7 cm soil layer increased the most from january to april with an average increase of 0 031 m3 m3 whereas the sm content decreased the least from june to august with an average decrease of 0 008 m3 m3 in the 28 100 cm soil layer the increase in sm content was the smallest from january to april with an average increase of 0 018 m3 m3 whereas the decrease in sm content was the largest from june to august with an average decrease of 0 013 m3 m3 fig 9 on a seasonal scale vegetation changes led to an increase in mean sm in spring and winter a decrease in mean sm in summer and autumn and a minor change in mean sm in ags the largest increase in sm content owing to vegetation change occurred in spring with an average increase of 0 019 m3 m3 and the largest decrease occurred in summer with an average decrease of 0 010 m3 m3 with greater soil depth the rise in sm rise gradually decreased during the spring and the decline in sm gradually increased during the summer fig 10 the increase in sm in spring decreased from 0 022 m3 m3 to 0 017 m3 m3 whereas the decrease in sm in summer increased from 0 008 m3 m3 to 0 0013 m3 m3 fig 10 overall vegetation restoration induced a slight increase in the annual average sm whereas the sm content in summer remained stable fig 11 a since 2004 the average annual sm caused by vegetation restoration has increased from 0 0007 m3 m3 to 0 0060 m3 m3 with an average annual increase of 0 0004 m3 m3 the overall sm in summer has shown a slight downward trend with an average annual rate of 0 0001 m3 m3 this feature also displayed evident differences among different regions fig 11b c d areas that experienced an increase in annual average sm accounted for 54 85 of the total study area and were mainly located in the western part of the study area whereas areas that underwent a decrease in annual average sm were mainly in the eastern part of the study area at greater soil depths there are larger areas of increased annual average sm in the 28 100 cm soil layer the area with increased sm due to vegetation changes increased to 55 13 of the total area fig 11d from a comparison of average sm changes caused by vegetation restoration alone and those owing to comprehensive factors including climate vegetation restoration and other unspecified factors the former was greater than the latter in most months and only in january and july was the former smaller than the latter on the seasonal scale all seasons displayed greater changes in average sm owing to vegetation restoration alone than those owing to the comprehensive factors fig 12 3 4 response of sm cv to vegetation change alone at the monthly scale vegetation restoration alone mainly led to a decrease in the cv of sm with a generally larger decrease from january to april resulting in an average decrease in sm cv of 0 077 vegetation restoration led to an increase in the cv of sm for june july resulting in an average increase in sm cv of 0 011 the decrease in cv of sm decreased gradually with increasing soil depth in most months and the decrease in cv of sm gradually increased in may only its decrease increased from 0 027 to 0 043 fig 13 on the seasonal scale the changes in cv of sm caused by vegetation restoration alone were dominated by decreases with the largest decrease in spring resulting in an average decrease in soil moisture cv of 0 080 only summer experienced a slight increase in the cv of sm on average the decrease in cv of sm caused by vegetation restoration alone gradually decreased with increasing soil depth in spring winter and ags 0 021 and 0 018 fig 14 at the annual scale vegetation restoration alone reduced the cv of sm across most of the study area the area with reduced cv accounted for 98 27 of the total study area on average with the main source of the reduction occurring in the northwestern part of the study area the reduction in cv of sm owing to vegetation restoration alone decreased with increasing soil depth fig 15 a comparison of the variation in cv of sm caused by vegetation restoration alone and that caused by comprehensive factors climate vegetation restoration and other unspecified factors reveals that the former was lower than the latter in most months and was higher than the latter only in july on the seasonal scale the variation in cv of sm due to vegetation restoration alone was lower than that due to the comprehensive factors in all seasons fig 16 4 discussion 4 1 time variations in sm changes due to vegetation restoration alone the results of this study demonstrate that vegetation restoration in a subtropical humid karst area resulted in a slight increase in annual average sm content fig 11 however existing plot scale case studies in humid karst areas have previously found that vegetation restoration resulted in a slight decrease in sm content zhou et al 2022 these results collectively indicate that vegetation restoration in subtropical humid karst regions has little effect on overall sm content on the one hand vegetation restoration causes an increase in vegetation cover which leads to lower soil evaporation li et al 2019 additionally vegetation restoration leads to the formation of a thicker litter layer and the more extensive root system and greater organic matter help form a good aggregate structure in the soil which will increase the water holding capacity of the soil yang et al 2016 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 the above changes are beneficial for increasing sm content in karst areas which are typically characterized by massive water seepage however the increase in transpiration brought about by vegetation restoration cannot be ignored ning et al 2020 wang et al 2022 especially in subtropical regions vegetation restoration in subtropical humid karst areas reduced soil water infiltration and evaporation but increased transpiration the offsetting results of these two processes may be the reason that the changes in sm content caused by vegetation restoration are so minor in contrast low transpiration rates in mildly humid regions owing to increased surface cover after vegetation restoration will lead to a decrease in soil evaporation and ultimately an increase in sm content adams et al 1991 our results also demonstrated that the effects of vegetation restoration on sm content in subtropical humid karst regions exhibited seasonal differences fig 10 the data indicate that the trade off relationship between soil water infiltration and reduced evaporation and the increased transpiration caused by vegetation restoration is not uniform across seasons or different time scales as mentioned above the various processes appear to cancel one another out on an annual scale however owing to the high summer temperatures in subtropical regions vegetation restoration increases transpiration whereas the reductions in soil water infiltration and evaporation that result from vegetation restoration are small this relationship also further proves that for karst areas with surface water shortages although vegetation restoration can improve overall soil water infiltration the degree of improvement may be small and rates are slow 4 2 vegetation restoration in subtropical humid karst regions stabilizes sm our results show that although vegetation restoration in subtropical humid karst regions has little effect on the annual average sm content it is beneficial for stabilizing sm figs 13 15 prior to vegetation changes the condition of vegetation in the karst area of southwest china was poor chi et al 2018 and desertification occurred over a large rocky area fig 17 a coupled with the thin soil cover and high bedrock permeability in this area dong et al 2019 precipitation tends to quickly either evaporate or infiltrate making soil water storage difficult liu et al 2018 this resulted in a large cv for sm prior to vegetation restoration in this area as mentioned earlier vegetation restoration shields the soil from the sun which reduces evaporation it also increases the thickness of the litter layer and changes the hydraulic properties of the soil layer thereby increasing the water storage capacity of the litter layer and the soil layer and reducing water seepage yi et al 2021 zhong et al 2022 fig 17b moreover the greater vegetation cover can cause precipitation to be intercepted by the canopy and litter thereby enabling longer term replenishment of sm sun et al 2022 the combined action of the above factors resulted from the restoration of vegetation in the subtropical humid karst area resulting in greater sm stability our results show that the extent of changes in sm content caused by vegetation restoration exceeds that caused by a combination of factors including climate vegetation restoration and other unspecified factors fig 12 this study also shows that vegetation restoration alleviated the soil drying caused by climate warming to a certain extent from a large scale and long term perspective among the comprehensive factors that result in changes to hydrological processes climate and vegetation restoration are the two most important soonthornrangsan and lowry 2021 yang et al 2022 however precipitation in the karst areas of southwest china has essentially remained stable for the past 20 years whereas temperature has shown a clear upward trend huang et al 2021 yang et al 2022 these climatic changes should theoretically result in a substantial reduction in sm content our results show that no significant change in sm has occurred on an annual scale this indicates that the decrease in sm content caused by rising temperatures is offset by the increase in sm content caused by vegetation restoration 4 3 the uniqueness of the effect of vegetation change on sm in the karst region of southwest china owing to the unique karst environment the results of this study are considerably different from those in other nonkarst vegetation restoration areas for example a study conducted by qiu et al 2021 in the loess plateau in north central china showed that vegetation restoration led to a considerable reduction in sm content which cannot be easily replenished by precipitation however the results of this study suggest that vegetation restoration in the karst region of southwest china mainly led to an increase in mean sm content this difference can be attributed to the fact that the loess plateau is located in an arid and semiarid area with less precipitation therefore after a large scale vegetation restoration project was conducted in this area the sm was largely consumed by the vegetation which greatly reduced the sm however the karst area of southwest china is rich in precipitation and after vegetation restoration the greater canopy and litter cover is able to intercept a large amount of precipitation so that precipitation can supplement sm slowly and continuously therefore vegetation restoration will not considerably reduce the mean value of sm in karst soils in southwest china on a long term scale not only vegetation will change but climate factors such as rainfall and temperature will also change therefore eliminating the impact of climate change is an important prerequisite for a clear understanding of the impact of vegetation restoration on sm in the karst region of southwest china deng et al 2020 used sm data from 1982 to 2015 to analyze changes to sm content in karst areas however long term analysis of changes to sm content could not explain the changes in sm content caused by vegetation restoration alone wei et al 2021 referenced similar precipitation years to analyze changes in sm caused by vegetation restoration in the karst region of southwest china but this study only controlled for precipitation factors and did not consider monthly and seasonal change temperature influences the amount of sm wang et al 2018 tang et al 2019 but is insufficient to solely account for changes in sm caused by vegetation restoration to address this issue the model used in this study controlled for most environmental factors but not vegetation hence the results more accurately reflect the impact of vegetation restoration on sm in the karst region of southwest china 4 4 intra annual prediction uncertainty as can be seen from fig 6 the model in this study had a low prediction accuracy for the nongrowing season this is mainly because only climatic and vegetation factors were considered in the rfm model in this study this simplification achieves good prediction results in the growing season but the relatively weaker influence of evi during the nongrowing season means that other influencing factors on sm become more complicated especially in the complex environmental conditions of the karst mountains xu et al 2017 gong et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 yan et al 2022 specifically the ability of factors other than evi to influence sm is relatively enhanced during the nongrowing season these factors include temporal distribution and variability in solar radiation wind precipitation air temperature vegetation type tree or shrub coniferous or broad leaved deciduous or not water retention of soil and litter layers in different moisture states hydraulic conductivity of rocks etc zhao et al 2018 chai et al 2021 lee and kim 2022 wei et al 2022 however accurate data on these factors are difficult to obtain and there is great spatial variability in karstic mountain environments thus it is difficult to fully consider all the influencing factors in the modeling stage which is likely a common difficulty faced by most empirical models if certain physical process models are used the prediction can usually be improved by parameter calibration baudena et al 2008 abdelhamed et al 2022 however due to the unique surface subsurface binary nature of the hydrological system in karst environments liang and yang 1995 a large amount of surface and soil water seeps into the subsurface through dissolution fissures and the subsurface hydrological conditions are particularly complex so that simulating karst hydrology based on physical process models is still a major challenge sarrazin et al 2018 jeannin et al 2021 as mentioned earlier there are challenges in predicting sm during nongrowing seasons in karst areas however if we only analyze data from growing seasons it will not fully illustrate the overall effect of vegetation restoration on sm and its seasonal variation moreover in humid subtropical monsoon regions like the karst region of southwest china vegetation is not completely dormant from october to march and may still influence sm changes dong et al 2022 zhao et al 2015 therefore for completeness data from the nongrowing season were still included in the analysis however we recognize there is some uncertainty in the results of the nongrowing season therefore we performed month by month quarter by quarter and growing season analyses which not only helped show the overall results but also allowed to focus specifically on more reliable results growing season summer when needed 4 5 limitations the karst region of southwest china is dominated by mountains with large terrain undulations but because of the extensive karst formations the strong karstification complicates the environment in this area wei et al 2021 the complex topography and geomorphology leads to microclimates in local areas which strengthens spatial heterogeneity of sm the spatial scale of all data selected in this study was 0 1 0 1 due to the large pixel range the small spatial range cannot reflect changes to sm nonetheless the sm data with this spatial resolution is presently the most reliable to date by macro scale analysis such large scale data are more conducive to reflect the overall status of sm therefore although spatial resolution of the sm data is lacking the results of this study still explain the overall spatial pattern of sm changes caused by vegetation restoration in the karst region of southwest china 4 6 applications studies have only focused on semiarid and semi humid areas or on humid non karst areas our study based in a humid karst region provides new information for research on sm effects resulting from vegetation change although our results show that vegetation restoration in the karst region of southwest china has no significant effect on sm on an annual scale the water consumption caused by vegetation restoration cannot be ignored our study also shows that vegetation restoration leads to a decrease in summer sm excessive water depletion by vegetation leads directly to reduced runoff into the river channel this will adversely affect the availability of water resources especially during the dry season which cannot be ignored in the context of rapid socio economic development and increasing water demands in these regions therefore planning for large scale revegetation projects should strongly consider the use of low water consuming vegetation types to reduce the impact on water resources 5 conclusions overall the contribution of increased vegetation to overall sm content changes in this subtropical humid karst region was 38 2 while the contribution of climate change was 61 8 vegetation restoration in the subtropical humid karst region caused only a slight increase in sm content although this change differed from season to season the effect of vegetation restoration on sm changes in summer was not significant in contrast vegetation restoration caused a significant decrease in the variability coefficient of sm indicating that vegetation restoration is beneficial for stabilizing sm in subtropical humid karst areas in addition vegetation restoration effectively moderated the drying tendency of soil caused by climate warming the results of this work provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of vegetation restoration on sm in the karst region of southwest china and offer theoretical guidance for the management of ecological restoration projects in the region uncited chai et al

2856,large scale vegetation restoration projects have been ongoing in the karst region of southwest china for several years however the influence of vegetation restoration alone on soil moisture sm changes in this region remains unclear in this study a random forest model was constructed using meteorological data the era5 land sm dataset and the enhanced vegetation index to analyze sm changes in the karst region of southwest china caused by vegetation restoration alone the results showed that on a monthly scale vegetation restoration introduced an increase in sm that was mainly concentrated in january april and a decrease that was mainly concentrated in june august on a seasonal scale vegetation changes caused an increase in mean sm in spring and winter and a decrease in mean sm in summer and autumn the largest increase in sm owing to vegetation changes was in spring with an average increase of 0 019 m3 m3 and the largest decrease was in summer with an average decrease of 0 010 m3 m3 however the annual average sm increased only slightly on the seasonal and annual scales the coefficient of variation values for changes in sm caused by vegetation restoration alone were dominated by decreases with a large decrease from january to april in addition vegetation restoration effectively moderated the drying tendency of soil caused by climate warming keywords soil moisture

soil moisture sm is an important component of the soil plant atmosphere hydrological continuum that affects the stability of ecosystems via regulating the growth and development of vegetation heathman et al 2003 legates et al 2011 wang et al 2018 yu et al 2018 yu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 climatic factors have a great influence on sm over long periods of time and on a large scale in addition the effect of changes in vegetation on sm cannot be neglected this is especially true for regions in which vegetation has considerably changed in recent years owing to human activity mittelbach and seneviratne 2012 niether et al 2017 therefore exploring the impact of vegetation restoration on sm including its content and stability is an important issue that must be resolved to understand maintenance of ecosystem stability studies that have analyzed the impact of vegetation changes on sm can be categorized as global or regional studies feng and liu 2015 gu et al 2019 the impact of changes in vegetation on sm at the global scale is usually small because large vegetated areas have not considerably varied at the global scale feng 2016 regionally some case studies have been conducted in certain areas with substantial vegetation changes studies in semiarid and subhumid areas have shown that vegetation restoration causes a decrease in sm bellot et al 2004 yang et al 2014 cao et al 2018 liang et al 2018 liu et al 2018 zhang and shangguan 2016 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 however vegetation restoration in humid areas has varying impacts on sm under different environmental conditions adams et al 1991 van hall et al 2017 hiltbrunner et al 2012 the situation in humid regions is complicated because under sufficient precipitation factors such as water depletion by vegetation soil and bedrock water storage capacity affect the relationship between vegetation changes and sm zhang et al 2014 cámara et al 2017 li et al 2017 humid karst areas are humid climate areas with shallow soil layers and bedrock that is highly permeable to water hartmann et al 2014 deng et al 2020 these characteristics are likely to result in a different sm response caused by vegetation restoration compared with other humid areas studies in humid karst areas mainly include case studies conducted on sample sites and regional studies based on remote sensing or reanalysis data in the former few sample plots are usually selected to study the effect of vegetation changes on sm under specific environmental conditions fu et al 2016 zhou et al 2022 however mountainous karst regions have high environmental heterogeneity that a few case studies are not sufficient to illustrate the overall effect in humid karst areas specifically lithology soil thickness topography and vegetation growth conditions can considerably vary in different karst mountain regions and these factors can affect the relationship between vegetation changes and sm yan et al 2021 yan et al 2022 in contrast regional scale studies based on remote sensing or data reanalysis are better able to reflect general patterns in humid karst regions however these previous regional scale studies only analyzed sm trends and did not exclude the influence of climate so as to separately assess the changes in that result from vegetation restoration alone deng et al 2020 therefore changes in sm due to solely vegetation restoration in humid karst areas remains unclear in areas with significant vegetation restoration failing to consider sm changes influenced solely by vegetation restoration may lead to inaccurate understanding of the effects of vegetation restoration on sm if vegetation restoration and climate change lead to sm changes in opposite directions their combined effect will result in smaller sm changes and the effects of climate change and vegetation restoration on sm may be underestimated specifically assessing sm changes influenced by vegetation restoration alone can thus help accurately understand whether vegetation restoration enhances or slows down sm changes caused by climatic factors the relationship between vegetation change and sm change in karst areas in humid regions is complex and vegetation restoration in humid karst areas has been obvious in recent years zhang et al 2019 zhong et al 2022 as mentioned earlier studies conducted in humid karst areas have not excluded the influence of climate change on vegetation restoration in such areas therefore sm changes caused by vegetation restoration alone in humid karst areas as well as whether vegetation restoration mitigates or exacerbates soil moisture changes caused by climatic factors remain unclear given that increased vegetation consumes more water we hypothesized that vegetation restoration alone in the karst region of southwest china would result in obvious changes in sm the aim of this study was to confirm whether and to what extent sm content and its stability have changed in this study the coefficient of variation of sm was used to characterize the stability of sm by constructing a random forest model rfm using sm data from 2001 to 2003 we simulated sm content affected by vegetation restoration alone from 2004 to 2019 to assess changes in soil moisture content and coefficient of variation caused due to vegetation restoration alone the simulated results were compared with sm data collected before vegetation restoration 2001 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study areas in this work were in yunnan province guizhou province and the guangxi autonomous region in southwestern china which accounted for approximately 796 773 km2 fig 1 a the elevation of the area increases from southeast to northwest fig 1b the terrain is dominated by plateaus and mountains the climate is mainly subtropical humid monsoon climate the average annual precipitation is approximately 1021 mm fig 1c and the annual average temperature is approximately 17 6 c fig 1c d the geology of this area is complex with a large area of carbonate rocks mainly consisting of limestone and dolomite fig 1e the soil in the area is mainly haplic alisols common topsoil fractions 40 sand 37 silt and 23 clay chromic luvisols topsoil fractions 27 sand 27 silt and 46 clay rendzic leptosols topsoil fractions 37 sand 44 silt and 19 clay and dystric regosols topsoil fractions 42 sand 37 silt and 21 clay the soil is loose and erodible and forms a thin layer the vegetation types in the area are diverse although areas of carbonate rock area mainly suitable for the growth of shrubs and grasses whereas areas of noncarbonate rock can support arbor forests the unique geological conditions in this area which have led to extensive development of karst landforms is the most typical karst landform in eastern asia the formation of karst landforms has caused severe soil erosion and water shortages which are not conducive to the development of agricultural production transportation and urbanization resulting in limited social and economic development vegetation in this region has been extensively damaged by reclamation of sloping land grazing and firewood cutting before the 1990s since around 2000 various large scale ecological projects were initiated to restore the ecology of the area the main ecological engineering measures taken here are to reduce human interference thereby achieving secondary vegetation succession although additional measures such as afforestation have been implemented in certain places the area covered by these actions is limited 2 2 data source and processing 2 2 1 sm data sm data for the entire study area were obtained in raster format from the global era5 land sm dataset https cds climate copernicus eu compared with the more commonly used types of remote sensing or reanalysis sm data era5 land has a higher spatial resolution and can better detect spatial variations in sm within the highly heterogeneous karst environment although sm products such as those from the soil moisture active and passive satellite have high spatial resolution it only represents sm to a depth of 0 5 cm in the soil layer whereas era5 land detects sm variations in deeper soil levels root zone therefore era5 land data were used in this study the era5 land sm data consists of four vertical layers 0 7 7 28 28 100 and 100 289 cm since the study was conducted in a humid karst area with shallow soil layers only sm data within a 100 cm depth were selected the spatial resolution of the data was 0 1 0 1 the time resolution was daily and the time range was 2000 2019 after preprocessing the sm data to remove erroneous values the average value and coefficient of variation cv of the study area in the spring summer autumn winter active growing season ags and each month were calculated for analysis the field measured sm dataset in this article was obtained from the chinese crop growth and farmland soil moisture dataset compiled by the china national meteorological science data center https data cma cn the sampling depth of the dataset was 0 10 cm the time resolution was 10 days and the time range was 2000 2013 after removing sites lacking data 44 sites in the study area were selected since the measured sm data at the sites were the relative moisture content the relative sm content was multiplied by the field water holding capacity and the soil bulk density to obtain the soil volumetric moisture content owing to the lack of data on field water holding capacity and soil bulk density at each site the values of these two parameters were obtained from studies since the data were measured in farmland it is anthropogenic soil the soil bulk density is 1 37 g cm3 albergel et al 2012 and the field water holding capacity was set at 30 brocca et al 2010 the accuracy of all era5 land sm dataset was verified by converting the relative soil humidity to soil volumetric water content since the available field measured sm data were recorded on a 10 day scale the accuracy of the era5 land sm dataset of the study area could only be verified on a 10 day scale given that the previous sm field observation dataset was limited to surface data a china wide gravimetric based multilayer sm dataset was used for further validation wang and shi 2019 this dataset included month wise data of soil depths of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 40 50 cm 60 70 cm and 90 100 cm from 1992 to 2013 to match the soil layers of the era5 land sm data we used the 0 10 cm and 10 20 cm data from the gravimetric based dataset to match with the 0 7 cm and 7 28 cm sm data from the era5 land dataset we did not validate the 28 100 cm sm data from era5 land due to multiple layers of missing data at 40 100 cm depth in the gravimetric based multilayer sm dataset 2 2 2 enhanced vegetation index and meteorological data the enhanced vegetation index evi data mod13a3 were obtained from the national aeronautics and space administration http reverb echo nasa gov reverb the spatial resolution of the mod13a3 dataset was 1 km the time resolution was monthly and the time range was 2000 2019 after preprocessing the data such as removal of spatial mosaics and erroneous values linear interpolation was performed pixel by pixel in time the higher temporal resolution of evi means that it is more likely to be affected by cloud cover occlusion anomalies and other factors thereby leading to larger errors therefore this paper uses the maximum synthetic monthly scale data so that the evi more truly reflects the vegetation conditions in the study area after linear interpolation the data time resolution was daily after spatial resampling of the data the spatial resolution was 0 1 0 1 the temperature and precipitation data china surface meteorological daily value dataset v3 0 were obtained from the china national meteorological science data center http data cma cn the time resolution of the dataset was daily and the time range was 2000 2019 after preprocessing the original data anusplin software https fennerschool anu edu au research products anusplin was used to perform day to day spatial interpolation the spatial resolution of the data after interpolation was 0 1 0 1 2 3 methods 2 3 1 rfm a rfm was used to analyze the impact of vegetation on sm the rfm was an ensemble learning algorithm based on a decision tree the algorithm can be roughly divided into a classification algorithm and a regression algorithm in this study the regression algorithm was used the regression algorithm is based on a combined model composed of a set of regression decision subtrees h x θt t 1 2 t where θt is a random variable subject to independent and identical distribution x is the independent variable and t is the number of decision trees ensemble learning uses the value of each decision tree h x θt as the regression prediction result as described in eq 1 1 h x 1 t t 1 t h x θ t where h x θt is the output based on and θ the rfm generates different decision trees from different subsets of training data through the bagging process thereby avoiding the effects of multicollinearity between independent variables breiman 2001 segal and xiao 2011 to date rfms have been applied in many ecohydrological studies and their reliability in ecohydrology has been verified by multiple groups carranza et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 because the onset of large scale vegetation restoration in the karst region of southwest china was around 2000 and no clear effects were observed during the initial years the data from 2000 to 2003 were used to establish the rfm and data from 2004 were used for verification the regression algorithm is summarized as the formula in eq 2 2 sm a p b t c e v i d p p e t p f where a to e are regression parameters f is a constant and the independent variables p t evi tp and pp are the daily precipitation temperature evi previous temperature and previous precipitation from 2000 to 2003 respectively and the dependent variable sm is the daily sm from 2000 to 2003 as the hydrological process in the karst area is relatively rapid fu et al 2015 huang et al 2009 the temperature and precipitation data over the preceding three days were used as the previous meteorological elements after constructing the model we substituted the independent variable from 2004 into the model and compared the simulated sm values with those from era5 land to verify the reliability of the model 2001 was chosen as the base period because a large scale vegetation restoration project was implemented around 2000 and evi data for a whole year are available for 2001 which represents the period before vegetation changes we chose 2019 as the period of change which represents the time after vegetation restoration although vegetation changes did occur to a small degree in the first few years after the vegetation restoration was implemented we used only data from 2001 rather than the average from 2001 to 2003 to optimally represent conditions before vegetation restoration we substituted the daily precipitation daily temperature previous precipitation and previous temperature from 2001 along with the evi for 2019 into the model thus simulating the effect sm from vegetation change alone 2 3 2 methods for determining sm under different influencing factors after obtaining the daily sm data under the condition that the vegetation did not change in 2019 through the rfm the change in the mean value and cv of sm caused by the vegetation change alone were calculated according to eq 3 and 4 3 s m v m e a n s m 2019 m e a n s m p m e a n 4 s m v c v s m 2019 c v s m p c v where sm2019 mean and sm2019 cv are the mean value and cv of the sm after vegetation change respectively which was obtained via substituting the daily precipitation daily temperature previous precipitation and previous temperature from 2001 as well as the evi for 2019 into the rfm model smp mean and smp cv are the mean value and cv of the sm before vegetation change and here we used the era5 land data from 2001 base period to represent sm before vegetation changes smv mean and smv cv are the changes in the mean value and cv of sm before and after vegetation restoration caused only by vegetation restoration a positive value for smv mean indicates that vegetation restoration increased the mean value of sm content while a negative value indicates that vegetation restoration decreased the mean value of sm content the smv cv value was calculated similarly the difference between the changes in sm caused by vegetation alone and those caused by comprehensive factors including climate vegetation restoration and other unspecified factors were calculated using eq 5 and eq 6 5 c mean s m y m e a n s m c m e a n 6 c cv s m v c v s m c c v where cmean is the difference between sm changes caused by vegetation restoration alone and those caused by comprehensive factors accordingly ccv is the difference between the cv of sm changes caused by vegetation restoration alone and those caused by comprehensive factors a positive value of cmean indicates that the change to the average sm content caused by vegetation restoration alone is higher than that caused by comprehensive factors whereas a negative value of cmean indicates the opposite and ccv is similar smc mean and smc cv are the mean value and cv of the sm change before and after vegetation restoration under the influence of comprehensive factors smc mean was obtained by subtracting the actual sm value for 2001 from the actual sm for 2019 from the era5 land data smc cv was obtained in a similar way the above calculations were performed on three different time scales monthly seasonally and yearly moreover the significance of all comparisons was tested since the data were not normally distributed the kruskal wallis test was used for analysis 3 results 3 1 accuracy validation and model parameter determination field measured sm data from 2000 to 2013 were used to verify the era5 land sm dataset on a 10 day scale the era5 land sm dataset overestimated the actual sm values the correlation coefficient between the era5 land sm dataset and field measured sm data was 0 3 for 82 61 of the sites and 0 5 for 50 of the sites fig 2 a whereas the root mean square error rmse was 0 1 for 45 45 of the sites fig 2b the bias between value was 0 1 for 77 27 of the sites fig 2c and the abvr was 0 12 for 43 48 of the sites fig 2d the sites were evenly distributed in space indicating that era5 land sm data of the karst region in southwest china were highly accurate and sufficient for this study the gravimetric based sm dataset also showed that era5 land slightly overestimates actual sm the average correlation coefficient between era5 land and the measured sm in the first layer was 0 55 and 44 of the sites had a correlation coefficient greater than 0 6 while the second layer had an average correlation coefficient of 0 48 and 28 of the sites had a correlation coefficient greater than 0 6 fig 3 a e the average rmse of era5 land and the measured sm in the first layer was 0 10 and 52 of the sites had an rmse less than 0 1 while the second layer had an average rmse of 0 09 and 68 of the sites had an rmse less than 0 1 fig 3b f the average bias of era5 land and the measured sm in the first layer was 0 07 and 56 of the sites had a bias between 0 1 while the second layer had an average bias of 0 05 and 76 of the sites had a bias between 0 1 fig 3c g the average avbr of ra5 land and the measured sm in the first layer was 0 09 and 52 of the sites had an avbr less than 0 08 while the second layer had an average avbr of 0 08 and 60 of the sites had an avbr less than 0 08 fig 3d h for 2000 2003 and 2019 when the number of trees in the rfm was 50 100 the ooberror of all soil layers tended to be stable and the rmse of all soil layers reached a minimum when the number of leaf nodes was five figs 4 and 5 considering the high heterogeneity of the karst mountain environment more trees may need to be built in the local area to stabilize the ooberror of the model thus we herein used 100 trees for pixel by pixel modeling the 2004 dataset was used to verify the prediction results of the rfm model overall the rfm model has high prediction accuracy with an average r2 of approximately 0 8 an average rmse of 0 02 and an average pbias of 2 0 fig 6 from the perspective of different seasons the data predicted using the rfm model demonstrated high accuracy during the growing season however there was some difference between the predicted value and the era5 land sm data during the nongrowing season 3 2 temporal and spatial changes in vegetation and sm content the vegetation change from 2000 to 2019 was dominated by a substantial upward trend accounting for approximately 86 99 of the study area fig 7 a b c i only a few areas showed a decreasing trend in evi which were mainly distributed in the western part of the study area fig 7l however sm content remained generally stable with only a slight increase in sm content in the lower layers fig 7a b c the pixel by pixel correlation analysis showed that despite the weak overall correlation between evi and sm content some local areas with high correlation were still identified fig 7d in addition the areas with low sm and evi were mainly distributed in the northwest part of the study area while areas with high sm and evi are mainly found in the northeast part of the study area fig 7e f g h the rates at which vegetation and climate contribute to sm content changes from 2000 to 2019 are shown in fig 8 the contribution of climatic factors to sm variation was 61 8 whereas the contribution of vegetation factors was 38 2 however this feature varies from month to month the contribution rate of climatic factors to sm content changes in autumn and winter was considerably higher than that of vegetation restoration whereas the opposite was true in summer among the summer months the contribution of climatic factors at depths of 0 7 and 7 28 cm in september exceeded 95 there were also differences in the contribution rates of climate and vegetation change factors at different soil layer depths in spring the climate and human activity factors contributed to sm content changes at similar rates in the 0 7 cm soil layer as well as in the deeper soil layers however vegetation restoration contributed more 3 3 response of the average sm to vegetation changes alone on a monthly scale vegetation changes alone lead to an increase in mean sm in the first half of the year and a decrease in mean sm in the second half of the year this increase in sm was mainly concentrated in january april while the decrease was mainly concentrated in june august the average sm decreased with increasing soil depth owing to vegetation change fig 9 the sm content in the 0 7 cm soil layer increased the most from january to april with an average increase of 0 031 m3 m3 whereas the sm content decreased the least from june to august with an average decrease of 0 008 m3 m3 in the 28 100 cm soil layer the increase in sm content was the smallest from january to april with an average increase of 0 018 m3 m3 whereas the decrease in sm content was the largest from june to august with an average decrease of 0 013 m3 m3 fig 9 on a seasonal scale vegetation changes led to an increase in mean sm in spring and winter a decrease in mean sm in summer and autumn and a minor change in mean sm in ags the largest increase in sm content owing to vegetation change occurred in spring with an average increase of 0 019 m3 m3 and the largest decrease occurred in summer with an average decrease of 0 010 m3 m3 with greater soil depth the rise in sm rise gradually decreased during the spring and the decline in sm gradually increased during the summer fig 10 the increase in sm in spring decreased from 0 022 m3 m3 to 0 017 m3 m3 whereas the decrease in sm in summer increased from 0 008 m3 m3 to 0 0013 m3 m3 fig 10 overall vegetation restoration induced a slight increase in the annual average sm whereas the sm content in summer remained stable fig 11 a since 2004 the average annual sm caused by vegetation restoration has increased from 0 0007 m3 m3 to 0 0060 m3 m3 with an average annual increase of 0 0004 m3 m3 the overall sm in summer has shown a slight downward trend with an average annual rate of 0 0001 m3 m3 this feature also displayed evident differences among different regions fig 11b c d areas that experienced an increase in annual average sm accounted for 54 85 of the total study area and were mainly located in the western part of the study area whereas areas that underwent a decrease in annual average sm were mainly in the eastern part of the study area at greater soil depths there are larger areas of increased annual average sm in the 28 100 cm soil layer the area with increased sm due to vegetation changes increased to 55 13 of the total area fig 11d from a comparison of average sm changes caused by vegetation restoration alone and those owing to comprehensive factors including climate vegetation restoration and other unspecified factors the former was greater than the latter in most months and only in january and july was the former smaller than the latter on the seasonal scale all seasons displayed greater changes in average sm owing to vegetation restoration alone than those owing to the comprehensive factors fig 12 3 4 response of sm cv to vegetation change alone at the monthly scale vegetation restoration alone mainly led to a decrease in the cv of sm with a generally larger decrease from january to april resulting in an average decrease in sm cv of 0 077 vegetation restoration led to an increase in the cv of sm for june july resulting in an average increase in sm cv of 0 011 the decrease in cv of sm decreased gradually with increasing soil depth in most months and the decrease in cv of sm gradually increased in may only its decrease increased from 0 027 to 0 043 fig 13 on the seasonal scale the changes in cv of sm caused by vegetation restoration alone were dominated by decreases with the largest decrease in spring resulting in an average decrease in soil moisture cv of 0 080 only summer experienced a slight increase in the cv of sm on average the decrease in cv of sm caused by vegetation restoration alone gradually decreased with increasing soil depth in spring winter and ags 0 021 and 0 018 fig 14 at the annual scale vegetation restoration alone reduced the cv of sm across most of the study area the area with reduced cv accounted for 98 27 of the total study area on average with the main source of the reduction occurring in the northwestern part of the study area the reduction in cv of sm owing to vegetation restoration alone decreased with increasing soil depth fig 15 a comparison of the variation in cv of sm caused by vegetation restoration alone and that caused by comprehensive factors climate vegetation restoration and other unspecified factors reveals that the former was lower than the latter in most months and was higher than the latter only in july on the seasonal scale the variation in cv of sm due to vegetation restoration alone was lower than that due to the comprehensive factors in all seasons fig 16 4 discussion 4 1 time variations in sm changes due to vegetation restoration alone the results of this study demonstrate that vegetation restoration in a subtropical humid karst area resulted in a slight increase in annual average sm content fig 11 however existing plot scale case studies in humid karst areas have previously found that vegetation restoration resulted in a slight decrease in sm content zhou et al 2022 these results collectively indicate that vegetation restoration in subtropical humid karst regions has little effect on overall sm content on the one hand vegetation restoration causes an increase in vegetation cover which leads to lower soil evaporation li et al 2019 additionally vegetation restoration leads to the formation of a thicker litter layer and the more extensive root system and greater organic matter help form a good aggregate structure in the soil which will increase the water holding capacity of the soil yang et al 2016 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 the above changes are beneficial for increasing sm content in karst areas which are typically characterized by massive water seepage however the increase in transpiration brought about by vegetation restoration cannot be ignored ning et al 2020 wang et al 2022 especially in subtropical regions vegetation restoration in subtropical humid karst areas reduced soil water infiltration and evaporation but increased transpiration the offsetting results of these two processes may be the reason that the changes in sm content caused by vegetation restoration are so minor in contrast low transpiration rates in mildly humid regions owing to increased surface cover after vegetation restoration will lead to a decrease in soil evaporation and ultimately an increase in sm content adams et al 1991 our results also demonstrated that the effects of vegetation restoration on sm content in subtropical humid karst regions exhibited seasonal differences fig 10 the data indicate that the trade off relationship between soil water infiltration and reduced evaporation and the increased transpiration caused by vegetation restoration is not uniform across seasons or different time scales as mentioned above the various processes appear to cancel one another out on an annual scale however owing to the high summer temperatures in subtropical regions vegetation restoration increases transpiration whereas the reductions in soil water infiltration and evaporation that result from vegetation restoration are small this relationship also further proves that for karst areas with surface water shortages although vegetation restoration can improve overall soil water infiltration the degree of improvement may be small and rates are slow 4 2 vegetation restoration in subtropical humid karst regions stabilizes sm our results show that although vegetation restoration in subtropical humid karst regions has little effect on the annual average sm content it is beneficial for stabilizing sm figs 13 15 prior to vegetation changes the condition of vegetation in the karst area of southwest china was poor chi et al 2018 and desertification occurred over a large rocky area fig 17 a coupled with the thin soil cover and high bedrock permeability in this area dong et al 2019 precipitation tends to quickly either evaporate or infiltrate making soil water storage difficult liu et al 2018 this resulted in a large cv for sm prior to vegetation restoration in this area as mentioned earlier vegetation restoration shields the soil from the sun which reduces evaporation it also increases the thickness of the litter layer and changes the hydraulic properties of the soil layer thereby increasing the water storage capacity of the litter layer and the soil layer and reducing water seepage yi et al 2021 zhong et al 2022 fig 17b moreover the greater vegetation cover can cause precipitation to be intercepted by the canopy and litter thereby enabling longer term replenishment of sm sun et al 2022 the combined action of the above factors resulted from the restoration of vegetation in the subtropical humid karst area resulting in greater sm stability our results show that the extent of changes in sm content caused by vegetation restoration exceeds that caused by a combination of factors including climate vegetation restoration and other unspecified factors fig 12 this study also shows that vegetation restoration alleviated the soil drying caused by climate warming to a certain extent from a large scale and long term perspective among the comprehensive factors that result in changes to hydrological processes climate and vegetation restoration are the two most important soonthornrangsan and lowry 2021 yang et al 2022 however precipitation in the karst areas of southwest china has essentially remained stable for the past 20 years whereas temperature has shown a clear upward trend huang et al 2021 yang et al 2022 these climatic changes should theoretically result in a substantial reduction in sm content our results show that no significant change in sm has occurred on an annual scale this indicates that the decrease in sm content caused by rising temperatures is offset by the increase in sm content caused by vegetation restoration 4 3 the uniqueness of the effect of vegetation change on sm in the karst region of southwest china owing to the unique karst environment the results of this study are considerably different from those in other nonkarst vegetation restoration areas for example a study conducted by qiu et al 2021 in the loess plateau in north central china showed that vegetation restoration led to a considerable reduction in sm content which cannot be easily replenished by precipitation however the results of this study suggest that vegetation restoration in the karst region of southwest china mainly led to an increase in mean sm content this difference can be attributed to the fact that the loess plateau is located in an arid and semiarid area with less precipitation therefore after a large scale vegetation restoration project was conducted in this area the sm was largely consumed by the vegetation which greatly reduced the sm however the karst area of southwest china is rich in precipitation and after vegetation restoration the greater canopy and litter cover is able to intercept a large amount of precipitation so that precipitation can supplement sm slowly and continuously therefore vegetation restoration will not considerably reduce the mean value of sm in karst soils in southwest china on a long term scale not only vegetation will change but climate factors such as rainfall and temperature will also change therefore eliminating the impact of climate change is an important prerequisite for a clear understanding of the impact of vegetation restoration on sm in the karst region of southwest china deng et al 2020 used sm data from 1982 to 2015 to analyze changes to sm content in karst areas however long term analysis of changes to sm content could not explain the changes in sm content caused by vegetation restoration alone wei et al 2021 referenced similar precipitation years to analyze changes in sm caused by vegetation restoration in the karst region of southwest china but this study only controlled for precipitation factors and did not consider monthly and seasonal change temperature influences the amount of sm wang et al 2018 tang et al 2019 but is insufficient to solely account for changes in sm caused by vegetation restoration to address this issue the model used in this study controlled for most environmental factors but not vegetation hence the results more accurately reflect the impact of vegetation restoration on sm in the karst region of southwest china 4 4 intra annual prediction uncertainty as can be seen from fig 6 the model in this study had a low prediction accuracy for the nongrowing season this is mainly because only climatic and vegetation factors were considered in the rfm model in this study this simplification achieves good prediction results in the growing season but the relatively weaker influence of evi during the nongrowing season means that other influencing factors on sm become more complicated especially in the complex environmental conditions of the karst mountains xu et al 2017 gong et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 yan et al 2022 specifically the ability of factors other than evi to influence sm is relatively enhanced during the nongrowing season these factors include temporal distribution and variability in solar radiation wind precipitation air temperature vegetation type tree or shrub coniferous or broad leaved deciduous or not water retention of soil and litter layers in different moisture states hydraulic conductivity of rocks etc zhao et al 2018 chai et al 2021 lee and kim 2022 wei et al 2022 however accurate data on these factors are difficult to obtain and there is great spatial variability in karstic mountain environments thus it is difficult to fully consider all the influencing factors in the modeling stage which is likely a common difficulty faced by most empirical models if certain physical process models are used the prediction can usually be improved by parameter calibration baudena et al 2008 abdelhamed et al 2022 however due to the unique surface subsurface binary nature of the hydrological system in karst environments liang and yang 1995 a large amount of surface and soil water seeps into the subsurface through dissolution fissures and the subsurface hydrological conditions are particularly complex so that simulating karst hydrology based on physical process models is still a major challenge sarrazin et al 2018 jeannin et al 2021 as mentioned earlier there are challenges in predicting sm during nongrowing seasons in karst areas however if we only analyze data from growing seasons it will not fully illustrate the overall effect of vegetation restoration on sm and its seasonal variation moreover in humid subtropical monsoon regions like the karst region of southwest china vegetation is not completely dormant from october to march and may still influence sm changes dong et al 2022 zhao et al 2015 therefore for completeness data from the nongrowing season were still included in the analysis however we recognize there is some uncertainty in the results of the nongrowing season therefore we performed month by month quarter by quarter and growing season analyses which not only helped show the overall results but also allowed to focus specifically on more reliable results growing season summer when needed 4 5 limitations the karst region of southwest china is dominated by mountains with large terrain undulations but because of the extensive karst formations the strong karstification complicates the environment in this area wei et al 2021 the complex topography and geomorphology leads to microclimates in local areas which strengthens spatial heterogeneity of sm the spatial scale of all data selected in this study was 0 1 0 1 due to the large pixel range the small spatial range cannot reflect changes to sm nonetheless the sm data with this spatial resolution is presently the most reliable to date by macro scale analysis such large scale data are more conducive to reflect the overall status of sm therefore although spatial resolution of the sm data is lacking the results of this study still explain the overall spatial pattern of sm changes caused by vegetation restoration in the karst region of southwest china 4 6 applications studies have only focused on semiarid and semi humid areas or on humid non karst areas our study based in a humid karst region provides new information for research on sm effects resulting from vegetation change although our results show that vegetation restoration in the karst region of southwest china has no significant effect on sm on an annual scale the water consumption caused by vegetation restoration cannot be ignored our study also shows that vegetation restoration leads to a decrease in summer sm excessive water depletion by vegetation leads directly to reduced runoff into the river channel this will adversely affect the availability of water resources especially during the dry season which cannot be ignored in the context of rapid socio economic development and increasing water demands in these regions therefore planning for large scale revegetation projects should strongly consider the use of low water consuming vegetation types to reduce the impact on water resources 5 conclusions overall the contribution of increased vegetation to overall sm content changes in this subtropical humid karst region was 38 2 while the contribution of climate change was 61 8 vegetation restoration in the subtropical humid karst region caused only a slight increase in sm content although this change differed from season to season the effect of vegetation restoration on sm changes in summer was not significant in contrast vegetation restoration caused a significant decrease in the variability coefficient of sm indicating that vegetation restoration is beneficial for stabilizing sm in subtropical humid karst areas in addition vegetation restoration effectively moderated the drying tendency of soil caused by climate warming the results of this work provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of vegetation restoration on sm in the karst region of southwest china and offer theoretical guidance for the management of ecological restoration projects in the region uncited chai et al

2857,persistent eutrophication frequently causes toxic algal blooms which is a serious threat to drinking water safety food security and public health nutrient thresholds the maximum nutrient load that an aquatic ecosystem can absorb while meeting management objective are key to avoiding and reducing blooms the determination of thresholds relies on nutrient load response curves the spatial heterogeneity of large shallow lakes in terms of lake characteristics results in different curves shape among areas of the lake which leads to spatial differences in thresholds however the spatial heterogeneity of thresholds is typically neglected there are few methods to analyse the relationship between river loads and lake specific area thresholds here we proposed the area threshold analysis framework to analyse the spatial patterns of nutrient loads and thresholds in lakes we first quantified the flow and load of the rivers entering the lake the lake was then zoned and modelled to analyse area thresholds finally an intuitive link between the nutrient loads of specific rivers and the thresholds of specific areas of the lake was established the results showed a nonlinear without hysteresis response in all areas of chaohu lake the nutrient loads and thresholds were highly variable in space showing a trend of increasing and then decreasing from west to east flow density and wind might be important in influencing the spatial distribution of thresholds the different effects of the wind and flow density on total phosphorus tp and chlorophyll a chl a lead to large differences in the thresholds with tp and chl a as management objectives respectively the large gap between nutrient loads and thresholds made it important for management to consider appropriate management goals to deal with unrealistic nutrient reductions achieving year round chl a 30 µg l in chaohu lake was easier than tp 0 05 mg l since for the latter the shiwuli paihe and nanfei river loads needed reductions of 80 in addition for area 1 and 2 it was more practical to first start meeting tp 0 05 mg l for 2 or 3 seasons of the year than for 4 seasons overall we developed a new framework for spatial threshold analysis and established an intuitive link between nutrient loads and thresholds in large shallow lakes these results are valuable for understanding the threshold properties of spatially heterogeneous ecosystems in general and provide a reference for watershed nutrient management and ecological restoration of lakes keywords eutrophication spatial heterogeneity pclake threshold value algal blooms data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lakes worldwide are threatened by eutrophication which threatens the drinking water supply food security and public health wang et al 2018 brooks et al 2016 population growth and increased industrial activity are important causes of lake eutrophication conley et al 2009 the continuation of industrial activities during lake health restoration is a key issue for management a common threshold in limnology is the maximum nutrient load that a lake can accept janssen et al 2017 which provide a reference for lake nutrient management we define the threshold as the maximum nutrient load allowed to the lake when management objectives are achieved the management objective can be to achieve a certain lake water quality target or to maintain a certain stable state algae dominated or submerged vegetation dominated scheffer et al 2001 the determination of threshold determines the success or failure of management kelly et al 2015 load response curves are used to determine nutrient thresholds lakes can have three types of curves linear nonlinear without hysteresis and nonlinear with hysteresis scheffer et al 2001 the type of response curve is related to the strength of positive feedback between phytoplankton and submerged plants janssen et al 2014 lake distribution characteristics e g depth fetch flow velocity and sediment and input characteristics e g hydrology and nutrients can influence the response processes of shallow lakes janse et al 2010 janse et al 2008 janssen et al 2021a janssen et al 2014 janssen et al 2019 in some shallow lakes aquatic vegetation has a substantial influence on lake water quality because it occupies a critical interface in the lake ecosystem hu et al 2021 macrophyte degradation enhances the effects of wind there can be a sudden change from a macrophyte dominant state to an alternative phytoplankton state scheffer et al 1993 lake hydrodynamic conditions can affect local nutrient and algal concentrations through transport and hydraulic residence time is considered to be one of the reasons for alternative stability hilt et al 2011 different hydrological and nutrient input patterns can also influence the response pattern of the lake janssen et al 2019 due to geographical differences the distribution characteristics of large shallow lakes are typically spatially variable which results in different water quality responses to nutrients in different areas of the lake the load response curves of large shallow lake exhibit spatial heterogeneity janssen et al 2017 which is often ignored janssen et al 2014 although studies of spatial thresholds have considered the distribution of lake characteristics janssen et al 2017 no study has integrated the distribution of lake characteristics with input characteristics there are several methods for assessing response curves historical data hindcasting capon et al 2015 space for stress substitution schallenberg et al 2017 cross site comparison schallenberg 2021 laboratory or field experiments barker et al 2008 and deterministic modelling janse et al 2008 the historical data approach relies on long term observations of the lake which must cover all stages of oligotrophication and eutrophication capon et al 2015 many lakes do not have such a dataset the space for stress substitution and cross site comparison approaches rely on studies of other similar lakes they indirectly determine response curves without the use of long term observations laboratory simulation allows reconstruction of lake oligotrophication and eutrophication but the results are not representative of field conditions stewart et al 2013 for example the effects of wind are easily ignored janssen et al 2017 modelling can simulate the response process under multiple stresses in lakes by building a model with reliable predictive ability janse et al 2008 kong et al 2017 the flexibility and efficiency of the modelling approach enable spatial threshold analysis janse et al developed the pclake model comprising a fully mixed water column and a subsurface sediment layer this model operates a closed nutrient cycle in the lake system janse 2005 the model was designed for pollutant control in shallow lakes and the prediction of load response curves it is more professional than other models hu et al 2021 janssen et al 2014 pclake is widely used to model thresholds in bifurcation analyses of ecosystems janssen et al 2017 kong et al 2017 because pclake is a zero dimensional model its generalisation of lake characteristics limits applications in large lakes with high spatial heterogeneity to address this attempts have been made to dimensionalise the pclake model andersen et al 2020 janssen et al 2017 janssen et al 2019 based on the datm framework janssen et al coupled pclake with the 3d hydrodynamic mode delft3d and analysed the spatial threshold distribution of taihu lake janssen et al 2017 however because complex hydrodynamic processes hamper the quantification of local nutrient loads burger et al 2008 spatial analyses cannot evaluate the relationships of riverine nutrient inputs with spatial thresholds in lakes china is the world s largest developing country it began to accumulate lake water quality data after the occurrence of widespread eutrophication in the 1980s huang et al 2021a because of insufficient data and the urgent need for management china adopted european and american environmental standards for water quality assessment the standards classify surface water quality by specifying uniform physical chemical and biological index limits this approach provides a basis for the protection and management of water environments in china however there are few biological indicators related to algae and eutrophication is restrained only by nitrogen and phosphorus yang et al 2022 the spatial heterogeneity of water bodies is ignored china spans six temperature zones from north to south and the mean elevation difference between east and west is 4000 m such differences in geography and climate result in regional differences in response curves janssen et al 2021a leading to overly strict or lenient management it is thus necessary to analyse the deviations between thresholds under current management standards and ecological thresholds chaohu lake located in south eastern china has an area of 780 km2 it is one of several large shallow lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river fig 1 the watershed is densely populated and strongly influenced by human activities it has experienced extensive eutrophication the watershed has seven major inlet rivers the nanfei hangbu shiwuli baishitian zhaohe and zhegao rivers that account for 90 of the total inflow zhang et al 2021 the main water volume and nutrient load enters the lake from the west and the lake flows from west to east finally flowing into the yangtze river via the yuxi river in the southeast the elongated morphology and input pattern give chaohu lake an upstream and downstream transport characteristic similar to river transport which is beneficial for quantifying the transport of material between the lake areas lake water quality shows significant spatial heterogeneity usually involving high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in the west lake which lead to algal blooms good water quality is present in the east lake xi et al 2015 the distribution of lake flow field depth and sediment have similar spatial patterns wang et al 2021b chen and liu 2015 facilitating the analysis of spatial heterogeneity among thresholds in this study we aimed to determine the spatial patterns of nutrient loads and thresholds in chaohu lake we proposed the area threshold analysis framework for the analysis of spatial nutrient loads and thresholds we first reconstruct the runoff process of chaohu lake to provide the necessary boundary for lake modelling the lake area was zoned according to the characteristics of each area based on the concept of a complete mixing reactor the regions were uniformly modelled using the pclake model finally bifurcation analysis of the areas was used to calculate the thresholds under management objectives the spatial response mechanism of the thresholds was analysed our findings will facilitate restoration management of poorly mixed and spatially heterogeneous lakes such as chaohu lake 2 methods 2 1 analysis framework the analysis framework is shown in fig 2 the framework implements spatial loading and threshold analysis in 3 steps preparation of basic data model configuration modelling and analysis the first important step is to understand the distribution characteristics and input characteristics of the lake the lake distribution characteristics depth sediment hydrodynamics water quality etc and input characteristics flow load can be captured through literature research and model simulations the abundance of information in the study area is the main limitation for the implementation of the framework for chaohu lake studies on lake distribution characteristics are abundant while information on input characteristics is lacking in this study the swat model was chosen to reconstruct the runoff process of chaohu lake the second step is to zone the lake and configure the model according to its characteristics large shallow lakes often exhibit strong spatial heterogeneity in terms of flow field and pollution distribution the chaohu lake distributions of sediment wang et al 2021b water quality xi et al 2015 huang et al 2021b flow field chen and liu 2015 and water depth had similar spatial patterns sediment flow velocity water quality and water depth were selected as lake parameters a clustering analysis was performed for 19 stations in chaohu lake based on the results chaohu lake was zoned according to the locations of river estuaries and the existing zoning method wang et al 2021b the purpose of lake partitioning was to accommodate the homogenisation of the 0 dimensional model pclake and to facilitate the apportionment of nutrient sources the configuration of the model was selected after zoning chaohu lake is elongated its water flows from west to east year round similar to the upstream and downstream of a river the correlations of tn tp and chlorophyll a chl a concentrations with the distance of the lake from ty to chcc red arrow in fig 3 exceeded 0 85 p 0 01 in this study we used a tandem configuration model which is reportedly feasible for lake threshold analysis janssen et al 2019 the transport variables between adjacent areas were calculated based on the principle of a complete mixing reactor finally the model code is compiled and bifurcation analysis is performed based on the model configuration scheme based on the datm framework mooij et al 2014 the tandem model was implemented using matlab and a spatial threshold analysis was performed using the tandem model details about the method were given below 2 2 soil and water assessment tool swat model runoff can be calculated by empirical methods including inferred methods and unit hydrological line methods de lavenne et al 2015 conceptual models including hbv models lupakov et al 2021 and xinanjiang models wang et al 2021a and mechanistic models including vic models nijssen et al 2001 the swat model chen et al 2018 and the rs dtvgm model lou et al 2019 empirical methods are typically used because of their simplicity and practicality but the highly generalised coefficients increase the uncertainty of the results conceptual models overcome the limitation of the selection of empirical coefficients they improve the calculation accuracy by considering different hydrological processes mechanistic models benefit from their rich description of hydrological processes and can analyse runoff processes using fine time scales panagopoulos et al 2011 because the process based water quality model used in this study depends on fine time scale date we used the swat mechanistic model for watershed runoff calculations the swat model is a gis based distributed watershed hydrologic model developed by the agricultural research service of the u s department of agriculture and texas a m agrilife research kast et al 2021 the model is based on water balance equations including surface runoff precipitation rain or snow evapotranspiration infiltration and subsurface flow nutrient balance equations are also based on factors such as external loading transportation of nutrients with runoff fertilisers plant nutrient uptake and soil characteristics swat models can simulate many hydrological and physicochemical processes e g runoff sediment water quality and pesticide they have been used in many watersheds worldwide bauwe et al 2019 tan et al 2019a cibin et al 2016 the swat model was used to simulate the quantity of watershed flow amounts using a monthly time step and sub watershed spatial units the model data sources are shown in table s1 specifically the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient and the coefficient of determination r2 were used to evaluate model performance monthly monitoring data from 2016 to 2019 at the taoxi hydrological monitoring station were collected and compared with the simulation results the model was simulated for 2013 to 2019 with 2013 to 2015 as the warm up period the calibration period was 2016 to 2018 the validation period was 2019 calibration was performed using swat cup with the sequential uncertainty fitting version sufi 2 method the r2 values for the calibration and validation periods were 0 88 and 0 64 respectively the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient values were 0 5 fig 4 the performance of the model met the requirements for use lin et al 2021 1 r 2 d d m m 2 d d 2 m m 2 2 nse 1 d m 2 d d 2 r2 the coefficient of determination d the observed data and m the model output high r2 scores indicates good resemblance of the seasonal pattern in the data by the model nse is the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse is close to 1 which means the model is of good quality and the model is credible nse is close to 0 which means the simulation results are close to the mean level of the observed values i e the overall results are credible but the process simulation error is large nse is much 0 and the model is not credible 2 3 cluster analysis statistical analysis e g cluster redundancy and principal component analysis of biological physical and chemical indicators of water allows the investigation of both spatial and temporal patterns in water ecosystems chu et al 2021 ma et al 2020 liu and yang 2021 newton et al 2011 yu et al 2011 cluster analysis can detect regional differences in lake water quality beveridge et al 2012 momen et al 1996 zhang et al 2021 the two step clustering method can address continuous variables automatically determine the optimal number of clusters and quantitatively describe the importance of variables in each category lake water quality data were provided by the chaohu lake management agency water samples were collected and treated in accordance with the environmental protection industry standards of the people s republic of china chinese standard hj t 91 2002 the lake parameters of 19 sites in the lake were clustered fig 3 there was substantial interannual and inter month variability in the water quality of chaohu lake lin et al 2021 first the lake sites were classified using a two step clustering method to analyse time series lake water quality data 2014 to 2017 do nh4 n tn tp chl a and bod next the site samples were classified according to analysing total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the sediment surface layer wang et al 2021b sediment thickness water depth flow rate chen and liu 2015 as well as total nitrogen and total phosphorus in water using the systematic clustering method in spss software table s2 based on the classification results the lake area was partitioned by integrating the above mentioned lake characteristics and estuarine location fig 3 the accuracy of the classification results was tested by discriminant analysis da da is a multivariate analysis method that discriminates the accuracy of classification results via creation of a discriminant function based on interclass differences for samples of known classes smeti and golfinopoulos 2016 the correctness of the partitioning results was 55 for continuous variables of water quality and 90 for station samples these findings indicate that the partitioning results are statistically significant and acceptable 2 4 model building how to model the pclake model in the whole lake and achieve simultaneous analysis of different areas is an important topic the first issue of modeling is the programming language a lack of familiarity with programming languages hampers model development janssen et al 2015 a unified programming framework solves this problem by enabling the implementation of multiple models in one language examples include the database approach to modelling van gerven et al 2015 the framework for aquatic biogeochemical models bruggeman and bolding 2014 and delft3d waq deltares 2014 in this study the areas of chaohu lake were uniformly modelled using the pclake model with the datm modelling was implemented in matlab the modelling principle is shown in fig 5 the uniform model considered the size effect depth cdepthw fetch cfetch sediment thickness cdepths and sediment pore water phosphorus content copo4max were the area parameters uniform parameters were used for other variables table s3 the mpload and mnload in the forcing function were calculated as the product of flow and river concentration thus preventing swat model parameter regionalisation that could influence the load and reduce the uncertainty flow nitrogen and phosphorus loads were treated as transport variables between areas the flow input mqin consisted of riverine input with upstream transport fig 5 the flow output mqout was calculated using the water balance equation eq 3 the amount of phosphorus transported downstream was equal to the product of the area concentration and the output flow mqout eq 4 in the model calibration one area was calibrated individually and subsequently validated in the whole lake because area 4 was in the middle of the lake and had more representative parameters it was used for calibration the model was run for 23 years the first 20 years were run with the 2016 forcing function to bring the model to equilibrium while years 21 to 23 were run using the 2017 to 2019 forcing function the results of years 20 to 23 of the model were used as the output for 2016 to 2019 the month by month water quality data from 2016 to 2018 were selected for manual calibration of area 4 the data from 2019 were used to validate area 4 the data from 2016 to 2019 were used to validate other areas fig 6 the r2 values for tn and tp in all areas of the lake were 0 26 0 61 with a mean of 0 43 the r2 value for chl a was 0 03 0 44 with a mean of 0 16 table s4 the model typically did not yield better results for chemical biological variables soares and calijuri 2021 compared to model studies in other large lakes kong et al 2017 bucak et al 2018 the model used in this study showed reliable performance 3 q out q in q p q ev q wl 4 p out q out c p where qin is the input water m3 including river and upstream transmission qp is the rainfall input m3 qev is evaporation m3 qwl is the change in water volume due to water level fluctuations m3 pout is the phosphorus output g cp is the area phosphorus concentration mg l 5 re 1 n d m d where re is the relative absolute error with n the sample size low re scores show that the model output falls well within the range of the measurement data 2 5 threshold analysis the magnitude of the threshold value is related to the management objectives for linear and nonlinear response curves without hysteresis the threshold is the nutrient load that corresponds to the water quality target for nonlinear response curves with hysteresis the threshold value must consider the sudden shift point janse et al 2008 in shallow lakes there are two or more steady states vegetation dominant and phytoplankton dominant scheffer et al 2001 there are abrupt change points between these states janssen et al 2021b threshold analysis first requires determining whether the load response curve is nonlinear with hysteresis bifurcation analysis is used to analyse load response curves via scenario simulation through the establishment of eutrophication and oligotrophication paths the state of the lake under different loads can be determined and used to calculate the disturbance threshold janse et al 2008 we conducted a bifurcation analysis for each area separately to analyse the response curves and thresholds the response curves in all areas of chaohu lake were nonlinear without hysteresis these findings are consistent with data from nearby lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river huang et al 2021a janssen et al 2017 changes in the abundance and diversity of aquatic vegetation occur gradually rather than suddenly phillips et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 alternative stable states are typically associated with shallow lakes that are homogenous in lake characteristics janssen et al 2019 the main nutrient input to chaohu lake is riverine consistent with the point loaded lake response curve janssen et al 2019 because the lake was nonlinear without hysteresis we used the chl a concentration as a management target to determine the threshold we also used the phosphorus concentration in the current chinese water quality standard as the management objective to compare the two thresholds overall the thresholds were analysed under two management objectives objective 1 tp 0 05 mg l chinese surface water environmental standard category iii and objective 2 chl a concentration 30 µg l european water framework directive janssen et al 2014 compared to tp chl a concentration directly responds to algal levels and we are more concerned with summer values thus two thresholds were considered separately in the calculations based on objective 1 the phosphorus load was calculated when two three and four seasons met the standard considering three hydrological years high normal and low based on meteorological data 2016 2017 and 2019 were selected as high normal and low years respectively based on the loads of 2016 2017 and 2019 the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio was set at 20 a bifurcation analysis of total phosphorus concentration was performed the three hydrological years were weighted and averaged to obtain the number of attainment seasons we assumed weights of 25 for the high and low water years and 50 for the normal water year the threshold was phosphorus load when the mean summer chl a concentration of the three hydrologic years achieved objective 2 3 results 3 1 watershed runoff the runoff results fig 7 showed that the inter annual runoff volume significantly varied from 2016 to 2019 with the largest and smallest input volumes in 2016 63 6 108 m3 and 2019 24 5 108 m3 respectively the results were similar to the findings in previous reports tu et al 1990 the rivers had similar input patterns in different years the hangbu river was always the largest contributor of runoff providing 40 50 of the total inflow to the lake the nanfei river runoff provided 15 30 of the total inflow to the lake the shiwuli river provided 3 of the total inflow the lake flow density q was defined in this study as the water input per unit area of the lake and was used to describe the hydrodynamic conditions of the lake fig 7b the flow density in areas 1 and 2 was small the main input was riverine area 3 had the highest q because of the large input from the hangbu river along with upstream transfer area 4 had no riverine input all inflow was derived from upstream and rainfall most of the q of areas 5 and 6 which were downstream of the lake was provided by upstream transfer 3 2 load contribution and threshold distribution we used lake phosphorus load density to represent phosphorus input from west to east the phosphorus input density to chaohu lake tended to increase then decrease fig 8 all inputs to area 1 were riverine shiwuli river and paihe river with a density of 8 7 g m2 day approximately 82 of the input to area 2 was from the nanfei river while 18 was from area 1 area 3 had the highest input density with the hanbu river and the upstream transfer contributing 55 and 45 respectively all inputs in area 4 were from area 3 input loads from rivers in areas 5 and 6 were smaller most came from upstream the thresholds varied widely among areas increasing and then decreasing from west to east for objective 1 when the objective was met in two seasons the thresholds in area 1 and 2 were 2 2 5 g m2 day the thresholds in areas 3 and 4 were 5 g m2 day and the thresholds in areas 5 and 6 were 3 5 g m2 day when the target was met in three seasons threshold was down 5 15 compared to the two seasons when the objective was met in four seasons the thresholds decreased by 30 35 for objective 2 the thresholds were 1 6

understanding the spatial distribution of nutrient loads and thresholds in lakes is important for implementing effective watershed nutrient management and restoring water quality throughout the lake however no model is currently capable of achieving this the widely used tools for threshold analysis are zero dimensional and are considered to be only to small lakes or ponds soares and calijuri 2021 for large lakes ignoring the spatial heterogeneity of the characteristics of lakes will render threshold unreliable the area threshold analysis framework provides a new way of analysing spatial nutrient loads and thresholds the input characteristics and distribution characteristics of the lake are key factors that affect lake ecosystems they can determine the type of response curve janssen et al 2014 janssen et al 2017 janssen et al 2019 which resulted in a similar spatial distribution pattern of water quality in the lake over time qi et al 2021 xi et al 2015 yang et al 2020b yu et al 2011 zhang et al 2021 statistical analysis of lake characteristics enables the identification of areas with similar lake characteristics this provides a theoretical basis for applying the zero dimensional model to determine the spatial threshold of the lake meanwhile water depth fetch janssen et al 2014 sediment and flow janssen et al 2017 are considered to be important factors influencing the lake response we calibrated the models uniformly with these parameters as the area specific parameters the calibration results showed that the differences in area specific parameters did not cause simulation results to deviate significantly from the monitored values and still described the local water quality response well the result of validation indirectly verified the reliability of ataf to modelling areas considering key elements this suggests that the model considered the spatial heterogeneity of depth fetch and sediment to reduce uncertainty furthermore a simple generalisation of transport based on the complete mixed reactor principle was available through uniform modelling we obtained the spatial distribution of the chaohu lake threshold the determination of critical nutrient loads on a spatial scale is an important innovation the threshold distribution did not look as fine as the study of lake taihu janssen et al 2017 however we could intuitively compare the river inputs to the thresholds by quantifying material exchange between areas for example in area 2 the nanfei river contributed 82 of the area load while the upstream transfer contributed only 18 in order to meet year round tp 0 05 mg l load reduction of 81 was necessary this requires a considerable reduction in the nanfei river such a reduction is impossible to achieve by pursuing fine spatial thresholds e g dividing the lake into many small cells because complex hydrodynamics will prevent the quantification of material exchange between them a simple generalisation would introduce serious errors into such a small scale analysis from this perspective our approach is an instructive compromise the datm framework facilitated this study model coupling and improvement are no longer difficult tasks coupling 0 dimensional models with 1 dimensional vertical models has yielded promising results therefore we can extend our approach to vertically stratified deep lakes by coupling 1 dimensional droop models 4 2 threshold distribution the threshold value reflects the capacity of the lake to contain phosphorus and chl a the differences in the spatial distribution of the thresholds indicated that lake characteristics influence the thresholds ignoring the spatial heterogeneity of the lake can conceal this difference and hamper subsequent analysis differences in thresholds under the two management objectives reflected the different response mechanisms of lake phosphorus and algae to external disturbances for lake tp concentration wind induced endogenous release and flow density may explain the large spatial variation in thresholds all areas of the lake lack wind shelters similar to east lake taihu janssen et al 2017 the smooth shoreline failed to weaken the effect of wind on the lake surface thus allowing the development of considerable waves wind can cause resuspension of substrate it can also enhance chemical transport through the sediment water interface by reducing the thickness of the diffuse boundary layer liu et al 2014 because of the shallow depths of areas 1 and 2 chen and liu 2015 winds could lead to considerable endogenous release importantly sediments in areas 1 and 2 had the highest phosphorus contents and are concentrated in the surface layer wang et al 2021b suggesting extensive release of endogenous sources under the action of wind this weakens the regional pollution capacity and decreases the tp threshold these findings are confirmed by studies regarding sediment phosphorus flux yang et al 2020a areas 3 and 4 were deeper than areas 1 and 2 which partially mitigated the effect of wind on the bottom sediment the hangbu river the largest river flowing into the lake had a high area flow density the flow density in areas 3 and 4 was approximately threefold greater than the flow density in areas 1 and 2 fig 7 the better hydrodynamic conditions accelerated nutrient transport making the thresholds in areas 3 and 4 approximately twofold greater than the thresholds in areas 1 and 2 these findings were supported by the greater consistency of areas 3 and 4 areas 5 and 6 had a greater flow density than did areas 1 and 2 which might explain the greater threshold in those areas compared with areas 3 and 4 the phosphorus content in sediments was higher in areas 5 and 6 wang et al 2021b this finding is presumably because of pollutant siltation caused by the establishment of the chaohu lake sluice the presence of a phosphorus rich mineral layer distributed in the north eastern part of chaohu lake and the higher phosphorus content within soils in the east lake watershed the large surface area and the east west orientation of the lake amplify the influence of the east wind high fetch the wind induced resuspension made the thresholds smaller in areas 5 and 6 than in areas 3 and 4 yang et al 2021 for lake chl a concentration wind induced aggregation and flow density were the main reasons for the large spatial variation in thresholds areas 1 and 2 had the smallest thresholds lake wide implying that these areas were more suitable for algal aggregation than were other areas consistent with these findings the highest algal growth rate was observed in the west lake area qi et al 2021 our findings imply several effects first wind related endogenous release provided an adequate source of nutrients for algal growth second the recovery of bottom sediment algae in shallow water areas is generally regarded as an important source of cyanobacteria in the water column karlsson elfgren et al 2003 shallow depths 2 m in areas 1 and 2 enhanced the recovery of bottom sediment cyanobacteria karlsson elfgren et al 2004 third east winds prevail in chaohu lake promoting algae accumulation in areas 1 and 2 algal aggregation would enhance the release of phosphorus from sediment via pumping xie et al 2003 and oxygen depletion zhu et al 2013 further promoting algal growth a low flow velocity promotes algal growth mitrovic et al 2011 a moderate flow velocity increases nutrient uptake by algal cells and promotes algal metabolism xiao et al 2016 and a high flow velocity inhibits algal growth tan et al 2019b the critical flow velocity is 6 m s to inhibit algal growth in taihu lake which is located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river wu et al 2013 the flow velocity in chaohu lake under summer prevailing winds is 0 01 0 05 m s chen and liu 2015 the limitation of algal growth by flow velocity did not explain the sudden increase in the chl a threshold in areas 3 and 4 water age has a similar spatial pattern to chl a qi et al 2016 although the rate of change is disproportionate algal biomass is positively correlated with water age tang et al 2021 to explain the sudden increases in thresholds in areas 3 and 4 we performed a bifurcation analysis of the inflow to the lake based on the current phosphorus load we analysed the relationship between chl a concentration and flow density there was a significant correlation between area flow density and summer chl a concentration r2 0 14 p 0 01 fig 9 the bifurcation results and observations had a significant inflection point at q 55 mm m2 day the chl a concentration significantly decreased at q 55 mm m2 day we assumed that chl a concentration was related only to flow density i e it was inversely proportional to flow density red dashed line in fig 9 the red curve was more consistent with the trend of bifurcation results and observations the above results suggest flow density to be the main determinant of chl a concentration we propose two explanations in the first explanation a high flow density intensified phosphorus transport increased the area phosphorus holding capacity reduced the phosphorus concentration in the lake and affected algal growth in the second explanation the higher flow simultaneously promoted algal transfer indirectly increasing the regional chl a holding capacity bifurcation analysis explained the small thresholds in areas 1 and 2 mean q of 39 and 35 mm m2 day respectively and the sudden increases in thresholds in areas 3 and 4 mean q of 130 and 102 mm m2 day respectively compared to areas 1 and 2 the flow densities in areas 5 and 6 were 52 and 82 mm m2 day respectively they yielded higher thresholds however the threshold value of area 6 was smaller than the values in areas 3 and 4 the local growth rate of algae is low in area 6 yang et al 2021 but the risk of algal aggregation is higher in this area than in other areas qian et al 2022 yang et al 2021 these findings indicated that algae from upstream floats were accumulating here lowering the threshold persistent winds can aggregate algae and increase the concentration of chl a in downwind water ndong et al 2014 the effect of wind on algal drift between areas was not fully reflected in the model results when algae did not float beyond the delineated lake area the model simulation of algae was subject to systematic errors from the model itself however when algae floated beyond the delineated lake area the variation in chl a concentration was calibrated to the parameters of algal growth resulting in overestimation of the algal growth rate and underestimation of the threshold these changes led to uncertainty in the simulation results this uncertainty might explain the inability of the model bifurcation analysis to describe the large chl a value at q 55 mm m2 day the addition of chl a to the material flow transport is a feasible approach which we plan to describe in a subsequent study 4 3 management objectives the thresholds under different management objectives significantly differed it may be necessary to re evaluate the management objectives to achieve a financial and ecological balance in areas 1 and 2 the difference in thresholds under the two objectives was not significant at chl a 30 µg l areas 1 and 2 achieved a tp 0 05 mg l for four and three seasons respectively objective 2 was a more stringent management target than was objective 1 the difference between the current nutrient load and the threshold was substantial meeting the objective 1 or 2 standard for an entire year was a daunting task meeting the standards for two or three seasons was more realistic the thresholds for areas 3 and 4 under objective 1 significantly differed from those thresholds under objective 2 the current load to the lake exceeded the threshold under objective 1 but did not reach the threshold under objective 2 this situation would allow managers more manoeuvrability because addressing threats to water quality and safety no longer appeared to be a top priority the continued adoption of objective 1 would depend on the manager s ambition for area 5 objective 1 was the more stringent water quality standard the difference between objective 2 and the current load input was small and after the load reduction of upstream area 5 might not require reduction to achieve objective 2 for area 6 objective 2 has been achieved the achievement of objective 1 depends on the manager s ambition the difference between objective 1 and the current load was small upstream management will allow the objective to be achieved therefore if objective 1 was the management goal areas 1 and 2 did not ensure chl a 30 μg l which does not remove the potential threat of algae to water safety and a more stringent water quality goal should be set however in areas 3 to 6 objective 1 was excessively strict when tp exceeds 0 05 mg l it did not mean that the concentration of algae would threaten the health of water quality and the appropriate relaxed water quality standards could be taken 5 conclusion we analysed the spatial distribution of nutrition load and thresholds in chaohu lake using the area threshold analysis framework established a link between rivers and area thresholds and provided spatial insights into the lake ecosystem our results enhance the understanding of differences in the responses of lake area ecosystems to disturbances they enable determination of the roles that lake characteristics have in the response process as well as consideration of where nutrient loads originate and the extent of reduction needed we conclude that nutrient load thresholds vary widely among the regions of chaohu lake with the lowest threshold in the west and the highest in the mid lake area these variations are mainly related to the spatial heterogeneity of lake characteristics the large differences in thresholds under different management objectives reflect the different response mechanisms of different water quality variables to nutrition load the western part of the lake areas 1 and 2 has the greatest reduction task the shiwuli paihe and nanfei rivers must be reduced by 80 to achieve an annual tp of 0 05 mg l achievement of the standard for two or three seasons is a more realistic management goal compared to achievement of the standard for the entire year the central part of the lake areas 3 and 4 can achieve chl a 30 µg l without reduction the achievement of a tp of 0 05 mg l depends on the manager s ambition most inputs into the eastern part of the lake areas 5 and 6 are from other areas upstream reductions will help achieve the water quality target wind and flow density influence the threshold distribution in which lake characteristics such as depth and sediment distribution have important roles we presume that our approach will increase interest in disturbance response mechanisms and nutrient load management in

2857,persistent eutrophication frequently causes toxic algal blooms which is a serious threat to drinking water safety food security and public health nutrient thresholds the maximum nutrient load that an aquatic ecosystem can absorb while meeting management objective are key to avoiding and reducing blooms the determination of thresholds relies on nutrient load response curves the spatial heterogeneity of large shallow lakes in terms of lake characteristics results in different curves shape among areas of the lake which leads to spatial differences in thresholds however the spatial heterogeneity of thresholds is typically neglected there are few methods to analyse the relationship between river loads and lake specific area thresholds here we proposed the area threshold analysis framework to analyse the spatial patterns of nutrient loads and thresholds in lakes we first quantified the flow and load of the rivers entering the lake the lake was then zoned and modelled to analyse area thresholds finally an intuitive link between the nutrient loads of specific rivers and the thresholds of specific areas of the lake was established the results showed a nonlinear without hysteresis response in all areas of chaohu lake the nutrient loads and thresholds were highly variable in space showing a trend of increasing and then decreasing from west to east flow density and wind might be important in influencing the spatial distribution of thresholds the different effects of the wind and flow density on total phosphorus tp and chlorophyll a chl a lead to large differences in the thresholds with tp and chl a as management objectives respectively the large gap between nutrient loads and thresholds made it important for management to consider appropriate management goals to deal with unrealistic nutrient reductions achieving year round chl a 30 µg l in chaohu lake was easier than tp 0 05 mg l since for the latter the shiwuli paihe and nanfei river loads needed reductions of 80 in addition for area 1 and 2 it was more practical to first start meeting tp 0 05 mg l for 2 or 3 seasons of the year than for 4 seasons overall we developed a new framework for spatial threshold analysis and established an intuitive link between nutrient loads and thresholds in large shallow lakes these results are valuable for understanding the threshold properties of spatially heterogeneous ecosystems in general and provide a reference for watershed nutrient management and ecological restoration of lakes keywords eutrophication spatial heterogeneity pclake threshold value algal blooms data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lakes worldwide are threatened by eutrophication which threatens the drinking water supply food security and public health wang et al 2018 brooks et al 2016 population growth and increased industrial activity are important causes of lake eutrophication conley et al 2009 the continuation of industrial activities during lake health restoration is a key issue for management a common threshold in limnology is the maximum nutrient load that a lake can accept janssen et al 2017 which provide a reference for lake nutrient management we define the threshold as the maximum nutrient load allowed to the lake when management objectives are achieved the management objective can be to achieve a certain lake water quality target or to maintain a certain stable state algae dominated or submerged vegetation dominated scheffer et al 2001 the determination of threshold determines the success or failure of management kelly et al 2015 load response curves are used to determine nutrient thresholds lakes can have three types of curves linear nonlinear without hysteresis and nonlinear with hysteresis scheffer et al 2001 the type of response curve is related to the strength of positive feedback between phytoplankton and submerged plants janssen et al 2014 lake distribution characteristics e g depth fetch flow velocity and sediment and input characteristics e g hydrology and nutrients can influence the response processes of shallow lakes janse et al 2010 janse et al 2008 janssen et al 2021a janssen et al 2014 janssen et al 2019 in some shallow lakes aquatic vegetation has a substantial influence on lake water quality because it occupies a critical interface in the lake ecosystem hu et al 2021 macrophyte degradation enhances the effects of wind there can be a sudden change from a macrophyte dominant state to an alternative phytoplankton state scheffer et al 1993 lake hydrodynamic conditions can affect local nutrient and algal concentrations through transport and hydraulic residence time is considered to be one of the reasons for alternative stability hilt et al 2011 different hydrological and nutrient input patterns can also influence the response pattern of the lake janssen et al 2019 due to geographical differences the distribution characteristics of large shallow lakes are typically spatially variable which results in different water quality responses to nutrients in different areas of the lake the load response curves of large shallow lake exhibit spatial heterogeneity janssen et al 2017 which is often ignored janssen et al 2014 although studies of spatial thresholds have considered the distribution of lake characteristics janssen et al 2017 no study has integrated the distribution of lake characteristics with input characteristics there are several methods for assessing response curves historical data hindcasting capon et al 2015 space for stress substitution schallenberg et al 2017 cross site comparison schallenberg 2021 laboratory or field experiments barker et al 2008 and deterministic modelling janse et al 2008 the historical data approach relies on long term observations of the lake which must cover all stages of oligotrophication and eutrophication capon et al 2015 many lakes do not have such a dataset the space for stress substitution and cross site comparison approaches rely on studies of other similar lakes they indirectly determine response curves without the use of long term observations laboratory simulation allows reconstruction of lake oligotrophication and eutrophication but the results are not representative of field conditions stewart et al 2013 for example the effects of wind are easily ignored janssen et al 2017 modelling can simulate the response process under multiple stresses in lakes by building a model with reliable predictive ability janse et al 2008 kong et al 2017 the flexibility and efficiency of the modelling approach enable spatial threshold analysis janse et al developed the pclake model comprising a fully mixed water column and a subsurface sediment layer this model operates a closed nutrient cycle in the lake system janse 2005 the model was designed for pollutant control in shallow lakes and the prediction of load response curves it is more professional than other models hu et al 2021 janssen et al 2014 pclake is widely used to model thresholds in bifurcation analyses of ecosystems janssen et al 2017 kong et al 2017 because pclake is a zero dimensional model its generalisation of lake characteristics limits applications in large lakes with high spatial heterogeneity to address this attempts have been made to dimensionalise the pclake model andersen et al 2020 janssen et al 2017 janssen et al 2019 based on the datm framework janssen et al coupled pclake with the 3d hydrodynamic mode delft3d and analysed the spatial threshold distribution of taihu lake janssen et al 2017 however because complex hydrodynamic processes hamper the quantification of local nutrient loads burger et al 2008 spatial analyses cannot evaluate the relationships of riverine nutrient inputs with spatial thresholds in lakes china is the world s largest developing country it began to accumulate lake water quality data after the occurrence of widespread eutrophication in the 1980s huang et al 2021a because of insufficient data and the urgent need for management china adopted european and american environmental standards for water quality assessment the standards classify surface water quality by specifying uniform physical chemical and biological index limits this approach provides a basis for the protection and management of water environments in china however there are few biological indicators related to algae and eutrophication is restrained only by nitrogen and phosphorus yang et al 2022 the spatial heterogeneity of water bodies is ignored china spans six temperature zones from north to south and the mean elevation difference between east and west is 4000 m such differences in geography and climate result in regional differences in response curves janssen et al 2021a leading to overly strict or lenient management it is thus necessary to analyse the deviations between thresholds under current management standards and ecological thresholds chaohu lake located in south eastern china has an area of 780 km2 it is one of several large shallow lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river fig 1 the watershed is densely populated and strongly influenced by human activities it has experienced extensive eutrophication the watershed has seven major inlet rivers the nanfei hangbu shiwuli baishitian zhaohe and zhegao rivers that account for 90 of the total inflow zhang et al 2021 the main water volume and nutrient load enters the lake from the west and the lake flows from west to east finally flowing into the yangtze river via the yuxi river in the southeast the elongated morphology and input pattern give chaohu lake an upstream and downstream transport characteristic similar to river transport which is beneficial for quantifying the transport of material between the lake areas lake water quality shows significant spatial heterogeneity usually involving high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in the west lake which lead to algal blooms good water quality is present in the east lake xi et al 2015 the distribution of lake flow field depth and sediment have similar spatial patterns wang et al 2021b chen and liu 2015 facilitating the analysis of spatial heterogeneity among thresholds in this study we aimed to determine the spatial patterns of nutrient loads and thresholds in chaohu lake we proposed the area threshold analysis framework for the analysis of spatial nutrient loads and thresholds we first reconstruct the runoff process of chaohu lake to provide the necessary boundary for lake modelling the lake area was zoned according to the characteristics of each area based on the concept of a complete mixing reactor the regions were uniformly modelled using the pclake model finally bifurcation analysis of the areas was used to calculate the thresholds under management objectives the spatial response mechanism of the thresholds was analysed our findings will facilitate restoration management of poorly mixed and spatially heterogeneous lakes such as chaohu lake 2 methods 2 1 analysis framework the analysis framework is shown in fig 2 the framework implements spatial loading and threshold analysis in 3 steps preparation of basic data model configuration modelling and analysis the first important step is to understand the distribution characteristics and input characteristics of the lake the lake distribution characteristics depth sediment hydrodynamics water quality etc and input characteristics flow load can be captured through literature research and model simulations the abundance of information in the study area is the main limitation for the implementation of the framework for chaohu lake studies on lake distribution characteristics are abundant while information on input characteristics is lacking in this study the swat model was chosen to reconstruct the runoff process of chaohu lake the second step is to zone the lake and configure the model according to its characteristics large shallow lakes often exhibit strong spatial heterogeneity in terms of flow field and pollution distribution the chaohu lake distributions of sediment wang et al 2021b water quality xi et al 2015 huang et al 2021b flow field chen and liu 2015 and water depth had similar spatial patterns sediment flow velocity water quality and water depth were selected as lake parameters a clustering analysis was performed for 19 stations in chaohu lake based on the results chaohu lake was zoned according to the locations of river estuaries and the existing zoning method wang et al 2021b the purpose of lake partitioning was to accommodate the homogenisation of the 0 dimensional model pclake and to facilitate the apportionment of nutrient sources the configuration of the model was selected after zoning chaohu lake is elongated its water flows from west to east year round similar to the upstream and downstream of a river the correlations of tn tp and chlorophyll a chl a concentrations with the distance of the lake from ty to chcc red arrow in fig 3 exceeded 0 85 p 0 01 in this study we used a tandem configuration model which is reportedly feasible for lake threshold analysis janssen et al 2019 the transport variables between adjacent areas were calculated based on the principle of a complete mixing reactor finally the model code is compiled and bifurcation analysis is performed based on the model configuration scheme based on the datm framework mooij et al 2014 the tandem model was implemented using matlab and a spatial threshold analysis was performed using the tandem model details about the method were given below 2 2 soil and water assessment tool swat model runoff can be calculated by empirical methods including inferred methods and unit hydrological line methods de lavenne et al 2015 conceptual models including hbv models lupakov et al 2021 and xinanjiang models wang et al 2021a and mechanistic models including vic models nijssen et al 2001 the swat model chen et al 2018 and the rs dtvgm model lou et al 2019 empirical methods are typically used because of their simplicity and practicality but the highly generalised coefficients increase the uncertainty of the results conceptual models overcome the limitation of the selection of empirical coefficients they improve the calculation accuracy by considering different hydrological processes mechanistic models benefit from their rich description of hydrological processes and can analyse runoff processes using fine time scales panagopoulos et al 2011 because the process based water quality model used in this study depends on fine time scale date we used the swat mechanistic model for watershed runoff calculations the swat model is a gis based distributed watershed hydrologic model developed by the agricultural research service of the u s department of agriculture and texas a m agrilife research kast et al 2021 the model is based on water balance equations including surface runoff precipitation rain or snow evapotranspiration infiltration and subsurface flow nutrient balance equations are also based on factors such as external loading transportation of nutrients with runoff fertilisers plant nutrient uptake and soil characteristics swat models can simulate many hydrological and physicochemical processes e g runoff sediment water quality and pesticide they have been used in many watersheds worldwide bauwe et al 2019 tan et al 2019a cibin et al 2016 the swat model was used to simulate the quantity of watershed flow amounts using a monthly time step and sub watershed spatial units the model data sources are shown in table s1 specifically the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient and the coefficient of determination r2 were used to evaluate model performance monthly monitoring data from 2016 to 2019 at the taoxi hydrological monitoring station were collected and compared with the simulation results the model was simulated for 2013 to 2019 with 2013 to 2015 as the warm up period the calibration period was 2016 to 2018 the validation period was 2019 calibration was performed using swat cup with the sequential uncertainty fitting version sufi 2 method the r2 values for the calibration and validation periods were 0 88 and 0 64 respectively the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient values were 0 5 fig 4 the performance of the model met the requirements for use lin et al 2021 1 r 2 d d m m 2 d d 2 m m 2 2 nse 1 d m 2 d d 2 r2 the coefficient of determination d the observed data and m the model output high r2 scores indicates good resemblance of the seasonal pattern in the data by the model nse is the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse is close to 1 which means the model is

simulation error is large nse is much 0 and the model is not credible 2 3 cluster analysis statistical analysis e g cluster redundancy and principal component analysis of biological physical and chemical indicators of water allows the investigation of both spatial and temporal patterns in water ecosystems chu et al 2021 ma et al 2020 liu and yang 2021 newton et al 2011 yu et al 2011 cluster analysis can detect regional differences in lake water quality beveridge et al 2012 momen et al 1996 zhang et al 2021 the two step clustering method can address continuous variables automatically determine the optimal number of clusters and quantitatively describe the importance of variables in each category lake water quality data were provided by the chaohu lake management agency water samples were collected and treated in accordance with the environmental protection industry standards of the people s republic of china chinese standard hj t 91 2002 the lake parameters of 19 sites in the lake were clustered fig 3 there was substantial interannual and inter month variability in the water quality of chaohu lake lin et al 2021 first the lake sites were classified using a two step clustering method to analyse time series lake water quality data 2014 to 2017 do nh4 n tn tp chl a and bod next the site samples were classified according to analysing total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the sediment surface layer wang et al 2021b sediment thickness water depth flow rate chen and liu 2015 as well as total nitrogen and total phosphorus in water using the systematic clustering method in spss software table s2 based on the classification results the lake area was partitioned by integrating the above mentioned lake characteristics and estuarine location fig 3 the accuracy of the classification results was tested by discriminant analysis da da is a multivariate analysis method that discriminates the accuracy of classification results via creation of a discriminant function based on interclass differences for samples of known classes smeti and golfinopoulos 2016 the correctness of the partitioning results was 55 for continuous variables of water quality and 90 for station samples these findings indicate that the partitioning results are statistically significant and acceptable 2 4 model building how to model the pclake model in the whole lake and achieve simultaneous analysis of different areas is an important topic the first issue of modeling is the programming language a lack of familiarity with programming languages hampers model development janssen et al 2015 a unified programming framework solves this problem by enabling the implementation of multiple models in one language examples include the database approach to modelling van gerven et al 2015 the framework for aquatic biogeochemical models bruggeman and bolding 2014 and delft3d waq deltares 2014 in this study the areas of chaohu lake were uniformly modelled using the pclake model with the datm modelling was implemented in matlab the modelling principle is shown in fig 5 the uniform model considered the size effect depth cdepthw fetch cfetch sediment thickness cdepths and sediment pore water phosphorus content copo4max were the area parameters uniform parameters were used for other variables table s3 the mpload and mnload in the forcing function were calculated as the product of flow and river concentration thus preventing swat model parameter regionalisation that could influence the load and reduce the uncertainty flow nitrogen and phosphorus loads were treated as transport variables between areas the flow input mqin consisted of riverine input with upstream transport fig 5 the flow output mqout was calculated using the water balance equation eq 3 the amount of phosphorus transported downstream was equal to the product of the area concentration and the output flow mqout eq 4 in the model calibration one area was calibrated individually and subsequently validated in the whole lake because area 4 was in the middle of the lake and had more representative parameters it was used for calibration the model was run for 23 years the first 20 years were run with the 2016 forcing function to bring the model to equilibrium while years 21 to 23 were run using the 2017 to 2019 forcing function the results of years 20 to 23 of the model were used as the output for 2016 to 2019 the month by month water quality data from 2016 to 2018 were selected for manual calibration of area 4 the data from 2019 were used to validate area 4 the data from 2016 to 2019 were used to validate other areas fig 6 the r2 values for tn and tp in all areas of the lake were 0 26 0 61 with a mean of 0 43 the r2 value for chl a was 0 03 0 44 with a mean of 0 16 table s4 the model typically did not yield better results for chemical biological variables soares and calijuri 2021 compared to model studies in other large lakes kong et al 2017 bucak et al 2018 the model used in this study showed reliable performance 3 q out q in q p q ev q wl 4 p out q out c p where qin is the input water m3 including river and upstream transmission qp is the rainfall input m3 qev is evaporation m3 qwl is the change in water volume due to water level fluctuations m3 pout is the phosphorus output g cp is the area phosphorus concentration mg l 5 re 1 n d m d where re is the relative absolute error with n the sample size low re scores show that the model output falls well within the range of the measurement data 2 5 threshold analysis the magnitude of the threshold value is related to the management objectives for linear and nonlinear response curves without hysteresis the threshold is the nutrient load that corresponds to the water quality target for nonlinear response curves with hysteresis the threshold value must consider the sudden shift point janse et al 2008 in shallow lakes there are two or more steady states vegetation dominant and phytoplankton dominant scheffer et al 2001 there are abrupt change points between these states janssen et al 2021b threshold analysis first requires determining whether the load response curve is nonlinear with hysteresis bifurcation analysis is used to analyse load response curves via scenario simulation through the establishment of eutrophication and oligotrophication paths the state of the lake under different loads can be determined and used to calculate the disturbance threshold janse et al 2008 we conducted a bifurcation analysis for each area separately to analyse the response curves and thresholds the response curves in all areas of chaohu lake were nonlinear without hysteresis these findings are consistent with data from nearby lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river huang et al 2021a janssen et al 2017 changes in the abundance and diversity of aquatic vegetation occur gradually rather than suddenly phillips et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 alternative stable states are typically associated with shallow lakes that are homogenous in lake characteristics janssen et al 2019 the main nutrient input to chaohu lake is riverine consistent with the point loaded lake response curve janssen et al 2019 because the lake was nonlinear without hysteresis we used the chl a concentration as a management target to determine the threshold we also used the phosphorus concentration in the current chinese water quality standard as the management objective to compare the two thresholds overall the thresholds were analysed under two management objectives objective 1 tp 0 05 mg l chinese surface water environmental standard category iii and objective 2 chl a concentration 30 µg l european water framework directive janssen et al 2014 compared to tp chl a concentration directly responds to algal levels and we are more concerned with summer values thus two thresholds were considered separately in the calculations based on objective 1 the phosphorus load was calculated when two three and four seasons met the standard considering three hydrological years high normal and low based on meteorological data 2016 2017 and 2019 were selected as high normal and low years respectively based on the loads of 2016 2017 and 2019 the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio was set at 20 a bifurcation analysis of total phosphorus concentration was performed the three hydrological years were weighted and averaged to obtain the number of attainment seasons we assumed weights of 25 for the high and low water years and 50 for the normal water year the threshold was phosphorus load when the mean summer chl a concentration of the three hydrologic years achieved objective 2 3 results 3 1 watershed runoff the runoff results fig 7 showed that the inter annual runoff volume significantly varied from 2016 to 2019 with the largest and smallest input volumes in 2016 63 6 108 m3 and 2019 24 5 108 m3 respectively the results were similar to the findings in previous reports tu et al 1990 the rivers had similar input patterns in different years the hangbu river was always the largest contributor of runoff providing 40 50 of the total inflow to the lake the nanfei river runoff provided 15 30 of the total inflow to the lake the shiwuli river provided 3 of the total inflow the lake flow density q was defined in this study as the water input per unit area of the lake and was used to describe the hydrodynamic conditions of the lake fig 7b the flow density in areas 1 and 2 was small the main input was riverine area 3 had the highest q because of the large input from the hangbu river along with upstream transfer area 4 had no riverine input all inflow was derived from upstream and rainfall most of the q of areas 5 and 6 which were downstream of the lake was provided by upstream transfer 3 2 load contribution and threshold distribution we used lake phosphorus load density to represent phosphorus input from west to east the phosphorus input density to chaohu lake tended to increase then decrease fig 8 all inputs to area 1 were riverine shiwuli river and paihe river with a density of 8 7 g m2 day approximately 82 of the input to area 2 was from the nanfei river while 18 was from area 1 area 3 had the highest input density with the hanbu river and the upstream transfer contributing 55 and 45 respectively all inputs in area 4 were from area 3 input loads from rivers in areas 5 and 6 were smaller most came from upstream the thresholds varied widely among areas increasing and then decreasing from west to east for objective 1 when the objective was met in two seasons the thresholds in area 1 and 2 were 2 2 5 g m2 day the thresholds in areas 3 and 4 were 5 g m2 day and the thresholds in areas 5 and 6 were 3 5 g m2 day when the target was met in three seasons threshold was down 5 15 compared to the two seasons when the objective was met in four seasons the thresholds decreased by 30 35 for objective 2 the thresholds were 1 6 2 g m2 day in the west lake areas 1 and 2 12 5 18 5 g m2 day in the middle of the lake areas 3 and 4 4 6 7 g m2 day the east lake area 5 and area 6 4 discussion 4 1 area threshold analysis framework understanding the spatial distribution of nutrient loads and thresholds in lakes is important for implementing effective watershed nutrient management and restoring water quality throughout the lake however no model is currently capable of achieving this the widely used tools for threshold analysis are zero dimensional and are considered to be only to small lakes or ponds soares and calijuri 2021 for large lakes ignoring the spatial heterogeneity of the characteristics of lakes will render threshold unreliable the area threshold analysis framework provides a new way of analysing spatial nutrient loads and thresholds the input characteristics and distribution characteristics of the lake are key factors that affect lake ecosystems they can determine the type of response curve janssen et al 2014 janssen et al 2017 janssen et al 2019 which resulted in a similar spatial distribution pattern of water quality in the lake over time qi et al 2021 xi et al 2015 yang et al 2020b yu et al 2011 zhang et al 2021 statistical analysis of lake characteristics enables the identification of areas with similar lake characteristics this provides a theoretical basis for applying the zero dimensional model to determine the spatial threshold of the lake meanwhile water depth fetch janssen et al 2014 sediment and flow janssen et al 2017 are considered to be important factors influencing the lake response we calibrated the models uniformly with these parameters as the area specific parameters the calibration results showed that the differences in area specific parameters did not cause simulation results to deviate significantly from the monitored values and still described the local water quality response well the result of validation indirectly verified the reliability of ataf to modelling areas considering key elements this suggests that the model considered the spatial heterogeneity of depth fetch and sediment to reduce uncertainty furthermore a simple generalisation of transport based on the complete mixed reactor principle was available through uniform modelling we obtained the spatial distribution of the chaohu lake threshold the determination of critical nutrient loads on a spatial scale is an important innovation the threshold distribution did not look as fine as the study of lake taihu janssen et al 2017 however we could intuitively compare the river inputs to the thresholds by quantifying material exchange between areas for example in area 2 the nanfei river contributed 82 of the area load while the upstream transfer contributed only 18 in order to meet year round tp 0 05 mg l load reduction of 81 was necessary this requires a considerable reduction in the nanfei river such a reduction is impossible to achieve by pursuing fine spatial thresholds e g dividing the lake into many small cells because complex hydrodynamics will prevent the quantification of material exchange between them a simple generalisation would introduce serious errors into such a small scale analysis from this perspective our approach is an instructive compromise the datm framework facilitated this study model coupling and improvement are no longer difficult tasks coupling 0 dimensional models with 1 dimensional vertical models has yielded promising results therefore we can extend our approach to vertically stratified deep lakes by coupling 1 dimensional droop models 4 2 threshold distribution the threshold value reflects the capacity of the lake to contain phosphorus and chl a the differences in the spatial distribution of the thresholds indicated that lake characteristics influence the thresholds ignoring the spatial heterogeneity of the lake can conceal this difference and hamper subsequent analysis differences in thresholds under the two management objectives reflected the different response mechanisms of lake phosphorus and algae to external disturbances for lake tp concentration wind induced endogenous release and flow density may explain the large spatial variation in thresholds all areas of the lake lack wind shelters similar to east lake taihu janssen et al 2017 the smooth shoreline failed to weaken the effect of wind on the lake surface thus allowing the development of considerable waves wind can cause resuspension of substrate it can also enhance chemical transport through the sediment water interface by reducing the thickness of the diffuse boundary layer liu et al 2014 because of the shallow depths of areas 1 and 2 chen and liu 2015 winds could lead to considerable endogenous release importantly sediments in areas 1 and 2 had the highest phosphorus contents and are concentrated in the surface layer wang et al 2021b suggesting extensive release of endogenous sources under the action of wind this weakens the regional pollution capacity and decreases the tp threshold these findings are confirmed by studies regarding sediment phosphorus flux yang et al 2020a areas 3 and 4 were deeper than areas 1 and 2 which partially mitigated the effect of wind on the bottom sediment the hangbu river the largest river flowing into the lake had a high area flow density the flow density in areas 3 and 4 was approximately threefold greater than the flow density in areas 1 and 2 fig 7 the better hydrodynamic conditions accelerated nutrient transport making the thresholds in areas 3 and 4 approximately twofold greater than the thresholds in areas 1 and 2 these findings were supported by the greater consistency of areas 3 and 4 areas 5 and 6 had a greater flow density than did areas 1 and 2 which might explain the greater threshold in those areas compared with areas 3 and 4 the phosphorus content in sediments was higher in areas 5 and 6 wang et al 2021b this finding is presumably because of pollutant siltation caused by the establishment of the chaohu lake sluice the presence of a phosphorus rich mineral layer distributed in the north eastern part of chaohu lake and the higher phosphorus content within soils in the east lake watershed the large surface area and the east west orientation of the lake amplify the influence of the east wind high fetch the wind induced resuspension made the thresholds smaller in areas 5 and 6 than in areas 3 and 4 yang et al 2021 for lake chl a concentration wind induced aggregation and flow density were the main reasons for the large spatial variation in thresholds areas 1 and 2 had the smallest thresholds lake wide implying that these areas were more suitable for algal aggregation than were other areas consistent with these findings the highest algal growth rate was observed in the west lake area qi et al 2021 our findings imply several effects first wind related endogenous release provided an adequate source of nutrients for algal growth second the recovery of bottom sediment algae in shallow water areas is generally regarded as an important source of cyanobacteria in the water column karlsson elfgren et al 2003 shallow depths 2 m in areas 1 and 2 enhanced the recovery of bottom sediment cyanobacteria karlsson elfgren et al 2004 third east winds prevail in chaohu lake promoting algae accumulation in areas 1 and 2 algal aggregation would enhance the release of phosphorus from sediment via pumping xie et al 2003 and oxygen depletion zhu et al 2013 further promoting algal growth a low flow velocity promotes algal growth mitrovic et al 2011 a moderate flow velocity increases nutrient uptake by algal cells and promotes algal metabolism xiao et al 2016 and a high flow velocity inhibits algal growth tan et al 2019b the critical flow velocity is 6 m s to inhibit algal growth in taihu lake which is located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river wu et al 2013 the flow velocity in chaohu lake under summer prevailing winds is 0 01 0 05 m s chen and liu 2015 the limitation of algal growth by flow velocity did not explain the sudden increase in the chl a threshold in areas 3 and 4 water age has a similar spatial pattern to chl a qi et al 2016 although the rate of change is disproportionate algal biomass is positively correlated with water age tang et al 2021 to explain the sudden increases in thresholds in areas 3 and 4 we performed a bifurcation analysis of the inflow to the lake based on the current phosphorus load we analysed the relationship between chl a concentration and flow density there was a significant correlation between area flow density and summer chl a concentration r2 0 14 p 0 01 fig 9 the bifurcation results and observations had a significant inflection point at q 55 mm m2 day the chl a concentration significantly decreased at q 55 mm m2 day we assumed that chl a concentration was related only to flow density i e it was inversely proportional to flow density red dashed line in fig 9 the red curve was more consistent with the trend of bifurcation results and observations the above results suggest flow density to be the main determinant of chl a concentration we propose two explanations in the first explanation a high flow density intensified phosphorus transport increased the area phosphorus holding capacity reduced the phosphorus concentration in the lake and affected algal growth in the second explanation the higher flow simultaneously promoted algal transfer indirectly increasing the regional chl a holding capacity bifurcation analysis explained the small thresholds in areas 1 and 2 mean q of 39 and 35 mm m2 day respectively and the sudden increases in thresholds in areas 3 and 4 mean q of 130 and 102 mm m2 day respectively compared to areas 1 and 2 the flow densities in areas 5 and 6 were 52 and 82 mm m2 day respectively they yielded higher thresholds however the threshold value of area 6 was smaller than the values in areas 3 and 4 the local growth rate of algae is low in area 6 yang et al 2021 but the risk of algal aggregation is higher in this area than in other areas qian et al 2022 yang et al 2021 these findings indicated that algae from upstream floats were accumulating here lowering the threshold persistent winds can aggregate algae and increase the concentration of chl a in downwind water ndong et al 2014 the effect of wind on algal drift between areas was not fully reflected in the model results when algae did not float beyond the delineated lake area the model simulation of algae was subject to systematic errors from the model itself however when algae floated beyond the delineated lake area the variation in chl a concentration was calibrated to the parameters of algal growth resulting in overestimation of the algal growth rate and underestimation of the threshold these changes led to uncertainty in the simulation results this uncertainty might explain the inability of the model bifurcation analysis to describe the large chl a value at q 55 mm m2 day the addition of chl a to the material flow transport is a feasible approach which we plan to describe in a subsequent study 4 3 management objectives the thresholds under different management objectives significantly differed it may be necessary to re evaluate the management objectives to achieve a financial and ecological balance in areas 1 and 2 the difference in thresholds under the two objectives was not significant at chl a 30 µg l areas 1 and 2 achieved a tp 0 05 mg l for four and three seasons respectively objective 2 was a more stringent management target than was objective 1 the difference between the current nutrient load and the threshold was substantial meeting the objective 1 or 2 standard for an entire year was a daunting task meeting the standards for two or three seasons was more realistic the thresholds for areas 3 and 4 under objective 1 significantly differed from those thresholds under objective 2 the current load to the lake exceeded the threshold under objective 1 but did not reach the threshold under objective 2 this situation would allow managers more manoeuvrability because addressing threats to water quality and safety no longer appeared to be a top priority the continued adoption of objective 1 would depend on the manager s ambition for area 5 objective 1 was the more stringent water quality standard the difference between objective 2 and the current load input was small and after the load reduction of upstream area 5 might not require reduction to achieve objective 2 for area 6 objective 2 has been achieved the achievement of objective 1 depends on the manager s ambition the difference between objective 1 and the current load was small upstream management will allow the objective to be achieved therefore if objective 1 was the management goal areas 1 and 2 did not ensure chl a 30 μg l which does not remove the potential threat of algae to water safety and a more stringent water quality goal should be set however in areas 3 to 6 objective 1 was excessively strict when tp exceeds 0 05 mg l it did not mean that the concentration of algae would threaten the health of water quality and the appropriate relaxed water quality standards could be taken 5 conclusion we analysed the spatial distribution of nutrition load and thresholds in chaohu lake using the area threshold analysis framework established a link between rivers and area thresholds and provided spatial insights into the lake ecosystem our results enhance the understanding of differences in the responses of lake area ecosystems to disturbances they enable determination of the roles that lake characteristics have in the response process as well as consideration of where nutrient loads originate and the extent of reduction needed we conclude that nutrient load thresholds vary widely among the regions of chaohu lake with the lowest threshold in the west and the highest in the mid lake area these variations are mainly related to the spatial heterogeneity of lake characteristics the large differences in thresholds under different management objectives reflect the different response mechanisms of different water quality variables to nutrition load the western part of the lake areas 1 and 2 has the greatest reduction task the shiwuli paihe and nanfei rivers must be reduced by 80 to achieve an annual tp of 0 05 mg l achievement of the standard for two or three seasons is a more realistic management goal compared to achievement of the standard for the entire year the central part of the lake areas 3 and 4 can achieve chl a 30 µg l without reduction the achievement of a tp of 0 05 mg l depends on the manager s ambition most inputs into the eastern part of the lake areas 5 and 6 are from other areas upstream reductions will help achieve the water quality target wind and flow density influence the threshold distribution in which lake characteristics such as depth and sediment distribution have important roles we presume that our approach will increase interest in disturbance response mechanisms and nutrient load management in

2858,locally recycled moisture from transpiration and surface evaporation is of great importance in the terrestrial hydrological cycle especially in the widely distributed oases across arid central asia quantitative assessment of the proportional contribution of recycled moisture to local precipitation i e the recycling ratio is useful to understand the land air interaction as well as the anthropogenic impact on the regional water cycle here we analyzed the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in precipitation samples collected at six stations across the kaxgar yarkant oasis in the western tarim basin of central asia from april 2018 to june 2020 using this data the moisture recycling ratio in this typical oasis was assessed using a bayesian three component isotopic mixing model for the plain stations the annual weighted mean δ 18o value in precipitation ranged from 5 94 to 1 46 and the mountain station has a lower annual mean precipitation isotopic ratio the average recycling ratio during the summer months ranged between 17 0 and 63 9 for each sampling station in the kaxgar yarkant oasis and the proportional contribution from transpiration ranged from 15 1 to 61 3 the contribution of plant transpiration to local precipitation is much larger than that of surface evaporation the recycled portion in total precipitation amount may increase the local precipitation under an oasis expansion background but is insufficient to change the arid background in addition the bayesian isotopic mixing model is promising to determine the recycling ratio in an arid setting and provides more spatial details than the climate reanalysis based calculation keywords precipitation stable isotope moisture recycling oasis arid central asia data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction moisture recycling refers to the hydrological process when evaporated and transpired water from the terrestrial surface returns to the land which plays an important role in the terrestrial water cycle van der ent et al 2014 tuinenburg et al 2020 quantitative assessment of the proportional contribution of recycled moisture to local precipitation also known as the moisture recycling ratio is helpful to understand the land atmosphere interaction in the context of a warming climate and to understand the impact of human activities on water limited regions trenberth 1999 te wierik et al 2021 in arid central asia many densely populated oases are distributed along the piedmont plain the annual mean precipitation is low and water resource availability is always a contentious issue for regional sustainability siegfried et al 2012 in arid regions under a warming climate we may see recycling contributing an increasing fraction to atmospheric moisture hua et al 2016 yao et al 2020 the recycling ratio varies geographically associated with climate conditions and underlying land surface vegetation in arid central asia the contribution of recycled moisture in the oases is much larger than that in the nearby vegetation free deserts yang et al 2019 using gridded data of atmospheric specific humidity wind field and other meteorological parameters the recycling ratio can be determined and mapped on a global or regional scale including in central asia eltahir and bras 1996 trenberth 1999 however in most existing assessments of recycling ratio the spatial resolution of climate input is too course relative to the dramatic variation in land cover e g for interlaced oases and deserts sometimes even the theoretically high spatial divergence of recycling ratio for mountain ranges e g the tianshan mountains is highly smoothed in maps hua et al 2016 wu et al 2019b as physical tracers the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in water are effective tools to assess hydrological processes including moisture recycling van der ent et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 case studies based on stable water isotopes have been conducted applying isotopic mixing models in oases under an arid and semi arid setting zhang and wang 2016 the basic assumption of these models is that the stable isotopic compositions of precipitating vapor are a mixture of those from advected vapor and locally recycled vapor the isotopic ratio of recycled vapor can be estimated using that of the surface evaporation vapor e g kong et al 2013 sun et al 2019 2020 wu et al 2019a or a combination of transpiration and surface evaporation vapor e g wang et al 2016a zhao et al 2019 li et al 2019 gui et al 2022 when the stable water isotopes in each flux of the two component advection and surface evaporation or three component advection transpiration and surface evaporation vapor combination at the target stations are available either measured or estimated the proportional contribution of recycled moisture to local precipitation vapor can be mathematically determined using isotopic mixing models phillips and gregg 2001 peng et al 2011 in the isotope based mixing model multiple linear regression can be applied to estimate the relationship between independent variables i e isotopic ratio in each contributing vapor and one dependent variable i e isotopic ratio in precipitating vapor genereux 1998 to determine model uncertainty more complex algorithms are involved in solving the equations for which software solutions are available phillips and gregg 2001 parnell et al 2013 stock et al 2018 for example wang et al 2016a used the software isoerror phillips and gregg 2001 to determine the confidence intervals and standard deviation of the determined contribution for each contributing component in the isotope mixing model and then this software was applied to understand the model uncertainty in many other later studies zhao et al 2019 sometimes unrealistic solutions i e 0 or 100 may occur in the isotopic mixing model which can be seen in recent arid and semi arid regions zhao et al 2019 qiu et al 2021 for example zhao et al 2019 determined a negative contribution 13 5 or 18 7 of transpiration at an arid riparian forest but did not find an optimal algorithm to resolve this problem in the past decade bayesian techniques have been applied in many fields of earth and environmental science and are considered to be an improved method for determining a multiple mixing model parnell et al 2013 qiu et al 2021 compared the traditional linear regression algorithm using isoerror to the bayesian algorithm using r based program mixsiar stock et al 2018 and found the bayesian algorithm shows more suitable solutions in calculating moisture recycling ratio in a semi arid region more case studies using the bayesian stable isotopic mixing method are still needed in quantifying recycling ratio especially for arid settings the tarim basin is a vast low lying area in central asia surrounded by the tianshan mountains on the north the pamir plateau on the west and the qinghai tibet plateau on the south fig 1 the low lying plain is approximately 530 000 km2 and the drainage area of the tarim river is up to 1 020 000 km2 chen 2010 because of the rain shadow effect and the long distance to the oceans the tarim basin has a very arid climate and the mean precipitation amount is just 66 mm per year shi et al 2008 although several isotope based moisture recycling studies have been conducted in central asia the low lying tarim basin is still not well assessed in a climate reanalysis based assessment wu et al 2019b the tarim basin shows a much larger recycling ratio compared to the junggar basin to the north or the hexi corridor to the east especially in summer a nationwide investigation in china hua et al 2017 calculated the mean recycling ratios for 14 terrestrial sub regions during 1979 2010 and found a high regional mean 25 in the tarim basin which is almost twice of that in the rest of arid northwest china however isotope based case studies indicated a high recycling ratio 29 to 42 at the coast and low values 3 to 16 across inland china zhang and wang 2016 the finding of a high recycling ratio in the tarim basin derived from climate grids has not been verified using an isotope based method and a systemic isotopic observation of precipitation in the tarim basin may be helpful to understand the spatial divergence to understand the moisture recycling across the oasis with strong evapotranspiration in the extreme arid region we collected precipitation samples across the kaxgar yarkant oasis a leeward oasis region located in the western tarim basin central asia from 2018 to 2020 and analyzed the characteristics of precipitation isotopes for the study region the proportional contributions from advection transpiration and surface evaporation to local precipitation are determined using a bayesian three component isotopic mixing model and the influencing factors of moisture recycling are discussed 2 data and methods 2 1 sampling network and collection the kaxgar yarkant oasis is located in the northwestern part of the tarim basin in southern xinjiang central asia fig 1 the oasis is leeward of the tianshan mountains to the north and pamirs plateau to the west many inland streams and rivers like the kaxgar and yarkant rivers originate from the western high altitude mountain ranges and flow into the taklimakan desert in the tarim basin in arid central asia the airflow is dominated by the mid latitude westerlies instead of the monsoon the kaxgar yarkant oasis plain with altitudes between 1100 and 1400 m above sea level has an annual mean air temperature between 11 and 13 c and annual mean precipitation amount between 40 and 90 mm fig 1b g shen et al 2001 the surrounding mountain ranges usually have a lower air temperature and larger precipitation amount fig 1h based on the monthly air temperature we can roughly divide each year into the warm summer months from may to september and cold winter months from october to april when quantifying the oasis moisture recycling we focus on the summer months fig 1b h while the low air temperature and limited precipitation amount in the other months usually result in weak evapotranspiration jian et al 2018 we selected seven national meteorological stations across the kaxgar yarkant oasis to collect event based precipitation samples from 2018 to 2020 table 1 most stations are located on the plain with elevation ranging from 1117 m bachu to 1386 m kashi the wuqia station is an alpine station of the southern tianshan mountains with an altitude of 2176 m the sampling was conducted by the full time weather observers of these national meteorological stations for each station the samples were immediately collected after the end of precipitation events to eliminate the effect of sample evaporation all the precipitation samples were kept in 50 ml high density polyethylene hdpe narrow mouthed bottles with waterproof seals although the snow and hail samples were firstly melted at room temperature in a zip lock bag similar sampling procedures have been applied in our previous work wang et al 2016b the meteorological data of air temperature precipitation amount and relative humidity during the sampling period was provided by the corresponding meteorological stations during the sampling period 435 precipitation samples were collected table 1 the mountainous station wuqia had the largest sample number n 101 and the bachu station had only 33 precipitation samples the samples collected in wuqia during may 2018 to march 2019 n 51 were previously analyzed by shi et al 2021 2 2 laboratory analysis the precipitation samples were analyzed for stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes using a liquid water isotope analyzer t lwia 45 ep abb los gatos research ca usa in the stable isotope laboratory northwest normal university lanzhou china considering the memory effect all the liquid water samples were injected to the analyzer sequentially six times and the first two measurements were directly discarded and then the remaining four measurements were averaged as the final output using the lwia post analysis software abb los gatos research ca usa wang et al 2016b three reference standards were included in a run which were selected from the abb los gatos research commercial working standards lgr 1e δ 2h 165 7 δ 18o 21 28 2e δ 2h 123 8 δ 18o 16 71 3e δ 2h 79 6 δ

sample r reference 1 1000 where r sample is the ratio of 2h 1h or 18o 16o in sample and r reference is the ratio of 2h 1h or 18o 16o in v smow the precision in this study is 0 6 for δ 2h and 0 2 for δ 18o respectively 2 3 bayesian isotopic mixing model 2 3 1 basic framework the water vapor to form precipitation or precipitating vapor generally is sourced from three main parts the advection from outer atmospheric systems the surface transpiration through aerial parts of plants i e leaves stems and flowers and the surface physical evaporation i e evaporation from intercepted moisture soil moisture and inland waters van der ent et al 2014 good et al 2015 to determine the fractional contribution of these three components to the precipitation amount an assumption is that the in cloud processes occur under equilibrium conditions and the fractional contribution of the precipitation is similar to the fractional contribution of the condensing vapor peng et al 2011 van der ent et al 2014 when the stable isotopic ratios in the three potential sources and the mixed precipitating vapor are known measured or estimated the basic framework of three component mixing model is expressed as 2 δ pv f adv δ adv f tr δ tr f ev δ ev 3 f adv f tr f ev 1 where f adv f tr and f ev are proportional contributions of advection plant transpiration and surface evaporation to local precipitation respectively and isotope values of δ pv δ adv δ tr and δ ev are δ 18o or δ 2h in precipitating vapor advection vapor transpiration vapor and surface evaporation vapor respectively fig 2 logically the sum of proportional contributions from the three components is 100 to obtain a solution for the equations an open source r package mixsiar bayesian mixing model in r version 3 1 12 is used in this study the bayesian method gives probabilistic predictions of the fractional contribution from the three components and is considered to be better than the standard deterministic model in determining the fractional contribution using isotope tracers evaristo et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 in spite of many case studies in isotope ecology penna et al 2018 only a few recent cases qiu et al 2021 used the isotope based bayesian method in quantifying moisture recycling in precipitation stock et al 2018 and moore and semmens 2008 provide the details of mixsiar model framework the results can be expressed as the mean median standard deviation and credible intervals are also provided for the markov chain monte carlo mcmc parameter in mixsiar the number of chains is set as 3 and the chain length is set as normal chain length 100000 burn 50000 and thin 50 convergence was tested using the gelman rubin and geweke diagnostics in mixsiar 2 3 2 precipitating vapor isotopes the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition in precipitating vapor can be estimated using that in the precipitation collected at the surface as well as the corresponding meteorological data here a local evaporation line adjusted method bennett et al 2008 gibson and reid 2014 without isotopic equilibrium assumption is applied using the hydrocalculator software version 1 03 skrzypek et al 2015 hydrocalculator was developed and tested using data from a semi arid site in northwest australia and observations in arid and semi arid climates in northwest china shi 2020 and other regions cui et al 2017 mercer et al 2020 found that this method performed better than the traditional isotopic equilibrium assumption the stable isotopic ratios of precipitating vapor gibson and reid 2014 can be expressed as 4 δ pv δ p k ε 1 k ε where δ p is isotopic ratios in precipitation k is adjusting parameter and ε is equilibrium fractionation factor between water and vapor in decimal notation which is depended on temperature horita and wesolowski 1994 to identify k under a specific condition k is initially assigned as 1 and the slope of the local evaporation line can be expressed as 5 s lel h 10 3 18 ε h 2 δ pv 2 δ p 2 ε 1 10 3 2 δ p h 10 3 2 ε h 18 δ pv 18 δ p 18 ε 1 10 3 18 δ p where h is relative humidity δ pv and δ p are stable isotopic ratios in precipitating vapor and precipitation and ε is total fractionation factor skrzypek et al 2015 then this procedure can be repeated with different k values ranging from 0 6000 to 1 0000 and a step width 0 0001 is used here the k value at which the difference between s lel and the slope of actual local evaporation line reaches the minimum is identified as the optimum k value skrzypek et al 2015 this repeated procedure is automatically conducted in the software hydrocalculator version 1 03 and a similar procedure was applied in our previous study wang et al 2016a using the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios in surface water e g river lake and canal collected across the plain of the kaxgar yarkant oasis during the summer months of 2018 and 2019 fig 1a we determined a local evaporation line as δ 2h 5 6 δ 18o 12 0 r 2 0 94 p 0 01 n 59 and the arithmetic means and standard deviation of δ 2h and δ 18o are 75 9 13 4 and 11 4 2 3 respectively 2 3 3 advection vapor isotopes to acquire the isotopic ratio of the advection vapor at the target station an upwind station should be identified in this study the westernmost station wuqia is selected as the upwind station for other oasis stations which is generally based on the reanalysis derived back trajectories and moisture flux in summer months of the northwestern tarim basin wang et al 2016a shi et al 2021 yao et al 2021b usually if the heavy isotopes are depleted along the trajectory a rayleigh distillation is considered in determining the advected vapor isotopic ratio to the target station and a fraction of atmospheric water loadings between the upwind and target stations are needed peng et al 2011 if not the water vapor isotopic ratio in the upwind station can be directly used as the advected water vapor to the target station peng et al 2011 it is assumed that the isotopic composition of the vapor that is advected in the cloud is the same as the isotopic composition of the atmosphere during precipitation at the upwind station that is the isotopic composition of the whole vertical column of vapor is the same further it is assumed that the depletion of isotopes in the cloud due to rainout is negligible as in wang et al 2016a in this study there is no clear heavy isotope depletion in water vapor from wuqia to other downwind sampling stations and the wuqia precipitation has a high d excess which implies that it is not affected by sub cloud evaporation see section 3 1 1 in addition the higher elevation wuqia station usually has less moisture than the leeward oasis in the low lying basin hu et al 2015 yao et al 2016 which does not satisfy the basic assumption of rayleigh distillation so the estimated values in wuqia were then applied as the isotopic ratios in the advected vapor for the remaining six stations 2 3 4 transpiration vapor isotopes the isotopic ratios of transpiration vapor are difficult to measure in a vast area for many cases focusing on a simple ecosystem with homogeneous species the isotopic ratios in xylem water of plants are usually considered as an approximation of that in transpiration water vapor under an isotopic steady state williams et al 2004 many investigations in arid central asia dai et al 2015 chen et al 2017 wang et al 2018a guo and zhao 2021 found an obvious variability in stable isotopes in plant xylem on a seasonal or daily basis for an oasis with complex plant species and anthropogenic irrigation inputs there is no effective tool to judge the spatio temporal representability of collected plant samples and the widely applied cryogenic extraction for xylem water may also lead to a large uncertainty chen et al 2020 practically the isotope compositions of water from an evaporation front usually soil water surface water or replaced by the precipitation can be applied to estimate the isotope compositions of transpiration vapor zhao et al 2019 peng et al 2011 wang et al 2016a in arid central asia the local precipitation is too scarce to grow crops in the oasis and the irrigation water may be a significant contributor to transpiration li et al 2020 the irrigation from rivers and groundwater is expected to play a significant role in surface water availability both from surface water stores and from recently irrigated crops particularly those using flood irrigation like cotton and wheat which are the main crops in the region in this study the evaporation front water is assumed as a mixture of precipitation and irrigation water after evaporation although surface water samples were collected in this study the field studies zhao et al 2019 min et al 2019 dong et al 2020 guo and zhao 2021 showed that the stable isotope ratios of soil especially topsoil and xylem water are usually much higher than those of new irrigation water due to the strong evaporation occurring in an arid setting for this reason the surface water values should not be assumed to represent either the soil water storage at the evaporation front or the water used by the plant the stable isotope compositions in mixed source water before evaporation can be expressed as 6 δ m θ δ p 1 θ δ ir where δ p is isotope compositions of precipitation δ ir is isotope compositions of irrigation water the median of surface water at the nearest nine sites collected in this study and θ is ratio of precipitation to the sum of precipitation and irrigation water 7 θ p p i a where p is precipitation amount for each sampling station i is water use volume of agriculture and a is irrigation cropland area the data about water use and irrigation is acquired from local statistical yearbooks statistics bureau of xinjiang uygur autonomous region 2021 and an arithmetic mean from 2018 to 2020 is used in this study the isotope compositions in evaporation front water were estimated using isotope balance equation gibson et al 1999 with isotope compositions in collected surface water 8 δ fr δ δ δ m f m where δ m is isotope composition of front water before evaporation f is residual volume of water 0 75 as default and m welhan and fritz 1977 allison and leaney 1982 and δ gat 1981 are defined as 9 m h ε 1 h ε k 10 δ h δ pv ε h ε where h is relative humidity ε k is kinetic fractionation factor ε is total fractionation factors skrzypek et al 2015 and δ pv is isotopic ratio of ambient vapor here the residual volume of water is set as 0 75 which is generally consistent with isotope ranges in field observations e g guo and zhao 2021 and the average water use coefficient of cropland irrigation zhou et al 2013 2 3 5 surface evaporation vapor isotopes to estimate the stable isotopic ratios in surface evaporation vapor we assumed that the isotopic composition of the evaporation moisture is the same for the entire trajectory of the air mass from the upwind station to the local station as in peng et al 2011 and then a craig gordon model craig and gordon 1965 gat et al 1994 gat 1996 was applied as 11 δ ev δ fr α h δ pv ε 1 h ε k where δ fr is isotopic ratio of evaporation front δ pv is isotopic ratio of ambient vapor h is relative humidity α is temperature depended equilibrium fractionation factor horita and wesolowski 1994 ε k is kinetic fractionation factor and ε is total fractionation factors skrzypek et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 basic characteristics 3 1 1 temporal variability in precipitation stable isotopes for most stations across the plain of the kaxgar yarkant oasis table 2 the annual amount weighted mean precipitation δ 18o ranged from 5 94 kashi to 3 33 artux except bachu 1 46 with the lowest altitude as the only mountainous station in this study wuqia precipitation has a very low δ 18o value 6 48 compared to previous studies in central asia wang et al 2016a li et al 2019 yao et al 2021a the bachu precipitation in this study shows the highest weighted annual mean δ 18o for annual weighted mean δ 2h low lying bachu still has the highest value but the value in kashi is slightly lower than that in wuqia the δ 18o and δ 2h values in the study region are higher than most regions in china liu et al 2014 but are generally close to previously reported values for oases along the northwestern wang et al 2016b or southwestern liu et al 2014 margin of the tarim basin compared to the surrounding mountains in previous studies sun et al 2019 shi et al 2021 the low lying oasis stations usually have higher precipitation δ 18o and δ 2h the observed spatial distribution is generally consistent with previous spatial interpolation of precipitation isotopes isoscapes on a global bowen and revenaugh 2003 terzer wassmuth et al 2021 or national liu et al 2008 wang et al 2022 scale the precipitation isotopic ratios in the study region are underestimated in most isoscape products bowen and revenaugh 2003 liu et al 2008 terzer wassmuth et al 2021 because of the lack of precipitation isotope data from the past a recent nationwide isoscape product based on a regionalized fuzzy clustering wang et al 2022 shows an improvement of spatial pattern of precipitation isotopes in the study region we also provide the values of d excess 8δ 18o δ 2h in table 2 most stations have an annual mean d excess value lower than the global mean 10 except for the mountainous station wuqia 14 89 suggesting a stronger influence of below cloud evaporation in the low lying basin dansgaard 1964 the isotopic ratios showed expected seasonal variations during the sampling period with the heavy isotopes enriched in summer and depleted in winter table 2 and fig 3 the temporal variation of precipitation isotope ratios at each sampling station can be fitted by waveform trigonometric function fig 3 many positive values of δ 18o can be seen in summer months in fig 3 which is a typical characteristic of precipitation isotopes under an arid setting compared to the previous measurements in arid central asia wang et al 2016b li et al 2019 yao et al 2021a the study region has a high proportion of positive δ 18o values only a small number of samples can be found in the dry winter months fig 3 and the long term average monthly precipitation in winter ranges from 1 8 mm bachu to 7 9 mm wuqia fig 1b h the heavy isotope enriched summer months and depleted winter months are usually considered to be dominated by the westerly in central asia instead of the marine monsoon yao et al 2013 3 1 2 local meteoric water line using the event based samples collected in this study we determine the local meteoric water line lmwl fig 4 as 12 δ 2h 7 2δ 18o 1 5 r 2 0 94 p 0 01 n 435 compared to the global mean δ 2h 8δ 18o 10 the study region has a lower slope and intercept for the lmwl typical for arid sites which may experience significant below cloud evaporation for each sampling station table s1 the slope of the lmwl ranges between 6 6 artux and bachu and 7 7 shache which are lower than the global mean the slope of the lmwl is generally consistent with previous findings in arid central asia or arid northwest china ranging from 7 1 to 7 8 at 7 stations liu et al 2014 ranging from 6 3 to 8 3 at 23 stations wang et al 2018b the local meteoric water lines for summer and winter months are determined as 13 δ 2h 6 8δ 18o 2 5 r 2 0 90 p 0 01 n 353 summer 14 δ 2h 7 5δ 18o 1 1 r 2 0 96 p 0 01 n 82 winter the summer samples are usually distributed at the top right corner of the local meteoric water line fig 4 which is associated with the seasonality of moisture sources wang et al 2016a as well as the enhanced below cloud evaporation of raindrops wang et al 2021 the slope in summer months is lower than that in winter months also showing a strong below cloud evaporation in the warmer summer months groundwater stable isotope data collected in the kaxgar region in 2017 zeng et al 2021 lie in the same range as the surface water samples collected in this study fig 4 3 1 3 temperature and amount effects temperature effect of precipitation isotopes i e a positive correlation between isotopic ratio and air temperature is widely reported in the mid and high latitudes dansgaard 1964 zhang and wang 2016 according to the samples collected in this study we can determine a linear regression fig 5 a between stable oxygen isotopic ratio and air temperature as 15 δ 18o 0 61 t 11 17 r 2 0 44 p 0 01 n 435 where t is air temperature in c the equation 15 indicates a significant temperature effect in the study region the regression coefficients for each station table s2 range between 0 34 c akto and 1 34 c yopurga a previous study pang et al 2011 based on two stations in the tianshan mountains indicates a sectioned phenomenon of temperature effect i e the temperature effect is stronger below 0 c due to adiabatic cooling and is weaker above 0 c due to moisture recycling and below cloud evaporation however this is not the case for the kaxgar yarkant oasis in the tarim basin fig 5 if only the samples with temperature 0 c are considered the regression coefficient slightly increases δ 18o 0 77 t 14 00 r 2 0 34 p 0 01 n 401 if the remaining samples i e samples collected 0 c are regressed there is no statistically significant correlation δ 18o 0 30 t 15 21 r 2 0 02 p 0 40 n 34 in the study region the snowfall events are few and the amount for each event is small for example for the kashi n 13 and wuqia n 11 stations with relatively more samples collected below 0 c the arithmetic average amount is 0 5 and 1 5 mm per event respectively and small precipitation amount is usually sensitive to complex local air regimes although the below cloud evaporation logically increases the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios in raindrops the basic temporal characteristics and the temperature effect may remain wang et al 2021 and then the isotopic ratios in precipitation collected above 0 c or higher may still show a strong temperature effect in addition the leeward topography may also influence the adiabatic cooling and the rain shadow usually corresponds to the dry and warm leeward air which is not well described as adiabatic cooling in orographic or frontal precipitation besides the temperature effect the amount effect negative correlation between isotopic ratio and precipitation amount is also tested in the study region fig 5b for 435 event based samples the δ 18o value negatively correlates with precipitation amount p 0 01 although the determination coefficient is very low r 2 0 06 in our previous study across the tianshan mountains wang et al 2016b 3 of 23 stations also exhibited an amount effect with p 0 05 if we examine the determination coefficient for each station the r 2 values are between 0 01 and 0 16 generally there is no clear amount effect on a monthly basis 3 2 quantifying moisture recycling 3 2 1 recycling moisture ratio and amount we estimate the stable isotopic ratios in each component advection transpiration and surface evaporation in the mixing model fig 6 and table s3 taking the kashi station in summer months as an example the precipitation weighted isotopic ratios are 13 93 for δ 2h and 2 79 for δ 18o respectively the ambient air temperature and relative humidity during the precipitation events are acquired from the local meteorological station and then the isotopic ratios in precipitating vapor are calculated to be 59 50 for δ 2h and 8 44 for δ 18o respectively the precipitating vapor isotopic ratios 76 36 for δ 2h and 11 34 for δ 18o at the upwind station wuqia are also estimated using the local precipitation isotopes 27 78 for δ 2h and 5 39 for δ 18o because there is no isotopically depleting trend from the upwind station wuqia to the target station kashi the advection vapor in kashi is assumed to equal the precipitating vapor isotopic ratios in wuqia the isotopic ratios in local precipitation 13 93 for δ 2h and 2 79 for δ 18o and surface water 83 89 for δ 2h and 12 24 for δ 18o are used in the calculation of isotopic ratios in transpiration vapor 40 64 for δ 2h and 0 07 for δ 18o and surface evaporation vapor 166 15 for δ 2h and 37 34 for δ 18o as shown in fig 6 the precipitating vapor shows a range between 72 14 akto and 43 57 bachu for δ 2h and between 9 36 shache and 6 09 bachu for δ 18o using the bayesian mixing model we can determine the proportional contributions of the three components for each station and month and the 95 credible intervals shades and standard deviations error bars are also acquired fig 7 and table s4 generally the advection plays a dominant role in precipitation 60 for most stations except kashi and bachu and the contribution of surface evaporation is always much lower than the other two components the recycling ratio the sum of contribution of transpiration and surface evaporation ranges from 17 0 akto to 63 9 bachu the highest moisture recycling ratio occurs at eastern margin of kaxgar yarkant oasis fig 8 this result is higher than previous reports in oases across arid central asia e g wang et al 2016a kong et al 2013 li et al 2016b in a case of low lying oases along the northern slope of the tianshan mountains wang et al 2016a the contribution of transpiration and surface evaporation ranges from 5 9 to 16 2 and the small oases have a low recycling ratio along an elevation gradient for the northern slope of the tianshan mountains kong et al 2013 the high elevations usually have lower recycling ratio due to the low temperature the isotope based studies at the pamir plateau and western kunlun mountains sun et al 2019 indicated the mean recycling ratio is between 11 3 and 21 3 for different stations regarding the relative contribution of transpiration and surface evaporation for the oases in arid central asia previous in situ observations indicated that the transpiration is always much higher than that of surface evaporation e g yuan et al 2015 li et al 2016a for example in a cotton field in the tarim basin li et al 2016a the transpiration 30 7 mm accounted for 98 6 of the total evapotranspiration 31 1 mm in irrigation period in august for the sampling stations in this study the relative contributions of transpiration range from 88 8 akto to 95 8 bachu which indicates that the stable water isotope technique is an efficient tool to estimate relative proportion of transpiration and surface evaporation the moisture recycling is an important part in the terrestrial water cycle which is impacted by many local and large scale factors the temperature and relative humidity impact on moisture recycling and high temperature and low humidity is expected to lead to high evaporation and thus high recycling ratio peng et al 2011 zhao et al 2019 in this study the bachu station presents a relatively high recycling ratio that is related to the slightly higher temperature and lower relative humidity fig s1 which results in a higher contribution of evaporation vapor fig 8 however the local meteorological factors are not the only regime controlling the moisture recycling the water availability of the surface is another critical factor affecting surface evapotranspiration in an arid setting the pan evaporation amount is usually several times larger than the actual surface evaporation liu et al 2009 yao et al 2020 in this study the kashi station is located at the center of oases and irrigation system may increase the water availability for evapotranspiration for croplands but quantitative evaluations of soil moisture vegetation type and water area are still needed in future works although it is not easy to map the irrigation amount in detail the surface evapotranspiration is widely impacted by the water availability on the oasis surface delivered from the reservoirs and canals here we tested the sensitivity of proportional contributions of advection transpiration and surface evaporation with different isotopic composition of transpiration and surface evaporation inputs fig 9 and table s5 s12 four scenarios i e adding 1 0 adding 0 5 reducing 1 0 and reducing 0 5 to δ 18o are applied to water vapor in transpiration and surface evaporation in this study because the hydrogen isotope ratio in natural water usually shows positive correlation with oxygen isotope ratio we also modified the corresponding δ 2h values based on the linear regression equations between δ 2h and δ 18o among the three components fig 9 the proportional contribution of advection f adv is always larger than that of transpiration f tr and surface evaporation f ev whatever scenarios are applied except in the bachu station as the δ 18otr increases fig 9 a c the contributions of advection and surface evaporation generally show an increasing trend and the contribution of transpiration decreases larger δ 18otr corresponds to a larger contribution of advection and lower contribution of transpiration for δ 18oev fig 9 d f the impacts on the proportional contributions of advection and transpiration are relatively weak although there is a slightly increasing trend in f adv and decreasing trends in f tr and f ev as δ 18oev increases 3 2 2 strong moisture recycling at the leeward oasis the contribution of transpiration and surface evaporation from oases to local precipitation is a critical factor when discussing the recent wetting trend in central asia han et al 2017 yao et al 2020 xu and lin 2021 hua et al 2017 mapped the recycling ratio of china based on a climate reanalysis during the period 1979 2010 and found the southern xinjiang recycling ratio 25 was much larger than in surrounding arid regions like northern xinjiang 14 and eastern xinjiang 11 this indicated that the low lying southern xinjiang where the kaxgar yarkant oasis is located might be a region with strong moisture recycling it also should be noticed that the spatial details are smoothed due to the rough resolution of climate reanalysis in these assessments as shown in table s13 several central asian oases were examined for moisture recycling using stable water isotopes in past decade most of these studies are based on a three component assumption wang et al 2016a li et al 2016b zhao et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 that the precipitating moisture is a mixture of advection surface evaporation and transpiration and in contrast the two component assumption kong et al 2013 removed the contribution of transpiration which may underestimate the recycling ratio the uncertainty of these isotopic mixing models comes from many specific assumptions and parameter choices such as the selection of upwind station and the single prevailing wind setting wang et al 2016a hua et al 2017 which may reduce the comparability between different cases in these assessments in table s13 the recycling ratio ranged from 3 to 57 with an arithmetic mean of 24 and most were between 14 and 33 compared with previous cases across china zhang and wang 2016 the oases in arid central asia are not regions with a low moisture recycling ratio the contribution of transpiration is usually much larger than that of surface evaporation except one case at the desert and oasis ecotone which is also different from a very close station at the gobi desert zhao et al 2019 although it seems the moisture recycling ratio in the study region seems is not low the actual contribution to precipitation amount is still very small usually less than 20 mm in summer months because most precipitation occurs in the summer months fig 1 the annual amount of the recycled moisture cannot be larger than 30 mm in most cases a significant wetting trend has been widely evidenced in the study region and northwestern china yao et al 2020 considering the expansion of artificial oases and improvements in irrigation systems in recent decades cai et al 2019 enhanced transpiration and surface evaporation may play an important role in the regional precipitation increase in addition xerophyte growth is highly sensitive to precipitation in a water scarce environment therefore even a small increase in precipitation may greatly affect the local vegetation xu and lin 2021 if the recycling ratio continues to increase as described in yao et al 2020 i e 0 44 or 0 53 per decade from 1961 to 2010 the recycled moisture increasingly impacts arid ecosystems however as predicted using current wetting trend the increased amount derived from transpiration and surface evaporation is still small in this arid climate 4 conclusions the contribution of locally recycled moisture to precipitation cannot be ignored in the oasis ecosystem of central asia but there are few isotope based quantitative assessments of recycling ratio for extremely arid conditions here we focused on a typical leeward oasis the kaxgar yarkant oasis and estimated the contribution of recycled moisture there are great spatial variations in recycling ratio across arid central asia and most stations in this leeward oasis shows a strong moisture recycling during the summer months the average recycling ratio ranged between 17 0 and 63 9 for each sampling station and the ratio from transpiration is much larger than that of surface evaporation in addition the bayesian isotopic mixing model is promising in quantifying moisture recycling considering the low precipitation rates in the arid inland and the enlarged oasis area the recycled portion of total precipitation amount may enhance the wetting trend observed in past decades however the precipitation contributed by moisture recycling does not change the regional arid climate the finding is useful to understand the potential contribution of artificial oasis as well as anthropogenic activities to water processes in an arid climate data availability data will be made available on request credit authorship

2858,locally recycled moisture from transpiration and surface evaporation is of great importance in the terrestrial hydrological cycle especially in the widely distributed oases across arid central asia quantitative assessment of the proportional contribution of recycled moisture to local precipitation i e the recycling ratio is useful to understand the land air interaction as well as the anthropogenic impact on the regional water cycle here we analyzed the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in precipitation samples collected at six stations across the kaxgar yarkant oasis in the western tarim basin of central asia from april 2018 to june 2020 using this data the moisture recycling ratio in this typical oasis was assessed using a bayesian three component isotopic mixing model for the plain stations the annual weighted mean δ 18o value in precipitation ranged from 5 94 to 1 46 and the mountain station has a lower annual mean precipitation isotopic ratio the average recycling ratio during the summer months ranged between 17 0 and 63 9 for each sampling station in the kaxgar yarkant oasis and the proportional contribution from transpiration ranged from 15 1 to 61 3 the contribution of plant transpiration to local precipitation is much larger than that of surface evaporation the recycled portion in total precipitation amount may increase the local precipitation under an oasis expansion background but is insufficient to change the arid background in addition the bayesian isotopic mixing model is promising to determine the recycling ratio in an arid setting and provides more spatial details than the climate reanalysis based calculation keywords precipitation stable isotope moisture recycling oasis arid central asia data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction moisture recycling refers to the hydrological process when evaporated and transpired water from the terrestrial surface returns to the land which plays an important role in the terrestrial water cycle van der ent et al 2014 tuinenburg et al 2020 quantitative assessment of the proportional contribution of recycled moisture to local precipitation also known as the moisture recycling ratio is helpful to understand the land atmosphere interaction in the context of a warming climate and to understand the impact of human activities on water limited regions trenberth 1999 te wierik et al 2021 in arid central asia many densely populated oases are distributed along the piedmont plain the annual mean precipitation is low and water resource availability is always a contentious issue for regional sustainability siegfried et al 2012 in arid regions under a warming climate we may see recycling contributing an increasing fraction to atmospheric moisture hua et al 2016 yao et al 2020 the recycling ratio varies geographically associated with climate conditions and underlying land surface vegetation in arid central asia the contribution of recycled moisture in the oases is much larger than that in the nearby vegetation free deserts yang et al 2019 using gridded data of atmospheric specific humidity wind field and other meteorological parameters the recycling ratio can be determined and mapped on a global or regional scale including in central asia eltahir and bras 1996 trenberth 1999 however in most existing assessments of recycling ratio the spatial resolution of climate input is too course relative to the dramatic variation in land cover e g for interlaced oases and deserts sometimes even the theoretically high spatial divergence of recycling ratio for mountain ranges e g the tianshan mountains is highly smoothed in maps hua et al 2016 wu et al 2019b as physical tracers the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in water are effective tools to assess hydrological processes including moisture recycling van der ent et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 case studies based on stable water isotopes have been conducted applying isotopic mixing models in oases under an arid and semi arid setting zhang and wang 2016 the basic assumption of these models is that the stable isotopic compositions of precipitating vapor are a mixture of those from advected vapor and locally recycled vapor the isotopic ratio of recycled vapor can be estimated using that of the surface evaporation vapor e g kong et al 2013 sun et al 2019 2020 wu et al 2019a or a combination of transpiration and surface evaporation vapor e g wang et al 2016a zhao et al 2019 li et al 2019 gui et al 2022 when the stable water isotopes in each flux of the two component advection and surface evaporation or three component advection transpiration and surface evaporation vapor combination at the target stations are available either measured or estimated the proportional contribution of recycled moisture to local precipitation vapor can be mathematically determined using isotopic mixing models phillips and gregg 2001 peng et al 2011 in the isotope based mixing model multiple linear regression can be applied to estimate the relationship between independent variables i e isotopic ratio in each contributing vapor and one dependent variable i e isotopic ratio in precipitating vapor genereux 1998 to determine model uncertainty more complex algorithms are involved in solving the equations for which software solutions are available phillips and gregg 2001 parnell et al 2013 stock et al 2018 for example wang et al 2016a used the software isoerror phillips and gregg 2001 to determine the confidence intervals and standard deviation of the determined contribution for each contributing component in the isotope mixing model and then this software was applied to understand the model uncertainty in many other later studies zhao et al 2019 sometimes unrealistic solutions i e 0 or 100 may occur in the isotopic mixing model which can be seen in recent arid and semi arid regions zhao et al 2019 qiu et al 2021 for example zhao et al 2019 determined a negative contribution 13 5 or 18 7 of transpiration at an arid riparian forest but did not find an optimal algorithm to resolve this problem in the past decade bayesian techniques have been applied in many fields of earth and environmental science and are considered to be an improved method for determining a multiple mixing model parnell et al 2013 qiu et al 2021 compared the traditional linear regression algorithm using isoerror to the bayesian algorithm using r based program mixsiar stock et al 2018 and found the bayesian algorithm shows more suitable solutions in calculating moisture recycling ratio in a semi arid region more case studies using the bayesian stable isotopic mixing method are still needed in quantifying recycling ratio especially for arid settings the tarim basin is a vast low lying area in central asia surrounded by the tianshan mountains on the north the pamir plateau on the west and the qinghai tibet plateau on the south fig 1 the low lying plain is approximately 530 000 km2 and the drainage area of the tarim river is up to 1 020 000 km2 chen 2010 because of the rain shadow effect and the long distance to the oceans the tarim basin has a very arid climate and the mean precipitation amount is just 66 mm per year shi et al 2008 although several isotope based moisture recycling studies have been conducted in central asia the low lying tarim basin is still not well assessed in a climate reanalysis based assessment wu et al 2019b the tarim basin shows a much larger recycling ratio compared to the junggar basin to the north or the hexi corridor to the east especially in summer a nationwide investigation in china hua et al 2017 calculated the mean recycling ratios for 14 terrestrial sub regions during 1979 2010 and found a high regional mean 25 in the tarim basin which is almost twice of that in the rest of arid northwest china however isotope based case studies indicated a high recycling ratio 29 to 42 at the coast and low values 3 to 16 across inland china zhang and wang 2016 the finding of a high recycling ratio in the tarim basin derived from climate grids has not been verified using an isotope based method and a systemic isotopic observation of precipitation in the tarim basin may be helpful to understand the spatial divergence to understand the moisture recycling across the oasis with strong evapotranspiration in the extreme arid region we collected precipitation samples across the kaxgar yarkant oasis a leeward oasis region located in the western tarim basin central asia from 2018 to 2020 and analyzed the characteristics of precipitation isotopes for the study region the proportional contributions from advection transpiration and surface evaporation to local precipitation are determined using a bayesian three component isotopic mixing model and the influencing factors of moisture recycling are discussed 2 data and methods 2 1 sampling network and collection the kaxgar yarkant oasis is located in the northwestern part of the tarim basin in southern xinjiang central asia fig 1 the oasis is leeward of the tianshan mountains to the north and pamirs plateau to the west many inland streams and rivers like the kaxgar and yarkant rivers originate from the western high altitude mountain ranges and flow into the taklimakan desert in the tarim basin in arid central asia the airflow is dominated by the mid latitude westerlies instead of the monsoon the kaxgar yarkant oasis plain with altitudes between 1100 and 1400 m above sea level has an annual mean air temperature between 11 and 13 c and annual mean precipitation amount between 40 and 90 mm fig 1b g shen et al 2001 the surrounding mountain ranges usually have a lower air temperature and larger precipitation amount fig 1h based on the monthly air temperature we can roughly divide each year into the warm summer months from may to september and cold winter months from october to april when quantifying the oasis moisture recycling we focus on the summer months fig 1b h while the low air temperature and limited precipitation amount in the other months usually result in weak evapotranspiration jian et al 2018 we selected seven national meteorological stations across the kaxgar yarkant oasis to collect event based precipitation samples from 2018 to 2020 table 1 most stations are located on the plain with elevation ranging from 1117 m bachu to 1386 m kashi the wuqia station is an alpine station of the southern tianshan mountains with an altitude of 2176 m the sampling was conducted by the full time weather observers of these national meteorological stations for each station the samples were immediately collected after the end of precipitation events to eliminate the effect of sample evaporation all the precipitation samples were kept in 50 ml high density polyethylene hdpe narrow mouthed bottles with waterproof seals although the snow and hail samples were firstly melted at room temperature in a zip lock bag similar sampling procedures have been applied in our previous work wang et al 2016b the meteorological data of air temperature precipitation amount and relative humidity during the sampling period was provided by the corresponding meteorological stations during the sampling period 435 precipitation samples were collected table 1 the mountainous station wuqia had the largest sample number n 101 and the bachu station had only 33 precipitation samples the samples collected in wuqia during may 2018 to march 2019 n 51 were previously analyzed by shi et al 2021 2 2 laboratory analysis the precipitation samples were analyzed for stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes using a liquid water isotope analyzer t lwia 45 ep abb los gatos research ca usa in the stable isotope laboratory northwest normal university lanzhou china considering the memory effect all the liquid water samples were injected to the analyzer sequentially six times and the first two measurements were directly discarded and then the remaining four measurements were averaged as the final output using the lwia post analysis software abb los gatos research ca usa wang et al 2016b three reference standards were included in a run which were selected from the abb los gatos research commercial working standards lgr 1e δ 2h 165 7 δ 18o 21 28 2e δ 2h 123 8 δ 18o 16 71 3e δ 2h 79 6 δ

sample r reference 1 1000 where r sample is the ratio of 2h 1h or 18o 16o in sample and r reference is the ratio of 2h 1h or 18o 16o in v smow the precision in this study is 0 6 for δ 2h and 0 2 for δ 18o respectively 2 3 bayesian isotopic mixing model 2 3 1 basic framework the water vapor to form precipitation or precipitating vapor generally is sourced from three main parts the advection from outer atmospheric systems the surface transpiration through aerial parts of plants i e leaves stems and flowers and the surface physical evaporation i e evaporation from intercepted moisture soil moisture and inland waters van der ent et al 2014 good et al 2015 to determine the fractional contribution of these three components to the precipitation amount an assumption is that the in cloud processes occur under equilibrium conditions and the fractional contribution of the precipitation is similar to the fractional contribution of the condensing vapor peng et al 2011 van der ent et al 2014 when the stable isotopic ratios in the three potential sources and the mixed precipitating vapor are known measured or estimated the basic framework of three component mixing model is expressed as 2 δ pv f adv δ adv f tr δ tr f ev δ ev 3 f adv f tr f ev 1 where f adv f tr and f ev are proportional contributions of advection plant transpiration and surface evaporation to local precipitation respectively and isotope values of δ pv δ adv δ tr and δ ev are δ 18o or δ 2h in precipitating vapor advection vapor transpiration vapor and surface evaporation vapor respectively fig 2 logically the sum of proportional contributions from the three components is 100 to obtain a solution for the equations an open source r package mixsiar bayesian mixing model in r version 3 1 12 is used in this study the bayesian method gives probabilistic predictions of the fractional contribution from the three components and is considered to be better than the standard deterministic model in determining the fractional contribution using isotope tracers evaristo et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 in spite of many case studies in isotope ecology penna et al 2018 only a few recent cases qiu et al 2021 used the isotope based bayesian method in quantifying moisture recycling in precipitation stock et al 2018 and moore and semmens 2008 provide the details of mixsiar model framework the results can be expressed as the mean median standard deviation and credible intervals are also provided for the markov chain monte carlo mcmc parameter in mixsiar the number of chains is set as 3 and the chain length is set as normal chain length 100000 burn 50000 and thin 50 convergence was tested using the gelman rubin and geweke diagnostics in mixsiar 2 3 2 precipitating vapor isotopes the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition in precipitating vapor can be estimated using that in the precipitation collected at the surface as well as the corresponding meteorological data here a local evaporation line adjusted method bennett et al 2008 gibson and reid 2014 without isotopic equilibrium assumption is applied using the hydrocalculator software version 1 03 skrzypek et al 2015 hydrocalculator was developed and tested using data from a semi arid site in northwest australia and observations in arid and semi arid climates in northwest china shi 2020 and other regions cui et al 2017 mercer et al 2020 found that this method performed better than the traditional isotopic equilibrium assumption the stable isotopic ratios of precipitating vapor gibson and reid 2014 can be expressed as 4 δ pv δ p k ε 1 k ε where δ p is isotopic ratios in precipitation k is adjusting parameter and ε is equilibrium fractionation factor between water and vapor in decimal notation which is depended on temperature horita and wesolowski 1994 to identify k under a specific condition k is initially assigned as 1 and the slope of the local evaporation line can be expressed as 5 s lel h 10 3 18 ε h 2 δ pv 2 δ p 2 ε 1 10 3 2 δ p h 10 3 2 ε h 18 δ pv 18 δ p 18 ε 1 10 3 18 δ p where h is relative humidity δ pv and δ p are stable isotopic ratios in precipitating vapor and precipitation and ε is total fractionation factor skrzypek et al 2015 then this procedure can be repeated with different k values ranging from 0 6000 to 1 0000 and a step width 0 0001 is used here the k value at which the difference between s lel and the slope of actual local evaporation line reaches the minimum is identified as the optimum k value skrzypek et al 2015 this repeated procedure is automatically conducted in the software hydrocalculator version 1 03 and a similar procedure was applied in our previous study wang et al 2016a using the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios in surface water e g river lake and canal collected across the plain of the kaxgar yarkant oasis during the summer months of 2018 and 2019 fig 1a we determined a local evaporation line as δ 2h 5 6 δ 18o 12 0 r 2 0 94 p 0 01 n 59 and the arithmetic means and standard deviation of δ 2h and δ 18o are 75 9 13 4 and 11 4 2 3 respectively 2 3 3 advection vapor isotopes to acquire the isotopic ratio of the advection vapor at the target station an upwind station should be identified in this study the westernmost station wuqia is selected as the upwind station for other oasis stations which is generally based on the reanalysis derived back trajectories and moisture flux in summer months of the northwestern tarim basin wang et al 2016a shi et al 2021 yao et al 2021b usually if the heavy isotopes are depleted along the trajectory a rayleigh distillation is considered in determining the advected vapor isotopic ratio to the target station and a fraction of atmospheric water loadings between the upwind and target stations are needed peng et al 2011 if not the water vapor isotopic ratio in the upwind station can be directly used as the advected water vapor to the target station peng et al 2011 it is assumed that the isotopic composition of the vapor that is advected in the cloud is the same as the isotopic composition of the atmosphere during precipitation at the upwind station that is the isotopic composition of the whole vertical column of vapor is the same further it is assumed that the depletion of isotopes in the cloud due to rainout is negligible as in wang et al 2016a in this study there is no clear heavy isotope depletion in water vapor from wuqia to other downwind sampling stations and the wuqia precipitation has a high d excess which implies that it is not affected by sub cloud evaporation see section 3 1 1 in addition the higher elevation wuqia station usually has less moisture than the leeward oasis in the low lying basin hu et al 2015 yao et al 2016 which does not satisfy the basic assumption of rayleigh distillation so the estimated values in wuqia were then applied as the isotopic ratios in the advected vapor for the remaining six stations 2 3 4 transpiration vapor isotopes the isotopic ratios of transpiration vapor are difficult to measure in a vast area for many cases focusing on a simple ecosystem with homogeneous species the isotopic ratios in xylem water of plants are usually considered as an approximation of that in transpiration water vapor under an isotopic steady state williams et al 2004 many investigations in arid central asia dai et al 2015 chen et al 2017 wang et al 2018a guo and zhao 2021 found an obvious variability in stable isotopes in plant xylem on a seasonal or daily basis for an oasis with complex plant species and anthropogenic irrigation inputs there is no effective tool to judge the spatio temporal representability of collected plant samples and the widely applied cryogenic extraction for xylem water may also lead to a large uncertainty chen et al 2020 practically the isotope compositions of water from an evaporation front usually soil water surface water or replaced by the precipitation can be applied to estimate the isotope compositions of transpiration vapor zhao et al 2019 peng et al 2011 wang et al 2016a in arid central asia the local precipitation is too scarce to grow crops in the oasis and the irrigation water may be a significant contributor to transpiration li et al 2020 the irrigation from rivers and groundwater is expected to play a significant role in surface water availability both from surface water stores and from recently irrigated crops particularly those using flood irrigation like cotton and wheat which are the main crops in the region in this study the evaporation front water is assumed as a mixture of precipitation and irrigation water after evaporation although surface water samples were collected in this study the field studies zhao et al 2019 min et al 2019 dong et al 2020 guo and zhao 2021 showed that the stable isotope ratios of soil especially topsoil and xylem water are usually much higher than those of new irrigation water due to the strong evaporation occurring in an arid setting for this reason the surface water values should not be assumed to represent either the soil water storage at the evaporation front or the water used by the plant the stable isotope compositions in mixed source water before evaporation can be expressed as 6 δ m θ δ p 1 θ δ ir where δ p is isotope compositions of precipitation δ ir is isotope compositions of irrigation water the median of surface water at the nearest nine sites collected in this study and θ is ratio of precipitation to the sum of precipitation and irrigation water 7 θ p p i a where p is precipitation amount for each sampling station i is water use volume of agriculture and a is irrigation cropland area the data about water use and irrigation is acquired from local statistical yearbooks statistics bureau of xinjiang uygur autonomous region 2021 and an arithmetic mean from 2018 to 2020 is used in this study the isotope compositions in evaporation front water were estimated using isotope balance equation gibson et al 1999 with isotope compositions in collected surface water 8 δ fr δ δ δ m f m where δ m is isotope composition of front water before evaporation f is residual volume of water 0 75 as default and m welhan and fritz 1977 allison and leaney 1982 and δ gat 1981 are defined as 9 m h ε 1 h ε k 10 δ h δ pv ε h ε where h is relative humidity ε k is kinetic fractionation factor ε is total fractionation factors skrzypek et al 2015 and δ pv is isotopic ratio of ambient vapor here the residual volume of water is set as 0 75 which is generally consistent with isotope ranges in field observations e g guo and zhao 2021 and the average water use coefficient of cropland irrigation zhou et al 2013 2 3 5 surface evaporation vapor isotopes to estimate the stable isotopic ratios in surface evaporation vapor we assumed that the isotopic composition of the evaporation moisture is the same for the entire trajectory of the air mass from the upwind station to the local station as in peng et al 2011 and then a craig gordon model craig and gordon 1965 gat et al 1994 gat 1996 was applied as 11 δ ev δ fr α h δ pv ε 1 h ε k where δ fr is isotopic ratio of evaporation front δ pv is isotopic ratio of ambient vapor h is relative humidity α is temperature depended equilibrium fractionation factor horita and wesolowski 1994 ε k is kinetic fractionation factor and ε is total fractionation factors skrzypek et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 basic characteristics 3 1 1 temporal variability in precipitation stable isotopes for most stations across the plain of the kaxgar yarkant oasis table 2 the annual amount weighted mean precipitation δ 18o ranged from 5 94 kashi to 3 33 artux except bachu 1 46 with the lowest altitude as the only mountainous station in this study wuqia precipitation has a very low δ 18o value 6 48 compared to previous studies in central asia wang et al 2016a li et al 2019 yao et al 2021a the bachu precipitation in this study shows the highest weighted annual mean δ 18o for annual weighted mean δ 2h low lying bachu still has the highest value but the value in kashi is slightly lower than that in wuqia the δ 18o and δ 2h values in the study region are higher than most regions in china liu et al 2014 but are generally close to previously reported values for oases along the northwestern wang et al 2016b or southwestern liu et al 2014 margin of the tarim basin compared to the surrounding mountains in previous studies sun et al 2019 shi et al 2021 the low lying oasis stations usually have higher precipitation δ 18o and δ 2h the observed spatial distribution is generally consistent with previous spatial interpolation of precipitation isotopes isoscapes on a global bowen and revenaugh 2003 terzer wassmuth et al 2021 or national liu et al 2008 wang et al 2022 scale the precipitation isotopic ratios in the study region are underestimated in most isoscape products bowen and revenaugh 2003 liu et al 2008 terzer wassmuth et al 2021 because of the lack of precipitation isotope data from the past a recent nationwide isoscape product based on a regionalized fuzzy clustering wang et al 2022 shows an improvement of spatial pattern of precipitation isotopes in the study region we also provide the values of d excess 8δ 18o δ 2h in table 2 most stations have an annual mean d excess value lower than the global mean 10 except for the mountainous station wuqia 14 89 suggesting a stronger influence of below cloud evaporation in the low lying basin dansgaard 1964 the isotopic ratios showed expected seasonal variations during the sampling period with the heavy isotopes enriched in summer and depleted in winter table 2 and fig 3 the temporal variation of precipitation isotope ratios at each sampling station can be fitted by waveform trigonometric function fig 3 many positive values of δ 18o can be seen in summer months in fig 3 which is a typical characteristic of precipitation isotopes under an arid setting compared to the previous measurements in arid central asia wang et al 2016b li et al 2019 yao et al 2021a the study region has a high proportion of positive δ 18o values only a small number of samples can be found in the dry winter months fig 3 and the long term average monthly precipitation in winter ranges from 1 8 mm bachu to 7 9 mm wuqia fig 1b h the heavy isotope enriched summer months and depleted winter months are usually considered to be dominated by the westerly in central asia instead of the marine monsoon yao et al 2013 3 1 2 local meteoric water line using the event based samples collected in this study we determine the local meteoric water line lmwl fig 4 as 12 δ 2h 7 2δ 18o 1 5 r 2 0 94 p 0 01 n 435 compared to the global mean δ 2h 8δ 18o 10 the study region has a lower slope and intercept for the lmwl typical for arid sites which may experience significant below cloud evaporation for each sampling station table s1 the slope of the lmwl ranges between 6 6 artux and bachu and 7 7 shache which are lower than the global mean the slope of the lmwl is generally consistent with previous findings in arid central asia or arid northwest china ranging from 7 1 to 7 8 at 7 stations liu et al 2014 ranging from 6 3 to 8 3 at 23 stations wang et al 2018b the local meteoric water lines for summer and winter months are determined as 13 δ 2h 6 8δ 18o 2 5 r 2 0 90 p 0 01 n 353 summer 14 δ 2h 7 5δ 18o 1 1 r 2 0 96 p 0 01 n 82 winter the summer samples are usually distributed at the top right corner of the local meteoric water line fig 4 which is associated with the seasonality of moisture sources wang et al 2016a as well as the enhanced below cloud evaporation of raindrops wang et al 2021 the slope in summer months is lower than that in winter months also showing a strong below cloud evaporation in the warmer summer months groundwater stable isotope data collected in the kaxgar region in 2017 zeng et al 2021 lie in the same range as the surface water samples collected in this study fig 4 3 1 3 temperature and amount effects temperature effect of precipitation isotopes i e a positive correlation between isotopic ratio and air temperature is widely reported in the mid and high latitudes dansgaard 1964 zhang and wang 2016 according to the samples collected in this study we can determine a linear regression fig 5 a between stable oxygen isotopic ratio and air temperature as 15 δ 18o 0 61 t 11 17 r 2 0 44 p 0 01 n 435 where t is air temperature in c the equation 15 indicates a significant temperature effect in the study region the regression coefficients for each station table s2 range between 0 34 c akto and 1 34 c yopurga a previous study pang et al 2011 based on two stations in the tianshan mountains indicates a sectioned phenomenon of temperature effect i e the temperature effect is stronger below 0 c due to adiabatic cooling and is weaker above 0 c due to moisture recycling and below cloud evaporation however this is not the case for the kaxgar yarkant oasis in the tarim basin fig 5 if only the samples with temperature 0 c are considered the regression coefficient slightly increases δ 18o 0 77 t 14 00 r 2 0 34 p 0 01 n 401 if the remaining samples i e samples collected 0 c are regressed there is no statistically significant correlation δ 18o 0 30 t 15 21 r 2 0 02 p 0 40 n 34 in the study region the snowfall events are few and the amount for each event is small for example for the kashi n 13 and wuqia n 11 stations with relatively more samples collected below 0 c the arithmetic average amount is 0 5 and 1 5 mm per event respectively and small precipitation amount is usually sensitive to complex local air regimes although the below cloud evaporation logically increases the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios in raindrops the basic temporal characteristics and the temperature effect may remain wang et al 2021 and then the isotopic ratios in precipitation collected above 0 c or higher may still show a strong temperature effect in addition the leeward topography may also influence the adiabatic cooling and the rain shadow usually corresponds to the dry and warm leeward air which is not well described as adiabatic cooling in orographic or frontal precipitation besides the temperature effect the amount effect negative correlation between isotopic ratio and precipitation amount is also tested in the study region fig 5b for 435 event based samples the δ 18o value negatively correlates with precipitation amount p 0 01 although the determination coefficient is very low r 2 0 06 in our previous study across the tianshan mountains wang et al 2016b 3 of 23 stations also exhibited an amount effect with p 0 05 if we examine the determination coefficient for each station the r 2 values are between 0 01 and 0 16 generally there is no clear amount effect on a monthly basis 3 2 quantifying moisture recycling 3 2 1 recycling moisture ratio and amount we estimate the stable isotopic ratios in each component advection transpiration and surface evaporation in the mixing model fig 6 and table s3 taking the kashi station in summer months as an example the precipitation weighted isotopic ratios are 13 93 for δ 2h and 2 79 for δ 18o respectively the ambient air temperature and relative humidity during the precipitation events are acquired from the local meteorological station and then the isotopic ratios in precipitating vapor are calculated to be 59 50 for δ 2h and 8 44 for δ 18o respectively the precipitating vapor isotopic ratios 76 36 for δ 2h and 11 34 for δ 18o at the upwind station wuqia are also estimated using the local precipitation isotopes 27 78 for δ 2h and 5 39 for δ 18o because there is no isotopically depleting trend from the upwind station wuqia to the target station kashi the advection vapor in kashi is assumed to equal the precipitating vapor isotopic ratios in wuqia the isotopic ratios in local precipitation 13 93 for δ 2h and 2 79 for δ 18o and surface water 83 89 for δ 2h and 12 24 for δ 18o are used in the calculation of isotopic ratios in transpiration vapor 40 64 for δ 2h and 0 07 for δ 18o and surface evaporation vapor 166 15 for δ 2h and 37 34 for δ 18o as shown in fig 6 the precipitating vapor shows a range between 72 14 akto and 43 57 bachu for δ 2h and between 9 36 shache and 6 09 bachu for δ 18o using the bayesian mixing model we can determine the proportional contributions of the three components for each station and month and the 95 credible intervals shades and standard deviations error bars are also acquired fig 7 and table s4 generally the advection plays a dominant role in precipitation 60 for most stations except kashi and bachu and the contribution of surface evaporation is always much lower than the other two components the recycling ratio the sum of contribution of transpiration and surface evaporation ranges from 17 0 akto to 63 9 bachu the highest moisture recycling ratio occurs at eastern margin of kaxgar yarkant oasis fig 8 this result is higher than previous reports in oases across arid central asia e g wang et al 2016a kong et al 2013 li et al 2016b in a case of low lying oases along the northern slope of the tianshan mountains wang et al 2016a the contribution of transpiration and surface evaporation ranges from 5 9 to 16 2 and the small oases have a low recycling ratio along an elevation gradient for the northern slope of the tianshan mountains kong et al 2013 the high elevations usually have lower recycling ratio due to the low temperature the isotope based studies at the pamir plateau and western kunlun mountains sun et al 2019 indicated the mean recycling ratio is between 11 3 and 21 3 for different stations regarding the relative contribution of transpiration and surface evaporation for the oases in arid central asia previous in situ observations indicated that the transpiration is always much higher than that of surface evaporation e g yuan et al 2015 li et al 2016a for example in a cotton field in the tarim basin li et al 2016a the transpiration 30 7 mm accounted for 98 6 of the total evapotranspiration 31 1 mm in irrigation period in august for the sampling stations in this study the relative contributions of transpiration range from 88 8 akto to 95 8 bachu which indicates that the stable water isotope technique is an efficient tool to estimate relative proportion of transpiration and surface evaporation the moisture recycling is an important part in the terrestrial water cycle which is impacted by many local and large scale factors the temperature and relative humidity impact on moisture recycling and high temperature and low humidity is expected to lead to high evaporation and thus high recycling ratio peng et al 2011 zhao et al 2019 in this study the bachu station presents a relatively high recycling ratio that is related to the slightly higher temperature and lower relative humidity fig s1 which results in a higher contribution of evaporation vapor fig 8 however the local meteorological factors are not the only regime controlling the moisture recycling the water availability of the surface is another critical factor affecting surface evapotranspiration in an arid setting the pan evaporation amount is usually several times larger than the actual surface evaporation liu et al 2009 yao et al 2020 in this study the kashi station is located at the center of oases and irrigation system may increase the water availability for evapotranspiration for croplands but quantitative evaluations of soil moisture vegetation type and water area are still needed in future works although it is not easy to map the irrigation amount in detail the surface evapotranspiration is widely impacted by the water availability on the oasis surface delivered from the reservoirs and canals here we tested the sensitivity of proportional contributions of advection transpiration and surface evaporation with different isotopic composition of transpiration and surface evaporation inputs fig 9 and table s5 s12 four scenarios i e adding 1 0 adding 0 5 reducing 1 0 and reducing 0 5 to δ 18o are applied to water vapor in transpiration and surface evaporation in this study because the hydrogen isotope ratio in natural water usually shows positive correlation with oxygen isotope ratio we also modified the corresponding δ 2h values based on the linear regression equations between δ 2h and δ 18o among the three components fig 9 the proportional contribution of advection f adv is always larger than that of transpiration f tr and surface evaporation f ev whatever scenarios are applied except in the bachu station as the δ 18otr increases fig 9 a c the contributions of advection and surface evaporation generally show an increasing trend and the contribution of transpiration decreases larger δ 18otr corresponds to a larger contribution of advection and lower contribution of transpiration for δ 18oev fig 9 d f the impacts on the proportional contributions of advection and transpiration are relatively weak although there is a slightly increasing trend in f adv and decreasing trends in f tr and f ev as δ 18oev increases 3 2 2 strong moisture recycling at the leeward oasis the contribution of transpiration and surface evaporation from oases to local precipitation is a critical factor when discussing the recent wetting trend in central asia han et al 2017 yao et al 2020 xu and lin 2021 hua et al 2017 mapped the recycling ratio of china based on a climate reanalysis during the period 1979 2010 and found the southern xinjiang recycling ratio 25 was much larger than in surrounding arid regions like northern xinjiang 14 and eastern xinjiang 11 this indicated that the low lying southern xinjiang where the kaxgar yarkant oasis is located might be a region with strong moisture recycling it also should be noticed that the spatial details are smoothed due to the rough resolution of climate reanalysis in these assessments as shown in table s13 several central asian oases were examined for moisture recycling using stable water isotopes in past decade most of these studies are based on a three component assumption wang et al 2016a li et al 2016b zhao et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 that the precipitating moisture is a mixture of advection surface evaporation and transpiration and in contrast the two component assumption kong et al 2013 removed the contribution of transpiration which may underestimate the recycling ratio the uncertainty of these isotopic mixing models comes from many specific assumptions and parameter choices such as the selection of upwind station and the single prevailing wind setting wang et al 2016a hua et al 2017 which may reduce the comparability between different cases in these assessments in table s13 the recycling ratio ranged from 3 to 57 with an arithmetic mean of 24 and most were between 14 and 33 compared with previous cases across china zhang and wang 2016 the oases in arid central asia are not regions with a low moisture recycling ratio the contribution of transpiration is usually much larger than that of surface evaporation except one case at the desert and oasis ecotone which is also different from a very close station at the gobi desert zhao et al 2019 although it seems the moisture recycling ratio in the study region seems is not low the actual contribution to precipitation amount is still very small usually less than 20 mm in summer months because most precipitation occurs in the summer months fig 1 the annual amount of the recycled moisture cannot be larger than 30 mm in most cases a significant wetting trend has been widely evidenced in the study region and northwestern china yao et al 2020 considering the expansion of artificial oases and improvements in irrigation systems in recent decades cai et al 2019 enhanced transpiration and surface evaporation may play an important role in the regional precipitation increase in addition xerophyte growth is highly sensitive to precipitation in a water scarce environment therefore even a small increase in precipitation may greatly affect the local vegetation xu and lin 2021 if the recycling ratio continues to increase as described in yao et al 2020 i e 0 44 or 0 53 per decade from 1961 to 2010 the recycled moisture increasingly impacts arid ecosystems however as predicted using current wetting trend the increased amount derived from transpiration and surface evaporation is still small in this arid climate 4 conclusions the contribution of locally recycled moisture to precipitation cannot be ignored in the oasis ecosystem of central asia but there are few isotope based quantitative assessments of recycling ratio for extremely arid conditions here we focused on a typical leeward oasis the kaxgar yarkant oasis and estimated the contribution of recycled moisture there are great spatial variations in recycling ratio across arid central asia and most stations in this leeward oasis shows a strong moisture recycling during the summer months the average recycling ratio ranged between 17 0 and 63 9 for each sampling station and the ratio from transpiration is much larger than that of surface evaporation in addition the bayesian isotopic mixing model is promising in quantifying moisture recycling considering the low precipitation rates in the arid inland and the enlarged oasis area the recycled portion of total precipitation amount may enhance the wetting trend observed in past decades however the precipitation contributed by moisture recycling does not change the regional arid climate the finding is useful to understand the potential contribution of artificial oasis as well as anthropogenic activities to water processes in an arid climate data availability data will be made available on request credit authorship

2859,evapotranspiration et is an essential ecohydrological process linking the land surface energy water and carbon cycles and plays a critical role in the earth system et remains one of the most problematic components of the water cycle to be determined due to the heterogeneity of the landscape and the complexity of driving factors the satellite based earth observation is expected to provide et information at large scales however accurate global et information with spatially and temporally continuous coverage at moderate to high resolution is still scarce in this paper a combined model called etmonitor with multi process parameterizations was improved and applied to estimate the global et mainly using the biophysical and hydrological parameters variables retrieved from satellite observations the etmonitor model was improved in several aspects in this study to generate the global et datasets during 2000 2019 at daily 1 km resolution including 1 adopting high temporal resolution surface water cover and snow ice cover as input to simulate the impact of their seasonal change on et variation 2 parameterizing the impact of soil moisture on plant transpiration and soil evaporation using high resolution soil moisture which was downscaled to 1 km resolution from the coarse resolution data retrieved from microwave remote sensing observation 3 involving a better soil heat flux estimation to reduce its impact on the uncertainty of estimated et 4 being calibrated based on global ground flux observations to achieve better accuracy the estimated daily et was validated based on the global in situ observations at site scale across various ecosystems with overall high correlation 0 75 low bias 0 08 mm d 1 and low root mean square error 0 93 mm d 1 it had good ability to partition total et to plant transpiration and soil evaporation indicated by the good agreement with the ground isotope measurements in a growing season at one site in the northwest china the estimated global et was cross validated by comparing with other existing et products and it showed the global et estimated by etmonitor could capture the expected global et patterns both in space and in time it also indicated the superiority of the et product by etmonitor in the following aspects capability in capturing the seasonal dynamics of waterbody evaporation and sublimation better performance in capturing the spatial variation of et in the irrigated cropland regions and mountain regions with complex terrain than other global et products e g the gleam and mod16 et products

customized regions or periods can also be provided upon user request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et linking the land surface water and energy cycles has been considered a key process for understanding the earth climate system and the complex heat water exchange between the land surface and the overlaying atmosphere allen et al 1998 schwalm et al 2011 evapotranspiration has huge potential applications in irrigation scheduling management of water and land resources monitoring and assessment of floods and droughts for disaster management and more furthermore in the context of global scarcity of high quality freshwater resources the information of how much water used by crops and natural ecosystems through et is critical for optimizing water allocation among different competing sectors such as agriculture industry people and the environment oki and kanae 2006 the satellite earth observation can provide multiple biophysical variables which have tremendous potential to serve as input to models or algorithms that are developed to estimate the regional and global et and are able to reflect the impact of land surface heterogeneity and climate variability on et however accurate global et information or dataset with spatially and temporally continuous coverage and at moderate resolution referred to 1 km pixel size in this study is still scarce the primary factor limited the et accuracy and spatiotemporal coverage is the remote sensing et models several models have been developed to estimate land surface et based on satellite earth observation data and many of them have been proven to be able to obtain et information at different spatial scales from regional to global coverage bastiaanssen et al 1998 bastiaanssen et al 2012 hu and jia 2015 long et al 2010 miralles et al 2011 mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 nishida et al 2003 norman et al 1995 su 2002 zhang et al 2010 zheng et al 2016 the statistical methods including the simple empirical regression models and the recently developed data driven models rely heavily on the selections of predictor variables the accuracy of the selected algorithms e g empirical equations or machine learning algorithms and the reliability of the training dataset and they may lead to significant uncertainties when applied globally fisher et al 2009 hu et al 2021 jung et al 2009 2019 koppa et al 2022 papale and valentini 2003 wang et al 2007 the surface energy balance type algorithm based on thermal infrared remote sensing technologies is restricted in cloud free condition and not able to provide continuous et dataset with high temporal resolution without a proper interpolation li et al 2013 jia et al 2009 which prevent its application from generating the spatially and temporally continuous et product large uncertainty may also be introduced in surface energy balance type algorithm if the difference between aerodynamic temperature and land surface temperature lst by thermal infrared remote sensing is not properly treated especially over areas with strong land surface thermal heterogeneity e g in arid semi arid region where large contrast in surface temperatures between soil and vegetation occurs often or in mountain regions li et al 2013 the combined model is the most attractive approach to obtain the spatially and temporally continuous et over large scales and it seems to work well for both energy limited and water stressed conditions for vegetated areas bastiaanssen et al 2012 mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 hu and jia 2015 for example the penman monteith equation based algorithm used to generate modis global et product called pm mod et hereafter developed by mu et al 2007 and mu et al 2011 is one of the most well known operational remote sensing et models however it showed relatively large bias in the arid and semi arid regions and significant underestimate could be found in the irrigated croplands due to its inadequate consideration of soil moisture constraint on et hu et al 2015 michel et al 2016 kim et al 2018 the accuracy in the estimated et by combined model is expected to be significantly improved after considering the soil moisture constraint on et and optimization of model parameters should be done carefully for global et estimation application miralles et al 2011 purdy et al 2018 jia et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 another important factor influencing the accuracy of et dataset is the driving force especially those input variables retrieved from satellite remote sensing there are some available global et datasets based on satellite observation for scientific research and applications jung et al 2019 martens et al 2017 mu et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 they generally adopted satellite observations from visible to thermal infrared band for et estimation according to the theoretical scheme of the model used chen and liu 2020 constant land cover map i e the modis based mcd12 land cover product was usually adopted as a key input when producing these et products and they neglect the influence of yearly or seasonal land cover change on the et estimation making them difficult to capture the temporal variation of et in regions with high temporal dynamics in land cover especially in regions with rapid changes in water body and snow cover large temporal variation of pixel wised water cover often happens in flooding plains changing between water covered or non water covered conditions or in high elevation lakes shifting between water and ice cover with seasons and this phenomenon can only be captured by the daily or seasonal water cover dataset but not by mcd12 ji et al 2018 the governing processes of the evaporation from water surface are different from that over other surfaces e g soil vegetation leading to different values of total et in water cover pixel and non water cover pixel hence ignoring temporal water cover variation may led to large uncertainties in et estimation in particular in areas with high dynamics of water surface like in many seasonal flooding plains and areas with frequently short lived water bodies similar cases also held true for regions with seasonal snow ice cover pixels while the accumulation or melting of snow will have impact on the regional et significantly strasser et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 the spatial resolution is widely concerned for the global et dataset and et at higher spatial resolution is more useful than at coarse resolution for farmland water use and management the development of global et at moderate resolution was hindered by the low spatial resolution of available global soil moisture datasets when using combined method i e pm equation based conductance type method satellite remote sensing observation based on microwave sensors can provide soil moisture to support et monitoring with the advantage of less influenced by cloud and capability of penetrating through the cloud and into non dense vegetation canopy with less attenuation the global surface soil moisture products retrieved from active passive micro wave observations of satellite remote sensing e g the advanced microwave scanning radiometer eos amsr e kawanishi 2003 the advanced scatterometer ascat and the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos soil moisture active passive smap wagner et al 1999 kerr 2007 entekhabi et al 2010 usually have coarse spatial resolution e g 0 25 some global studies on et estimation were carried out by implementing global soil moisture from satellite observation at coarse resolution for example in global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam algorithm the esa cci soil moisture product was used as water stress factors ranging between 0 maximum stress and thus no evaporation and 1 no stress and thus potential evaporation to regulate priestley and taylor pt equation for global actual et estimation at 0 25 resolution miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 recently the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl model was also updated to incorporate surface soil moisture from smap dataset to improve the accuracy of global et estimation purdy et al 2018 relatively high resolution 1 km et estimation were mostly conducted at regional or basin scales bastiaanssen et al 2012 hu and jia 2015 using downscaled soil moisture from its original coarse resolution many efforts have made on using different ways to downscale soil moisture from 0 25 resolution to moderate resolution i e 1 km alemohammad et al 2018 peng et al 2017 song et al 2014 either relying on simple methods usually with large uncertainties or using more elaborate method with higher accuracy but not practical for large scale application to obtain gap free soil moisture dataset at global scale e g those using lst as input consequently it is worth exploring the potential of generating moderate resolution e g 1 km soil moisture dataset with reasonable accuracy from the usual 0 25 resolution data at global scale and implement these moderate resolution soil moisture data in et estimation algorithms to generate global et product et partitioning is also a great challenge in remote sensing et studies although some remote sensing et algorithms could provide basic et components their partitioning ability has not well addressed different et components are associated with different physical mechanisms and processes e g transpiration is mainly controlled by the plant physiology including its stomata behavior in response to environmental conditions soil evaporation is highly related to the atmosphere water demand and surface soil water content the rainfall interception loss is mainly related to the canopy morphology and rainfall intensity miralles et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 recent study demonstrated that even the total et in global remote sensing product is accurately estimated the simulated components show significant deviations from observations and the global ratio of transpiration and evaporation to total et yet remains uncertain martens et al 2017 this study aims at developing an accurate global et product with et components at global scale with spatially and temporally continuous coverage and at moderate resolution and the main objectives include 1 to improve an operational global et model for global et estimation with high accuracy 2 to generate a global long term gap free et product with the high resolution and ability of partitioning et to different components 3 and to demonstrate the accuracy of the estimated global et by comparing with the ground measurements and other existing et products a global gap free et dataset at daily time step and 1 km spatial resolution with long term time series 20 years was generated by applying the developed method driven by multi source satellite earth observations and atmospheric forcing data compared with previous studies the estimated et in current study have several advantages in terms of accuracy spatiotemporal continuity and resolution and et partitioning ability and these were achieved mainly by several improvements in current study including the adoption of seasonal dynamics of surface water cover and snow ice cover the calibration of sensitivity parameters based on global flux observation the retrieval of high resolution soil moisture and soil heat flux and their application in et estimation 2 methodology the etmonitor model driven by multiple remote sensing observations will be used in this study the etmonitor model has been applied over different land surfaces in different climate regions hu and jia 2015 zheng et al 2019 this study will focus on realizing the global scale application of etmonitor at daily and 1 km spatial resolution by several practical improvements as below 1 to estimate daily mean soil heat flux by building a machine learning method and include soil heat flux in the energy balance equation used in the etmonitor soil heat flux was neglected in the earlier version of etmonitor for daily et calculation 2 to improve spatial resolution of surface soil moisture derived from satellite observations from 25 km to 1 km based on machine learning algorithm and apply the 1 km soil moisture to the calculation of canopy surface and soil surface resistances for plant transpiration and soil evaporation estimation in etmonitor 3 to consider the impact of rapid change in water body area on the et estimation in each model grid by using water body area data with high temporal resolution derived from satellite observations 4 to optimize the model parameters using flux measurements from global flux tower sites to reduce the uncertainty in the global et estimation resulted from using empirical values of model parameters in the following sections these new developments will be described in detail while the full basic model equations can be found in our earlier papers hu and jia 2015 jia et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 2 1 model description and implementation in global scale the etmonitor model was designed to estimate et using multi source satellite observations by considering the energy budget water balance and plant physiology processes in the parameterizations of land atmosphere energy and water exchange hu and jia 2015 the etmonitor is composed by several modules to model major processes or components of terrestrial evapotranspiration including plant transpiration soil evaporation vegetation canopy interception loss water body evaporation and snow ice sublimation fig 1 strictly speaking sublimation is neither evaporation nor evapotranspiration miralles et al 2020 we refer it as part of et for simplicity the etmonitor in this study runs at daily time step and 1 km spatial grid at global scale in each model grid the component processes may happen jointly depending on weather and land surface conditions e g both soil evaporation and plant transpiration could occur over soil vegetation canopy on the same day or soil evaporation and water evaporation may happen in a grid composed of bare soil and open water surface the land cover data are adopted to distinguish the sources of et in a model grid to initialize different et components estimation using respective modules in the etmonitor in the etmonitor the terrestrial surface et is calculated as the sum of all components 1 et e c e s e i e w e ss where ec mm d 1 is plant transpiration es mm d 1 is soil evaporation ei mm d 1 is canopy rainfall interception loss ew mm d 1 is open water evaporation and ess mm d 1 is snow ice sublimation for soil vegetation canopy system plant transpiration and soil evaporation in etmonitor are estimated using shuttleworth wallace two source scheme shuttleworth and wallace 1985 combined with a jarvis type method to estimate canopy resistance to transpiration where the minimum canopy resistance is regulated by soil moisture and other environmental variables jarvis 1976 steward 1988 canopy interception loss ei is estimated using a revised gash model gash et al 1995 zheng and jia 2020 for the water or snow ice surface the water evaporation and snow ice sublimation are estimated by penman combination equation details are described in the following sections in practice the available energy i e the difference between net radiation flux and soil heat flux is first calculated for soil vegetation canopy the net radiation is partitioned among the processes of plant transpiration soil evaporation and canopy rainfall interception loss when applicable 2 1 1 net radiation estimation and partitioning the total net radiation rn w m 2 that reaches the land surface is the energy force of et process available energy i e the difference between net radiation and the ground heat flux g w m 2 is partitioned between sensible and latent heat fluxes at the land surface and the surface energy balance equation can be written as 2 r n g λ e t h where λet w m 2 is the latent heat flux associated with et mm d 1 and h w m 2 is the sensible heat flux rn is calculated as the difference between incoming and outgoing radiation fluxes both in shortwave and longwave by the following equation 3a rn 1 α 0 r s r l σ ε t 4 1 ε r l 3b ε ε s 1 f c ε v f c where α 0 dimensionless is land surface albedo rs w m 2 is incoming shortwave radiation ε dimensionless is broadband land surface emissivity εs and εv are broadband emissivity of bare soil 0 96 and vegetation 0 98 respectively rl w m 2 is incoming longwave radiation σ 5 67 10 8 w m 2 k 4 is stephan boltzman constant t k is the daily averaged land surface temperature fc is the fractional vegetation cover similar to cleugh et al 2007 we use daily averaged air temperature to replace land surface temperature when applying eq 3a as the satellite based land surface temperature observation is generally available at the satellite overpass time in clear sky condition and daily averaged land surface temperature is difficult to obtain the eq 3a showed good performance in rn estimation in the study by cleugh et al 2007 the estimated rn using eq 3a in our study also showed low rmse and high correlation coefficient compared with ground observation results presented in section 4 1 for the soil vegetation canopy rn is partitioned among three components 4 rn rn i rn c rn s where rni w m 2 represents the net radiation intercepted by the vegetation canopy and used for evaporating water from the wet canopy surface rainfall interception loss which is only applicable on rainy days rnc w m 2 is the net radiation intercepted by the vegetation canopy for plant transpiration rns w m 2 is the net radiation at the underneath soil surface after penetrating the vegetation canopy to estimate rni during the rainfall days ei was first estimated and rni was calculated according to ei it was under the assumption that the canopy rainfall interception loss is fully evaporated during the rainfall days even we noticed this assumption might lead to certain uncertainty and the wet canopy evaporation could last for a few days after rainfall it was acceptable for daily et estimation and applied in many previous studies miralles et al 2016 hu and jia 2015 wang et al 2019 rni is zero on non rainy days the intercepted net radiation flux by vegetation canopy and that received by the underneath surface were estimated as 5a rn c f c r n rn i 5b rn s 1 f c r n rn i 2 1 2 ground heat flux estimation for soil surface either with or without vegetation canopy ground heat flux g is the heat flux entering or leaving the soil at soil surface which is the residual of the net radiation partition between sensible and latent heat fluxes both for vegetation canopy and soil surface for the water surface g represented the heat flux at open water surface for snow surface g represented the heat flux at the snowpack surface g was neglected in the earlier version of etmonitor hu and jia 2015 studies showed that g could account for up to 30 of rn for bare soil bennett et al 2008 so that error may be introduced in et estimation if g is neglected especially in areas with sparse vegetation cover where the g usually plays a significant role in energy balance at daily scale bennett et al 2008 li et al 2015 purdy et al 2016 study showed that the widely used approaches for regional g estimation in different et models by taking g as a fraction of rn e g surface energy balance system sebs gleam and pm mod algorithms generally overestimated g with the root mean square error rmse more than 10 w m 2 at daily scale purdy et al 2016 to improve the accuracy in global daily et estimate by better simulation of g a machine learning model using random forest rf algorithm was developed and applied to estimate g at global scale in this study the rf can generate independent regression trees through randomly selecting training samples automatically and it can handle the high dimensional data and nonlinear problems the rf algorithm combines many weak learners decision trees into one stronger predictor by aggregating the predictions from all decision trees in regression in this study the rf model to estimate g was firstly trained with in situ observation from the fluxnet2015 dataset five variables were selected as interpreting variables including rn leaf area index lai air temperature albedo and saturated soil water content the number of decision trees in the ensemble was set as 300 and it could result in stable accuracy the number of predictor variables was typically one third of the variables for regression and it was set as 2 in current study the rf model for g estimation was trained through the bagging approach for each node approximately two thirds in bag samples of all samples are randomly selected to train the decision tree and the remaining 1 3 samples out of bag were applied to test the performance of the well trained rf model the trained rf model was further applied to estimate daily g with input data in each pixel for global application 2 1 3 soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration in etmonitor the total evapotranspiration from the vegetation soil system under rainfall free days no rainfall interception was the sum of the es and ec the core equations for soil evaporation and plant transpiration were based on the shuttleworth wallace s w dual source model combined with parameterizations for a series of resistances the soil surface resistance in s w model r s s was estimated by a simple equation related to surface soil moisture θ surf expressed as the degree of saturation in percentage 6 r s s r ss m i n θ surf b 7 θ surf θ θ res θ sat θ res where r ss m i n was the minimum soil resistance s m 1 representing the r s s value under sufficient water condition b was a parameter describing the sensitivity of r s s to θ surf varying with soil types and climate conditions clapp and hornberger 1978 bastiaanssen et al 2012 and it was parameterized as a linear function of θ sat saturated soil moisture m3 m 3 θ was the surface volumetric soil moisture m3 m 3 provided by remote sensing dataset θ res was residual soil moisture m3 m 3 θ sat and θ res were derived from the map of soil properties the canopy surface resistance r s c was estimated as the reciprocal of the canopy conductance upscaled from leaf stomatal conductance taking into account leaves density of the canopy represented by lai the leaf stomatal conductance was computed by well known jarvis type model jarvis 1976 and in this study we considered several environmental variables i e the solar radiation rs vapor pressure deficit vpd air temperature ta and root zone soil moisture θroot to regulate the minimum leaf stomatal resistance or maximum conductance similar to the formula by steward 1988 these finally led to the following equation to estimate r s c of vegetation canopy 8 r s c r s m i n f r s f v p d f t a f θ root lai eff where r s m i n was the minimum leaf stomatal resistance s m 1 lai eff was the effective leaf area index to upscale water transfer from leaf to canopy level and was estimated based on actual lai by an empirical formula following allen et al 2006 the environmental constraint functions f r s f v p d f t a and f θ root varying between 0 and 1 represented the constraints of solar radiation vpd air temperature and root zone soil moisture to the stomatal conductance steward 1988 mo et al 2004 expressed as 9a f r s 1 e x p r s k r 9b f v p d 1 k d v p d 9c f t a t a t min t opt t min t max t a t max t opt t max t opt t opt t min 9d f θ root m i n 1 max 0 θ root θ wilt θ fc θ wilt where k r and k d are fitting parameters that described the sensitivity of stomatal conductance to incoming shortwave radiation and vpd θ fc and θ wilt represented the thresholds of soil moisture in root zone layer at which the plant stomata would be fully open and closed they were respectively taken as the soil moisture at the field capacity and permanent wilting point derived from the soil properties map zhang et al 2018 t min t max and t opt were the minimum maximum and optimum air temperatures that influence the stomatal activity respectively θ root could not be directly retrieved from satellite earth observations to obtain θ root two approaches were provided in the etmonitor for the first approach a three layer soil water transfer model based on richard equation was established to simulate θ root by assimilating surface soil moisture of satellite product to reduce the uncertainty of root zone moisture simulation cui and jia 2021 however this procedure is more suitable for farmland scale application and very time consuming when applied to global scale estimate at 1 km resolution and daily time step for the second approach the soil was divided into two layers i e the topsoil layer with a few centimeters depth assuming measurements by microwave sensors of satellite remote sensing could penetrate and the subsoil layer that could reach the root zone of vegetation in this simplified scheme a simple relationship between θ root and θ surf was applied to estimate root zone soil moisture following bastiaanssen et al 2012 and hu and jia 2015 this second simple method was adopted in current study to estimate θ root for the purpose of practical application at global scale for daily et estimate at 1 km resolution obviously topsoil layer moisture is crucial information to ensure the accuracy of et estimate at global application popularly available surface soil moisture data are provided by microwave remote sensing observations with coarse spatial resolution e g 25 km which is not sufficient for studies at 1 km spatial resolution we have applied a machine learning method to downscale the soil moisture data at 25 km resolution to 1 km resolution see section 3 1 the values of model parameters i e k r t min t max and t opt in eqs 8 9 were taken according to vegetation types as in previous study while the values of r s m i n and k d were calibrated using ground data from flux tower sites since etmonitor was found most sensitive to these two parameters see section 2 2 1 for details 2 1 4 canopy rainfall interception loss estimation canopy rainfall interception loss ei is the portion of rainfall that falls on the vegetation canopy but never reaches the ground evaporate from the wet canopy into the atmosphere instead dunin et al 1988 van dijk et al 2015 rain that hits plant surfaces is temporarily retained and eventually either evaporates into the atmosphere interception loss or falls to the ground by dripping or by running down branches and stems stemflow rain that does not hit a plant surface is called free throughfall and together with dripping is often referred to as throughfall david et al 2005 ei was estimated by a revised gash analytical model zheng and jia 2020 which was a rainfall event based model that successfully applied on daily basis with the assumption of one storm per rainy day different from the initial gash model which estimated the rainfall interception by canopy and trunk separately in the current study the total rainfall interception loss was estimated by taking the canopy and trunk as a whole following zheng and jia 2020 2 1 5 open water body evaporation estimation a wide variety of methods for estimating open water evaporation have been reported in the literature which could be categorized into several types mass balance models energy budget models bulk transfer models combination models the equilibrium temperature method and empirical factors method in etmonitor model the penman combination equation was used for water evaporation ew mm estimation the penman equation is a physically based and widely used method to estimate evaporation from open water bodies under varying locations and climatic conditions and it is practical for large scale applications penman 1948 shuttleworth 1993 valiantzas 2006 more elaborated methods e g wang et al 2020 among others could be used if all input data can be obtained for global scale application the day by day variation of surface water cover from satellite observations was used in this study to consider the impact of change in water body area on the estimated total et in each model grid the pixels marked as water by the data of water body area were re classed as water in the background land cover map for estimation of daily evaporation from open water otherwise other components e g soil evaporation would be estimated according to background land cover map 2 1 6 snow ice sublimation estimation in the snow or ice covered or partially covered area the solid water could turn to gaseous phase through sublimation process which could dominant the moisture loss from land surface to the atmosphere in snow covered areas especially in the polar and high elevation regions or in regions with seasonal snow snow ice sublimation is mainly controlled by wind air humidity and radiation kuchment and gelfan 1996 strasser et al 2008 moore 1983 schmidt et al 1998 and can be estimated using empirical equation e g the kuzmin formula kuzmin 1953 was used in previous version of etmonitor hu and jia 2015 recent study showed that penman combination equation was proven to be able to capture the spatiotemporal variation of snow sublimation with acceptable accuracy wang et al 2017 in this study we adopted the penman combination equation to estimate sublimation in which g was taken as the conductive heat flux at the interface between the snowpack and the soil surface and calculated as a constant proportion of rn received at the snow surface following the study of wang et al 2017 evaporation may happen over melting snow surface we neglected this process in current study in this study information of daily snow cover derived from satellite observation was adopted as an input to identify the occurrence of sublimation sublimation was then estimated only if the pixel was marked as snow ice cover otherwise estimated as other components according to the background land cover map 2 2 model calibration and validation 2 2 1 calibration of model parameters previous application of etmonitor is limited to certain regions with known climate and vegetation conditions therefore model parameters were set as fixed values taken from literature table 1 listed a summary of the nine major parameters in the etmonitor with brief explanation of their physical meaning and the range of each parameter that was commonly found in the literature many other similar models generally assumed a fixed value for each parameter for each plant functional types pft neglecting the climatic influence such treatment is not suitable to global scale application due to very diverse climate and plant conditions in this study the most sensitive model parameters in etmonitor were calibrated using ground measurements collected at flux tower stations distributed globally and the calibrated parameters were then extrapolated to each pixel globally by considering the climate regimes and pft the procedure contained four steps as described below 1 selection of sensitive parameters we identified the most sensitive parameters of the etmonitor based on efast global sensitivity analysis methods saltelli et al 1999 2004 to reduce the number of tunable model parameters the sensitivity analysis showed that etmonitor was most sensitive to parameters r s m i n minimal stomatal resistance for plant transpiration and k d the vpd stress parameter for plant transpiration involved in canopy surface resistance for transpiration and these two parameters were calibrated using the flux tower observations the calibration was done over 236 flux tower sites see section 3 3 for data description those sites with water snow ice and bare soil were not included for calibration of these two model parameters related to vegetation transpiration 2 calibration of selected parameters at site level to conduct the parameter calibration the latin hypercube sample lhs mckay et al 1979 was first applied to sample the model parameter setting and 5000 sets of parameter settings were obtained the etmonitor model was then run at each one of the 236 flux tower sites for each of these 5000 sets of parameter settings this led to a total of 1 180 000 model simulations for each simulation the etmonitor performance was obtained by comparing the daily et estimation by etmonitor with the flux tower based measurements the model performance is judged by kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 10 k g e 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the pearson correlation coefficient α is the ratio between the standard deviation σ values of the simulation and observation β is the ratio between the mean simulated and observed values kge is smaller than 1 and higher kge means better agreement between the observed and the simulated results generally various previous studies treated kge 0 as their threshold between good and bad performance and they used positive kge values as indicative of good model simulations whereas negative kge values were considered not satisfactory andersson et al 2017 fowler et al 2018 towner et al 2019 however recent studies showed that model performance in the range kge 0 41 could be considered reasonable knoben et al 2019 the parameter set with the top 10 best performance i e the 10 groups of parameter settings with the maximum kge values in the simulation results in each site was regarded as the optimal parameter set candidates which will be further evaluated to obtain the optimized parameters for different pfts and different climate regimes instead of using single optimal parameter setting for each site we selected top 10 sets of parameter settings for each site to mitigate the impact of equifinality various parameter sets may be equally capable of reproducing a similar outcome 3 optimization of parameters for different pfts and different climate regimes the selected flux sites were clustered to different groups according to their climate regimes and pfts the climate regime was defined by the sub types of köppen geiger climate classification kgc following the map from beck et al 2018 and there were totally 5 major climate zones a tropical b dry c temperate d continental e polar and 30 sub types as shown in fig 2 in the end the selected 236 flux sites were clustered into 85 kgc pft groups accordingly for each kgc pft group the forcing data from all sites of the group was lumped and all the site specific top 10 sets of parameter settings from all sites of the group obtained in the last step were also lumped together as parameter setting candidates of the target kgc pft group the total candidates number is 10 numbers of sites in the kgc pft group for example there were 22 sites labelled as dfc enf enf with the climate regimes of cold no dry season cold summer and all the parameter settings from these 22 sites were jointly lumped for the group of dfc enf i e totally 10 22 sites 220 sets of parameter settings for dfc enf the lumped parameter settings of each kgc pft group were applied for et simulation driven by the lumped forcing dataset of the target kgc pft group and the parameter setting that achieved the highest kge was taken as the optimized parameter setting of the corresponding kgc pft group 4 extrapolation of optimized parameters for global application the optimized model parameter sets for different kge pft were applied to etmonitor for global et estimation by assigning the optimized parameter settings to each 1 km grid according to the kgc pft classification in each grid in the regions not included in the calibrated 85 kgc pft groups the parameters in the nearby climate regions were taken 2 2 2 model validation we used k fold cross validation to validate the daily et estimation by etmonitor at flux tower sites in the k fold cross validation method data were separated into k partitions folds equally and each of the partitions was used for validation while the rest was used for calibration the value of k was set as 10 and the collected flux tower data were separated into 10 partitions equally of which 9 partitions were used for calibration and the remaining 1 partition the hold out part was left as unmeasured after calibration the optimized parameters were used to get new prediction values for the unmeasured partition the prediction values were then compared with the unmeasured partition for validation this procedure was repeated 10 times so that every sample was exercised strictly once during the validation procedure finally the results from all the 10 repeats were lumped to get the total accuracy of the model this validation could explore the transferability of the etmonitor model from known flux tower sites to any other sites for global application 3 data and pre processing 3 1 satellite data and pre processing the etmonitor was implemented at global scale at 1 km spatial resolution and daily temporal step using the input data from satellite earth observations including land cover types lai fractional vegetation cover fc land surface albedo surface soil moisture precipitation and canopy height table 2 3 1 1 optical remote sensing data and processing the standard modis collection 6 land cover product mcd12 was used to infer information of land cover types and 17 land cover types were identified based on the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp classification sulla menashe et al 2019 pfts provided by mcd12 igbp lc types were further used to create a look up table for the parameters in etmonitor following the description in section 2 2 the mcd12 land cover product was produced at annual scale and could not reflect the day to day variation of water cover and snow cover the snow cover product mod10a2 with 8 day temporal step was used to consider the seasonal variation of snow ice cover the 8 day maximum snow cover provided by mod10a2 product layer maximum snow extent in mod10a2 was re assigned to daily values with the help of the snow chronology bit flags for each day in the eight day observation period layer eight day snow cover in mod10a2 this daily snow ice cover information overwrote the mcd12 lc to track the land surface condition for estimation of sublimation in each pixel by etmonitor when snow ice existing the daily global surface water change database dgwcd product during 2000 2016 from ji et al 2018 was used to consider the day by day variation of surface water cover those pixels marked as water in the dgwcd were re classed as water in the land cover map for estimation of daily evaporation from open water otherwise other component e g soil evaporation would be estimated according to mcd12 lc map the dgwcd product by ji et al 2018 is available till 2016 the 8 day global surface water extent dataset from han and niu 2020 was adopted after interpolated to daily scale from 2017 onwards land cover snow cover and water cover data with 500 m resolution were resampled to 1 km resolution using the method of maximum fraction the albedo lai and fc data were from the global land surface satellite glass product and the detailed description of the glass product and methods could be found in the literature liu et al 2013a b xiao et al 2014 qu et al 2014 jia et al 2015 the glass products overcome the clouds contamination and have the advantage of providing spatially and temporally continuous information compared to the modis products the spatial resolution of glass lai and fc products were 500 m they were spatially aggregated to 1 km resolution in this study the temporal resolution of glass lai fc and albedo products were 8 day they were reconstructed to daily step by linear interpolation for further daily et estimation 3 1 2 surface soil moisture data and downscaling daily surface soil moisture was obtained from the esa cci v05 3 product with 0 25 resolution for the missing values of soil moisture in esa cci v05 3 product era5 top layer soil moisture was adopted to fill the gaps to obtain daily gap free ssm at 0 25 resolution the gap filled daily surface soil moisture at 0 25 resolution was then disaggregated to 1 km resolution based on a machine learning method inspired by the previous study that predicted the fine resolution surface soil moisture by training the relationship between the observed surface soil moisture at ground sites and coarse resolution soil moisture retrieved from satellite observations with the help of ndvi in both coarse and fine resolutions alemohammad et al 2018 in this study we adopted random forest algorithm to build the ssm downscaling model rf model was first trained to learn the nonlinear relationships between the in situ observations of ssm and different explanatory variables and the well trained rf model was then applied to predict the 1 km resolution ssm based on the spatial distributed remote sensing dataset the rf model for ssm downscaling was trained through the bagging approach with similar setting for soil heat flux estimate as described in section 2 1 2 six explanatory variables were selected to apply the rf model including ssm at 0 25 resolution ndvi at both 0 25 and 1 km resolution albedo digital elevation model dem and saturated soil water content all at 1 km resolution to obtain the downscaled ssm at 1 km resolution the 1 km resolution ndvi data were from mod13a2 product didan 2015a in order to match the spatial resolution of esa cci soil moisture data for building the rf model at the 0 25 spatial resolution the 0 25 resolution ndvi was obtained by aggregating the ndvi provided by the mod13c1 product with 0 05 resolution didan 2015b dem data was from strm30 becker et al 2009 and saturated soil water content data were from previous study zhang et al 2018 surface soil moisture of ground observation from the international soil moisture network ismn dorigo et al 2011 dorigo et al 2013 were used as response variable to train the model and to validate the downscaled results the 70 of all ismn ssm samples were randomly selected to train the rf model and the remaining 30 samples were applied to validate the performance of the trained rf model 3 1 3 other remote sensing data global daily precipitation data from global precipitation measurement gpm late run precipitation product at 0 1 resolution with improved accuracy huffman et al 2019 were used to estimate the canopy rainfall interception loss the 0 1 resolution precipitation data were downscaled to 1 km using a bilinear resampling method global map of canopy height at 1 km spatial resolution simard et al 2011 derived from the geoscience laser altimeter system glas aboard icesat ice cloud and land elevation satellite was adopted to obtain canopy height of forests in this study the glas based canopy height dataset was built based on high correlation between the glas derived canopy height values and other global variables including forest type tree cover elevation and climatology maps and agreed well with the ground observations the canopy heights of crop and grass were modeled corresponding to their growth stages following the study by zhou et al 2006 3 2 meteorological forcing data the global gridded near surface meteorological forcing data were from the era5 https cds climate copernicus eu including air temperature ta dew point temperature td air pressure pa wind speed at 10 m height u10 and v10 downward shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes rs and rl vpd was then calculated from air temperature and dew point temperature the era5 hourly meteorological forcing data with 0 25 resolution was firstly averaged to daily values and then downscaled to 1 km using statistical downscaling approaches the wind speed was downscaled using the bilinear resampling method while the rest variables were downscaled based on the semi empirical transfer functions with multiple predictor variables including topographic altitude aspect and slope following gao et al 2008 and stahl et al 2006 the topographic information was retrieved from the srtm30 dem becker et al 2009 3 3 flux tower data observation data from flux tower sites were adopted to calibrate and validate the etmonitor model measurements of land surface fluxes by the eddy covariance system collected from 251 flux tower sites globally were used to validate the estimated et these sites covering various types of ecosystems were selected by considering the following aspects these sites included all the necessary high quality input data for et estimation and validation at site level and covered at least one growing season these sites were located in relatively homogeneous area to ensure the spatial representatives for comparison with the 1 km pixel values by etmonitor the homogeneity of the land surface at the sites were visually assessed by checking 1 km 1 km area around the flux towers with a high resolution 30 m land cover map from zhang et al 2021 the sites were considered as homogeneous if one or two land cover types dominated area greater than 70 in the 1 km 1 km area around the sites the flux observation data at each site were screened by data quality evaluation those data with poor quality were not used for calibration and validation in this study the spatial distribution of the 251 sites were presented in fig 2 the list of the sites was given in supplementary table s1 most of these sites were from the global fluxnet2015 dataset and regional flux observation networks e g ameriflux euroflux asiaflux chinaflux and hiwater heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research these sites covered a wide range of global climate regimes from tropical to polar regions across 12 pfts including evergreen needleleaf forest enf evergreen broadleaf forest ebf deciduous needleleaf forest dnf deciduous broadleaf forest dbf mixed forest mf closed shrublands csh open shrublands osh woody savannas wsa savannas sav grasslands gra permanent wetlands wet and croplands cro besides those sites covered by barren or sparsely vegetated bar water wat and snow ice sno were also included for validation of et components estimation the latent heat flux observations from the selected flux tower sites were directly used without energy balance closure correction in order to reduce the uncertainty introduced by the poor quality data data screening was performed to select reliable daily observations 1 data from rainy days were excluded 2 negative values of daily et were filtered out 3 the 30 min latent heat flux data for daily aggregation were checked data from the days with larger than 20 missing observations of 30 min acquisition were excluded this procedure yielded a realistic number of reliable daily et observations to be further used for calibration and validation of the global et estimation by etmonitor 3 4 stable isotope observation of soil evaporation and plant transpiration to evaluate the components of soil evaporation and plant transpiration estimated by the etmonitor the stable isotope observations of water flux collected in daman site in the northwest china from 27 may to 21 september in 2012 were used daman site with maize crop was one of the sites of the hiwater the ratios of plant transpiration and soil evaporation to total et on daily scale were obtained based on the 18o composition of atmospheric water vapor measured using a cavity ring down spectroscopy water vapor isotope analyzer at 0 5 1 5 m height above the crop canopy wen et al 2016 the daily ratio of plant transpiration to total et ec et and daily ratio of soil evaporation to total et es et estimated by etmonitor were compared with the stable isotope observation of water fluxes 3 5 other et products for cross comparison other earth observation based et products were collected for cross comparison table 3 including the mod16 et product mu et al 2011 gleam v3 3b et product martens et al 2017 the fluxcom et dataset jung et al 2019 energy balance eb an improved sebs algorithm et product chen et al 2021 penman monteith leuning pml v2 et product zhang et al 2019 in the mod16 and fluxcom product the calculations of et were not made over non vegetated pixels i e water body barren or sparsely vegetated area permanent snow and ice permanent wetland and urban areas thus these pixels were not included for inter comparison 4 results 4 1 evaluation of key forcing variables the meteorological forcing is important inputs for et estimation and their accuracies need to be carefully validated the meteorological forcing variables from the downscaled era5 dataset generally agreed well with the ground observations demonstrated by low rmse supplementary figure s1 we further validated the estimated daily mean surface net radiation and soil heat flux both at 1 km spatial resolution against the available in situ measurements from 149 sites of fluxnet2015 149 sites among the collected 251 sites could provide reliable rn and g observations both the estimated daily mean rn and g agreed well with the measurements at flux tower sites fig 3 the temporal variation of the estimated and observed daily mean rn and g at some selected sites were shown in supplementary figure s2 and figure s3 respectively the rmse value of the estimated daily rn is 30 75 w m 2 comparable to the ceres clouds and the earth s radiant energy system rn products with rmse of 33 56 w m 2 jia et al 2016 the rmse value of the estimated daily g is 4 91 w m 2 much better than the reported accuracy with rmse ranging from 7 34 w m 2 to 14 98 w m 2 purdy et al 2016 these results indicated that the estimated daily mean rn and g at 1 km resolution in this study could provide reliable input data for further daily et estimation the downscaled 1 km daily soil moisture was also validated against ground measurements the surface soil moisture in situ measurement data from the ismn were used for both training in downscaling procedure and validation of the results 70 data for training and 30 data for validation the accuracy of training results is high with rmse 0 04 m3 m 3 and r 0 94 fig 4 the downscaled soil moisture performed well with rmse 0 05 m3 m 3 and r 0 89 fig 4 temporal variation of downscaled and observed ssm at some selected sites were shown in supplementary figure s4 to illustrate the consistency between the two time series these results indicated the overall good achievement in the downscaled 1 km soil moisture that is robust for further use to estimate the water stress factor in the canopy resistance for plant transpiration as well as to estimate soil evaporation 4 2 validation of et against flux tower measurements the etmonitor was calibrated to obtain optimal model parameters and validated at site level before it was applied to the global scale for et estimation fig 5 summarized the results of etmonitor calibration and validation at the 236 flux tower sites overall etmonitor performed well in estimating daily et as indicated by the statistical metrics of calibration rmse 0 85 mm d 1 bias 0 07 mm d 1 r 0 83 fig 5a the validation results also showed overall good agreement with the in situ measurements with rmse 0 89 mm d 1 bias 0 07 mm d 1 r 0 82 fig 5a the daily total et and each component were estimated at 1 km resolution by etmonitor using the calibrated model parameters and data described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 to evaluate the performance of estimated et the estimated et were compared with the ground observations at different temporal scales as summarized in table 4 the statistical values of etmonitor performance for all validation sites were shown in supplementary table s2 and figure s5 and the time series of estimated daily et and observed et at some flux observation sites were shown in supplementary figure s6 other global remote sensing et products with similar spatial resolution 1 km were also shown in table 4 for comparison the et estimated by etmonitor generally showed good agreement with ground observation in all temporal scales the performances of etmonitor at yearly and monthly scales were even better than the performance on daily and 8 day scales with the rmse decreased from 0 93 mm d 1 at daily scale to 0 83 mm d 1 at 8 day scale to 0 58 mm d 1 at monthly scale and eventually to 0 57 mm d 1 at yearly scale it indicated the random error was decreasing from short term to longer temporal scales we also notice that kge values were lower at yearly scale than at daily or 8 day scale for all these three datasets table 4 and it is because the number of annual et samples is less than the number of daily or 8 day et samples leading to relatively low values of correlation coefficient r and standard deviation σ for the validation at yearly scale according to eq 10 r and σ are key inputs for kge calculation and low values of r and σ cause low kge values 4 3 performance of et estimation in different land cover and et partitioning by etmonitor it is useful to understand the performance of the etmonitor over various land cover types fig 6 displayed the performance of the estimated daily total et according to the land cover type against the ground observations from the corresponding flux tower sites in the vegetation covered sites et was the sum of soil evaporation plant transpiration and vegetation canopy interception loss since the components of open water body evaporation and ice snow sublimation were zero generally good agreement between the estimation and observation were achieved for almost all vegetation covered sites and very good correlation and low bias could be found with r range from 0 66 to 0 85 and bias range from 0 17 mm d 1 to 0 20 mm d 1 the bias values were close to zero and it indicated no obvious overestimation or underestimation the rmse of daily total et was overall less than 1 00 mm d 1 with the lowest rmse for dnf 0 79 mm d 1 wsa 0 79 mm d 1 osh 0 81 mm d 1 and gra 0 82 mm d 1 the highest rmse of daily et found for ebf rmse 1 10 mm d 1 sites mainly located in the relatively humid region usually with higher evapotranspiration where large rmse and lower kge were anticipated etmonitor estimates different et components soil evaporation plant transpiration open water body evaporation vegetation canopy interception loss and ice snow sublimation to obtain total et hence it has the ability to partition total et to different et components fig 6 also displayed the performance of non vegetation covered sites i e barren or sparsely vegetated sites bar water wat and snow ice sno to validate the estimated components of the bare soil evaporation open water evaporation and snow ice sublimation it was revealed that etmonitor could estimate the soil evaporation well as indicated by the low rmse 0 57 mm d 1 and low bias for bar sites low correlation 0 52 could be partly due to the relatively narrow et range i e 0 2 mm d 1 for water evaporation relatively larger rmse values were found rmse 1 48 mm d 1 this was partly due to larger evaporation values from water surface the bias of daily water evaporation 0 40 mm d 1 was comparably low and it indicated the estimated water evaporation did not show obvious overestimation or underestimation to validate the estimated snow ice sublimation the seasonal snow cover at each flux site was checked and finally eight flux sites were found with latent heat flux observations for at least 1 month during the snow covered periods although some low kge values were found in snow ice sublimation estimation the overall rmse and bias of the estimated daily snow sublimation were 0 33 mm d 1 and 0 13 mm d 1 and it indicated the accuracy of estimated snow sublimation is satisfactory to further evaluate the et components partitioning of soil evaporation and plant transpiration by etmonitor in the vegetation covered sites the ratios of ec et and es et estimated by etmonitor were compared with the stable isotope observations the daily ec et and es et estimated by etmonitor were generally agreed well with the isotope observations with the overall rmse 12 74 and r 0 94 in the growing season of maize crop in 2012 in daman site fig 7 relatively large difference was found in the beginning of the growing season when the canopy was not closed and such discrepancy may also be related to fields being mulched to prevent from soil moisture loss which was not captured by the satellite remote sensing data soil moisture land cover thus limiting the model ability to show such impact the rmse decreased to 8 62 and r increased to 0 97 after removing the early growing season period before july from the analysis the averaged ec et and es et values from etmonitor in growing season in daman site were 80 15 and 19 85 respectively which were very close to the isotope observation results 86 33 and 13 67 these indicated the good performance in separating soil evaporation and plant transpiration by etmonitor 4 4 inter comparison between etmonitor product and other et products fig 8 illustrated the spatial distributions of annual mean et from etmonitor while other et products in the overlapping period 2003 2015 were shown in supplementary figure s7 all products were spatially aggregated to 0 25 for cross comparison and pixels with missing et values in fluxcom and mod16 et products were excluded for fair comparison etmonitor et product could reasonably capture the expected global et spatial patterns though considerable discrepancy with other products could be found in some regions the et estimated by etmonitor generally showed similar global patterns with gleam fluxcom and pml v2 et products fig 8 the latitudinal profiles of different et products were also displayed fig 8b the annual et exhibited a distinguishable decreasing gradient from the equator to the high latitude region of the northern and southern hemispheres corresponding to the climate conditions land cover types and vegetation growing season lengths for better illustration fig 8 also showed annual mean et by different products and their mean monthly variation in different climate zones the main 5 classes in köppen geiger classifications described in section 2 2 1 and in fig 2 in tropical regions where very high et values were generally anticipated due to the high temperature and unlimited soil water supply et values from etmonitor were generally high and is consistent with fluxcom and pml v2 et products supplementary figure s7 fig 8c the eb showed lower et values in tropical region especially in the amazon and central africa regions supplementary figure s7 and it was probably related to the uncertainty of thermal remote sensing lst lst is the most important input for energy balance method and it is easily contaminated by the cloudiness in the tropical regions in arid regions where extreme low et values were anticipated due to the extreme low soil water supply et from etmonitor showed comparable value with gleam and lower than other et products except mod16 product large uncertainty in mod16 product has been reported in tropical and arid regions by previous studies e g khan et al 2018 michel et al 2016 zheng et al 2019 which is highly related to the parametrizations in mod16 product hu et al 2015 yang et al 2015 in temperate zones where et is generally lower than tropical region and higher than other regions etmonitor product showed comparable et values with other et products especially closer to gleam which showed relatively low uncertainty according to the evaluation by collocation based approach li et al 2022 in cold and polar zones where low et were found due to the low temperature and limited energy forcing etmonitor product showed comparable et values with fluxcom gleam and eb products while the pml v2 and mod16 et showed higher values than other products for further comparison each one of the global et products was plotted against et product of etmonitor supplementary figure s8 the spatial variation of et by etmonitor showed the highest r and lowest rmse when compared with pml v2 gleam and fluxcom et products and lowest bias with gleam et product followed with eb et product the et values from etmonitor also showed good ability in describing seasonal variation for both north and south hemispheres fig 8d although the et magnitude varied the seasonal course of et by etmonitor were comparable with other products especially in the regions with large season variation e g arid temperate and cold regions supplementary figure s9 presented spatial distribution of the correlation coefficient r and rmse calculated based on the monthly values of different et products against etmonitor product at first glance very high r and low rmse between etmonitor and other et products could be found in most areas supplementary figure s9 et product by etmonitor generally showed higher r and lower rmse with fluxcom than with that of other et products in the tropical region e g the amazon rainforest arid land e g the saharan desert and the high elevation region e g the tibetan plateau lower correlation or insignificant correlation were found even though with rmse being generally lower than 1 5 mm d 1 to better compare the spatial patterns from different et products the regional et variation in some typical regions e g the mountain regions with complex topography and the irrigation regions with contrast et values from surrounding areas were shown in fig 9 in the mountain regions e g hengduan mountain regions located in the southeast edge of the tibetan plateau fig 9 column a and the alps mountains in europe fig 9 column b etmonitor at 1 km resolution could reflect the impact of topography on et very well and higher et values occurred in the humid valleys with denser vegetation cover and higher soil water content and lower et values occurred in higher elevations along the mountain slopes with fewer vegetation cover and colder climate except fluxcom product could partially capture such patterns all the other four et products failed to capture the spatial patterns of et in the mountain regions even though mod16 and pml v2 had higher spatial resolution 500 m it implies that the spatial resolution is not the only dominant factor for the unsatisfactory performance by these et products in the mountain regions in the irrigated regions e g the middle reach of heihe river basin in the northwest of china fig 9 column c the middle reach of indus river basin fig 9 column d and the nile delta fig 9 column e the estimated et by etmonitor could clearly represent the et differences among different land covers especially the large et difference between irrigated croplands and the surrounding drylands in these irrigated croplands with arid and semi arid climate condition significantly high values of et occurred in the irrigated cropland due to high soil moisture from irrigation in contrast to the very low et values in the surrounding drylands the high et values in the irrigated cropland resulted in the precipitation deficit in arid semi arid climate environment i e negative values in the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration etmonitor utilized soil moisture at 1 km resolution as one of the influential parameters in estimation of the canopy surface resistance and soil surface resistance could capture very well the et variation when compared with other et products in which soil moisture information was not directly used e g mod16 the very large difference in et between the irrigated croplands and surrounding desert could also partially captured by fluxcom eb and pml v2 et products but the latter two et products showed systematically lower et values than etmonitor and fluxcom gleam and mod16 datasets could not show these large et difference in the irrigation regions as shown in fig 9 row 3 and row 4 4 5 inter comparison of et partitioning at global scale fig 10 displayed the global distribution of the et components i e vegetation transpiration soil evaporation rainfall interception loss of vegetation canopy open water evaporation and snow ice sublimation estimated by etmonitor mean values between 2003 and 2018 the et partitioning from gleam and pml v2 products for comparison in the overlapping period 2003 2018 is illustrated in supplementary figure s10 the sublimation and water evaporation were merged into one figure for easy illustration in fig 10 the et components from etmonitor generally showed similar global spatial patterns with pml v2 and gleam products however discrepancy could also be found among different products in different regions false color composite maps with red etmonitor green pml v2 blue gleam were also given in fig 10 for an easy visualization of the relative magnitudes of et values from the three products in the false color composite maps more red green blue colors means etmonitor pml v2 gleam having larger values than the other two et products the spatial pattern of plant transpiration estimated by etmonitor were generally close to the gleam and pml v2 products and all products showed vegetation transpiration being the largest components of total et the soil evaporation by the etmonitor was generally close to pml v2 product larger than that by gleam product the soil evaporation by the etmonitor was generally showed highest values in the tropical regions part of southeast asia and east america while soil evaporation by the pml v2 showed highest values in other regions the canopy rainfall interception loss estimated from the three et products generally had similar spatial patterns but etmonitor showed higher values in the tropical and subtropical regions europe north asia and east america than the other two et products for open water evaporation and snow ice sublimation etmonitor estimation is close to gleam etmonitor adopted daily water cover and daily snow ice cover to consider the impacts of seasonal dynamics of water and snow ice covers on evaporation and sublimation estimation which explains the spatial distribution difference between etmonitor and pml v2 used fixed yearly water and snow ice covers for water evaporation and snow ice sublimation in fig 10 pml v2 failed to capture the snow ice sublimation in the regions with seasonal snow ice cover e g north eurasia north america tibetan plateau the seasonal snow ice covered regions accounted for roughly one third of global terrestrial land surface and the global total sublimation would be underestimated by 54 08 if sublimation in those seasonal snow covered regions was ignored according to our estimation to assess the impact of seasonal water cover we compared the open water evaporation estimation by etmonitor in 2013 and 2014 between using the seasonal dynamic water cover as described in section 3 1 and using the fixed yearly water cover yearly fixed water cover in the mcd12 land cover map defined as at least 60 of area is covered by permanent water bodies seasonality of open water evaporation caused by water surface phenology cannot be captured in many regions with seasonal water cover e g the north america when fixed yearly water cover was adopted and total amount of terrestrial open water evaporation amount tends to be underestimated by 25 globally supplementary figure s11 although there existed regional differences in the spatial distribution of the et partitioning between values from etmonitor and from gleam and pml v2 products all datasets showed that plant transpiration dominated the total et on global land surface table 5 the plant transpiration and soil evaporation were the largest two components of total et globally respectively accounting for 61 54 0 44 and 19 08 0 54 of the global total et on average according to the etmonitor estimation and they were between the results of gleam and pml v2 products the rainfall interception loss was the third largest component accounting for 13 54 0 49 of the total et globally estimated by etmonitor and it was very close to the results of gleam and pml v2 products the rest 5 84 0 24 was mainly contributions from the open water body evaporation and snow ice sublimation 5 discussion 5 1 etmonitor algorithm and forcing data the spatially and temporally information on evapotranspiration can promote our knowledge of global water cycle provide crucial data for water resource management and improve our understanding of the interactions between land surface and the atmosphere fisher et al 2008 mccabe et al 2016 michel et al 2016 wang et al 2021a in the past few decades although significant progresses have been made in fundamental and applied research on evapotranspiration in a wide range of areas such as the earth s hydrologic cycle ecosystem functions and carbon sinks climate change and agriculture and water resources management insufficient observation capacity from local to global scales remains a critical and prominent problem fisher et al 2017 et remains the most problematic component of the global and regional water cycle to be determined with required accuracy and favorable spatio temporal resolutions due to the heterogeneity of the landscape and the complex processes involved chen et al 2019 fernández prieto et al 2012 jiménez et al 2011 lettenmaier and famiglietti 2006 li et al 2009 schmugge et al 2002 wang and dickinson 2012 remote sensing approach has been recognized as the most useful means to achieve global and regional et information at moderate spatial resolution based on observations of various sensors onboard the earth observation satellites jiang and ryu 2016 sahoo et al 2011 vinukollu et al 2011 xie et al 2022 zhang et al 2016 etmonitor is a hybrid model established by integrating different physical processes related to exchanges of energy and water the total et in a broader definition as well as the components i e soil water evaporation plant transpiration canopy interception loss and snow ice sublimation can be estimated directly by etmonitor the shuttleworth wallace dual source scheme adopted in etmonitor for soil evaporation and plant transpiration separation was a two layer model with rigorous physical treatment of the interactions between soil and canopy and its ability for et estimation has been well revealed after tested at site and basin scales in different climatic conditions and vegetation types e g iritz et al 1999 ortega farias et al 2007 zhou et al 2006 cui et al 2021 chen et al 2022a in contrast to the big leaf model such as the penman monteith equation etmonitor describes explicitly the water fluxes from the soil surface and from the vegetation canopy which are inherently different because transpiration is active leaves up taking water from the root zone soil layer through plant physiological process whereas soil evaporation comes from soil water at near surface soil layer cui and jia 2021 rainfall interception loss is considered an important process in particular in regions with humid climate and dense canopies etmonitor adopted a revised gash analytical model and combined remote sensing observations to estimate global rainfall interception losses zheng and jia 2020 initially the rs gash model remote sensing based gash model implemented in etmonitor was developed at regional scale cui and jia 2014 cui et al 2015 using vegetation canopy structure parameters derived from remote sensing observations the revised gash model was successfully applied for global estimation of canopy rainfall interception loss zheng and jia 2020 overall the above mentioned developments from our earlier work guaranteed the physical robustness of etmonitor which advanced many other models or algorithms based on machine learning or empirical approaches moreover etmonitor model can take the advantage of various land surface variables parameters derived from a broad range of independent datasets from satellite observations to estimate daily actual et and the components at 1 km spatial resolution compared with the traditional land surface model combined models driven by satellite earth observation is superior in terms that it can maximize the use of satellite earth observations to estimate the spatial variation of global land surface et for example in this study etmonitor updated the daily land cover condition by using daily global surface water change data from ji et al 2018 and 8 day mod10 snow ice cover data thus enabling it to reflect the impact of seasonal variation in land cover types on et estimation which is especially important for regions with seasonal water and snow cover although it has long been noted that the seasonal variation of regional water evaporation is closely related to the water surface coverage or area zhao and liu 2017 guo et al 2019 zhao and guo 2019 few studies have considered the impact of seasonal water coverage on water evaporation estimation at global scale according to our estimation in current study the global terrestrial water surface evaporation would be underestimated by 25 supplementary figure s10 if annual constant water cover instead of daily water cover used further leading to an error of 0 72 in the estimate of global total et if seasonal snow ice cover was not taken into account the global total sublimation would be underestimated by 54 08 in many previous studies annual or multi annual constant land cover maps were usually used for global et estimation e g mu et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 xie et al 2022 for example annual mcd12 land cover was used as input in pml v2 product zhang et al 2018 where the water body extent remained constant throughout the year which could not represent the seasonal water evaporation process caused by dynamic variation of water surface especially in flooding plains or seasonal lake watersheds difference between the annual mcd12 classification map and the actual regional water cover may lead to the overestimation or underestimation of regional et depending on the difference between the yearly mcd12 classification and the actual water cover of a region etmonitor used surface soil moisture data derived from microwave remote sensing observations to describe the constrains of soil water on transpiration and soil evaporation hu and jia 2015 zheng et al 2019 however the currently available daily soil moisture data based on satellite based passive microwave observations have fairly coarse spatial resolutions about 10 25 km gruber et al 2019 pen et al 2017 we therefore developed a machine learning algorithm to downscale the global soil moisture from 0 25 to 1 km resolution using optical remote sensing data at moderate resolution in this study and obtained very promising results both the downscaled soil moisture and the estimated et showed very promising results when compared to ground measurements furthermore the etmonitor has great advantages in obtaining spatiotemporally continuous global et products compared to the energy balance based et estimation method the latter requires land surface temperature retrieved from thermal infrared radiance observed by satellite and can only be observed on cloudless days jia et al 2009 this also partly explained the fact that global spatiotemporally continuous et product in moderate resolution based on the energy balance method is very rare modis published its well known global et product mod16 with 8 day and 500m resolution mu et al 2011 and recently gleam global et product achieved daily and 0 25 resolution martens et al 2017 clearly the mod16 product has better potential in regional applications for water resource management and drought assessment than gleam due to its higher spatial resolution mu et al 2013 and gleam product is superior in the long term climate change study due to its longer term of time series miralles et al 2014 the proposed etmonitor algorithm and its implementation of global product in this study has both the moderate spatial resolution 1 km of mod16 500m and the high temporal resolution daily of gleam such a resolution is thought to be sufficient for both regional and global scale applications for water resources management drought assessment and climate change assessment 5 2 the performance of global et product previous studies have presented the high accuracy of etmonitor for regional applications hu and jia 2015 li et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 sriwongsitanon et al 2020 weerasinghe et al 2020 shang et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 in this study the global et estimated by etmonitor also demonstrated a good performance at both site scale and global scale to ensure the accuracy of the estimated global et the most sensitive parameters in etmonitor algorithm were calibrated by using flux tower measurements the two calibrated parameters i e the rs min minimal stomatal resistance for plant transpiration and kvpd vpd stress parameter for plant transpiration were mostly related to the plant stomatal activities that control transpiration compared with the flux tower measurements of flux collected from 251 sites around the world the overall daily rmse and r of global et estimated by etmonitor were 0 93 mm d 1 and 0 75 respectively with more than 80 of the sites having r larger than 0 6 and rmse smaller than 1 2 mm d 1 the accuracy of daily et was greatly improved when it was aggregated to 8 day or monthly time scale despite low r values in some cases such as evergreen broadleaf forest in the humid regions their rmse values were quite low and still indicated moderate performance generally the global et estimated by etmonitor has the lowest rmse relative to ground measurements compared with other global et products table 4 which highlights the high accuracy of global et estimated by etmonitor some low rmse values were also reported by other studies such as 0 53 mm d 1 and 0 43 0 51 mm d 1 in different models fisher et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 but these studies were carried out in small areas or at longer time scale in our study the low rmse values were achieved by etmonitor in much larger spatial extent and fine time scale with the rmse less than 1 mm d 1 at 65 of ground sites tested in this study furthermore with better quality of regional input data to be available the accuracy of et estimation by etmonitor is expected to increase significantly for example former studies have proved that the etmonitor reached very high accuracy rmse 0 59 mm d 1 in the heihe basin an inland river basin in the arid and semi arid northwest china when more accurate regional input datasets were available hu and jia 2015 in previous studies the original version of etmonitor developed by hu and jia 2015 was applied for global et estimation with reported rmse of 1 10 mm d 1 and r of 0 6 zheng et al 2016 jia et al 2018 in current study the accuracy is much more improved when compared with extensive observation data globally even though the site scale validation may be controversial due to the scattered sites and limited ground observations the site scale comparisons can still provide a valuable reference for the accuracy of et products baldocchi 2003 mccabe and wood 2006 wilson et al 2002 zheng et al 2016 the uncertainties of the et estimation method could be further quantified with the upscaled in situ et observations to overcome the problem of the scale mis match between the footprint of ground flux measurements and the model pixel size liu et al 2016 li et al 2021 we also noticed that the different performance of estimated et over different land covers the relatively large rmse was found in open water evaporation mainly in lakes and low kge was found in snow ice sublimation estimation fig 6 current method estimates water evaporation as well as snow ice sublimation using penman combination equation in a straightforward way by only considering the major meteorological governing variables net radiation reached the water surface vpd and wind speed however it ignored there are some hidden physical processes e g time scale dependent feedbacks of water evaporation to water surface temperature and the dependence of energy storage in water body on the water depth and water quality e g the water salinity water clarity suspended solids blanken et al 2011 li et al 2016 mor et al 2018 guo et al 2019 mesquita et al 2020 for example water evaporation has negative feedback on water temperature that is water evaporation consume energy which decreases the water surface temperature and further reduces the evaporation rate friedrich et al 2018 the rate at which such feedback occurs depends on the meteorological forcing and the thermal inertia of the water body the latter depends on mean water depth and water quality these indicate the necessity of further improvement on the algorithm for evaporation estimation from open water further study will be conducted to consider the aforementioned complexities that govern water evaporation to improve the total et estimation furthermore the et estimated by etmonitor had reliable global pattern and better performance in showing the spatial variation of et in the mountain regions and irrigated cropland than other global et products we compared the spatial patterns and temporal variations of et product of etmonitor with five exiting remote sensing based et products besides the difference in physical parameterization and model structure of these models the use of different forcing datasets also partly explained the differences in the et products badgley et al 2015 globally the spatial pattern of et is related to the atmospheric moisture demand or land surface moisture supply jung et al 2010 the regions with medium high atmospheric demand and unlimited moisture supply e g regions with tropical and temperate climate regimes tend to have high et while regions with low moisture supply or low atmospheric demand regions with arid and cold climate regimes tend to have low et globally etmonitor could capture the expected global et patterns both spatially and temporally and showed consistent global et patterns with gleam and fluxcom et products but these et products had much coarser spatial resolution 0 25 moreover etmonior showed superior performance in mountain regions with complex topography and irrigated cropland regions than other five global et products by capturing much better spatial patterns and variations in these regions on the contrary some global remote sensing based et products e g flxucom eb and pml v2 failed to capture the spatial variation of et in mountain regions e g the alps mountain and hengduan mountain regions and some of them e g mod16 failed to capture the spatial variation of et in irrigated cropland regions e g middle reach of heihe basin middle reach of indus basin while some e g gleam failed in both regions fig 9 all these give us the confidence in further applications of analysis using our etmonitor global et product and encourage us to further extend the etmonitor product to longer periods for climate change studies it should also be noticed that the accuracy of the estimated et relies on the input data and the et estimation method there is a need to improve the accuracy of the input data e g satellite based land cover map lai soil moisture etc the satellite soil moisture also is very likely to be inaccurate especially in extremely humid and extremely arid regions areas with high vegetation fraction covered and areas with high radio frequency interference rfi kim et al 2018 the errors in soil moisture products certainly introduce uncertainty into the estimated et to reduce the error introduced by the input soil moisture data we chose the esa cci soil moisture product as input which combined data from different sensors to achieve high accuracy gruber et al 2019 the esa cci soil moisture product spanning from 1982 to the present has been critically evaluated and is considered to be the most reliable satellite soil moisture product zeng et al 2015 dorigo et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 ling et al 2021 wang et al 2021a b we also noticed that the error of soil moisture did not linearly propagate to the estimated et zheng et al 2021 when the soil moisture is very high e g near the field capacity soil moisture does not stress the evapotranspiration process and the overestimation of soil moisture in extremely humid regions or periods does not propagate to the estimated et when the soil moisture is very low such as near or below the permanent wilting point the soil moisture constraint factor for plant transpiration is almost equal to zero so underestimating soil moisture has a very limited impact on the accuracy of estimating et the role of soil moisture is more pronounced in semi arid and arid regions thus errors in soil moisture brings greater uncertainty to et estimate in these regions than in humid regions zheng et al 2021 even so the et estimation by etmonitor in the arid regions is still in good agreement with the ground observation with rmse less than 1 mm d 1 in most cases according to our estimation table s2 indicating the reliability of etmonitor model 5 3 the global water consumption and et components partitioning it is generally agreed that about 60 70 of the global land precipitation returns to the atmosphere through et and the rest was mainly available for runoff according to different global climate model gcm results in previous studies lim and roderick 2009 trenberth et al 2007 stephens et al 2020 the annual global land surface et estimated by etmonitor is 73 57 1 39 103 km3 yr 1 which falls within the reasonable range of reported values 58 103 85 103 km3 yr 1 rodell et al 2015 miralles et al 2016 stephens et al 2020 ma et al 2021 typical values of annual global et could be found as 65 103 km3 yr 1 by upscaling fluxnet observations jung et al 2011 and 84 4 103 km3 yr 1 by era interim reanalysis dataset miralles et al 2016 the water consumption expressed by et also showed significant variation among different land cover types determined by actual et per unit area and the distributed area of each type only those with both large area distribution and high et values were proved to be the large water consumers e g the croplands which had significant importance in ensuring the food security several studies reported the partitioning of global land surface et mainly using global land surface process models isotope observations sap flow and satellite earth observations miralles et al 2016 moran et al 2009 wang erlandsson et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 however the global ratio of transpiration to et yet remains uncertain jasechko et al 2013 martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 for example a recent study showed that the large discrepancies in et partitioning were observed between the different methods and gleam tended to underestimate soil evaporation and overestimate plant transpiration compared to the observations which may partly be due to the ignorance of soil evaporation under vegetation canopy chen et al 2022b although it is generally agreed that transpiration is the major component of et globally large variation in et components among different land cover types and climatic regimes was observed in our study our estimation suggested that global transpiration accounted for 63 of global total et slightly lower than that from gleam 74 and isotope technologies but within the previously reported range 35 80 coenders gerrits et al 2014 jasechko et al 2013 miralles et al 2016 mu et al 2011 to further validate the et partitioning some new et components separation methods and reliable global observation dataset of each et component are expected coenders gerrits et al 2014 jasechko et al 2013 miralles et al 2016 6 conclusion this study presented the improvement of etmonitor a multi parameterization based model for generating spatially and temporally continuous daily et at global scale during 2000 2019 at moderate resolution 1 km by utilizing multiple sources of advanced satellite earth observation data to ensure the accuracy of the et estimated from etmonitor this study carried out several works for implementing the etmonitor in global et estimation including 1 utilizing datasets of dynamic surface water cover and snow ice cover at high temporal resolution as input to simulate the impact of their seasonal change on et variation 2 downscaling spatial coarse resolution soil moisture derived from microwave remote sensing to 1 km resolution based on a machine learning method for accurate global et simulation 3 estimating global soil heat flux at 1 km resolution for better calculation of available energy and et 4 calibrating the most sensitive parameters in etmonitor model based on in situ surface flux observations to improve the accuracy of canopy surface resistance estimated et overall the et estimated by etmonitor agreed well with ground measurements from 251 flux towers across various ecosystems and climate zones with high correlation 0 75 low bias 0 08 mm d 1 and low root mean square error 0 93 mm d 1 the estimated et showed reasonable spatial patterns and superior in presenting the spatial variation of et especially in the mountain regions and in the arid irrigated cropland regions than other global et products e g the gleam and mod16 et products etmonitor has the capability of separating plant transpiration soil evaporation canopy rainfall interception loss open water evaporation and snow ice sublimation in satisfactory accuracies the performance of separation of plant transpiration and soil evaporation was very promising with rmse of 12 74 and r of 0 94 when compared with the in situ stable isotope observations of water flux the evaluation of different et components was still limited due to the scarcity of available data and comprehensive evaluation based on more observations would help to further improve the performance of etmonitor future focus will also be on improving parameterization methods for open water evaporation and snow ice sublimation this study could benefit studies in the global climate change

2859,evapotranspiration et is an essential ecohydrological process linking the land surface energy water and carbon cycles and plays a critical role in the earth system et remains one of the most problematic components of the water cycle to be determined due to the heterogeneity of the landscape and the complexity of driving factors the satellite based earth observation is expected to provide et information at large scales however accurate global et information with spatially and temporally continuous coverage at moderate to high resolution is still scarce in this paper a combined model called etmonitor with multi process parameterizations was improved and applied to estimate the global et mainly using the biophysical and hydrological parameters variables retrieved from satellite observations the etmonitor model was improved in several aspects in this study to generate the global et datasets during 2000 2019 at daily 1 km resolution including 1 adopting high temporal resolution surface water cover and snow ice cover as input to simulate the impact of their seasonal change on et variation 2 parameterizing the impact of soil moisture on plant transpiration and soil evaporation using high resolution soil moisture which was downscaled to 1 km resolution from the coarse resolution data retrieved from microwave remote sensing observation 3 involving a better soil heat flux estimation to reduce its impact on the uncertainty of estimated et 4 being calibrated based on global ground flux observations to achieve better accuracy the estimated daily et was validated based on the global in situ observations at site scale across various ecosystems with overall high correlation 0 75 low bias 0 08 mm d 1 and low root mean square error 0 93 mm d 1 it had good ability to partition total et to plant transpiration and soil evaporation indicated by the good agreement with the ground isotope measurements in a growing season at one site in the northwest china the estimated global et was cross validated by comparing with other existing et products and it showed the global et estimated by etmonitor could capture the expected global et patterns both in space and in time it also indicated the superiority of the et product by etmonitor in the following aspects capability in capturing the seasonal dynamics of waterbody evaporation and sublimation better performance in capturing the spatial variation of et in the irrigated cropland regions and mountain regions with complex terrain than other global et products e g the gleam and mod16 et products capability of et component partitioning at high spatial 1 km and high temporal daily resolutions with good accuracy the estimated plant transpiration soil evaporation canopy rainfall interception loss and water body evaporation and snow sublimation accounted for 61 54 0 44 19 08 0 54 13 54 0 49 and 5 84 0 24 respectively of the total et on global average the etmonitor global et dataset could

customized regions or periods can also be provided upon user request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et linking the land surface water and energy cycles has been considered a key process for understanding the earth climate system and the complex heat water exchange between the land surface and the overlaying atmosphere allen et al 1998 schwalm et al 2011 evapotranspiration has huge potential applications in irrigation scheduling management of water and land resources monitoring and assessment of floods and droughts for disaster management and more furthermore in the context of global scarcity of high quality freshwater resources the information of how much water used by crops and natural ecosystems through et is critical for optimizing water allocation among different competing sectors such as agriculture industry people and the environment oki and kanae 2006 the satellite earth observation can provide multiple biophysical variables which have tremendous potential to serve as input to models or algorithms that are developed to estimate the regional and global et and are able to reflect the impact of land surface heterogeneity and climate variability on et however accurate global et information or dataset with spatially and temporally continuous coverage and at moderate resolution referred to 1 km pixel size in this study is still scarce the primary factor limited the et accuracy and spatiotemporal coverage is the remote sensing et models several models have been developed to estimate land surface et based on satellite earth observation data and many of them have been proven to be able to obtain et information at different spatial scales from regional to global coverage bastiaanssen et al 1998 bastiaanssen et al 2012 hu and jia 2015 long et al 2010 miralles et al 2011 mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 nishida et al 2003 norman et al 1995 su 2002 zhang et al 2010 zheng et al 2016 the statistical methods including the simple empirical regression models and the recently developed data driven models rely heavily on the selections of predictor variables the accuracy of the selected algorithms e g empirical equations or machine learning algorithms and the reliability of the training dataset and they may lead to significant uncertainties when applied globally fisher et al 2009 hu et al 2021 jung et al 2009 2019 koppa et al 2022 papale and valentini 2003 wang et al 2007 the surface energy balance type algorithm based on thermal infrared remote sensing technologies is restricted in cloud free condition and not able to provide continuous et dataset with high temporal resolution without a proper interpolation li et al 2013 jia et al 2009 which prevent its application from generating the spatially and temporally continuous et product large uncertainty may also be introduced in surface energy balance type algorithm if the difference between aerodynamic temperature and land surface temperature lst by thermal infrared remote sensing is not properly treated especially over areas with strong land surface thermal heterogeneity e g in arid semi arid region where large contrast in surface temperatures between soil and vegetation occurs often or in mountain regions li et al 2013 the combined model is the most attractive approach to obtain the spatially and temporally continuous et over large scales and it seems to work well for both energy limited and water stressed conditions for vegetated areas bastiaanssen et al 2012 mu et al 2007 mu et al 2011 hu and jia 2015 for example the penman monteith equation based algorithm used to generate modis global et product called pm mod et hereafter developed by mu et al 2007 and mu et al 2011 is one of the most well known operational remote sensing et models however it showed relatively large bias in the arid and semi arid regions and significant underestimate could be found in the irrigated croplands due to its inadequate consideration of soil moisture constraint on et hu et al 2015 michel et al 2016 kim et al 2018 the accuracy in the estimated et by combined model is expected to be significantly improved after considering the soil moisture constraint on et and optimization of model parameters should be done carefully for global et estimation application miralles et al 2011 purdy et al 2018 jia et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 another important factor influencing the accuracy of et dataset is the driving force especially those input variables retrieved from satellite remote sensing there are some available global et datasets based on satellite observation for scientific research and applications jung et al 2019 martens et al 2017 mu et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 they generally adopted satellite observations from visible to thermal infrared band for et estimation according to the theoretical scheme of the model used chen and liu 2020 constant land cover map i e the modis based mcd12 land cover product was usually adopted as a key input when producing these et products and they neglect the influence of yearly or seasonal land cover change on the et estimation making them difficult to capture the temporal variation of et in regions with high temporal dynamics in land cover especially in regions with rapid changes in water body and snow cover large temporal variation of pixel wised water cover often happens in flooding plains changing between water covered or non water covered conditions or in high elevation lakes shifting between water and ice cover with seasons and this phenomenon can only be captured by the daily or seasonal water cover dataset but not by mcd12 ji et al 2018 the governing processes of the evaporation from water surface are different from that over other surfaces e g soil vegetation leading to different values of total et in water cover pixel and non water cover pixel hence ignoring temporal water cover variation may led to large uncertainties in et estimation in particular in areas with high dynamics of water surface like in many seasonal flooding plains and areas with frequently short lived water bodies similar cases also held true for regions with seasonal snow ice cover pixels while the accumulation or melting of snow will have impact on the regional et significantly strasser et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 the spatial resolution is widely concerned for the global et dataset and et at higher spatial resolution is more useful than at coarse resolution for farmland water use and management the development of global et at moderate resolution was hindered by the low spatial resolution of available global soil moisture datasets when using combined method i e pm equation based conductance type method satellite remote sensing observation based on microwave sensors can provide soil moisture to support et monitoring with the advantage of less influenced by cloud and capability of penetrating through the cloud and into non dense vegetation canopy with less attenuation the global surface soil moisture products retrieved from active passive micro wave observations of satellite remote sensing e g the advanced microwave scanning radiometer eos amsr e kawanishi 2003 the advanced scatterometer ascat and the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos soil moisture active passive smap wagner et al 1999 kerr 2007 entekhabi et al 2010 usually have coarse spatial resolution e g 0 25 some global studies on et estimation were carried out by implementing global soil moisture from satellite observation at coarse resolution for example in global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam algorithm the esa cci soil moisture product was used as water stress factors ranging between 0 maximum stress and thus no evaporation and 1 no stress and thus potential evaporation to regulate priestley and taylor pt equation for global actual et estimation at 0 25 resolution miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 recently the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl model was also updated to incorporate surface soil moisture from smap dataset to improve the accuracy of global et estimation purdy et al 2018 relatively high resolution 1 km et estimation were mostly conducted at regional or basin scales bastiaanssen et al 2012 hu and jia 2015 using downscaled soil moisture from its original coarse resolution many efforts have made on using different ways to downscale soil moisture from 0 25 resolution to moderate resolution i e 1 km alemohammad et al 2018 peng et al 2017 song et al 2014 either relying on simple methods usually with large uncertainties or using more elaborate method with higher accuracy but not practical for large scale application to obtain gap free soil moisture dataset at global scale e g those using lst as input consequently it is worth exploring the potential of generating moderate resolution e g 1 km soil moisture dataset with reasonable accuracy from the usual 0 25 resolution data at global scale and implement these moderate resolution soil moisture data in et estimation algorithms to generate global et product et partitioning is also a great challenge in remote sensing et studies although some remote sensing et algorithms could provide basic et components their partitioning ability has not well addressed different et components are associated with different physical mechanisms and processes e g transpiration is mainly controlled by the plant physiology including its stomata behavior in response to environmental conditions soil evaporation is highly related to the atmosphere water demand and surface soil water content the rainfall interception loss is mainly related to the canopy morphology and rainfall intensity miralles et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 recent study demonstrated that even the total et in global remote sensing product is accurately estimated the simulated components show significant deviations from observations and the global ratio of transpiration and evaporation to total et yet remains uncertain martens et al 2017 this study aims at developing an accurate global et product with et components at global scale with spatially and temporally continuous coverage and at moderate resolution and the main objectives include 1 to improve an operational global et model for global et estimation with high accuracy 2 to generate a global long term gap free et product with the high resolution and ability of partitioning et to different components 3 and to demonstrate the accuracy of the estimated global et by comparing with the ground measurements and other existing et products a global gap free et dataset at daily time step and 1 km spatial resolution with long term time series 20 years was generated by applying the developed method driven by multi source satellite earth observations and atmospheric forcing data compared with previous studies the estimated et in current study have several advantages in terms of accuracy spatiotemporal continuity and resolution and et partitioning ability and these were achieved mainly by several improvements in current study including the adoption of seasonal dynamics of surface water cover and snow ice cover the calibration of sensitivity parameters based on global flux observation the retrieval of high resolution soil moisture and soil heat flux and their application in et estimation 2 methodology the etmonitor model driven by multiple remote sensing observations will be used in this study the etmonitor model has been applied over different land surfaces in different climate regions hu and jia 2015 zheng et al 2019 this study will focus on realizing the global scale application of etmonitor at daily and 1 km spatial resolution by several practical improvements as below 1 to estimate daily mean soil heat flux by building a machine learning method and include soil heat flux in the energy balance equation used in the etmonitor soil heat flux was neglected in the earlier version of etmonitor for daily et calculation 2 to improve spatial resolution of surface soil moisture derived from satellite observations from 25 km to 1 km based on machine learning algorithm and apply the 1 km soil moisture to the calculation of canopy surface and soil surface resistances for plant transpiration and soil evaporation estimation in etmonitor 3 to consider the impact of rapid change in water body area on the et estimation in each model grid by using water body area data with high temporal resolution derived from satellite observations 4 to optimize the model parameters using flux measurements from global flux tower sites to reduce the uncertainty in the global et estimation resulted from using empirical values of model parameters in the following sections these new developments will be described in detail while the full basic model equations can be found in our earlier papers hu and jia 2015 jia et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 2 1 model description and implementation in global scale the etmonitor model was designed to estimate et using multi source satellite observations by considering the energy budget water balance and plant physiology processes in the parameterizations of land atmosphere energy and water exchange hu and jia 2015 the etmonitor is composed by several modules to model major processes or components of terrestrial evapotranspiration including plant transpiration soil evaporation vegetation canopy interception loss water body evaporation and snow ice sublimation fig 1 strictly speaking sublimation is neither evaporation nor evapotranspiration miralles et al 2020 we refer it as part of et for simplicity the etmonitor in this study runs at daily time step and 1 km spatial grid at global scale in each model grid the component processes may happen jointly depending on weather and land surface conditions e g both soil evaporation and plant transpiration could occur over soil vegetation canopy on the same day or soil evaporation and water evaporation may happen in a grid composed of bare soil and open water surface the land cover data are adopted to distinguish the sources of et in a model grid to initialize different et components estimation using respective modules in the etmonitor in the etmonitor the terrestrial surface et is calculated as the sum of all components 1 et e c e s e i e w e ss where ec mm d 1 is plant transpiration es mm d 1 is soil evaporation ei mm d 1 is canopy rainfall interception loss ew mm d 1 is open water evaporation and ess mm d 1 is snow ice sublimation for soil vegetation canopy system plant transpiration and soil evaporation in etmonitor are estimated using shuttleworth wallace two source scheme shuttleworth and wallace 1985 combined with a jarvis type method to estimate canopy resistance to transpiration where the minimum canopy resistance is regulated by soil moisture and other environmental variables jarvis 1976 steward 1988 canopy interception loss ei is estimated using a revised gash model gash et al 1995 zheng and jia 2020 for the water or snow ice surface the water evaporation and snow ice sublimation are estimated by penman combination equation details are described in the following sections in practice the available energy i e the difference between net radiation flux and soil heat flux is first calculated for soil vegetation canopy the net radiation is partitioned among the processes of plant transpiration soil evaporation and canopy rainfall interception loss when applicable 2 1 1 net radiation estimation and partitioning the total net radiation rn w m 2 that reaches the land surface is the energy force of et process available energy i e the difference between net radiation and the ground heat flux g w m 2 is partitioned between sensible and latent heat fluxes at the land surface and the surface energy balance equation can be written as 2 r n g λ e t h where λet w m 2 is the latent heat flux associated with et mm d 1 and h w m 2 is the sensible heat flux rn is calculated as the difference between incoming and outgoing radiation fluxes both in shortwave and longwave by the following equation 3a rn 1 α 0 r s r l σ ε t 4 1 ε r l 3b ε ε s 1 f c ε v f c where α 0 dimensionless is land surface albedo rs w m 2 is incoming shortwave radiation ε dimensionless is broadband land surface emissivity εs and εv are broadband emissivity of bare soil 0 96 and vegetation 0 98 respectively rl w m 2 is incoming longwave radiation σ 5 67 10 8 w m 2 k 4 is stephan boltzman constant t k is the daily averaged land surface temperature fc is the fractional vegetation cover similar to cleugh et al 2007 we use daily averaged air temperature to replace land surface temperature when applying eq 3a as the satellite based land surface temperature observation is generally available at the satellite overpass time in clear sky condition and daily averaged land surface temperature is difficult to obtain the eq 3a showed good performance in rn estimation in the study by cleugh et al 2007 the estimated rn using eq 3a in our study also showed low rmse and high correlation coefficient compared with ground observation results presented in section 4 1 for the soil vegetation canopy rn is partitioned among three components 4 rn rn i rn c rn s where rni w m 2 represents the net radiation intercepted by the vegetation canopy and used for evaporating water from the wet canopy surface rainfall interception loss which is only applicable on rainy days rnc w m 2 is the net radiation intercepted by the vegetation canopy for plant transpiration rns w m 2 is the net radiation at the underneath soil surface after penetrating the vegetation canopy to estimate rni during the rainfall days ei was first estimated and rni was calculated according to ei it was under the assumption that the canopy rainfall interception loss is fully evaporated during the rainfall days even we noticed this assumption might lead to certain uncertainty and the wet canopy evaporation could last for a few days after rainfall it was acceptable for daily et estimation and applied in many previous studies miralles et al 2016 hu and jia 2015 wang et al 2019 rni is zero on non rainy days the intercepted net radiation flux by vegetation canopy and that received by the underneath surface were estimated as 5a rn c f c r n rn i 5b rn s 1 f c r n rn i 2 1 2 ground heat flux estimation for soil surface either with or without vegetation canopy ground heat flux g is the heat flux entering or leaving the soil at soil surface which is the residual of the net radiation partition between sensible and latent heat fluxes both for vegetation canopy and soil surface for the water surface g represented the heat flux at open water surface for snow surface g represented the heat flux at the snowpack surface g was neglected in the earlier version of etmonitor hu and jia 2015 studies showed that g could account for up to 30 of rn for bare soil bennett et al 2008 so that error may be introduced in et estimation if g is neglected especially in areas with sparse vegetation cover where the g usually plays a significant role in energy balance at daily scale bennett et al 2008 li et al 2015 purdy et al 2016 study showed that the widely used approaches for regional g estimation in different et models by taking g as a fraction of rn e g surface energy balance system sebs gleam and pm mod algorithms generally overestimated g with the root mean square error rmse more than 10 w m 2 at daily scale purdy et al 2016 to improve the accuracy in global daily et estimate by better simulation of g a machine learning model using random forest rf algorithm was developed and applied to estimate g at global scale in this study the rf can generate independent regression trees through randomly selecting training samples automatically and it can handle the high dimensional data and nonlinear problems the rf algorithm combines many weak learners decision trees into one stronger predictor by aggregating the predictions from all decision trees in regression in this study the rf model to estimate g was firstly trained with in situ observation from the fluxnet2015 dataset five variables were selected as interpreting variables including rn leaf area index lai air temperature albedo and saturated soil water content the number of decision trees in the ensemble was set as 300 and it could result in stable accuracy the number of predictor variables was typically one third of the variables for regression and it was set as 2 in current study the rf model for g estimation was trained through the bagging approach for each node approximately two thirds in bag samples of all samples are randomly selected to train the decision tree and the remaining 1 3 samples out of bag were applied to test the performance of the well trained rf model the trained rf model was further applied to estimate daily g with input data in each pixel for global application 2 1 3 soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration in etmonitor the total evapotranspiration from the vegetation soil system under rainfall free days no rainfall interception was the sum of the es and ec the core equations for soil evaporation and plant transpiration were based on the shuttleworth wallace s w dual source model combined with parameterizations for a series of resistances the soil surface resistance in s w model r s s was estimated by a simple equation related to surface soil moisture θ surf expressed as the degree of saturation in percentage 6 r s s r ss m i n θ surf b 7 θ surf θ θ res θ sat θ res where r ss m i n was the minimum soil resistance s m 1 representing the r s s value under sufficient water condition b was a parameter describing the sensitivity of r s s to θ surf varying with soil types and climate conditions clapp and hornberger 1978 bastiaanssen et al 2012 and it was parameterized as a linear function of θ sat saturated soil moisture m3 m 3 θ was the surface volumetric soil moisture m3 m 3 provided by remote sensing dataset θ res was residual soil moisture m3 m 3 θ sat and θ res were derived from the map of soil properties the canopy surface resistance r s c was estimated as the reciprocal of the canopy conductance upscaled from leaf stomatal conductance taking into account leaves density of the canopy represented by lai the leaf stomatal conductance was computed by well known jarvis type model jarvis 1976 and in this study we considered several environmental variables i e the solar radiation rs vapor pressure deficit vpd air temperature ta and root zone soil moisture θroot to regulate the minimum leaf stomatal resistance or maximum conductance similar to the formula by steward 1988 these finally led to the following equation to estimate r s c of vegetation canopy 8 r s c r s m i n f r s f v p d f t a f θ root lai eff where r s m i n was the minimum leaf stomatal resistance s m 1 lai eff was the effective leaf area index to upscale water transfer from leaf to canopy level and was estimated based on actual lai by an empirical formula following allen et al 2006 the environmental constraint functions f r s f v p d f t a and f θ root varying between 0 and 1 represented the constraints of solar radiation vpd air temperature and root zone soil moisture to the stomatal conductance steward 1988 mo et al 2004 expressed as 9a f r s 1 e x p r s k r 9b f v p d 1 k d v p d 9c f t a t a t min t opt t min t max t a t max t opt t max t opt t opt t min 9d f θ root m i n 1 max 0 θ root θ wilt θ fc θ wilt where k r and k d are fitting parameters that described the sensitivity of stomatal conductance to incoming shortwave radiation and vpd θ fc and θ wilt represented the thresholds of soil moisture in root zone layer at which the plant stomata would be fully open and closed they were respectively taken as the soil moisture at the field capacity and permanent wilting point derived from the soil properties map zhang et al 2018 t min t max and t opt were the minimum maximum and optimum air temperatures that influence the stomatal activity respectively θ root could not be directly retrieved from satellite earth observations to obtain θ root two approaches were provided in the etmonitor for the first approach a three layer soil water transfer model based on richard equation was established to simulate θ root by assimilating surface soil moisture of satellite product to reduce the uncertainty of root zone moisture simulation cui and jia 2021 however this procedure is more suitable for farmland scale application and very time consuming when applied to global scale estimate at 1 km resolution and daily time step for the second approach the soil was divided into two layers i e the topsoil layer with a few centimeters depth assuming measurements by microwave sensors of satellite remote sensing could penetrate and the subsoil layer that could reach the root zone of vegetation in this simplified scheme a simple relationship between θ root and θ surf was applied to estimate root zone soil moisture following bastiaanssen et al 2012 and hu and jia 2015 this second simple method was adopted in current study to estimate θ root for the purpose of practical application at global scale for daily et estimate at 1 km resolution obviously topsoil layer moisture is crucial information to ensure the accuracy of et estimate at global application popularly available surface soil moisture data are provided by microwave remote sensing observations with coarse spatial resolution e g 25 km which is not sufficient for studies at 1 km spatial resolution we have applied a machine learning method to downscale the soil moisture data at 25 km resolution to 1 km resolution see section 3 1 the values of model parameters i e k r t min t max and t opt in eqs 8 9 were taken according to vegetation types as in previous study while the values of r s m i n and k d were calibrated using ground data from flux tower sites since etmonitor was found most sensitive to these two parameters see section 2 2 1 for details 2 1 4 canopy rainfall interception loss estimation canopy rainfall interception loss ei is the portion of rainfall that falls on the vegetation canopy but never reaches the ground evaporate from the wet canopy into the atmosphere instead dunin et al 1988 van dijk et al 2015 rain that hits plant surfaces is temporarily retained and eventually either evaporates into the atmosphere interception loss or falls to the ground by dripping or by running down branches and stems stemflow rain that does not hit a plant surface is called free throughfall and together with dripping is often referred to as throughfall david et al 2005 ei was estimated by a revised gash analytical model zheng and jia 2020 which was a rainfall event based model that successfully applied on daily basis with the assumption of one storm per rainy day different from the initial gash model which estimated the rainfall interception by canopy and trunk separately in the current study the total rainfall interception loss was estimated by taking the canopy and trunk as a whole following zheng and jia 2020 2 1 5 open water body evaporation estimation a wide variety of methods for estimating open water evaporation have been reported in the literature which could be categorized into several types mass balance models energy budget models bulk transfer models combination models the equilibrium temperature method and empirical factors method in etmonitor model the penman combination equation was used for water evaporation ew mm estimation the penman equation is a physically based and widely used method to estimate evaporation from open water bodies under varying locations and climatic conditions and it is practical for large scale applications penman 1948 shuttleworth 1993 valiantzas 2006 more elaborated methods e g wang et al 2020 among others could be used if all input data can be obtained for global scale application the day by day variation of surface water cover from satellite observations was used in this study to consider the impact of change in water body area on the estimated total et in each model grid the pixels marked as water by the data of water body area were re classed as water in the background land cover map for estimation of daily evaporation from open water otherwise other components e g soil evaporation would be estimated according to background land cover map 2 1 6 snow ice sublimation estimation in the snow or ice covered or partially covered area the solid water could turn to gaseous phase through sublimation process which could dominant the moisture loss from land surface to the atmosphere in snow covered areas especially in the polar and high elevation regions or in regions with seasonal snow snow ice sublimation is mainly controlled by wind air humidity and radiation kuchment and gelfan 1996 strasser et al 2008 moore 1983 schmidt et al 1998 and can be estimated using empirical equation e g the kuzmin formula kuzmin 1953 was used in previous version of etmonitor hu and jia 2015 recent study showed that penman combination equation was proven to be able to capture the spatiotemporal variation of snow sublimation with acceptable accuracy wang et al 2017 in this study we adopted the penman combination equation to estimate sublimation in which g was taken as the conductive heat flux at the interface between the snowpack and the soil surface and calculated as a constant proportion of rn received at the snow surface following the study of wang et al 2017 evaporation may happen over melting snow surface we neglected this process in current study in this study information of daily snow cover derived from satellite observation was adopted as an input to identify the occurrence of sublimation sublimation was then estimated only if the pixel was marked as snow ice cover otherwise estimated as other components according to the background land cover map 2 2 model calibration and validation 2 2 1 calibration of model parameters previous application of etmonitor is limited to certain regions with known climate and vegetation conditions therefore model parameters were set as fixed values taken from literature table 1 listed a summary of the nine major parameters in the etmonitor with brief explanation of their physical meaning and the range of each parameter that was commonly found in the literature many other similar models generally assumed a fixed value for each parameter for each plant functional types pft neglecting the climatic influence such treatment is not suitable to global scale application due to very diverse climate and plant conditions in this study the most sensitive model parameters in etmonitor were calibrated using ground measurements collected at flux tower stations distributed globally and the calibrated parameters were then extrapolated to each pixel globally by considering the climate regimes and pft the procedure contained four steps as described below 1 selection of sensitive parameters we identified the most sensitive parameters of the etmonitor based on efast global sensitivity analysis methods saltelli et al 1999 2004 to reduce the number of tunable model parameters the sensitivity analysis showed that etmonitor was most sensitive to parameters r s m i n minimal stomatal resistance for plant transpiration and k d the vpd stress parameter for plant transpiration involved in canopy surface resistance for transpiration and these two parameters were calibrated using the flux tower observations the calibration was done over 236 flux tower sites see section 3 3 for data description those sites with water snow ice and bare soil were not included for calibration of these two model parameters related to vegetation transpiration 2 calibration of selected parameters at site level to conduct the parameter calibration the latin hypercube sample lhs mckay et al 1979 was first applied to sample the model parameter setting and 5000 sets of parameter settings were obtained the etmonitor model was then run at each one of the 236 flux tower sites for each of these 5000 sets of parameter settings this led to a total of 1 180 000 model simulations for each simulation the etmonitor performance was obtained by comparing the daily et estimation by etmonitor with the flux tower based measurements the model performance is judged by kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 10 k g e 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the pearson correlation coefficient α is the ratio between the standard deviation σ values of the simulation and observation β is the ratio between the mean simulated and observed values kge is smaller than 1 and higher kge means better agreement between the observed and the simulated results generally various previous studies treated kge 0 as their threshold between good and bad performance and they used positive kge values as indicative of good model simulations whereas negative kge values were considered not satisfactory andersson et al 2017 fowler et al 2018 towner et al 2019 however recent studies showed that model performance in the range kge 0 41 could be considered reasonable knoben et al 2019 the parameter set with the top 10 best performance i e the 10 groups of parameter settings with the maximum kge values in the simulation results in each site was regarded as the optimal parameter set candidates which will be further evaluated to obtain the optimized parameters for different pfts and different climate regimes instead of using single optimal parameter setting for each site we selected top 10 sets of parameter settings for each site to mitigate the impact of equifinality various parameter sets may be equally capable of reproducing a similar outcome 3 optimization of parameters for different pfts and different climate regimes the selected flux sites were clustered to different groups according to their climate regimes and pfts the climate regime was defined by the sub types of köppen geiger climate classification kgc following the map from beck et al 2018 and there were totally 5 major climate zones a tropical b dry c temperate d continental e polar and 30 sub types as shown in fig 2 in the end the selected 236 flux sites were clustered into 85 kgc pft groups accordingly for each kgc pft group the forcing data from all sites of the group was lumped and all the site specific top 10 sets of parameter settings from all sites of the group obtained in the last step were also lumped together as parameter setting candidates of the target kgc pft group the total candidates number is 10 numbers of sites in the kgc pft group for example there were 22 sites labelled as dfc enf enf with the climate regimes of cold no dry season cold summer and all the parameter settings from these 22 sites were jointly lumped for the group of dfc enf i e totally 10 22 sites 220 sets of parameter settings for dfc enf the lumped parameter settings of each kgc pft group were applied for et simulation driven by the lumped forcing dataset of the target kgc pft group and the parameter setting that achieved the highest kge was taken as the optimized parameter setting of the corresponding kgc pft group 4 extrapolation of optimized parameters for global application the optimized model parameter sets for different kge pft were applied to etmonitor for global et estimation by assigning the optimized parameter settings to each 1 km grid according to the kgc pft classification in each grid in the regions not included in the calibrated 85 kgc pft groups the parameters in the nearby climate regions were taken 2 2 2 model validation we used k fold cross validation to validate the daily et estimation by etmonitor at flux tower sites in the k fold cross validation method data were separated into k partitions folds equally and each of the partitions was used for validation while the rest was used for calibration the value of k was set as 10 and the collected flux tower data were separated into 10 partitions equally of which 9 partitions were used for calibration and the remaining 1 partition the hold out part was left as unmeasured after calibration the optimized parameters were used to get new prediction values for the unmeasured partition the prediction values were then compared with the unmeasured partition for validation this procedure was repeated 10 times so that every sample was exercised strictly once during the validation procedure finally the results from all the 10 repeats were lumped to get the total accuracy of the model this validation could explore the transferability of the etmonitor model from known flux tower sites to any other sites for global application 3 data and pre processing 3 1 satellite data and pre processing the etmonitor was implemented at global scale at 1 km spatial resolution and daily temporal step using the input data from satellite earth observations including land cover types lai fractional vegetation cover fc land surface albedo surface soil moisture precipitation and canopy height table 2 3 1 1 optical remote sensing data and processing the standard modis collection 6 land cover product mcd12 was used to infer information of land cover types and 17 land cover types were identified based on the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp classification sulla menashe et al 2019 pfts provided by mcd12 igbp lc types were further used to create a look up table for the parameters in etmonitor following the description in section 2 2 the mcd12 land cover product was produced at annual scale and could not reflect the day to day variation of water cover and snow cover the snow cover product mod10a2 with 8 day temporal step was used to consider the seasonal variation of snow ice cover the 8 day maximum snow cover provided by mod10a2 product layer maximum snow extent in mod10a2 was re assigned to daily values with the help of the snow chronology bit flags for each day in the eight day observation period layer eight day snow cover in mod10a2 this daily snow ice cover information overwrote the mcd12 lc to track the land surface condition for estimation of sublimation in each pixel by etmonitor when snow ice existing the daily global surface water change database dgwcd product during 2000 2016 from ji et al 2018 was used to consider the day by day variation of surface water cover those pixels marked as water in the dgwcd were re classed as water in the land cover map for estimation of daily evaporation from open water otherwise other component e g soil evaporation would be estimated according to mcd12 lc map the dgwcd product by ji et al 2018 is available till 2016 the 8 day global surface water extent dataset from han and niu 2020 was adopted after interpolated to daily scale from 2017 onwards land cover snow cover and water cover data with 500 m resolution were resampled to 1 km resolution using the method of maximum fraction the albedo lai and fc data were from the global land surface satellite glass product and the detailed description of the glass product and methods could be found in the literature liu et al 2013a b xiao et al 2014 qu et al 2014 jia et al 2015 the glass products overcome the clouds contamination and have the advantage of providing spatially and temporally continuous information compared to the modis products the spatial resolution of glass lai and fc products were 500 m they were spatially aggregated to 1 km resolution in this study the temporal resolution of glass lai fc and albedo products were 8 day they were reconstructed to daily step by linear interpolation for further daily et estimation 3 1 2 surface soil moisture data and downscaling daily surface soil moisture was obtained from the esa cci v05 3 product with 0 25 resolution for the missing values of soil moisture in esa cci v05 3 product era5 top layer soil moisture was adopted to fill the gaps to obtain daily gap free ssm at 0 25 resolution the gap filled daily surface soil moisture at 0 25 resolution was then disaggregated to 1 km resolution based on a machine learning method inspired by the previous study that predicted the fine resolution surface soil moisture by training the relationship between the observed surface soil moisture at ground sites and coarse resolution soil moisture retrieved from satellite observations with the help of ndvi in both coarse and fine resolutions alemohammad et al 2018 in this study we adopted random forest algorithm to build the ssm downscaling model rf model was first trained to learn the nonlinear relationships between the in situ observations of ssm and different explanatory variables and the well trained rf model was then applied to predict the 1 km resolution ssm based on the spatial distributed remote sensing dataset the rf model for ssm downscaling was trained through the bagging approach with similar setting for soil heat flux estimate as described in section 2 1 2 six explanatory variables were selected to apply the rf model including ssm at 0 25 resolution ndvi at both 0 25 and 1 km resolution albedo digital elevation model dem and saturated soil water content all at 1 km resolution to obtain the downscaled ssm at 1 km resolution the 1 km resolution ndvi data were from mod13a2 product didan 2015a in order to match the spatial resolution of esa cci soil moisture data for building the rf model at the 0 25 spatial resolution the 0 25 resolution ndvi was obtained by aggregating the ndvi provided by the mod13c1 product with 0 05 resolution didan 2015b dem data was from strm30 becker et al 2009 and saturated soil water content data were from previous study zhang et al 2018 surface soil moisture of ground observation from the international soil moisture network ismn dorigo et al 2011 dorigo et al 2013 were used as response variable to train the model and to validate the downscaled results the 70 of all ismn ssm samples were randomly selected to train the rf model and the remaining 30 samples were applied to validate the performance of the trained rf model 3 1 3 other remote sensing data global daily precipitation data from global precipitation measurement gpm late run precipitation product at 0 1 resolution with improved accuracy huffman et al 2019 were used to estimate the canopy rainfall interception loss the 0 1 resolution precipitation data were downscaled to 1 km using a bilinear resampling method global map of canopy height at 1 km spatial resolution simard et al 2011 derived from the geoscience laser altimeter system glas aboard icesat ice cloud and land elevation satellite was adopted to obtain canopy height of forests in this study the glas based canopy height dataset was built based on high correlation between the glas derived canopy height values and other global variables including forest type tree cover elevation and climatology maps and agreed well with the ground observations the canopy heights of crop and grass were modeled corresponding to their growth stages following the study by zhou et al 2006 3 2 meteorological forcing data the global gridded near surface meteorological forcing data were from the era5 https cds climate copernicus eu including air temperature ta dew point temperature td air pressure pa wind speed at 10 m height u10 and v10 downward shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes rs and rl vpd was then calculated from air temperature and dew point temperature the era5 hourly meteorological forcing data with 0 25 resolution was firstly averaged to daily values and then downscaled to 1 km using statistical downscaling approaches the wind speed was downscaled using the bilinear resampling method while the rest variables were downscaled based on the semi empirical transfer functions with multiple predictor variables including topographic altitude aspect and slope following gao et al 2008 and stahl et al 2006 the topographic information was retrieved from the srtm30 dem becker et al 2009 3 3 flux tower data observation data from flux tower sites were adopted to calibrate and validate the etmonitor model measurements of land surface fluxes by the eddy covariance system collected from 251 flux tower sites globally were used to validate the estimated et these sites covering various types of ecosystems were selected by considering the following aspects these sites included all the necessary high quality input data for et estimation and validation at site level and covered at least one growing season these sites were located in relatively homogeneous area to ensure the spatial representatives for comparison with the 1 km pixel values by etmonitor the homogeneity of the land surface at the sites were visually assessed by checking 1 km 1 km area around the flux towers with a high resolution 30 m land cover map from zhang et al 2021 the sites were considered as homogeneous if one or two land cover types dominated area greater than 70 in the 1 km 1 km area around the sites the flux observation data at each site were screened by data quality evaluation those data with poor quality were not used for calibration and validation in this study the spatial distribution of the 251 sites were presented in fig 2 the list of the sites was given in supplementary table s1 most of these sites were from the global fluxnet2015 dataset and regional flux observation networks e g ameriflux euroflux asiaflux chinaflux and hiwater heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research these sites covered a wide range of global climate regimes from tropical to polar regions across 12 pfts including evergreen needleleaf forest enf evergreen broadleaf forest ebf deciduous needleleaf forest dnf deciduous broadleaf forest dbf mixed forest mf closed shrublands csh open shrublands osh woody savannas wsa savannas sav grasslands gra permanent wetlands wet and croplands cro besides those sites covered by barren or sparsely vegetated bar water wat and snow ice sno were also included for validation of et components estimation the latent heat flux observations from the selected flux tower sites were directly used without energy balance closure correction in order to reduce the uncertainty introduced by the poor quality data data screening was performed to select reliable daily observations 1 data from rainy days were excluded 2 negative values of daily et were filtered out 3 the 30 min latent heat flux data for daily aggregation were checked data from the days with larger than 20 missing observations of 30 min acquisition were excluded this procedure yielded a realistic number of reliable daily et observations to be further used for calibration and validation of the global et estimation by etmonitor 3 4 stable isotope observation of soil evaporation and plant transpiration to evaluate the components of soil evaporation and plant transpiration estimated by the etmonitor the stable isotope observations of water flux collected in daman site in the northwest china from 27 may to 21 september in 2012 were used daman site with maize crop was one of the sites of the hiwater the ratios of plant transpiration and soil evaporation to total et on daily scale were obtained based on the 18o composition of atmospheric water vapor measured using a cavity ring down spectroscopy water vapor isotope analyzer at 0 5 1 5 m height above the crop canopy wen et al 2016 the daily ratio of plant transpiration to total et ec et and daily ratio of soil evaporation to total et es et estimated by etmonitor were compared with the stable isotope observation of water fluxes 3 5 other et products for cross comparison other earth observation based et products were collected for cross comparison table 3 including the mod16 et product mu et al 2011 gleam v3 3b et product martens et al 2017 the fluxcom et dataset jung et al 2019 energy balance eb an improved sebs algorithm et product chen et al 2021 penman monteith leuning pml v2 et product zhang et al 2019 in the mod16 and fluxcom product the calculations of et were not made over non vegetated pixels i e water body barren or sparsely vegetated area permanent snow and ice permanent wetland and urban areas thus these pixels were not included for inter comparison 4 results 4 1 evaluation of key forcing variables the meteorological forcing is important inputs for et estimation and their accuracies need to be carefully validated the meteorological forcing variables from the downscaled era5 dataset generally agreed well with the ground observations demonstrated by low rmse supplementary figure s1 we further validated the estimated daily mean surface net radiation and soil heat flux both at 1 km spatial resolution against the available in situ measurements from 149 sites of fluxnet2015 149 sites among the collected 251 sites could provide reliable rn and g observations both the estimated daily mean rn and g agreed well with the measurements at flux tower sites fig 3 the temporal variation of the estimated and observed daily mean rn and g at some selected sites were shown in supplementary figure s2 and figure s3 respectively the rmse value of the estimated daily rn is 30 75 w m 2 comparable to the ceres clouds and the earth s radiant energy system rn products with rmse of 33 56 w m 2 jia et al 2016 the rmse value of the estimated daily g is 4 91 w m 2 much better than the reported accuracy with rmse ranging from 7 34 w m 2 to 14 98 w m 2 purdy et al 2016 these results indicated that the estimated daily mean rn and g at 1 km resolution in this study could provide reliable input data for further daily et estimation the downscaled 1 km daily soil moisture was also validated against ground measurements the surface soil moisture in situ measurement data from the ismn were used for both training in downscaling procedure and validation of the results 70 data for training and 30 data for validation the accuracy of training results is high with rmse 0 04 m3 m 3 and r 0 94 fig 4 the downscaled soil moisture performed well with rmse 0 05 m3 m 3 and r 0 89 fig 4 temporal variation of downscaled and observed ssm at some selected sites were shown in supplementary figure s4 to illustrate the consistency between the two time series these results indicated the overall good achievement in the downscaled 1 km soil moisture that is robust for further use to estimate the water stress factor in the canopy resistance for plant transpiration as well as to estimate soil evaporation 4 2 validation of et against flux tower measurements the etmonitor was calibrated to obtain optimal model parameters and validated at site level before it was applied to the global scale for et estimation fig 5 summarized the results of etmonitor calibration and validation at the 236 flux tower sites overall etmonitor performed well in estimating daily et as indicated by the statistical metrics of calibration rmse 0 85 mm d 1 bias 0 07 mm d 1 r 0 83 fig 5a the validation results also showed overall good agreement with the in situ measurements with rmse 0 89 mm d 1 bias 0 07 mm d 1 r 0 82 fig 5a the daily total et and each component were estimated at 1 km resolution by etmonitor using the calibrated model parameters and data described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 to evaluate the performance of

were shown in supplementary table s2 and figure s5 and the time series of estimated daily et and observed et at some flux observation sites were shown in supplementary figure s6 other global remote sensing et products with similar spatial resolution 1 km were also shown in table 4 for comparison the et estimated by etmonitor generally showed good agreement with ground observation in all temporal scales the performances of etmonitor at yearly and monthly scales were even better than the performance on daily and 8 day scales with the rmse decreased from 0 93 mm d 1 at daily scale to 0 83 mm d 1 at 8 day scale to 0 58 mm d 1 at monthly scale and eventually to 0 57 mm d 1 at yearly scale it indicated the random error was decreasing from short term to longer temporal scales we also notice that kge values were lower at yearly scale than at daily or 8 day scale for all these three datasets table 4 and it is because the number of annual et samples is less than the number of daily or 8 day et samples leading to relatively low values of correlation coefficient r and standard deviation σ for the validation at yearly scale according to eq 10 r and σ are key inputs for kge calculation and low values of r and σ cause low kge values 4 3 performance of et estimation in different land cover and et partitioning by etmonitor it is useful to understand the performance of the etmonitor over various land cover types fig 6 displayed the performance of the estimated daily total et according to the land cover type against the ground observations from the corresponding flux tower sites in the vegetation covered sites et was the sum of soil evaporation plant transpiration and vegetation canopy interception loss since the components of open water body evaporation and ice snow sublimation were zero generally good agreement between the estimation and observation were achieved for almost all vegetation covered sites and very good correlation and low bias could be found with r range from 0 66 to 0 85 and bias range from 0 17 mm d 1 to 0 20 mm d 1 the bias values were close to zero and it indicated no obvious overestimation or underestimation the rmse of daily total et was overall less than 1 00 mm d 1 with the lowest rmse for dnf 0 79 mm d 1 wsa 0 79 mm d 1 osh 0 81 mm d 1 and gra 0 82 mm d 1 the highest rmse of daily et found for ebf rmse 1 10 mm d 1 sites mainly located in the relatively humid region usually with higher evapotranspiration where large rmse and lower kge were anticipated etmonitor estimates different et components soil evaporation plant transpiration open water body evaporation vegetation canopy interception loss and ice snow sublimation to obtain total et hence it has the ability to partition total et to different et components fig 6 also displayed the performance of non vegetation covered sites i e barren or sparsely vegetated sites bar water wat and snow ice sno to validate the estimated components of the bare soil evaporation open water evaporation and snow ice sublimation it was revealed that etmonitor could estimate the soil evaporation well as indicated by the low rmse 0 57 mm d 1 and low bias for bar sites low correlation 0 52 could be partly due to the relatively narrow et range i e 0 2 mm d 1 for water evaporation relatively larger rmse values were found rmse 1 48 mm d 1 this was partly due to larger evaporation values from water surface the bias of daily water evaporation 0 40 mm d 1 was comparably low and it indicated the estimated water evaporation did not show obvious overestimation or underestimation to validate the estimated snow ice sublimation the seasonal snow cover at each flux site was checked and finally eight flux sites were found with latent heat flux observations for at least 1 month during the snow covered periods although some low kge values were found in snow ice sublimation estimation the overall rmse and bias of the estimated daily snow sublimation were 0 33 mm d 1 and 0 13 mm d 1 and it indicated the accuracy of estimated snow sublimation is satisfactory to further evaluate the et components partitioning of soil evaporation and plant transpiration by etmonitor in the vegetation covered sites the ratios of ec et and es et estimated by etmonitor were compared with the stable isotope observations the daily ec et and es et estimated by etmonitor were generally agreed well with the isotope observations with the overall rmse 12 74 and r 0 94 in the growing season of maize crop in 2012 in daman site fig 7 relatively large difference was found in the beginning of the growing season when the canopy was not closed and such discrepancy may also be related to fields being mulched to prevent from soil moisture loss which was not captured by the satellite remote sensing data soil moisture land cover thus limiting the model ability to show such impact the rmse decreased to 8 62 and r increased to 0 97 after removing the early growing season period before july from the analysis the averaged ec et and es et values from etmonitor in growing season in daman site were 80 15 and 19 85 respectively which were very close to the isotope observation results 86 33 and 13 67 these indicated the good performance in separating soil evaporation and plant transpiration by etmonitor 4 4 inter comparison between etmonitor product and other et products fig 8 illustrated the spatial distributions of annual mean et from etmonitor while other et products in the overlapping period 2003 2015 were shown in supplementary figure s7 all products were spatially aggregated to 0 25 for cross comparison and pixels with missing et values in fluxcom and mod16 et products were excluded for fair comparison etmonitor et product could reasonably capture the expected global et spatial patterns though considerable discrepancy with other products could be found in some regions the et estimated by etmonitor generally showed similar global patterns with gleam fluxcom and pml v2 et products fig 8 the latitudinal profiles of different et products were also displayed fig 8b the annual et exhibited a distinguishable decreasing gradient from the equator to the high latitude region of the northern and southern hemispheres corresponding to the climate conditions land cover types and vegetation growing season lengths for better illustration fig 8 also showed annual mean et by different products and their mean monthly variation in different climate zones the main 5 classes in köppen geiger classifications described in section 2 2 1 and in fig 2 in tropical regions where very high et values were generally anticipated due to the high temperature and unlimited soil water supply et values from etmonitor were generally high and is consistent with fluxcom and pml v2 et products supplementary figure s7 fig 8c the eb showed lower et values in tropical region especially in the amazon and central africa regions supplementary figure s7 and it was probably related to the uncertainty of thermal remote sensing lst lst is the most important input for energy balance method and it is easily contaminated by the cloudiness in the tropical regions in arid regions where extreme low et values were anticipated due to the extreme low soil water supply et from etmonitor showed comparable value with gleam and lower than other et products except mod16 product large uncertainty in mod16 product has been reported in tropical and arid regions by previous studies e g khan et al 2018 michel et al 2016 zheng et al 2019 which is highly related to the parametrizations in mod16 product hu et al 2015 yang et al 2015 in temperate zones where et is generally lower than tropical region and higher than other regions etmonitor product showed comparable et values with other et products especially closer to gleam which showed relatively low uncertainty according to the evaluation by collocation based approach li et al 2022 in cold and polar zones where low et were found due to the low temperature and limited energy forcing etmonitor product showed comparable et values with fluxcom gleam and eb products while the pml v2 and mod16 et showed higher values than other products for further comparison each one of the global et products was plotted against et product of etmonitor supplementary figure s8 the spatial variation of et by etmonitor showed the highest r and lowest rmse when compared with pml v2 gleam and fluxcom et products and lowest bias with gleam et product followed with eb et product the et values from etmonitor also showed good ability in describing seasonal variation for both north and south hemispheres fig 8d although the et magnitude varied the seasonal course of et by etmonitor were comparable with other products especially in the regions with large season variation e g arid temperate and cold regions supplementary figure s9 presented spatial distribution of the correlation coefficient r and rmse calculated based on the monthly values of different et products against etmonitor product at first glance very high r and low rmse between etmonitor and other et products could be found in most areas supplementary figure s9 et product by etmonitor generally showed higher r and lower rmse with fluxcom than with that of other et products in the tropical region e g the amazon rainforest arid land e g the saharan desert and the high elevation region e g the tibetan plateau lower correlation or insignificant correlation were found even though with rmse being generally lower than 1 5 mm d 1 to better compare the spatial patterns from different et products the regional et variation in some typical regions e g the mountain regions with complex topography and the irrigation regions with contrast et values from surrounding areas were shown in fig 9 in the mountain regions e g hengduan mountain regions located in the southeast edge of the tibetan plateau fig 9 column a and the alps mountains in europe fig 9 column b etmonitor at 1 km resolution could reflect the impact of topography on et very well and higher et values occurred in the humid valleys with denser vegetation cover and higher soil water content and lower et values occurred in higher elevations along the mountain slopes with fewer vegetation cover and colder climate except fluxcom product could partially capture such patterns all the other four et products failed to capture the spatial patterns of et in the mountain regions even though mod16 and pml v2 had higher spatial resolution 500 m it implies that the spatial resolution is not the only dominant factor for the unsatisfactory performance by these et products in the mountain regions in the irrigated regions e g the middle reach of heihe river basin in the northwest of china fig 9 column c the middle reach of indus river basin fig 9 column d and the nile delta fig 9 column e the estimated et by etmonitor could clearly represent the et differences among different land covers especially the large et difference between irrigated croplands and the surrounding drylands in these irrigated croplands with arid and semi arid climate condition significantly high values of et occurred in the irrigated cropland due to high soil moisture from irrigation in contrast to the very low et values in the surrounding drylands the high et values in the irrigated cropland resulted in the precipitation deficit in arid semi arid climate environment i e negative values in the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration etmonitor utilized soil moisture at 1 km resolution as one of the influential parameters in estimation of the canopy surface resistance and soil surface resistance could capture very well the et variation when compared with other et products in which soil moisture information was not directly used e g mod16 the very large difference in et between the irrigated croplands and surrounding desert could also partially captured by fluxcom eb and pml v2 et products but the latter two et products showed systematically lower et values than etmonitor and fluxcom gleam and mod16 datasets could not show these large et difference in the irrigation regions as shown in fig 9 row 3 and row 4 4 5 inter comparison of et partitioning at global scale fig 10 displayed the global distribution of the et components i e vegetation transpiration soil evaporation rainfall interception loss of vegetation canopy open water evaporation and snow ice sublimation estimated by etmonitor mean values between 2003 and 2018 the et partitioning from gleam and pml v2 products for comparison in the overlapping period 2003 2018 is illustrated in supplementary figure s10 the sublimation and water evaporation were merged into one figure for easy illustration in fig 10 the et components from etmonitor generally showed similar global spatial patterns with pml v2 and gleam products however discrepancy could also be found among different products in different regions false color composite maps with red etmonitor green pml v2 blue gleam were also given in fig 10 for an easy visualization of the relative magnitudes of et values from the three products in the false color composite maps more red green blue colors means etmonitor pml v2 gleam having larger values than the other two et products the spatial pattern of plant transpiration estimated by etmonitor were generally close to the gleam and pml v2 products and all products showed vegetation transpiration being the largest components of total et the soil evaporation by the etmonitor was generally close to pml v2 product larger than that by gleam product the soil evaporation by the etmonitor was generally showed highest values in the tropical regions part of southeast asia and east america while soil evaporation by the pml v2 showed highest values in other regions the canopy rainfall interception loss estimated from the three et products generally had similar spatial patterns but etmonitor showed higher values in the tropical and subtropical regions europe north asia and east america than the other two et products for open water evaporation and snow ice sublimation etmonitor estimation is close to gleam etmonitor adopted daily water cover and daily snow ice cover to consider the impacts of seasonal dynamics of water and snow ice covers on evaporation and sublimation estimation which explains the spatial distribution difference between etmonitor and pml v2 used fixed yearly water and snow ice covers for water evaporation and snow ice sublimation in fig 10 pml v2 failed to capture the snow ice sublimation in the regions with seasonal snow ice cover e g north eurasia north america tibetan plateau the seasonal snow ice covered regions accounted for roughly one third of global terrestrial land surface and the global total sublimation would be underestimated by 54 08 if sublimation in those seasonal snow covered regions was ignored according to our estimation to assess the impact of seasonal water cover we compared the open water evaporation estimation by etmonitor in 2013 and 2014 between using the seasonal dynamic water cover as described in section 3 1 and using the fixed yearly water cover yearly fixed water cover in the mcd12 land cover map defined as at least 60 of area is covered by permanent water bodies seasonality of open water evaporation caused by water surface phenology cannot be captured in many regions with seasonal water cover e g the north america when fixed yearly water cover was adopted and total amount of terrestrial open water evaporation amount tends to be underestimated by 25 globally supplementary figure s11 although there existed regional differences in the spatial distribution of the et partitioning between values from etmonitor and from gleam and pml v2 products all datasets showed that plant transpiration dominated the total et on global land surface table 5 the plant transpiration and soil evaporation were the largest two components of total et globally respectively accounting for 61 54 0 44 and 19 08 0 54 of the global total et on average according to the etmonitor estimation and they were between the results of gleam and pml v2 products the rainfall interception loss was the third largest component accounting for 13 54 0 49 of the total et globally estimated by etmonitor and it was very close to the results of gleam and pml v2 products the rest 5 84 0 24 was mainly contributions from the open water body evaporation and snow ice sublimation 5 discussion 5 1 etmonitor algorithm and forcing data the spatially and temporally information on evapotranspiration can promote our knowledge of global water cycle provide crucial data for water resource management and improve our understanding of the interactions between land surface and the atmosphere fisher et al 2008 mccabe et al 2016 michel et al 2016 wang et al 2021a in the past few decades although significant progresses have been made in fundamental and applied research on evapotranspiration in a wide range of areas such as the earth s hydrologic cycle ecosystem functions and carbon sinks climate change and agriculture and water resources management insufficient observation capacity from local to global scales remains a critical and prominent problem fisher et al 2017 et remains the most problematic component of the global and regional water cycle to be determined with required accuracy and favorable spatio temporal resolutions due to the heterogeneity of the landscape and the complex processes involved chen et al 2019 fernández prieto et al 2012 jiménez et al 2011 lettenmaier and famiglietti 2006 li et al 2009 schmugge et al 2002 wang and dickinson 2012 remote sensing approach has been recognized as the most useful means to achieve global and regional et information at moderate spatial resolution based on observations of various sensors onboard the earth observation satellites jiang and ryu 2016 sahoo et al 2011 vinukollu et al 2011 xie et al 2022 zhang et al 2016 etmonitor is a hybrid model established by integrating different physical processes related to exchanges of energy and water the total et in a broader definition as well as the components i e soil water evaporation plant transpiration canopy interception loss and snow ice sublimation can be estimated directly by etmonitor the shuttleworth wallace dual source scheme adopted in etmonitor for soil evaporation and plant transpiration separation was a two layer model with rigorous physical treatment of the interactions between soil and canopy and its ability for et estimation has been well revealed after tested at site and basin scales in different climatic conditions and vegetation types e g iritz et al 1999 ortega farias et al 2007 zhou et al 2006 cui et al 2021 chen et al 2022a in contrast to the big leaf model such as the penman monteith equation etmonitor describes explicitly the water fluxes from the soil surface and from the vegetation canopy which are inherently different because transpiration is active leaves up taking water from the root zone soil layer through plant physiological process whereas soil evaporation comes from soil water at near surface soil layer cui and jia 2021 rainfall interception loss is considered an important process in particular in regions with humid climate and dense canopies etmonitor adopted a revised gash analytical model and combined remote sensing observations to estimate global rainfall interception losses zheng and jia 2020 initially the rs gash model remote sensing based gash model implemented in etmonitor was developed at regional scale cui and jia 2014 cui et al 2015 using vegetation canopy structure parameters derived from remote sensing observations the revised gash model was successfully applied for global estimation of canopy rainfall interception loss zheng and jia 2020 overall the above mentioned developments from our earlier work guaranteed the physical robustness of etmonitor which advanced many other models or algorithms based on machine learning or empirical approaches moreover etmonitor model can take the advantage of various land surface variables parameters derived from a broad range of independent datasets from satellite observations to estimate daily actual et and the components at 1 km spatial resolution compared with the traditional land surface model combined models driven by satellite earth observation is superior in terms that it can maximize the use of satellite earth observations to estimate the spatial variation of global land surface et for example in this study etmonitor updated the daily land cover condition by using daily global surface water change data from ji et al 2018 and 8 day mod10 snow ice cover data thus enabling it to reflect the impact of seasonal variation in land cover types on et estimation which is especially important for regions with seasonal water and snow cover although it has long been noted that the seasonal variation of regional water evaporation is closely related to the water surface coverage or area zhao and liu 2017 guo et al 2019 zhao and guo 2019 few studies have considered the impact of seasonal water coverage on water evaporation estimation at global scale according to our estimation in current study the global terrestrial water surface evaporation would be underestimated by 25 supplementary figure s10 if annual constant water cover instead of daily water cover used further leading to an error of 0 72 in the estimate of global total et if seasonal snow ice cover was not taken into account the global total sublimation would be underestimated by 54 08 in many previous studies annual or multi annual constant land cover maps were usually used for global et estimation e g mu et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 xie et al 2022 for example annual mcd12 land cover was used as input in pml v2 product zhang et al 2018 where the water body extent remained constant throughout the year which could not represent the seasonal water evaporation process caused by dynamic variation of water surface especially in flooding plains or seasonal lake watersheds difference between the annual mcd12 classification map and the actual regional water cover may lead to the overestimation or underestimation of regional et depending on the difference between the yearly mcd12 classification and the actual water cover of a region etmonitor used surface soil moisture data derived from microwave remote sensing observations to describe the constrains of soil water on transpiration and soil evaporation hu and jia 2015 zheng et al 2019 however the currently available daily soil moisture data based on satellite based passive microwave observations have fairly coarse spatial resolutions about 10 25 km gruber et al 2019 pen et al 2017 we therefore developed a machine learning algorithm to downscale the global soil moisture from 0 25 to 1 km resolution using optical remote sensing data at moderate resolution in this study and obtained very promising results both the downscaled soil moisture and the estimated et showed very promising results when compared to ground measurements furthermore the etmonitor has great advantages in obtaining spatiotemporally continuous global et products compared to the energy balance based et estimation method the latter requires land surface temperature retrieved from thermal infrared radiance observed by satellite and can only be observed on cloudless days jia et al 2009 this also partly explained the fact that global spatiotemporally continuous et product in moderate resolution based on the energy balance method is very rare modis published its well known global et product mod16 with 8 day and 500m resolution mu et al 2011 and recently gleam global et product achieved daily and 0 25 resolution martens et al 2017 clearly the mod16 product has better potential in regional applications for water resource management and drought assessment than gleam due to its higher spatial resolution mu et al 2013 and gleam product is superior in the long term climate change study due to its longer term of time series miralles et al 2014 the proposed etmonitor algorithm and its implementation of global product in this study has both the moderate spatial resolution 1 km of mod16 500m and the high temporal resolution daily of gleam such a resolution is thought to be sufficient for both regional and global scale applications for water resources management drought assessment and climate change assessment 5 2 the performance of global et product previous studies have presented the high accuracy of etmonitor for regional applications hu and jia 2015 li et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 sriwongsitanon et al 2020 weerasinghe et al 2020 shang et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 in this study the global et estimated by etmonitor also demonstrated a good performance at both site scale and global scale to ensure the accuracy of the estimated global et the most sensitive parameters in etmonitor algorithm were calibrated by using flux tower measurements the two calibrated parameters i e the rs min minimal stomatal resistance for plant transpiration and kvpd vpd stress parameter for plant transpiration were mostly related to the plant stomatal activities that control transpiration compared with the flux tower measurements of flux collected from 251 sites around the world the overall daily rmse and r of global et estimated by etmonitor were 0 93 mm d 1 and 0 75 respectively with more than 80 of the sites having r larger than 0 6 and rmse smaller than 1 2 mm d 1 the accuracy of daily et was greatly improved when it was aggregated to 8 day or monthly time scale despite low r values in some cases such as evergreen broadleaf forest in the humid regions their rmse values were quite low and still indicated moderate performance generally the global et estimated by etmonitor has the lowest rmse relative to ground measurements compared with other global et products table 4 which highlights the high accuracy of global et estimated by etmonitor some low rmse values were also reported by other studies such as 0 53 mm d 1 and 0 43 0 51 mm d 1 in different models fisher et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 but these studies were carried out in small areas or at longer time scale in our study the low rmse values were achieved by etmonitor in much larger spatial extent and fine time scale with the rmse less than 1 mm d 1 at 65 of ground sites tested in this study furthermore with better quality of regional input data to be available the accuracy of et estimation by etmonitor is expected to increase significantly for example former studies have proved that the etmonitor reached very high accuracy rmse 0 59 mm d 1 in the heihe basin an inland river basin in the arid and semi arid northwest china when more accurate regional input datasets were available hu and jia 2015 in previous studies the original version of etmonitor developed by hu and jia 2015 was applied for global et estimation with reported rmse of 1 10 mm d 1 and r of 0 6 zheng et al 2016 jia et al 2018 in current study the accuracy is much more improved when compared with extensive observation data globally even though the site scale validation may be controversial due to the scattered sites and limited ground observations the site scale comparisons can still provide a valuable reference for the accuracy of et products baldocchi 2003 mccabe and wood 2006 wilson et al 2002 zheng et al 2016 the uncertainties of the et estimation method could be further quantified with the upscaled in situ et observations to overcome the problem of the scale mis match between the footprint of ground flux measurements and the model pixel size liu et al 2016 li et al 2021 we also noticed that the different performance of estimated et over different land covers the relatively large rmse was found in open water evaporation mainly in lakes and low kge was found in snow ice sublimation estimation fig 6 current method estimates water evaporation as well as snow ice sublimation using penman combination equation in a straightforward way by only considering the major meteorological governing variables net radiation reached the water surface vpd and wind speed however it ignored there are some hidden physical processes e g time scale dependent feedbacks of water evaporation to water surface temperature and the dependence of energy storage in water body on the water depth and water quality e g the water salinity water clarity suspended solids blanken et al 2011 li et al 2016 mor et al 2018 guo et al 2019 mesquita et al 2020 for example water evaporation has negative feedback on water temperature that is water evaporation consume energy which decreases the water surface temperature and further reduces the evaporation rate friedrich et al 2018 the rate at which such feedback occurs depends on the meteorological forcing and the thermal inertia of the water body the latter depends on mean water depth and water quality these indicate the necessity of further improvement on the algorithm for evaporation estimation from open water further study will be conducted to consider the aforementioned complexities that govern water evaporation to improve the total et estimation furthermore the et estimated by etmonitor had reliable global pattern and better performance in showing the spatial variation of et in the mountain regions and irrigated cropland than other global et products we compared the spatial patterns and temporal variations of et product of etmonitor with five exiting remote sensing based et products besides the difference in physical parameterization and model structure of these models the use of different forcing datasets also partly explained the differences in the et products badgley et al 2015 globally the spatial pattern of et is related to the atmospheric moisture demand or land surface moisture supply jung et al 2010 the regions with medium high atmospheric demand and unlimited moisture supply e g regions with tropical and temperate climate regimes tend to have high et while regions with low moisture supply or low atmospheric demand regions with arid and cold climate regimes tend to have low et globally etmonitor could capture the expected global et patterns both spatially and temporally and showed consistent global et patterns with gleam and fluxcom et products but these et products had much coarser spatial resolution 0 25 moreover etmonior showed superior performance in mountain regions with complex topography and irrigated cropland regions than other five global et products by capturing much better spatial patterns and variations in these regions on the contrary some global remote sensing based et products e g flxucom eb and pml v2 failed to capture the spatial variation of et in mountain regions e g the alps mountain and hengduan mountain regions and some of them e g mod16 failed to capture the spatial variation of et in irrigated cropland regions e g middle reach of heihe basin middle reach of indus basin while some e g gleam failed in both regions fig 9 all these give us the confidence in further applications of analysis using our etmonitor global et product and encourage us to further extend the etmonitor product to longer periods for climate change studies it should also be noticed that the accuracy of the estimated et relies on the input data and the et estimation method there is a need to improve the accuracy of the input data e g satellite based land cover map lai soil moisture etc the satellite soil moisture also is very likely to be inaccurate especially in extremely humid and extremely arid regions areas with high vegetation fraction covered and areas with high radio frequency interference rfi kim et al 2018 the errors in soil moisture products certainly introduce uncertainty into the estimated et to reduce the error introduced by the input soil moisture data we chose the esa cci soil moisture product as input which combined data from different sensors to achieve high accuracy gruber et al 2019 the esa cci soil moisture product spanning from 1982 to the present has been critically evaluated and is considered to be the most reliable satellite soil moisture product zeng et al 2015 dorigo et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 ling et al 2021 wang et al 2021a b we also noticed that the error of soil moisture did not linearly propagate to the estimated et zheng et al 2021 when the soil moisture is very high e g near the field capacity soil moisture does not stress the evapotranspiration process and the overestimation of soil moisture in extremely humid regions or periods does not propagate to the estimated et when the soil moisture is very low such as near or below the permanent wilting point the soil moisture constraint factor for plant transpiration is almost equal to zero so underestimating soil moisture has a very limited impact on the accuracy of estimating et the role of soil moisture is more pronounced in semi arid and arid regions thus errors in soil moisture brings greater uncertainty to et estimate in these regions than in humid regions zheng et al 2021 even so the et estimation by etmonitor in the arid regions is still in good agreement with the ground observation with rmse less than 1 mm d 1 in most cases according to our estimation table s2 indicating the reliability of etmonitor model 5 3 the global water consumption and et components partitioning it is generally agreed that about 60 70 of the global land precipitation returns to the atmosphere through et and the rest was mainly available for runoff according to different global climate model gcm results in previous studies lim and roderick 2009 trenberth et al 2007 stephens et al 2020 the annual global land surface et estimated by etmonitor is 73 57 1 39 103 km3 yr 1 which falls within the reasonable range of reported values 58 103 85 103 km3 yr 1 rodell et al 2015 miralles et al 2016 stephens et al 2020 ma et al 2021 typical values of annual global et could be found as 65 103 km3 yr 1 by upscaling fluxnet observations jung et al 2011 and 84 4 103 km3 yr 1 by era interim reanalysis dataset miralles et al 2016 the water consumption expressed by et also showed significant variation among different land cover types determined by actual et per unit area and the distributed area of each type only those with both large area distribution and high et values were proved to be the large water consumers e g the croplands which had significant importance in ensuring the food security several studies reported the partitioning of global land surface et mainly using global land surface process models isotope observations sap flow and satellite earth observations miralles et al 2016 moran et al 2009 wang erlandsson et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 however the global ratio of transpiration to et yet remains uncertain jasechko et al 2013 martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 for example a recent study showed that the large discrepancies in et partitioning were observed between the different methods and gleam tended to underestimate soil evaporation and overestimate plant transpiration compared to the observations which may partly be due to the ignorance of soil evaporation under vegetation canopy chen et al 2022b although it is generally agreed that transpiration is the major component of et globally large variation in et components among different land cover types and climatic regimes was observed in our study our estimation suggested that global transpiration accounted for 63 of global total et slightly lower than that from gleam 74 and isotope technologies but within the previously reported range 35 80 coenders gerrits et al 2014 jasechko et al 2013 miralles et al 2016 mu et al 2011 to further validate the et partitioning some new et components separation methods and reliable global observation dataset of each et component are expected coenders gerrits et al 2014 jasechko et al 2013 miralles et al 2016 6 conclusion this study presented the improvement of etmonitor a multi parameterization based model for generating spatially and temporally continuous daily et at global scale during 2000 2019 at moderate resolution 1 km by utilizing multiple sources of advanced satellite earth observation data to ensure the accuracy of the et estimated from etmonitor this study carried out several works for implementing the etmonitor in global et estimation including 1 utilizing datasets of dynamic surface water cover and snow ice cover at high temporal resolution as input to simulate the impact of their seasonal change on et variation 2 downscaling spatial coarse resolution soil moisture derived from microwave remote sensing to 1 km resolution based on a machine learning method for accurate global et simulation 3 estimating global soil heat flux at 1 km resolution for better calculation of available energy and et 4 calibrating the most sensitive parameters in etmonitor model based on in situ surface flux observations to improve the accuracy of canopy surface resistance estimated et overall the et estimated by etmonitor agreed well with ground measurements from 251 flux towers across various ecosystems and climate zones with high correlation 0 75 low bias 0 08 mm d 1 and low root mean square error 0 93 mm d 1 the estimated et showed reasonable spatial patterns and superior in presenting the spatial variation of et especially in the mountain regions and in the arid irrigated cropland regions than other global et products e g the gleam and mod16 et products etmonitor has the capability of separating plant transpiration soil evaporation canopy rainfall interception loss open water evaporation and snow ice sublimation in satisfactory accuracies the performance of separation of plant transpiration and soil evaporation was very promising with rmse of 12 74 and r of 0 94 when compared with the in situ stable isotope observations of water flux the evaluation of different et components was still limited due to the scarcity of available data and comprehensive evaluation based on more observations would help to further improve the performance of etmonitor future focus will also be on improving parameterization methods for open water evaporation and snow ice sublimation this study could benefit studies in the global climate change hydrological cycle land surface process modelling water resource management drought monitoring and more by providing algorithm and time series of total et and et components data credit authorship
