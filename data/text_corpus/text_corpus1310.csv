6550,in urban stormwater pipe networks pipe leakage may lead to reduction of groundwater recharge to significant reduction of groundwater levels and to subsurface contamination in the present study stormwater pipe leakage is simulated in a case study representing an urban catchment using the coupled groundwater pipe network flow model ogs he this model includes pipe flow variably saturated subsurface flow and exchange fluxes to and from leaky pipes the study area is a typical northern german urban catchment with a stormwater pipe network which is located partly below and above groundwater the successful calibration of a groundwater model is shown based on the calibrated groundwater model stormwater pipe leakage for pipe networks of different ages and different pipe defect sizes is investigated for dry weather flow conditions and rainfall conditions it is shown that standard defects with a size of 10 4 m2 per m pipe can result in a groundwater infiltration into the leaky pipe network which is in the order of annual groundwater recharge the same standard defect size leads to a reduction of local groundwater levels by several meters rain events of increasing return period reduce groundwater infiltration into leaky pipes and increase stormwater exfiltration from leaky pipes while the temporal distribution of a rain event has no effect on stormwater leakage keywords stormwater pipe leakage catchment scale opengeosys hystem extran urban groundwater 1 introduction urban groundwater gw quality and quantity is heavily affected by leakage of defect water mains sewers and stormwater pipes lerner 1986 eiswirth et al 1997 leakage in an urban system commonly comprises more than 25 of annual groundwater recharge lerner and harris 2009 and may even be in the order of annual groundwater recharge marsalek et al 2008 several studies have identified leakage as a major potential source of groundwater contamination usepa 1989 rueedi et al 2009 leading to reduced quality of urban groundwater resources groundwater contamination with pipewater bound pathogens may affect humans by causing diseases such as cholera karamouz et al 2011 pipe leakage denotes the hydraulic interaction between pipe systems and the surrounding saturated unsaturated zone pipe leakage includes exchange flows into the pipe system groundwater infiltration and exchange flows out of the pipe system pipewater exfiltration groundwater infiltration occurs when the groundwater level is above the pipewater level pipewater exfiltration occurs when the groundwater level is below the pipewater level in sewer and stormwater pipe systems pipewater exfiltration is governed by the presence of a colmation layer the colmation layer has significantly different hydraulic properties than the surrounding soil and forms in the defect vicinity due to particle input and biofilm growth colmation layers of sewer and stormwater pipe systems differ the distinction between sewer colmation layer and stormwater colmation layer stems from the difference of sewage and urban stormwater composition leading to different hydraulic properties of colmation layers while the amount of total suspended solids in sewage and stormwater may be similar the amount of organic matter in sewage exceeds that in stormwater booth 2006 as shown in siegrist 1987 larger organic matter loads in the infiltrate lead to a more severe soil clogging through settlement of organic matter and biofilm growth and to larger reduction in porosity and intrinsic permeability therefore permeability and porosity of sewer colmation layers are generally small compared to stormwater colmation layers subsequently pipewater exfiltration from sewer systems is generally small compared to pipewater exfiltration from stormwater systems problems associated with sewer pipe leakage are described in rutsch et al 2008 and karpf 2012 and will not be discussed here while peche et al 2017 have developed and applied a coupled numerical model to quantify leakage into and out of sewer systems the present study attempts to quantify stormwater pipe leakage spl spl is connected to a series of problems discussed below infiltration of groundwater into stormwater pipe systems results in a reduced stormwater pipe capacity ellis 2001 weiss et al 2002 which may lead to increased surface flooding especially in the case of heavy rainfall events groundwater infiltration may therefore decrease the groundwater table of an urban system wittenberg and aksoy 2010 if pipes are below groundwater this evokes land subsidence martinez et al 2011 and even sinkholes harvey and mcbean 2014 which can significantly damage urban structures a devastating sinkhole event happened in guatemala among other events known as the guatemala sinkhole problem where the interaction of leaky pipes and eroding limestone created a sinkhole swallowing a multistory building in 2010 coppola 2015 however groundwater infiltration driven decreasing groundwater levels may also be beneficial and prevent damage to urban underground structures caused by high groundwater levels gustafsson 2000 karpf and krebs 2013 stormwater exfiltration may lead to subsurface and groundwater contamination despite the fact that stormwater is assumed to be relatively clean compared to sewage water micevski et al 2002 urban stormwater may be highly polluted by a wide range of contaminants birch et al 2004 such as fecal indicator bacteria page et al 2010 polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals from road debris brown and peake 2006 stormwater exfiltration may also lead to increasing groundwater tables al rashed and sherif 2001 which may damage urban underground structures martinez et al 2011 understanding spl is essential to take measures against the above listed problems or to encourage advantages associated to spl e g groundwater drainage induced by groundwater infiltration the quantification of stormwater exfiltration is challenging due to the nonlinear dependence of the leakage flow on hydraulic gradient and relative intrinsic permeability in the colmation layer the effect of leakage from separate stormwater or sewer pipe systems or from combined pipe systems on urban groundwater has been investigated with similar if not identical conceptual modelling approaches in several catchment scale or city scale studies which are discussed below xu et al 2014 used a simplified model proposed by karpf and krebs 2011 to quantify non stormwater inflow into the stormwater drainage system of shanghai china they concluded that 10 of total pipe flow in their test area is from non stormwater sources the calculation of leakage is based on a water balance leakage is calculated only for dry weather flow conditions and transient exfiltration from stormwater pipes is not regarded bhaskar et al 2015 used a coupled surface subsurface flow model in order to quantify the long term impact of leakage on subsurface storage in baltimore us they used the coupled surface flow groundwater flow simulator parflow maxwell et al 2009 to calculate variably saturated subsurface flow pipe leakage is not calculated but estimated based on measured data from local pipe flow monitoring bhaskar et al 2015 concluded that net leakage groundwater infiltration minus pipewater exfiltration decreased subsurface storage by 11 in one year that model was not coupled to a pipe flow model in a study by thorndahl et al 2016a a coupled groundwater pipewater flow model was used to quantify only infiltration into sewers in several urban catchments in denmark pipe infiltration was approximated with a model using calibrated coefficients pipe flow was calculated using the full saint venant equations and variably saturated flow was approximated with a water balance approach such a water balance approach is only recommended for shallow groundwater tables and thus not applicable to all situations dhi 2017 thorndahl et al 2016a found that pipe infiltration may lower urban groundwater levels by several dozens of centimeters in a coupled pipe flow subsurface flow approach by kidmose et al 2015 leakage is calculated using the difference between groundwater level and pipewater level and an exchange coefficient the calculation of variably saturated flow is carried out using mike she dhi 2017 where variably saturated flow is reduced to one spatial dimension kidmose et al 2015 found that infiltration can exceed exfiltration by a few orders of magnitude maximum infiltration rates for pipe segments with a length of approximately 50 m reached 800 l day and maximum exfiltration rates reached 50 l day the presence of a colmation layer for pipe exfiltration was not regarded in that study gogu et al 2017 modelled pipe leakage in bucharest romania with a steady state urban subsurface model including groundwater flow pipe flow and interaction with surface water and underground structures such as tunnels they found that 20 of the pipe network is prone to groundwater infiltration it was also shown that 0 92 m3 s of pipewater surplus originates from groundwater infiltration leakage was calculated with the widely used leakage factor approach based on darcy s law rauch et al 1994 boukhemacha et al 2015 colmation layer intrinsic permeability and thickness are lumped into a leakage factor which is then multiplied with the pressure head difference and defect area to calculate leakage flow although physically based models are needed to quantify pipe leakage with high precision mohrlok et al 2008 to the best of our knowledge only few models for spl including the presence of a colmation layer calculate both pipe flow and variably saturated subsurface flow in a coupled and physically based manner at present time in existing approaches pipe flow is either neglected or the calculation of variably saturated subsurface flow is simplified in spatial dimension or by using simplified formulations for the richards equation to close that research gap the present study presents a physically based model of an urban aquifer including leaky stormwater pipes in order to investigate the effects of spl on urban groundwater we present the application of a coupled leakage model including the presence of a colmation layer physically based pipe flow and variably saturated subsurface flow in three spatial dimensions we apply the model ogs he peche et al 2017 to a urban catchment and quantify spl we develop a novel transfer function derived from numerical simulations on a single pipe defect that can be used for the upscaling of spl taking place through a colmation layer in a first scenario on dry weather flow leakage we quantify groundwater table and groundwater recharge changes caused by pipe systems of different conditions i e with large and small standard defects per meter of pipe in the present study the term standard defect refers to the average defect size per m pipe in a given pipe network and represents the condition of the pipe network as described in karpf 2012 the standard defect is characterized by a quadratic defect area and a location at the pipe invert based on leakage rates we propose a leakage severity map for that catchment which can be used to coordinate pipe rehabilitation measures the aim of this first scenario is to investigate the impact of pipe system condition on groundwater table and groundwater recharge in a second scenario on rainfall driven leakage we investigate spl for a series of pluvial events with different return periods and temporal distribution the aim of this second scenario is to investigate the effect of different rain events on stormwater exfiltration and groundwater infiltration 2 numerical model for the numerical simulations the software package ogs he peche et al 2017 is used which couples the groundwater flow simulator opengeosys ogs kolditz et al 2012a with the pipe network flow model hystem extran he itwh 2010 that coupled model calculates pipe leakage using the complete 1d saint venant equations de saint venant 1871 for pipe flow and richards equation richards 1931 for variably saturated water flow stormwater is added to or subtracted from the pipe network as a timestep wise calculated exchange flux at manhole positions this flux stems from the hydrodynamic rainfall runoff simulation model hystem itwh 2010 governing equations are given in the appendix in the present study leakage for an entire pipe section is assigned as a source term to a single node in the gw model that node is located at the midpoint of the pipe section leakage in the form of gw infiltration and stormwater exfiltration is calculated differently in ogs he fig 1 gw infiltration occurs when the gw level is above pipewater level it is assumed that backfill material is located within the pipe defect in this case the soil in the pipe vicinity and in the pipe defect is fully saturated such that gw infiltration is a linear process calculated as specific flux q leak in l t 1 using darcy s law 1 q leak in κ backfill ρ g μ h pw δ z p bot ρ g δ z where κ backfill l2 is backfill intrinsic permeability ρ m l 3 is fluid density g l t 2 is gravitational acceleration μ m l 1 t 1 is fluid dynamic viscosity h pw l is pipewater level δ z l is colmation layer thickness and p bot m l 1 t 2 is water pressure at colmation layer bottom note that q leak in is always negative because p bot ρ g h p w δ z and it is used as a sink term in the gw model for the pipe flow model q leak in is assigned as a source term multiplication with the standard defect size per m pipe a defect 1 m l and with the pipe length δ x l gives the gw infiltration flow rate q leak in q leak in a defect 1 m δ x stormwater exfiltration occurs when the gw level is below pipewater level in that case the soil in the pipe vicinity is unsaturated such that stormwater exfiltration is a non linear process one way of calculating stormwater exfiltration would be to solve richards equation on a spatial mesh that is locally refined near the pipe defect alternatively in order to omit local mesh refinement around stormwater pipe defects in the gw model we use an upscaling approach based on a leakage function lf as described in peche et al 2017 while the lf described in peche et al 2017 presents leakage related to sewer pipes the lf in the present model was newly derived and represents leakage related to stormwater pipes the lf describes leakage flux through a colmation layer of constant thickness for stormwater pipes embedded in a typical backfill sand used in germany as defined by karpf 2012 in the present study hydraulic properties of the colmation layer at a state of quasi constant hydraulic properties as observed in e g le coustumer et al 2012 and kandra et al 2014 were approximated from le coustumer et al 2012 and used to derive the lf hydraulic properties of the backfill material and van genuchten parameters are taken from karpf 2012 and carsel and parrish 1988 respectively fluid properties for all simulations in the present study and hydraulic properties for colmation layer and backfill sand are given in table 2 in the appendix a colmation layer thickness of δ z 0 02 m was used as proposed by karpf 2012 the mathematical formulation of the lf after peche et al 2017 is 2 q

visualized in fig 2 note that q leak ex is positive because it is assigned as a source term to the gw model for the pipe flow model q leak ex is assigned as a sink term stormwater exfiltration flow rate for an entire pipe segment is calculated using q leak ex q leak ex a defect 1 m δ x for p bot 6000 pa very dry conditions where the gw table is very low and a given h pw q leak ex is constant because very small pressures p bot 6000 pa lead to a hydraulic disconnection between leakage and gw level similar to the hydraulic disconnection of a river and groundwater as described in brunner et al 2009 for the calculation of q leak ex with p bot 6000 pa the pressure is reset to p bot 6000 pa in eq 2 in the numerical model code such that p bot in eq 2 is always p bot 6000 pa further information about the coupled model ogs he including a validation with three benchmark problems and the upscaling of sewer pipe leakage with the lf approach is described in peche et al 2017 3 test area and model setup the test area is an existing and anonymous catchment in a northern german city the catchment was chosen such that it contains a stormwater pipe network which is located above and below groundwater in order to capture both gw infiltration and stormwater exfiltration respectively the stormwater pipe network is known to be intact and pipe defects are assumed to be non existent it is assumed that the catchment represents a typical northern german urban area with its relatively small surface slope its complex stormwater pipe network and its aquifer consisting of mainly gravely and sandy sediments with till and clay lenses ehlers and gibbard 1996 bauer et al 2014 the vast majority 99 of stormwater pipes is of circular profile and pipe diameters are larger than 0 3 m this represents german construction guidelines gujer 2007 the catchment has a surface area of 5 km2 and a stormwater pipe system of 1211 connected individual pipes with a total length of 53 km the pipe lengths vary from 1 to 130 m both land surface and pipes are sloped towards the east with an average slope of 0 6 the pipe system discharges into a river that delineates the catchment in the east river stormwater pipe network and elevation are visualized in fig 3 soils in the test area are assumed to be sandy gravel with clay fraction in the eastern part and fine sand with clay fraction in the western part gw flows towards the river in the east continuous gw level measurements from 10 observation wells were available the data was used to calculate mean annual gw levels and to interpolate gw isolines well locations and gw level isolines are displayed in fig 3 in order to set up a conceptual model of the test area a model domain was delineated and boundary conditions were defined using a gis analysis the gw divides at the northern western and southern boundary of the test area are assigned no flow neumann type boundary conditions by analyzing existing gw isolines of the area the river along the eastern boundary was found to be in effluent connection to the gw such that the river is assigned a constant dirichlet type boundary condition the river water level was estimated and due to lack of field data transient handling of the river was not possible mean annual gw recharge of q recharge 100 mm y was estimated from nibis map server nibis 2017 and assigned on the top boundary of the model the domain delineation and boundary conditions are also visualized in fig 3 the thickness of the gw model was set to 9 m the gw model is sufficiently thick to include the stormwater pipe system and we assume flow direction to be parallel to the gw model base no vertical exchange fluxes through the bottom boundary of the model this stems from the effluent connection of the river to gw leading to the assumption that a horizontal gw flow component is dominant subsequently the gw model base was defined as no flow neumann type boundary condition a numerical grid consisting of tetrahedrons and prisms was generated this grid was locally refined in x y direction around well locations and the middle points of each pipe in z direction the grid was locally refined within the variably saturated zone and at the z elevation of the stormwater pipe system as displayed in fig 4 b smallest local refinement was set at the depth of the pipe defects with a z extent of prism elements of approximately 0 02 m this extend represents the colmation layer thickness and is recommended for the lf based upscaling in total the grid consists of 345487 tetrahedrons and prisms with a minimum mean and maximum edge length of 0 0004 m 40 m and 232 m respectively that element size is similar to that used in other coupled flow models on the catchment scale e g jones et al 2008 yang et al 2015 the pipe backfill was neglected in the model domain to increase model efficiency alternatively the effects of pipe backfill were taken into account by the lf and eq 1 for the simulation of spl 4 groundwater model calibration due to lack of field observations on pipe flow pipe discharge and pipe pressure results from the pipe flow model could not be validated however the pipe flow model is in operational use by the municipalities and has been updated maintained and used for pipe dimensioning purposes consequently results of the pipe flow model are assumed to be reliable a gw model calibration was carried out because time dependent gw recharge data was not available and because seasonal gw fluctuations are rather small 0 38 m well hydrographs are given in fig 18 in the appendix and in order to save computational costs the calibration of the intrinsic permeability distribution was carried out in a stationary fashion assuming a constant q recharge and using darcy s law the distances between individual neighboring gw level isolines were classified and used to delineate intrinsic permeability zones by doing so the gw model domain was divided into the 5 different permeability zones displayed in fig 4 a by analyzing the distances between gw isolines it was concluded that permeabilities in the eastern part of the model domain permeability zones 1 2 are large compared with permeability zones in the western part this analysis enabled to qualitatively estimate initial values of permeability used for the calibration initial permeability set κ ini values for κ ini are given in table 1 in this study intrinsic permeability is assumed to be constant in z direction for the automated calibration a file based procedure including matlab the mathworks inc 2016 and opengeosys was generated the flow chart of the procedure is given in fig 5 the nelder meat simplex algorithm nelder and mead 1965 was used for parameter optimization this downhill algorithm optimizes values of a parameter set here values of intrinsic permeability in order to minimize errors for the corresponding objective function this direct optimization method has proven to be efficient and is widely used for such type of problems musy et al 2014 results of the calibration are given in fig 6 clearly with a mean deviation of 0 64 m calculated gw levels agree well with observed gw levels calibration results and measured values show better agreement for wells in the western and southern part of the domain mean deviation of approximately 0 19 m wells w5 w6 w7 w8 w9 w10 compared with results for wells in the northeastern part mean deviation of approximately 1 5 m wells w1 w2 w3 w4 this deviation may stem from the fact that the aquifer in the northeastern part is not homogeneous but consists of sandy material with scattered clay lenses nibis 2017 results of the calibration in form of κ values for the intrinsic permeability zones as displayed in fig 4 a are given in table 1 the storage capacity of the soil types as expressed by the soil capacity s p in eq 5 is characterized by the van genuchten 1980 parameters α and m these parameters were chosen according to the known soil types from to nibis 2017 values for α and m were estimated from schaap and leij 1998 as printed in pachepsky et al 2003 and are given in table 1 as no observations of the soil were available these parameters could not calibrated the calibrated gw model is used for all studies described in section 5 a sensitivity analysis was carried out in order to determine model result sensitivity to the input parameters κ 0 κ 1 κ 2 κ 3 κ 4 and q recharge for the sensitivity analysis each input parameter was multiplied with 1 2 and 3 2 followed by a simulation until steady state in order to quantify parameter sensitivity the euclidean norm l 2 norm of calculated gw levels at the observation wells were compared with gw levels calculated with the optimized parameter set results of the sensitivity analysis are visualized in fig 7 clearly result deviation is smallest l 2 1 m for variations in κ 1 κ 2 κ 3 the modification of κ 0 and κ 4 leads to changes of the hydraulic head distribution in the m range the modification of q recharge leads to largest result deviation l 2 10 m leading to the conclusion that this value should be chosen judiciously results of the sensitivity analysis are discussed in section 6 5 simulation scenarios a total of 27 transient scenarios were simulated that investigate different aspects of spl under various conditions all scenarios were conducted using the conceptual model shown in fig 8 the 27 scenarios include 6 scenarios for dry weather flow conditions with pipe networks of different condition the remaining 21 scenarios simulate the effect of various rain events on spl the aim of the scenarios was 1 to quantify the reduction of annual gw recharge by leakage under dry weather flow conditions for different standard defect sizes further aim was to define a threshold standard defect size for the previously calibrated model section 4 where leakage was neglected defects larger than this threshold size must be included in an urban gw model while smaller defects may be neglected section 5 2 2 to quantify the reduction of gw levels by leakage under dry weather flow conditions results can be used to assess the impact of gw levels on urban infrastructure flooding stability section 5 3 3 to generate a leakage severity map highlighting pipes with largest leakage in the pipe network this map can be used in the decision making for pipe rehabilitation section 5 4 4 to evaluate the impact of rain return period and temporal rainfall distribution on spl results can be used to identify most severe rain events with regards to pipe capacity reduction by gw infiltration and soil contamination by stormwater exfiltration section 5 5 5 1 scenario definition 5 1 1 dry weather flow scenario a simulation of dry weather flow over a time interval of 5 days was conducted the term dry weather flow is meant in the sense that no urban flood occurs therefore no rainwater enters the manholes of the stormwater pipe network accordingly no rain was assigned as source term to the stormwater pipe flow model and exchange fluxes only occur through pipe defects in the subsurface exchange fluxes are gw infiltration and pipewater exfiltration for pipewater levels below and above groundwater level respectively water levels in the pipe network stem from gw infiltration the annually averaged gw recharge from rainfall of 100 mm y nibis 2017 was assigned as a source term to the land surface of the groundwater model the simulation time of 5 days was chosen because after that time both exchange fluxes stormwater exfiltration and groundwater infiltration have converged to a quasi steady state fig 19 in the appendix the spl after 5 days simulation time was used in sections 5 2 5 4 to investigate various controls on spl 5 1 2 rainfall scenarios the dry weather flow scenario with the standard defect size a defect 4 10 7 m2 per m pipe and with the same annually averaged gw recharge q recharge 100 mm y was modified by assigning rain events with different temporal distribution and return period rp as source terms to the manholes of the pipe flow model the rainfall was not assigned to the gw model because the wetting front from a heavy rainfall event of one hour duration only insignificantly influences spl compared to rainwater input into the pipe network through manholes this simplification stems from wetting front propagation studies with similar soil types initial conditions and boundary conditions ma et al 2010 herrada et al 2014 temporal distributions of rainfall were chosen due to different positions of the peak of rainfall in time and represent euler 1 type e1 rain peak at beginning of event euler 2 type e2 rain peak after 1 3 of event duration and a mirrored euler 2 type e2m rain peak after 2 3 of event duration for each of the temporal distributions the rp was varied between 1 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 years all events have a duration of 1 h and are visualized in fig 9 a uniform spatial distribution of rain intensity was chosen for all simulations simulation time was set to 3 5 h where the rain event occurs after 30 min and associated rainwater drainage by the pipe network occurs during the remaining two hours 5 2 reduction of annual gw recharge by leakage under dry weather flow conditions pipe leakage may change gw recharge in an urban catchment lerner 1986 1990 stormwater exfiltration may increase gw recharge while gw infiltration may reduce gw recharge as shown by kidmose et al 2015 the impact of stormwater exfiltration on gw recharge leading to gw level increase is significantly smaller than the impact of gw infiltration on gw recharge leading to gw level decrease this different impact stems from the presence of a colmation layer and from the small relative permeabilities under unsaturated conditions during stormwater exfiltration the reduction of annual gw recharge by spl is quantified for pipe domains with different standard defect sizes the parameter a defect was varied in the range of a defect 10 7 m2 per m pipe to 10 4 m2 per m pipe these values were estimated from wolf et al 2007 and karpf 2012 and they represent defect pipes with ages from very few years 10 7 m2 per m pipe to 100 years 10 4 m2 per m pipe the net cumulative dry weather flow leakage for all pipes was calculated using q leak net dry weather q leak in dry weather q leak ex dry weather as visualized in fig 10 it should be noted that q leak ex dry weather was always much smaller than q leak in dry weather the ratio of q leak net dry weather to the imposed constant q recharge was calculated for each defect size and results are visualized in fig 11 the threshold value of 1 denotes the maximum allowed reduction of gw recharge by leakage fig 11 clearly q leak net dry weather strongly depends on the defect size and it is equal to the chosen threshold of 1 of gw recharge at the standard defect size a defect 4 10 7 m2 per m pipe this corresponds to gw infiltration of 15 l day per 50 m pipe segment larger defect sizes result in a significantly larger reduction of annual gw recharge by leakage for example the defect size of a defect 1 10 5 m2 per m pipe leads to a reduction of gw recharge by gw infiltration into pipes of 23 this corresponds to gw infiltration of 340 l day per 50 m pipe segment which is in the same order of magnitude as results from kidmose et al 2015 this result shows that urbanization may significantly reduce gw recharge lerner 1990 for urban gw model calibration net leakage can either be quantified with a coupled model as is demonstrated here alternatively in the absence of a coupled model net leakage can be estimated using eq 1 with backfill sand intrinsic permeability and fluid properties the hydraulic gradient can be estimated by reading the local gw head and estimating pipe water levels from dry weather flow measurements the thickness of the colmation layer is usually between 0 01 m and 0 02 m and can be restricted to the pipe wall thickness in the absence of biofilm growth ellis et al 2009 because net leakage is mainly controlled by gw infiltration q leak in dry weather q leak ex dry weather stormwater exfiltration can be neglected for the calibration of an urban gw model 5 3 reduction of gw levels by leakage under dry weather flow conditions spl may significantly reduce groundwater levels in an urban catchment lerner 1986 to investigate this effect the parameter a defect was varied in the range of a defect 10 7 m2 per m pipe to 10 4 m2 per m pipe as in section 5 2 the mean gw level change in the vicinity of all pipe defects as well as maximum gw level increase and decrease over the entire model domain were calculated for each defect size and results are visualized in fig 12 clearly gw levels decrease with increasing defect size up to several meters for example a large standard defect of a defect 1 10 4 m2 per m pipe which is smaller than the statistical standard defect for the german city of dresden of 9 10 4 m2 per m pipe calculated by karpf 2012 leads to a mean decrease in gw level of 0 16 m and a maximum decrease of 3 m this result illustrates the dependence of urban gw levels on the condition of the pipe system in reverse conclusion it supports statements by herringshaw 2007 and thorndahl et al 2016a saying that a sudden decrease of pipe defects caused by e g a pipe rehabilitation can result in a significant rise of the gw level therefore while pipe rehabilitation is an important measure to avoid gw pollution by contaminated stormwater leakage resulting rising gw levels may lead to mobilization of pollutants and to urban infrastructure damages such as flooded basements or to unstable conditions of buildings by increased buoyancy the spatial distribution of gw level reduction from initial condition to steady state for standard defects larger than a defect 6 10 7 m2 per m pipe are visualized in figs 13 and 14 the spatial distribution of gw level reduction for standard defects smaller a defect 1 10 6 m2 per m pipe is not visualized because it was found to be insignificant also gw level increase by pipe water exfiltration was found to be insignificant and is therefore not given in figs 13 and 14 clearly gw level reduction can only occur where gw has been above pipe water at the initial condition thus part of the pipe network in the northern eastern and southwestern part are prone to gw infiltration and gw level reduction for a standard defect of a defect 1 10 4 m2 per m pipe gw level reduction is rather small 0 2 m in the eastern part of the domain while local gw level reduction is large 2 m in the western part this result correlates to initial gw levels above the pipe network in the catchment and all gw above the pipe system is drained away by the pipe system large gw level reduction occurs at locations where the gw above pipes has been large initially this result indicates that large defects in a pipe network reduce the gw levels to the depth of the pipe network it further indicates that despite larger standard defects per m pipe gw level reduction will not increase because the gw volume above the pipe network is limited clearly fig 13 further indicates that the spatial distribution of gw level reduction follows the spatial distribution of the pipe network and gw reduction resembles a drawdown of horizontal pumping well systems as described in e g grubb 1993 and rushton 2004 finally gw level reduction zones are larger at locations where the pipe network is more dense 5 4 generation of a leakage severity map under dry weather flow conditions gw infiltration decreases the capacity of a stormwater pipe network the drainage capacity of old pipe networks can be improved by reducing leaks stephenson 2012 especially in pipe sections where the pipe capacity is reduced by gw infiltration the result of the dry weather flow scenario with a standard defect size of 4 10 7 m2 per m pipe was used for mapping leakage in the pipe system with spl classified into severity categories the spatial distribution of spl including gw infiltration and stormwater exfiltration was plotted on a map by defining leakage flow classes such a map can be used as a decision making tool for a pipe rehabilitation plan the leakage severity map is visualized in fig 15 parts of the pipe network located in the southern and central part of the study area have a severity class of 0 and are not subject to leakage under dry weather flow conditions such pipes can be disregarded for rehabilitation parts of the pipe system in the eastern western and northern part have a severity class that is nonzero such pipes are subject to potentially large leakage and can be priorized for pipe rehabilitation a rehabilitation of only pipes prone to gw infiltration would result in an increased pipe system capacity and decreased manhole surcharge in case of strong rain events however as shown in section 5 3 such a rehabilitation may lead to a significant rise in groundwater levels and to associated problems such as flooded basements 5 5 impact of rain return period and temporal rainfall distribution on spl the rainfall scenarios aim at evaluating the impact of rain return period and temporal rainfall distribution on spl differently distributed rain events with different rps were assigned as source terms to the manholes of the pipe flow model the cumulative gw infiltration q leak in and the cumulative stormwater exfiltration q leak ex of the whole pipe network during the simulation time of 3 5 h were calculated for all rps and for all temporal rainfall distributions results are given in fig 16 clearly cumulative gw infiltration decreases in absolute numbers with increasing return period which is due to larger pipewater levels and thus smaller hydraulic gradients as mathematically described by eq 1 conversely stormwater exfiltration increases with increasing return period which is due to larger pipewater levels and larger hydraulic gradients in the colmation layer regarding the temporal distributions of rain events an early peak of rain leads to a small increase of gw infiltration in absolute numbers but only for events with small return periods results also indicate that cumulative stormwater exfiltration is not affected by the temporal distribution of rain no temporal distribution of rain events with significantly higher gw infiltration or stormwater exfiltration can be identified this important result leads to the conclusion that temporal distribution of rain has an insignificant impact on spl in the present study model results for an e1 rp100 rain event are visualized in fig 17 results for such an extreme rain event show that the pipe network is nearly completely drained after two hours pipewater drains towards the eastern part of the catchment where large pipewater levels last longer than in the western part of the catchment fig 17 visualizes leakage over time for an exemplary pipe which is prone to stormwater exfiltration clearly the temporal distribution of leakage does not fit to the temporal distribution of the rain event which is due to specific flow characteristics in the catchment including different pipe slopes retention times on the land surface and manhole surcharge pressures at this pipe vary in the range of 10 3 pa which is rather small maximum pressure changes in the whole domain are in the range of 10 1 pa for long pipes with large leakage 6 discussion and conclusions the application of a coupled three dimensional variably saturated subsurface flow model and a one dimensional pipe flow model for the simulation of spl on the scale of an urban catchment with a typical german stormwater pipe network in hydraulic connection with a typical northern german aquifer is presented in contrast to existing models spl is determined using pipewater levels and the three dimensional soil water pressure distribution a novel transfer function representing spl as a function of pipewater level and soil water pressure is introduced the derivation of such a transfer function is described in peche et al 2017 the calibration of the catchment scale groundwater model is carried out using a coupled matlab ogs procedure finally the coupled model is applied to scenarios of dry weather flow leakage and to scenarios of synthetic rain events to investigate the leakage response in summary novel key contributions and findings of the present study are given and discussed below the successful application of a coupled physically based model for the simulation of spl in an urban catchment is presented spl is simulated as exchange flux between one dimensional pipe flow and three dimensional variably saturated subsurface flow spl in form of pipewater exfiltration is calculated using a newly derived lf for stormwater leakage the lf used in this study is based on hydraulic properties of a stormwater colmation layer the hydraulic properties of the colmation layer affect spl in form of pipewater exfiltration significantly comparing the present lf with the lf for sewer leakage presented in peche et al 2017 leakage fluxes differ by two orders of magnitude because saturated intrinsic permeabilities of colmation layers differ by two orders of magnitude a stormwater pipe network colmation layer depends on the local conditions e g soil type land use specific physico chemical signature of the stormwater and should ideally be determined in a catchment specific manner which was not the case in the present study in the present study colmation layer properties are taken from le coustumer et al 2012 in the present model the process of precipitation driven land surface infiltration is not simulated it is assumed that the propagation of the wetting front up to a point where pipe leakage will be influenced at defect depth of several meters takes more time than the simulation time 3 5 h simulation time 1 h rain event this simplification stems from wetting front propagation studies with similar soil types initial conditions and boundary conditions ma et al 2010 herrada et al 2014 the validity of this simplification may be questionable for rain events of longer duration and larger intensity as the ones regarded here the successful calibration of a gw model using a coupled matlab ogs procedure is presented a defect pipe network is not included in the calibrated model pipe defects are assumed to be non existent in the study area calibration results show a maximum deviation in the m range compared with observed data such an over and underestimation of gw levels may lead to singificant over and underestimation of leakage this error could be diminished by a more thorough calibration procedure by e g using more observation data if available and introducing more κ zones leading to larger computational costs erroneous gw levels far below the pipe network do not affect leakage in form of pipewater exfiltration as described in peche et al 2017 analogously described for river gw interaction in e g brunner et al 2009 the hydraulic disconnection of leaky pipes from groundwater leads to the dependency of leakage only on pipe water level and not water pressure in the soil directly below the pipe defect furthermore it is recommended to carry out a transient gw model calibration using time dependent gw recharge data seasonal gw level fluctuations may be relatively small in the order of few dozens of centimeters in the present study but fluctuations are present thus the stationary calibration carried out in the present study may be questionable because seasonal fluctuations are not considered a sensitivity analysis with regards to intrinsic permeabilities and mean annual gw recharge was carried out it is shown that the hydraulic head distribution is sensitive to the area wise largest permeability zones κ 0 κ 4 this sensitivity with regards to permeabilites depends on both the size of the permeability zone and the number of observation points groundwater wells further the sensitivity analysis shows that model results are highly sensitive to a change in annual gw recharge this leads to the conclusion that gw recharge should be chosen judiciously and with large confidence annual gw recharge in the present study stems from nibis 2017 was verified against lysimeter measurements lemke and elbracht 2008 and is assumed to be of high confidence further this result shows that the gw head distribution and pipe leakage strongly depend on gw recharge it is therefore recommended to calculate pipe leakage under dynamic recharge conditions in long simulation time series however due to small timestep sizes necessary in the present model timestep size 4 s and consecutive computational effort the simulation of such a long time series was not possible in the present study in the present study pipe flow could not be calibrated due to lack of observation data this leads to questionable accuracy of the model however a thourough calibration of urban flow models is typically difficult thorndahl et al 2016b continous monitoring with several observation points in the pipe network and not only one discharge measurement at an outlet is recommended for the accurate calibration of a pipe flow model fraga et al 2017 such a flow monitoring is related to large expense the pipe flow model used in the present study is in operational use by the municipalities and is assumed to be reliable a parameter study on dry weather flow leakage with different standard pipe defect sizes per meter pipe was conducted it is shown that the process of pipewater exfiltration has a negligible impact on urban gw which is due to the presence of a colmation layer and related small fluxes despite pipewater exfiltration is small it may lead to contamination of soil and urban gw and is therefore of importance it is further shown that gw infiltration may drain away all gw above the pipe system for specific pipe conditions large standard defect sizes resulting gw levels after drainage are at the same elevation of the pipe network generally results demonstrate the strong dependence of urban groundwater on the condition of the stormwater pipe system net leakage for a standard defect larger than a defect 4 10 7 m2 per m pipe may exceed 1 of groundwater recharge standard defects larger than a defect 1 10 5 m2 per m pipe can lead to net leakage exceeding 20 of annual groundwater recharge these findings are in the similar range of results described in lerner and harris 2009 it is shown that standard defect sizes larger than a defect 1 10 5 m2 which is by an order of magnitude smaller than a standard defect for the german city of dresden derived by karpf 2012 lead to a mean decrease of the groundwater level in the range of several centimeters which correlates with findings from thorndahl et al 2016a the maximum local decrease of groundwater levels was found to be in the range of several meters it is further shown that if defects are larger than 4 10 7 m2 per m pipe and gw levels are shallow the process of pipe leakage must be included in the calibration of an urban gw model however this standard defect threshold value is soil property specific a systematic study investigating the effect of rain events of different return periods and temporal distributions on leakage was conducted results show that groundwater infiltration decreases in absolute numbers during rain events and that stormwater exfiltration increases during rain events both due to larger pipewater levels larger return periods result in larger stormwater exfiltration and smaller groundwater infiltration in absolute numbers the temporal distribution of rain does not significantly affect spl however leakage driven soil water pressure changes can be considered small for our scenarios the effect would be more significant for a case study with larger rain duration larger standard defects and larger leakage as the scenarios regarded here 7 outlook in future studies it would be interesting to investigate seasonal leakage fluctuations driven by seasonal gw recharge fluctuations and subsequent gw level fluctuations such a study may show that gw infiltration is larger in winter because shallow gw levels typically increase in winter further it is planned to apply the model on the scale of a city with more than 500 000 inhabitants and a pipe network of 2500 km length it is further planned to use model

6550,in urban stormwater pipe networks pipe leakage may lead to reduction of groundwater recharge to significant reduction of groundwater levels and to subsurface contamination in the present study stormwater pipe leakage is simulated in a case study representing an urban catchment using the coupled groundwater pipe network flow model ogs he this model includes pipe flow variably saturated subsurface flow and exchange fluxes to and from leaky pipes the study area is a typical northern german urban catchment with a stormwater pipe network which is located partly below and above groundwater the successful calibration of a groundwater model is shown based on the calibrated groundwater model stormwater pipe leakage for pipe networks of different ages and different pipe defect sizes is investigated for dry weather flow conditions and rainfall conditions it is shown that standard defects with a size of 10 4 m2 per m pipe can result in a groundwater infiltration into the leaky pipe network which is in the order of annual groundwater recharge the same standard defect size leads to a reduction of local groundwater levels by several meters rain events of increasing return period reduce groundwater infiltration into leaky pipes and increase stormwater exfiltration from leaky pipes while the temporal distribution of a rain event has no effect on stormwater leakage keywords stormwater pipe leakage catchment scale opengeosys hystem extran urban groundwater 1 introduction urban groundwater gw quality and quantity is heavily affected by leakage of defect water mains sewers and stormwater pipes lerner 1986 eiswirth et al 1997 leakage in an urban system commonly comprises more than 25 of annual groundwater recharge lerner and harris 2009 and may even be in the order of annual groundwater recharge marsalek et al 2008 several studies have identified leakage as a major potential source of groundwater contamination usepa 1989 rueedi et al 2009 leading to reduced quality of urban groundwater resources groundwater contamination with pipewater bound pathogens may affect humans by causing diseases such as cholera karamouz et al 2011 pipe leakage denotes the hydraulic interaction between pipe systems and the surrounding saturated unsaturated zone pipe leakage includes exchange flows into the pipe system groundwater infiltration and exchange flows out of the pipe system pipewater exfiltration groundwater infiltration occurs when the groundwater level is above the pipewater level pipewater exfiltration occurs when the groundwater level is below the pipewater level in sewer and stormwater pipe systems pipewater exfiltration is governed by the presence of a colmation layer the colmation layer has significantly different hydraulic properties than the surrounding soil and forms in the defect vicinity due to particle input and biofilm growth colmation layers of sewer and stormwater pipe systems differ the distinction between sewer colmation layer and stormwater colmation layer stems from the difference of sewage and urban stormwater composition leading to different hydraulic properties of colmation layers while the amount of total suspended solids in sewage and stormwater may be similar the amount of organic matter in sewage exceeds that in stormwater booth 2006 as shown in siegrist 1987 larger organic matter loads in the infiltrate lead to a more severe soil clogging through settlement of organic matter and biofilm growth and to larger reduction in porosity and intrinsic permeability therefore permeability and porosity of sewer colmation layers are generally small compared to stormwater colmation layers subsequently pipewater exfiltration from sewer systems is generally small compared to pipewater exfiltration from stormwater systems problems associated with sewer pipe leakage are described in rutsch et al 2008 and karpf 2012 and will not be discussed here while peche et al 2017 have developed and applied a coupled numerical model to quantify leakage into and out of sewer systems the present study attempts to quantify stormwater pipe leakage spl spl is connected to a series of problems discussed below infiltration of groundwater into stormwater pipe systems results in a reduced stormwater pipe capacity ellis 2001 weiss et al 2002 which may lead to increased surface flooding especially in the case of heavy rainfall events groundwater infiltration may therefore decrease the groundwater table of an urban system wittenberg and aksoy 2010 if pipes are below groundwater this evokes land subsidence martinez et al 2011 and even sinkholes harvey and mcbean 2014 which can significantly damage urban structures a devastating sinkhole event happened in guatemala among other events known as the guatemala sinkhole problem where the interaction of leaky pipes and eroding limestone created a sinkhole swallowing a multistory building in 2010 coppola 2015 however groundwater infiltration driven decreasing groundwater levels may also be beneficial and prevent damage to urban underground structures caused by high groundwater levels gustafsson 2000 karpf and krebs 2013 stormwater exfiltration may lead to subsurface and groundwater contamination despite the fact that stormwater is assumed to be relatively clean compared to sewage water micevski et al 2002 urban stormwater may be highly polluted by a wide range of contaminants birch et al 2004 such as fecal indicator bacteria page et al 2010 polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals from road debris brown and peake 2006 stormwater exfiltration may also lead to increasing groundwater tables al rashed and sherif 2001 which may damage urban underground structures martinez et al 2011 understanding spl is essential to take measures against the above listed problems or to encourage advantages associated to spl e g groundwater drainage induced by groundwater infiltration the quantification of stormwater exfiltration is challenging due to the nonlinear dependence of the leakage flow on hydraulic gradient and relative intrinsic permeability in the colmation layer the effect of leakage from separate stormwater or sewer pipe systems or from combined pipe systems on urban groundwater has been investigated with similar if not identical conceptual modelling approaches in several catchment scale or city scale studies which are discussed below xu et al 2014 used a simplified model proposed by karpf and krebs 2011 to quantify non stormwater inflow into the stormwater drainage system of shanghai china they concluded that 10 of total pipe flow in their test area is from non stormwater sources the calculation of leakage is based on a water balance leakage is calculated only for dry weather flow conditions and transient exfiltration from stormwater pipes is not regarded bhaskar et al 2015 used a coupled surface subsurface flow model in order to quantify the long term impact of leakage on subsurface storage in baltimore us they used the coupled surface flow groundwater flow simulator parflow maxwell et al 2009 to calculate variably saturated subsurface flow pipe leakage is not calculated but estimated based on measured data from local pipe flow monitoring bhaskar et al 2015 concluded that net leakage groundwater infiltration minus pipewater exfiltration decreased subsurface storage by 11 in one year that model was not coupled to a pipe flow model in a study by thorndahl et al 2016a a coupled groundwater pipewater flow model was used to quantify only infiltration into sewers in several urban catchments in denmark pipe infiltration was approximated with a model using calibrated coefficients pipe flow was calculated using the full saint venant equations and variably saturated flow was approximated with a water balance approach such a water balance approach is only recommended for shallow groundwater tables and thus not applicable to all situations dhi 2017 thorndahl et al 2016a found that pipe infiltration may lower urban groundwater levels by several dozens of centimeters in a coupled pipe flow subsurface flow approach by kidmose et al 2015 leakage is calculated using the difference between groundwater level and pipewater level and an exchange coefficient the calculation of variably saturated flow is carried out using mike she dhi 2017 where variably saturated flow is reduced to one spatial dimension kidmose et al 2015 found that infiltration can exceed exfiltration by a few orders of magnitude maximum infiltration rates for pipe segments with a length of approximately 50 m reached 800 l day and maximum exfiltration rates reached 50 l day the presence of a colmation layer for pipe exfiltration was not regarded in that study gogu et al 2017 modelled pipe leakage in bucharest romania with a steady state urban subsurface model including groundwater flow pipe flow and interaction with surface water and underground structures such as tunnels they found that 20 of the pipe network is prone to groundwater infiltration it was also shown that 0 92 m3 s of pipewater surplus originates from groundwater infiltration leakage was calculated with the widely used leakage factor approach based on darcy s law rauch et al 1994 boukhemacha et al 2015 colmation layer intrinsic permeability and thickness are lumped into a leakage factor which is then multiplied with the pressure head difference and defect area to calculate leakage flow although physically based models are needed to quantify pipe leakage with high precision mohrlok et al 2008 to the best of our knowledge only few models for spl including the presence of a colmation layer calculate both pipe flow and variably saturated subsurface flow in a coupled and physically based manner at present time in existing approaches pipe flow is either neglected or the calculation of variably saturated subsurface flow is simplified in spatial dimension or by using simplified formulations for the richards equation to close that research gap the present study presents a physically based model of an urban aquifer including leaky stormwater pipes in order to investigate the effects of spl on urban groundwater we present the application of a coupled leakage model including the presence of a colmation layer physically based pipe flow and variably saturated subsurface flow in three spatial dimensions we apply the model ogs he peche et al 2017 to a urban catchment and quantify spl we develop a novel transfer function derived from numerical simulations on a single pipe defect that can be used for the upscaling of spl taking place through a colmation layer in a first scenario on dry weather flow leakage we quantify groundwater table and groundwater recharge changes caused by pipe systems of different conditions i e with large and small standard defects per meter of pipe in the present study the term standard defect refers to the average defect size per m pipe in a given pipe network and represents the condition of the pipe network as described in karpf 2012 the standard defect is characterized by a quadratic defect area and a location at the pipe invert based on leakage rates we propose a leakage severity map for that catchment which can be used to coordinate pipe rehabilitation measures the aim of this first scenario is to investigate the impact of pipe system condition on groundwater table and groundwater recharge in a second scenario on rainfall driven leakage we investigate spl for a series of pluvial events with different return periods and temporal distribution the aim of this second scenario is to investigate the effect of different rain events on stormwater exfiltration and groundwater infiltration 2 numerical model for the numerical simulations the software package ogs he peche et al 2017 is used which couples the groundwater flow simulator opengeosys ogs kolditz et al 2012a with the pipe network flow model hystem extran he itwh 2010 that coupled model calculates pipe leakage using the complete 1d saint venant equations de saint venant 1871 for pipe flow and richards equation richards 1931 for variably saturated water flow stormwater is added to or subtracted from the pipe network as a timestep wise calculated exchange flux at manhole positions this flux stems from the hydrodynamic rainfall runoff simulation model hystem itwh 2010 governing equations are given in the appendix in the present study leakage for an entire pipe section is assigned as a source term to a single node in the gw model that node is located at the midpoint of the pipe section leakage in the form of gw infiltration and stormwater exfiltration is calculated differently in ogs he fig 1 gw infiltration occurs when the gw level is above pipewater level it is assumed that backfill material is located within the pipe defect in this case the soil in the pipe vicinity and in the pipe defect is fully saturated such that gw infiltration is a linear process calculated as specific flux q leak in l t 1 using darcy s law 1 q leak in κ backfill ρ g μ h pw δ z p bot ρ g δ z where κ backfill l2 is backfill intrinsic permeability ρ m l 3 is fluid density g l t 2 is gravitational acceleration μ m l 1 t 1 is fluid dynamic viscosity h pw l is pipewater level δ z l is colmation layer thickness and p bot m l 1 t 2 is water pressure at colmation layer bottom note that q leak in is always negative because p bot ρ g h p w δ z and it is used as a sink term in the gw model for the pipe flow model q leak in is assigned as a source term multiplication with the standard defect size per m pipe a defect 1 m l and with the pipe length δ x l gives the gw infiltration flow rate q leak in q leak in a defect 1 m δ x stormwater exfiltration occurs when the gw level is below pipewater level in that case the soil in the pipe vicinity is unsaturated such that stormwater exfiltration is a non linear process one way of calculating stormwater exfiltration would be to solve richards equation on a spatial mesh that is locally refined near the pipe defect alternatively in order to omit local mesh refinement around stormwater pipe defects in the gw model we use an upscaling approach based on a leakage function lf as described in peche et al 2017 while the lf described in peche et al 2017 presents leakage related to sewer pipes the lf in the present model was newly derived and represents leakage related to stormwater pipes the lf describes leakage flux through a colmation layer of constant thickness for stormwater pipes embedded in a typical backfill sand used in germany as defined by karpf 2012 in the present study hydraulic properties of the colmation layer at a state of quasi constant hydraulic properties as observed in e g le coustumer et al 2012 and kandra et al 2014 were approximated from le coustumer et al 2012 and used to derive the lf hydraulic properties of the backfill material and van genuchten parameters are taken from karpf 2012 and carsel and parrish 1988 respectively fluid properties for all simulations in the present study and hydraulic properties for colmation layer and backfill sand are given in table 2 in the appendix a colmation layer thickness of δ z 0 02 m was used as proposed by karpf 2012 the mathematical formulation of the lf after peche et al 2017 is 2 q

visualized in fig 2 note that q leak ex is positive because it is assigned as a source term to the gw model for the pipe flow model q leak ex is assigned as a sink term stormwater exfiltration flow rate for an entire pipe segment is calculated using q leak ex q leak ex a defect 1 m δ x for p bot 6000 pa very dry conditions where the gw table is very low and a given h pw q leak ex is constant because very small pressures p bot 6000 pa lead to a hydraulic disconnection between leakage and gw level similar to the hydraulic disconnection of a river and groundwater as described in brunner et al 2009 for the calculation of q leak ex with p bot 6000 pa the pressure is reset to p bot 6000 pa in eq 2 in the numerical model code such that p bot in eq 2 is always p bot 6000 pa further information about the coupled model ogs he including a validation with three benchmark problems and the upscaling of sewer pipe leakage with the lf approach is described in peche et al 2017 3 test area and model setup the test area is an existing and anonymous catchment in a northern german city the catchment was chosen such that it contains a stormwater pipe network which is located above and below groundwater in order to capture both gw infiltration and stormwater exfiltration respectively the stormwater pipe network is known to be intact and pipe defects are assumed to be non existent it is assumed that the catchment represents a typical northern german urban area with its relatively small surface slope its complex stormwater pipe network and its aquifer consisting of mainly gravely and sandy sediments with till and clay lenses ehlers and gibbard 1996 bauer et al 2014 the vast majority 99 of stormwater pipes is of circular profile and pipe diameters are larger than 0 3 m this represents german construction guidelines gujer 2007 the catchment has a surface area of 5 km2 and a stormwater pipe system of 1211 connected individual pipes with a total length of 53 km the pipe lengths vary from 1 to 130 m both land surface and pipes are sloped towards the east with an average slope of 0 6 the pipe system discharges into a river that delineates the catchment in the east river stormwater pipe network and elevation are visualized in fig 3 soils in the test area are assumed to be sandy gravel with clay fraction in the eastern part and fine sand with clay fraction in the western part gw flows towards the river in the east continuous gw level measurements from 10 observation wells were available the data was used to calculate mean annual gw levels and to interpolate gw isolines well locations and gw level isolines are displayed in fig 3 in order to set up a conceptual model of the test area a model domain was delineated and boundary conditions were defined using a gis analysis the gw divides at the northern western and southern boundary of the test area are assigned no flow neumann type boundary conditions by analyzing existing gw isolines of the area the river along the eastern boundary was found to be in effluent connection to the gw such that the river is assigned a constant dirichlet type boundary condition the river water level was estimated and due to lack of field data transient handling of the river was not possible mean annual gw recharge of q recharge 100 mm y was estimated from nibis map server nibis 2017 and assigned on the top boundary of the model the domain delineation and boundary conditions are also visualized in fig 3 the thickness of the gw model was set to 9 m the gw model is sufficiently thick to include the stormwater pipe system and we assume flow direction to be parallel to the gw model base no vertical exchange fluxes through the bottom boundary of the model this stems from the effluent connection of the river to gw leading to the assumption that a horizontal gw flow component is dominant subsequently the gw model base was defined as no flow neumann type boundary condition a numerical grid consisting of tetrahedrons and prisms was generated this grid was locally refined in x y direction around well locations and the middle points of each pipe in z direction the grid was locally refined within the variably saturated zone and at the z elevation of the stormwater pipe system as displayed in fig 4 b smallest local refinement was set at the depth of the pipe defects with a z extent of prism elements of approximately 0 02 m this extend represents the colmation layer thickness and is recommended for the lf based upscaling in total the grid consists of 345487 tetrahedrons and prisms with a minimum mean and maximum edge length of 0 0004 m 40 m and 232 m respectively that element size is similar to that used in other coupled flow models on the catchment scale e g jones et al 2008 yang et al 2015 the pipe backfill was neglected in the model domain to increase model efficiency alternatively the effects of pipe backfill were taken into account by the lf and eq 1 for the simulation of spl 4 groundwater model calibration due to lack of field observations on pipe flow pipe discharge and pipe pressure results from the pipe flow model could not be validated however the pipe flow model is in operational use by the municipalities and has been updated maintained and used for pipe dimensioning purposes consequently results of the pipe flow model are assumed to be reliable a gw model calibration was carried out because time dependent gw recharge data was not available and because seasonal gw fluctuations are rather small 0 38 m well hydrographs are given in fig 18 in the appendix and in order to save computational costs the calibration of the intrinsic permeability distribution was carried out in a stationary fashion assuming a constant q recharge and using darcy s law the distances between individual neighboring gw level isolines were classified and used to delineate intrinsic permeability zones by doing so the gw model domain was divided into the 5 different permeability zones displayed in fig 4 a by analyzing the distances between gw isolines it was concluded that permeabilities in the eastern part of the model domain permeability zones 1 2 are large compared with permeability zones in the western part this analysis enabled to qualitatively estimate initial values of permeability used for the calibration initial permeability set κ ini values for κ ini are given in table 1 in this study intrinsic permeability is assumed to be constant in z direction for the automated calibration a file based procedure including matlab the mathworks inc 2016 and opengeosys was generated the flow chart of the procedure is given in fig 5 the nelder meat simplex algorithm nelder and mead 1965 was used for parameter optimization this downhill algorithm optimizes values of a parameter set here values of intrinsic permeability in order to minimize errors for the corresponding objective function this direct optimization method has proven to be efficient and is widely used for such type of problems musy et al 2014 results of the calibration are given in fig 6 clearly with a mean deviation of 0 64 m calculated gw levels agree well with observed gw levels calibration results and measured values show better agreement for wells in the western and southern part of the domain mean deviation of approximately 0 19 m wells w5 w6 w7 w8 w9 w10 compared with results for wells in the northeastern part mean deviation of approximately 1 5 m wells w1 w2 w3 w4 this deviation may stem from the fact that the aquifer in the northeastern part is not homogeneous but consists of sandy material with scattered clay lenses nibis 2017 results of the calibration in form of κ values for the intrinsic permeability zones as displayed in fig 4 a are given in table 1 the storage capacity of the soil types as expressed by the soil capacity s p in eq 5 is characterized by the van genuchten 1980 parameters α and m these parameters were chosen according to the known soil types from to nibis 2017 values for α and m were estimated from schaap and leij 1998 as printed in pachepsky et al 2003 and are given in table 1 as no observations of the soil were available these parameters could not calibrated the calibrated gw model is used for all studies described in section 5 a sensitivity analysis was carried out in order to determine model result sensitivity to the input parameters κ 0 κ 1 κ 2 κ 3 κ 4 and q recharge for the sensitivity analysis each input parameter was multiplied with 1 2 and 3 2 followed by a simulation until steady state in order to quantify parameter sensitivity the euclidean norm l 2 norm of calculated gw levels at the observation wells were compared with gw levels calculated with the optimized parameter set results of the sensitivity analysis are visualized in fig 7 clearly result deviation is smallest l 2 1 m for variations in κ 1 κ 2 κ 3 the modification of κ 0 and κ 4 leads to changes of the hydraulic head distribution in the m range the modification of q recharge leads to largest result deviation l 2 10 m leading to the conclusion that this value should be chosen judiciously results of the sensitivity analysis are discussed in section 6 5 simulation scenarios a total of 27 transient scenarios were simulated that investigate different aspects of spl under various conditions all scenarios were conducted using the conceptual model shown in fig 8 the 27 scenarios include 6 scenarios for dry weather flow conditions with pipe networks of different condition the remaining 21 scenarios simulate the effect of various rain events on spl the aim of the scenarios was 1 to quantify the reduction of annual gw recharge by leakage under dry weather flow conditions for different standard defect sizes further aim was to define a threshold standard defect size for the previously calibrated model section 4 where leakage was neglected defects larger than this threshold size must be included in an urban gw model while smaller defects may be neglected section 5 2 2 to quantify the reduction of gw levels by leakage under dry weather flow conditions results can be used to assess the impact of gw levels on urban infrastructure flooding stability section 5 3 3 to generate a leakage severity map highlighting pipes with largest leakage in the pipe network this map can be used in the decision making for pipe rehabilitation section 5 4 4 to evaluate the impact of rain return period and temporal rainfall distribution on spl results can be used to identify most severe rain events with regards to pipe capacity reduction by gw infiltration and soil contamination by stormwater exfiltration section 5 5 5 1 scenario definition 5 1 1 dry weather flow scenario a simulation of dry weather flow over a time interval of 5 days was conducted the term dry weather flow is meant in the sense that no urban flood occurs therefore no rainwater enters the manholes of the stormwater pipe network accordingly no rain was assigned as source term to the stormwater pipe flow model and exchange fluxes only occur through pipe defects in the subsurface exchange fluxes are gw infiltration and pipewater exfiltration for pipewater levels below and above groundwater level respectively water levels in the pipe network stem from gw infiltration the annually averaged gw recharge from rainfall of 100 mm y nibis 2017 was assigned as a source term to the land surface of the groundwater model the simulation time of 5 days was chosen because after that time both exchange fluxes stormwater exfiltration and groundwater infiltration have converged to a quasi steady state fig 19 in the appendix the spl after 5 days simulation time was used in sections 5 2 5 4 to investigate various controls on spl 5 1 2 rainfall scenarios the dry weather flow scenario with the standard defect size a defect 4 10 7 m2 per m pipe and with the same annually averaged gw recharge q recharge 100 mm y was modified by assigning rain events with different temporal distribution and return period rp as source terms to the manholes of the pipe flow model the rainfall was not assigned to the gw model because the wetting front from a heavy rainfall event of one hour duration only insignificantly influences spl compared to rainwater input into the pipe network through manholes this simplification stems from wetting front propagation studies with similar soil types initial conditions and boundary conditions ma et al 2010 herrada et al 2014 temporal distributions of rainfall were chosen due to different positions of the peak of rainfall in time and represent euler 1 type e1 rain peak at beginning of event euler 2 type e2 rain peak after 1 3 of event duration and a mirrored euler 2 type e2m rain peak after 2 3 of event duration for each of the temporal distributions the rp was varied between 1 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 years all events have a duration of 1 h and are visualized in fig 9 a uniform spatial distribution of rain intensity was chosen for all simulations simulation time was set to 3 5 h where the rain event occurs after 30 min and associated rainwater drainage by the pipe network occurs during the remaining two hours 5 2 reduction of annual gw recharge by leakage under dry weather flow conditions pipe leakage may change gw recharge in an urban catchment lerner 1986 1990 stormwater exfiltration may increase gw recharge while gw infiltration may reduce gw recharge as shown by kidmose et al 2015 the impact of stormwater exfiltration on gw recharge leading to gw level increase is significantly smaller than the impact of gw infiltration on gw recharge leading to gw level decrease this different impact stems from the presence of a colmation layer and from the small relative permeabilities under unsaturated conditions during stormwater exfiltration the reduction of annual gw recharge by spl is quantified for pipe domains with different standard defect sizes the parameter a defect was varied in the range of a defect 10 7 m2 per m pipe to 10 4 m2 per m pipe these values were estimated from wolf et al 2007 and karpf 2012 and they represent defect pipes with ages from very few years 10 7 m2 per m pipe to 100 years 10 4 m2 per m pipe the net cumulative dry weather flow leakage for all pipes was calculated using q leak net dry weather q leak in dry weather q leak ex dry weather as visualized in fig 10 it should be noted that q leak ex dry weather was always much smaller than q leak in dry weather the ratio of q leak net dry weather to the imposed constant q recharge was calculated for each defect size and results are visualized in fig 11 the threshold value of 1 denotes the maximum allowed reduction of gw recharge by leakage fig 11 clearly q leak net dry weather strongly depends on the defect size and it is equal to the chosen threshold of 1 of gw recharge at the standard defect size a defect 4 10 7 m2 per m pipe this corresponds to gw infiltration of 15 l day per 50 m pipe segment larger defect sizes result in a significantly larger reduction of annual gw recharge by leakage for example the defect size of a defect 1 10 5 m2 per m pipe leads to a reduction of gw recharge by gw infiltration into pipes of 23 this corresponds to gw infiltration of 340 l day per 50 m pipe segment which is in the same order of magnitude as results from kidmose et al 2015 this result shows that urbanization may significantly reduce gw recharge lerner 1990 for urban gw model calibration net leakage can either be quantified with a coupled model as is demonstrated here alternatively in the absence of a coupled model net leakage can be estimated using eq 1 with backfill sand intrinsic permeability and fluid properties the hydraulic gradient can be estimated by reading the local gw head and estimating pipe water levels from dry weather flow measurements the thickness of the colmation layer is usually between 0 01 m and 0 02 m and can be restricted to the pipe wall thickness in the absence of biofilm growth ellis et al 2009 because net leakage is mainly controlled by gw infiltration q leak in dry weather q leak ex dry weather stormwater exfiltration can be neglected for the calibration of an urban gw model 5 3 reduction of gw levels by leakage under dry weather flow conditions spl may significantly reduce groundwater levels in an urban catchment lerner 1986 to investigate this effect the parameter a defect was varied in the range of a defect 10 7 m2 per m pipe to 10 4 m2 per m pipe as in section 5 2 the mean gw level change in the vicinity of all pipe defects as well as maximum gw level increase and decrease over the entire model domain were calculated for each defect size and results are visualized in fig 12 clearly gw levels decrease with increasing defect size up to several meters for example a large standard defect of a defect 1 10 4 m2 per m pipe which is smaller than the statistical standard defect for the german city of dresden of 9 10 4 m2 per m pipe calculated by karpf 2012 leads to a mean decrease in gw level of 0 16 m and a maximum decrease of 3 m this result illustrates the dependence of urban gw levels on the condition of the pipe system in reverse conclusion it supports statements by herringshaw 2007 and thorndahl et al 2016a saying that a sudden decrease of pipe defects caused by e g a pipe rehabilitation can result in a significant rise of the gw level therefore while pipe rehabilitation is an important measure to avoid gw pollution by contaminated stormwater leakage resulting rising gw levels may lead to mobilization of pollutants and to urban infrastructure damages such as flooded basements or to unstable conditions of buildings by increased buoyancy the spatial distribution of gw level reduction from initial condition to steady state for standard defects larger than a defect 6 10 7 m2 per m pipe are visualized in figs 13 and 14 the spatial distribution of gw level reduction for standard defects smaller a defect 1 10 6 m2 per m pipe is not visualized because it was found to be insignificant also gw level increase by pipe water exfiltration was found to be insignificant and is therefore not given in figs 13 and 14 clearly gw level reduction can only occur where gw has been above pipe water at the initial condition thus part of the pipe network in the northern eastern and southwestern part are prone to gw infiltration and gw level reduction for a standard defect of a defect 1 10 4 m2 per m pipe gw level reduction is rather small 0 2 m in the eastern part of the domain while local gw level reduction is large 2 m in the western part this result correlates to initial gw levels above the pipe network in the catchment and all gw above the pipe system is drained away by the pipe system large gw level reduction occurs at locations where the gw above pipes has been large initially this result indicates that large defects in a pipe network reduce the gw levels to the depth of the pipe network it further indicates that despite larger standard defects per m pipe gw level reduction will not increase because the gw volume above the pipe network is limited clearly fig 13 further indicates that the spatial distribution of gw level reduction follows the spatial distribution of the pipe network and gw reduction resembles a drawdown of horizontal pumping well systems as described in e g grubb 1993 and rushton 2004 finally gw level reduction zones are larger at locations where the pipe network is more dense 5 4 generation of a leakage severity map under dry weather flow conditions gw infiltration decreases the capacity of a stormwater pipe network the drainage capacity of old pipe networks can be improved by reducing leaks stephenson 2012 especially in pipe sections where the pipe capacity is reduced by gw infiltration the result of the dry weather flow scenario with a standard defect size of 4 10 7 m2 per m pipe was used for mapping leakage in the pipe system with spl classified into severity categories the spatial distribution of spl including gw infiltration and stormwater exfiltration was plotted on a map by defining leakage flow classes such a map can be used as a decision making tool for a pipe rehabilitation plan the leakage severity map is visualized in fig 15 parts of the pipe network located in the southern and central part of the study area have a severity class of 0 and are not subject to leakage under dry weather flow conditions such pipes can be disregarded for rehabilitation parts of the pipe system in the eastern western and northern part have a severity class that is nonzero such pipes are subject to potentially large leakage and can be priorized for pipe rehabilitation a rehabilitation of only pipes prone to gw infiltration would result in an increased pipe system capacity and decreased manhole surcharge in case of strong rain events however as shown in section 5 3 such a rehabilitation may lead to a significant rise in groundwater levels and to associated problems such as flooded basements 5 5 impact of rain return period and temporal rainfall distribution on spl the rainfall scenarios aim at evaluating the impact of rain return period and temporal rainfall distribution on spl differently distributed rain events with different rps were assigned as source terms to the manholes of the pipe flow model the cumulative gw infiltration q leak in and the cumulative stormwater exfiltration q leak ex of the whole pipe network during the simulation time of 3 5 h were calculated for all rps and for all temporal rainfall distributions results are given in fig 16 clearly cumulative gw infiltration decreases in absolute numbers with increasing return period which is due to larger pipewater levels and thus smaller hydraulic gradients as mathematically described by eq 1 conversely stormwater exfiltration increases with increasing return period which is due to larger pipewater levels and larger hydraulic gradients in the colmation layer regarding the temporal distributions of rain events an early peak of rain leads to a small increase of gw infiltration in absolute numbers but only for events with small return periods results also indicate that cumulative stormwater exfiltration is not affected by the temporal distribution of rain no temporal distribution of rain events with significantly higher gw infiltration or stormwater exfiltration can be identified this important result leads to the conclusion that temporal distribution of rain has an insignificant impact on spl in the present study model results for an e1 rp100 rain event are visualized in fig 17 results for such an extreme rain event show that the pipe network is nearly completely drained after two hours pipewater drains towards the eastern part of the catchment where large pipewater levels last longer than in the western part of the catchment fig 17 visualizes leakage over time for an exemplary pipe which is prone to stormwater exfiltration clearly the temporal distribution of leakage does not fit to the temporal distribution of the rain event which is due to specific flow characteristics in the catchment including different pipe slopes retention times on the land surface and manhole surcharge pressures at this pipe vary in the range of 10 3 pa which is rather small maximum pressure changes in the whole domain are in the range of 10 1 pa for long pipes with large leakage 6 discussion and conclusions the application of a coupled three dimensional variably saturated subsurface flow model and a one dimensional pipe flow model for the simulation of spl on the scale of an urban catchment with a typical german stormwater pipe network in hydraulic connection with a typical northern german aquifer is presented in contrast to existing models spl is determined using pipewater levels and the three dimensional soil water pressure distribution a novel transfer function representing spl as a function of pipewater level and soil water pressure is introduced the derivation of such a transfer function is described in peche et al 2017 the calibration of the catchment scale groundwater model is carried out using a coupled matlab ogs procedure finally the coupled model is applied to scenarios of dry weather flow leakage and to scenarios of synthetic rain events to investigate the leakage response in summary novel key contributions and findings of the present study are given and discussed below the successful application of a coupled physically based model for the simulation of spl in an urban catchment is presented spl is simulated as exchange flux between one dimensional pipe flow and three dimensional variably saturated subsurface flow spl in form of pipewater exfiltration is calculated using a newly derived lf for stormwater leakage the lf used in this study is based on hydraulic properties of a stormwater colmation layer the hydraulic properties of the colmation layer affect spl in form of pipewater exfiltration significantly comparing the present lf with the lf for sewer leakage presented in peche et al 2017 leakage fluxes differ by two orders of magnitude because saturated intrinsic permeabilities of colmation layers differ by two orders of magnitude a stormwater pipe network colmation layer depends on the local conditions e g soil type land use specific physico chemical signature of the stormwater and should ideally be determined in a catchment specific manner which was not the case in the present study in the present study colmation layer properties are taken from le coustumer et al 2012 in the present model the process of precipitation driven land surface infiltration is not simulated it is assumed that the propagation of the wetting front up to a point where pipe leakage will be influenced at defect depth of several meters takes more time than the simulation time 3 5 h simulation time 1 h rain event this simplification stems from wetting front propagation studies with similar soil types initial conditions and boundary conditions ma et al 2010 herrada et al 2014 the validity of this simplification may be questionable for rain events of longer duration and larger intensity as the ones regarded here the successful calibration of a gw model using a coupled matlab ogs procedure is presented a defect pipe network is not included in the calibrated model pipe defects are assumed to be non existent in the study area calibration results show a maximum deviation in the m range compared with observed data such an over and underestimation of gw levels may lead to singificant over and underestimation of leakage this error could be diminished by a more thorough calibration procedure by e g using more observation data if available and introducing more κ zones leading to larger computational costs erroneous gw levels far below the pipe network do not affect leakage in form of pipewater exfiltration as described in peche et al 2017 analogously described for river gw interaction in e g brunner et al 2009 the hydraulic disconnection of leaky pipes from groundwater leads to the dependency of leakage only on pipe water level and not water pressure in the soil directly below the pipe defect furthermore it is recommended to carry out a transient gw model calibration using time dependent gw recharge data seasonal gw level fluctuations may be relatively small in the order of few dozens of centimeters in the present study but fluctuations are present thus the stationary calibration carried out in the present study may be questionable because seasonal fluctuations are not considered a sensitivity analysis with regards to intrinsic permeabilities and mean annual gw recharge was carried out it is shown that the hydraulic head distribution is sensitive to the area wise largest permeability zones κ 0 κ 4 this sensitivity with regards to permeabilites depends on both the size of the permeability zone and the number of observation points groundwater wells further the sensitivity analysis shows that model results are highly sensitive to a change in annual gw recharge this leads to the conclusion that gw recharge should be chosen judiciously and with large confidence annual gw recharge in the present study stems from nibis 2017 was verified against lysimeter measurements lemke and elbracht 2008 and is assumed to be of high confidence further this result shows that the gw head distribution and pipe leakage strongly depend on gw recharge it is therefore recommended to calculate pipe leakage under dynamic recharge conditions in long simulation time series however due to small timestep sizes necessary in the present model timestep size 4 s and consecutive computational effort the simulation of such a long time series was not possible in the present study in the present study pipe flow could not be calibrated due to lack of observation data this leads to questionable accuracy of the model however a thourough calibration of urban flow models is typically difficult thorndahl et al 2016b continous monitoring with several observation points in the pipe network and not only one discharge measurement at an outlet is recommended for the accurate calibration of a pipe flow model fraga et al 2017 such a flow monitoring is related to large expense the pipe flow model used in the present study is in operational use by the municipalities and is assumed to be reliable a parameter study on dry weather flow leakage with different standard pipe defect sizes per meter pipe was conducted it is shown that the process of pipewater exfiltration has a negligible impact on urban gw which is due to the presence of a colmation layer and related small fluxes despite pipewater exfiltration is small it may lead to contamination of soil and urban gw and is therefore of importance it is further shown that gw infiltration may drain away all gw above the pipe system for specific pipe conditions large standard defect sizes resulting gw levels after drainage are at the same elevation of the pipe network generally results demonstrate the strong dependence of urban groundwater on the condition of the stormwater pipe system net leakage for a standard defect larger than a defect 4 10 7 m2 per m pipe may exceed 1 of groundwater recharge standard defects larger than a defect 1 10 5 m2 per m pipe can lead to net leakage exceeding 20 of annual groundwater recharge these findings are in the similar range of results described in lerner and harris 2009 it is shown that standard defect sizes larger than a defect 1 10 5 m2 which is by an order of magnitude smaller than a standard defect for the german city of dresden derived by karpf 2012 lead to a mean decrease of the groundwater level in the range of several centimeters which correlates with findings from thorndahl et al 2016a the maximum local decrease of groundwater levels was found to be in the range of several meters it is further shown that if defects are larger than 4 10 7 m2 per m pipe and gw levels are shallow the process of pipe leakage must be included in the calibration of an urban gw model however this standard defect threshold value is soil property specific a systematic study investigating the effect of rain events of different return periods and temporal distributions on leakage was conducted results show that groundwater infiltration decreases in absolute numbers during rain events and that stormwater exfiltration increases during rain events both due to larger pipewater levels larger return periods result in larger stormwater exfiltration and smaller groundwater infiltration in absolute numbers the temporal distribution of rain does not significantly affect spl however leakage driven soil water pressure changes can be considered small for our scenarios the effect would be more significant for a case study with larger rain duration larger standard defects and larger leakage as the scenarios regarded here 7 outlook in future studies it would be interesting to investigate seasonal leakage fluctuations driven by seasonal gw recharge fluctuations and subsequent gw level fluctuations such a study may show that gw infiltration is larger in winter because shallow gw levels typically increase in winter further it is planned to apply the model on the scale of a city with more than 500 000 inhabitants and a pipe network of 2500 km length it is further planned to use model results in form of pipe and subsurface velocity fields for a eulerian based transport model sämann et al 2018 in order to analyze contaminant spreading in order to save computation time 3 5 h

6551,to reflect a key aspect of global socio hydrology this paper explores global virtual water use from source of exploitation to sink of final consumption via interregional trades within the world economy as reflected by world input output database for 2014 an embodiment accounting model is developed which takes full account of virtual water feedbacks related to primary inputs global total trade volume of virtual water is estimated to be in magnitude around 30 of the global direct freshwater withdrawal moreover it is revealed that global virtual water transfer in intermediate trade is in magnitude around 1 4 times that in final trade in intermediate trade of virtual water china japan and the united kingdom turn out to be the three leading net importers while india russia and the united states are revealed as the leading net exporters in final trade of virtual water the united states japan and russia are the major net importers in contrast to china india and mexico as the leading net exporters trade connections and imbalances of major economies in terms of virtual water are quantified and analyzed two new indicators in terms of water self sufficiency rate by source and that by sink are devised it is found that around 40 of the use of china s freshwater withdrawal finally sinks into foreign economies while only 20 of china s virtual water use originates from other regions with regard to germany canada and france they behave like active pumps driving vast virtual water inflows and outflows demonstrating their high involvement in the global supply chain in terms of virtual water with the increasingly frequent virtual water transfer within the world economy nations and regions ought to assess their behaviors in intermediate and final trades of virtual water for sustainable use of freshwater resources keywords global socio hydrology world economy virtual water global supply chain trade imbalance 1 introduction as a new interdisciplinary science of people and water socio hydrology has attracted wide attention in recent years sivapalan et al 2012 di baldassarre et al 2013 troy et al 2015 in contrast to eco hydrology that aims at studying the relations between water and ecological systems guo et al 2018 jiang and chen 2019 socio hydrology seeks to quantitatively explore how water resources interact with human and the world economy sivapalan et al 2012 blair and buytaert 2016 given the water availability and the changing nature of the world economy water resource management becomes much more uncertain and calls for wider interdisciplinary approaches combining social science just as pointed out in an editorial article of journal of hydrology ratna and syme 2014 as a crucial aspect of socio hydrology virtual water trade has gained wide exposure in the academic field in recent years as could be witnessed from the exponential growth of related studies fang and chen 2015 feng et al 2014 guan and hubacek 2007 liu et al 2017 lutter et al 2016 yang et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 in a globalized world where freshwater resources are distributed unbalancedly a water insufficient region may alleviate local water scarcity by importing large quantities of water intensive products such as food and beverage products from foreign regions oki and kanae 2004 vanham et al 2017 wang et al 2014 this phenomenon was first noticed by allan 1993 1996 1998a early in the 1990s who raised the concept of virtual water as a description of the conceptual amount of freshwater embedded in the traded products and used it to explain the absence of conflicts related with water resources in middle east regions allan 1997 1998b closely related with the notion of virtual water water footprint was later proposed by hoekstra and hung 2002 as a consumption based indicator to incorporate the offsite information into consideration which has been then widely applied to quantifying the amount of freshwater use induced to satisfy a nation s demand of all kinds of goods and services chapagain et al 2006 chapagain and hoekstra 2007 hoekstra and chapagain 2006 sun et al 2017 in fact the invisible transfer of ecological elements induced by international trade has been demonstrated not only for freshwater resources but also for primary energy resources chen and wu 2017 yang et al 2014 land resources qiang et al 2013 wu et al 2018 carbon emissions mi et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 particulate matters meng et al 2016 etc for instance the ipcc fifth assessment report ipcc 2014 has directed full attention to the carbon emissions induced outside the a nation s territory due to the international exchange of goods or services within a highly interconnected world economy virtual water trade is playing a more and more important role in redistributing the use of freshwater resources along the fragmented global supply chain carr et al 2013 hoekstra and hung 2005 chapagain and hoekstra 2008 according to carr et al 2012 the total amount of global virtual water trade has more than doubled over the period from 1986 to 2008 while the interconnectedness of the virtual water trade network as represented by the number of links between nations has risen by 92 similar results are derived by dalin et al 2012 in analyzing the global virtual water transfer associated with food trade from 1986 to 2007 as seen since almost all nations and regions have been involved in the global virtual water trade due to the high frequency of interregional exchange of goods and services it is essential to discuss their water supply and consumption under the global context hoekstra and hung 2005 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 hanasaki et al 2010 reimer 2012 whereas at present national and regional governments mainly adopt a local perspective instead of a global perspective when carrying out national or supranational policies towards water use and conservation such as the red line for freshwater exploitation raised in the opinions of the state council on applying the strictest water resources control system statecouncil 2012 in china and the water framework directive ec 2000 in the european union in the related policy packages measures such as promoting the development of irrigation infrastructure and improving the efficiency of water cycling facilities are often adopted to cope with water shortage which are demonstrated to be insufficient to deal with the rising water demand required by the booming population and economic growth lenzen et al 2013 konar et al 2012 few governmental policy makers recognized the important role of virtual water trade or considered altering their trade patterns as a possible means of mitigating the local scarcity of water resources such as reducing the exports of water intensive goods to other countries in particular currently a key trade related concern remains with the economic trade imbalance which has recently induced global trade disputes trump 2018 whitehouse 2018 nevertheless though the trade imbalance in monetary terms has been widely focused on the trade imbalance in terms of virtual water has been generally neglected in policy packages and intergovernmental negotiations in fact international trade inevitably leads to trade imbalance of virtual water in the study by lenzen et al 2013 it is found that japan germany and the united states are the major net importers of virtual water while pakistan and china turn out as the major deficit regions in virtual water trade regarding existing studies on virtual water it is noticed that they mainly adopt a demand pull perspective by assigning direct water use to final demand feng et al 2014 lenzen et al 2013 zhang and anadon 2014 which originates from normative economics that reflects subjective value judgements or ethical percepts on economic development samuelson and nordhaus 2010 it is worth pointing out that with different norms or value judgements held there exist different corresponding accounting frameworks such as production based accounting peters 2008 final demand based accounting davis et al 2011 lenzen et al 2013 sales based accounting kanemoto et al 2012 income based accounting marques et al 2012 liang et al 2017 household consumption based accounting wu et al 2019 total consumption based accounting wu et al 2019 etc while these normative accounting frameworks final demand based accounting is most commonly used at present are supportive to enhancing our understanding on virtual water use of nations and regions from different perspectives producers perspective final users perspective final producers perspective primary input providers perspective household consumers perspective total final consumers perspective etc they are unable to reflect the objective performance of the economy in terms of virtual water also a main focus of socio hydrology to give an objective measurement of the economy from the perspective of virtual water chen and his colleagues raised the embodiment accounting model supported by input output tables to trace the virtual water embodied in the monetary flows regardless of intermediate products or final products chen and chen 2013 han et al 2018 shao et al 2017 by extending the biophysical balance model of embodied energy proposed by herendeen 1973 for instance on the global scale chen and chen 2013 undertook virtual water accounting for the globalized world economy and investigated the international virtual water trade different from normative accounting methods as subjective assignment of water use to different agents embodiment accounting is capable of tracing the circulation of virtual water within global economic network which stems from positive economics that reflects the fact of an economy therefore for the goods and services within the economy virtual water becomes a property inherent in them the global economy could thus be treated as not only a network of monetary flows but also a network of virtual water flows with external freshwater support nevertheless it is also noticed that in previous studies by chen and his colleagues chen and chen 2013 han et al 2018 the embodiment accounting model proposed for the world economy fails to take account of the virtual water feedbacks associated with primary inputs from the society and is thus not consistent with the principle of circular economy it treats the products used for global final demand including household consumption consumption of non profit institutions government consumption gross fixed capital formation and changes in inventories and valuables as the sink of virtual water whereas for the world economy modelled by the global input output table only the products used for genuine final consumptive purposes including household consumption consumption of non profit institutions and government consumption could be treated as the sink of virtual water while the products used as capital goods namely those used as gross fixed capital formation and changes in inventories and valuables will move into the economic system via social redistribution matrix representing how final demand is linked with primary inputs to sustain the economic production as primary inputs thus making the economic network circular wu et al 2018 2019 in order to clearly explain how the global economy interacts with freshwater resources it is necessary to direct full consideration to the virtual water feedbacks associated with primary inputs from the society by resorting to the statistics for world economy in 2014 this study seeks to reflect a key aspect of global socio hydrology by exploring the circulation of virtual water within the global economic network from source of exploitation to sink of final consumption an embodiment accounting model that takes full account of virtual water feedbacks associated with primary inputs is proposed the interregional transfer of virtual water and the associated trade imbalances of nations and regions are quantified and analyzed two new indicators in terms of water self sufficiency rate by source and that by sink are devised which are expected to shed light on national water security as well as international collaboration on sustainable water use 2 methodology and data source 2 1 embodiment accounting in this study an embodiment accounting model supported by water withdrawal data and a global multi region input output account is developed based on the one reported in our previous studies chen and chen 2013 han et al 2018 embodiment accounting originated from embodied energy accounting that firstly appeared in the work by herendeen 1973 which attempted to calculate the direct and indirect energy cost of goods and services in the united states during the 1970s embodied energy accounting has been widely applied especially by the energy research group in the university of illinois to analyzing energy requirements of different economies bullard and herendeen 1975 bullard et al 1978 costanza 1980 denton 1975 hannon et al 1983 hannon 2010 herendeen 1974 1978a b later by an integration of the embodiment concept in systems ecology raised by odum 1983 1995 into the biophysical balance model raised by herendeen 1973 embodied energy accounting has been generalized by chen and his colleagues to embodiment accounting of ecological elements such as energy chen and chen 2011 2013 wu and chen 2017 2018 arable land chen and han 2015 wu et al 2018 water chen and chen 2013 han et al 2018 greenhouse gas chen and chen 2011 and mercury emissions chen et al 2016 li et al 2017 for the world economy details of the embodiment accounting model for water use by the world economy could be found in our previous works chen and chen 2013 han et al 2018 within which an economic sector is taken as the basic unit as illustrated in fig 1 a under our previous accounting model the biophysical balance of water use for an economic sector within the world economy is established as the sum of water use embodied in the intermediate inputs of the sector plus its direct freshwater withdrawal is equal to the water use embodied in the output products of the sector the direct freshwater withdrawal represents the exogenous environmental support for the economy while water use embodied in intermediate inputs may be regarded as internal feedback within the global economic system therefore bearing a resemblance to the flow field guo et al 2018 jiang et al 2017 wang and chen 2016 the world economy could be viewed as a network of embodied water flows namely virtual water flows with exogenous water inputs from the environment nevertheless the water use embodied in the primary inputs has not been accounted in this accounting model presented as illustrated in table 1 the economic inputs into a sector are classified as intermediate inputs from all the economic sectors and primary inputs from the society meanwhile a sector s output products flow in two directions some of them are used as intermediate inputs into economic sectors the others are presented to society within the global economic input output account a sector s output that is presented to society is used as household consumption consumption of non profit institutions government consumption gross fixed capital formation changes in inventories and valuables as previously mentioned the output products used as capital goods are not genuinely consumed and will go into the economic network as primary inputs to support the economic activities just as illustrated in fig 1 b nevertheless regarding the embodiment accounting model presented in fig 1 a attention is only directed to the water use embodied in the intermediate inputs from economic sectors while that embodied in the primary inputs is neglected by taking account of the water use embodied in both primary and intermediate inputs this study moves a step forward to rebuild the biophysical balance model in our previous work 2 2 algorithm as illustrated in table 1 the world economy has been disaggregated into m regions with each region comprising n l economic sectors l ranges from 1 to m the biophysical balance for an economic unit in terms of water use is presented in fig 2 for sector k in region t it could be expressed as unit j where j k l 1 t 1 n l as witnessed w j represents external freshwater withdrawal from the environment into unit j x i j e represents the amount of the output of unit i that is used as intermediate inputs into unit j x j represents the total output of unit j that comprises two parts namely i 1 n x j i e n l 1 m n l and x j s while i 1 n x j i e represents the amount of the output of unit j that is used as intermediate inputs into economic sectors x j s stands for the amount of the output of unit j that is presented to the society meanwhile x j s could be divided into two parts namely x jc s representing the amount of the output of unit j that is used as genuine final consumption and x jo s representing the amount of the output of unit j that is used as fixed capital formation as well as changes in inventories and valuables p j represents the primary inputs into unit j ε p represents the embodied water intensity of p j ε j is the embodied water intensity of x j ε i is the embodied water intensity of x i j e therefore i 1 n ε i x i j e represents the amount of water use embodied in the intermediate inputs from all economic sectors into unit j ε p p j represents the amount of water use embodied in the primary inputs into unit j the biophysical balance of water use for unit j is thus expressed as 1 w j i 1 n ε i x i j e ε p p j ε j x j the matrix notation for eq 1 is established as 2 w ε x e ε p p ε x where w w j 1 n is the row vector for freshwater withdrawal as exogenous environmental inputs p p j 1 n is the row vector for primary inputs x e x i j e n n is the square matrix for economic transactions between sectors x is the diagonal matrix for x x i n 1 besides ε ε j 1 n is a row vector in eq 2 w p x e and x are available from the environmental statistics and global economic input output account meanwhile it needs to be especially noted that the world economy as represented by global input output account contains several balance conditions first all the sectoral output products presented by the economy to the society maintain a monetary balance with the primary inputs from the society into the economy second the water use embodied in the capital goods products used as gross fixed capital formation and changes in inventories and valuables equals that embodied in the primary inputs in the input output account only through the social redistribution matrix or referred to as social accounting matrix in the fourth quadrant could the capital goods get into the economy as primary inputs it is worth noting that the global input output account makes a normalization of the economy so that capital goods may keep circulating in the world economy via the redistribution matrix currently though social accounting matrixes of some national economies for specific years have been released hanson and robinson 1991 wang and li 2008 such matrix that corresponds to the global input output account is unavailable without the social accounting matrix it is unable for us to differentiate the embodied water intensity of the primary inputs by sector hence as a preliminary treatment it is assumed that all the primary inputs have the same embodied water intensity therefore another biophysical balance equation in terms of water use is presented as 3 ε p j 1 n p j i 1 n ε i x io s in matrix form eq 3 is expressed as 4 ε p p sum ε x o s where p sum represents the sum total of all primary inputs x o s x jo s n 1 represents the sectoral output products used as capital goods therefore by combing eqs 2 and 4 the row vector for embodied water intensity of sectoral output could be derived as 5 ε w x x e 1 p sum x o s p 1 hence virtual water use vwu of region t as expressed by water embodied in the goods and services delivered for region t s final consumption is formulated as 6 vwu t i 1 n ε i x ic st besides the direct freshwater withdrawal dfw of region t is formulated as 7 dfw t k 1 l 1 t 1 n l l 1 t n l w k t meanwhile supported by embodied water intensity of the sectoral output products the virtual water embodied in region t s intermediate imports vwii t that embodied in its final imports vwfi t and that embodied in its total imports vwi t could be respectively expressed as 8 vwii t i 1 i 1 l 1 t 1 n l l 1 t n l n ε i x i et and 9 vwfi t i 1 i 1 l 1 t 1 n l l 1 t n l n ε i x i st and 10 vwi t vwii t vwfi t i 1 i 1 l 1 t 1 n l l 1 t n l n ε i x i et ε i x i st in which x i et and x i st respectively denote the amount of unit i s output that is used as intermediate inputs into the economic sectors of region t and the amount of unit i s output that is used as final demand of region t similarly the virtual water embodied in region t s intermediate exports vwie t that embodied in its final exports vwfe t and that embodied in its total exports vwe t could be respectively expressed as 11 vwie t k 1 l 1 t 1 n l l 1 t n l ε k x k te and 12 vwfe t k 1 l 1 t 1 n l l 1 t n l ε k x k ts and 13 vwe t vwie t vwfe t k 1 l 1 t 1 n l l 1 t n l ε k x k te ε k x k ts in which x k te and x k ts respectively denote the amount of the output of sector k in region t that is used as intermediate inputs into economic sectors and the amount of the output of sector k in region t that is delivered to the society as final demand meanwhile virtual water embodied in region t s intermediate trade balance that embodied in its final trade balance and that embodied in its total trade balance are respectively expressed as 14 vwitb t vwii t vwie t and 15 vwftb t vwfi t vwfe t and 16 vwttb t vei t vee t vwitb t vwftb t a positive vwitb t vwftb t and vwttb t respectively signify that region t is a net importer of virtual water in intermediate trade a net importer in final trade and a net importer in total trade 2 3 data sources the world bank 2017 presents us with the freshwater withdrawals of the world regions in the year 2014 which are adopted in this study as the exogenous freshwater inputs from the environment consistent with that in our previous work chen and chen 2013 this study does not take the rainwater direct utilization into account due to the high uncertainty the freshwater withdrawal includes agricultural water withdrawal industrial water withdrawal and domestic water withdrawal the agricultural water withdrawal refers to freshwater resources exploited by the agriculture sector for irrigation and other agricultural purposes industrial water withdrawal refers to freshwater resources exploited by the industrial sectors for production purposes such as mining manufacturing and electricity production domestic water withdrawal refers to freshwater resources exploited for residential daily use besides a most recent multi region input output account for world economy 2014 is adopted from the world input output database timmer et al 2015 in which the world is divided into 44 nations and regions including one modelling the rest of the world row each region is comprised of 56 economic sectors therefore altogether 2464 economic units are included in the model appendices a and b respectively present the details of the regions and economic sectors 3 results 3 1 virtual water use of nations and regions the direct freshwater withdrawal and virtual water use of the 43 regions are both demonstrated in fig 3 with the corresponding numerical values presented in appendix c as witnessed india china and the united states stand out as the prominent water users india occupies the leading place in terms of both direct freshwater withdrawal and virtual water use amounting to 761 02 billion cubic meters gm3 and 701 73 gm3 respectively china takes the second place in direct freshwater withdrawal 607 80 gm3 but comes third in virtual water use 454 08 gm3 with regard to the united states its virtual water use and direct freshwater withdrawal respectively amount to 595 75 gm3 and 485 60 gm3 as witnessed the direct freshwater withdrawal of china is in magnitude around one third higher than its virtual water use while that of the united states is in magnitude around one fifth lower than its virtual water use this is mainly due to the different trade patterns which will be discussed in the following sections the details for sectoral contributions to virtual water use of some leading users are presented in fig 4 in the outer ring of fig 4 the sectors are consistent with those listed in the world input output database while in the inner ring the sectors are aggregated into twenty sections to be consistent with those in the international standard industry classification revision 4 un 2008 as enunciated in appendix b as seen for india section a agriculture forestry and fishing accounts for 64 43 of its total virtual water use followed by section c manufacturing sharing 20 05 section e water supply sewerage etc sharing 6 46 section i accommodation and food service activities sharing 4 39 etc india is endowed with the largest area of arable land within the asian regions agriculture industry which is highly water intensive and involved with the overwhelming majority of india s population has long been a backbone industry of india s economy hence agriculture industry serves the dominant contributor to the virtual water use of india for the united states it shall arouse our attention that agricultural industry only accounts for less than 8 of its total virtual water use in the meanwhile section c manufacturing occupies 38 33 of the united states virtual water use which demonstrates the massive water requirement by the industrial activities among the manufacturing industries food beverage industry and textile industry are the two largest contributors respectively dedicating to 20 78 and 3 81 of the united states virtual water use besides section l real estate activities etc section o public administration and defense etc and section q human health and social work activities altogether contribute to over one quarter of the virtual water use of the united states revealing the nation s heavy investment into medical care and public administration activities for these service sectors they are located at the high end value chain therefore though the related activities do not require many direct water inputs they induce large quantities of water use associated with intermediate products from other sectors as well as primary inputs from the society similar to the united states japan is also highly reliant on service industries section i accommodation and food service activities section l real estate activities section o public administration and defense etc and section q human health and social work activities altogether account for approximately 30 of japan s virtual water use for china though with a long history of agricultural tradition it has been undergoing the drastic transitional process from a central planned economy to a market based economy during the last three decades since the reform and opening up as demonstrated in fig 4 section a agriculture forestry and fishing and section c manufacturing respectively hold accountable for 23 97 and 37 95 of china s virtual water use meanwhile section o public administration and defense etc section p education and section q human health and social work activities altogether account for over one sixth of china s virtual water use which has demonstrated the growing residential demands for services provided by tertiary industry in china fig 5 presents the per capita virtual water use of each region as natural resources are essential biophysical support to sustain the economy per capita resource use may serve as a biophysical index to measure the living standards of a region the per capita virtual water use of each region is illustrated to be unevenly distributed ranging from 320 70 m3 cap to 1871 11 m3 cap among the world regions excluding row covered in the world input output database thirty regions are revealed to be above the world average level 545 71 m3 cap in terms of per capita virtual water use as witnessed the per capita virtual water use of the united states far outstrips that of other regions this amount is up to 1870 11 m3 cap which is around five times as much as the average level of world economy and one and a half times as much as that of japan 1181 42 m3 cap the per capita virtual water use of the united kingdom 910 31 m3 cap france 902 39 m3 cap and germany 898 60 m3 cap generally remain on the same level which are in magnitude around half of that of the united states while for china india and brazil their per capita water use are respectively calculated to be 332 84 m3 cap 542 36 m3 cap and 409 40 m3 cap the per capita virtual water use of india stays on the same level with the world average for china its virtual water use is around three fifths of the world average and one sixth of that for the united states as seen though india and china are the major virtual water users in the world their per capita virtual water use are far below the world average level this has revealed the inferior domestic living standards in these two regions whose residents gain much less biophysical welfare in comparison to those developed economies 3 2 water use embodied in trade the water use embodied in the imports divided into intermediate imports and final imports and exports divided into final imports and final exports of the regions are respectively presented in fig 6 as distinguished by color the global total trade volume of virtual water the sum of the virtual water import of all 44 regions covered in the world input output database is calculated to amount to 1245 65 gm3 which is in magnitude equivalent to over 30 of the global total direct freshwater withdrawal within the world regions not including row the top ten importers of virtual water are the united states 164 89 gm3 china 124 15 gm3 germany 74 66 gm3 japan 66 50 gm3 the united kingdom 44 54 gm3 france 43 37 gm3 canada 42 12 gm3 south korea 33 99 gm3 italy 32 25 gm3 and netherlands 32 06 gm3 for the united states its intermediate import 77 54 gm3 and its final import of virtual water 87 35 gm3 stay on the same level suggesting the intensive requirements of its domestic industries as well as the residential consumers for the virtual water use from abroad the united kingdom canada and france are demonstrated to be in a similar situation while for germany and japan different pictures are observed for these two developed nations the ratios of whose intermediate import of virtual water to final import are respectively obtained as 1 29 and 1 27 for these two nations on one hand they need plenty of foreign products to satisfy domestic consumers needs on other hand germany and japan require massive intermediate products from abroad to manufacture high value added goods such as automobiles and electronic products therefore water use embodied in their intermediate import turns out be larger than that in their final import for china the intermediate import of virtual water 90 11 gm3 is around two and a half times as much as its final import 34 04 gm3 revealing the heavy dependency of china on the imported water use to manufacture the finished goods with regard to exports china and the united states are the two leading exporters of virtual water with the virtual water export amounting to 152 39 gm3 and 133 55 gm3 respectively the major exporters in the second echelon are india 68 42 gm3 and germany 56 99 gm3 followed by canada 35 32 gm3 mexico 33 92 gm3 italy 33 03 gm3 france 29 82 gm3 netherlands 28 06 gm3 and indonesia 26 13 gm3 coming in the third echelon while china s intermediate export of virtual water 67 71 gm3 is around 80 of its final export 84 69 the united states intermediate export 86 16 gm3 is around twice as much as its final export 47 39 gm3 china has the title of the world factory as it supplies the world with products made in china which are mainly consumer goods such as textile products appliances telecommunication products and plastic goods therefore a large amount of virtual water use flows from china into overseas economies for other major exporters including india germany canada mexico and netherlands the ratios of their intermediate export to final export of virtual water are respectively obtained as 1 22 1 28 2 19 0 49 and 1 71 as seen canada and netherlands which supply a large number of intermediate products to foreign economies stand out among these regions with comparatively higher ratios while for mexico according to existing statistics oec 2017 finished products such as automobiles electrical apparatuses and agricultural products tomatoes pepper watermelon onions pawpaw etc account for the bulk of its total exports therefore mexico s intermediate export of virtual water is only around half of its final export the net trades of virtual water as distinguished by net intermediate trade and net final trade are presented in fig 7 in intermediate trade of virtual water the leading net importers are china japan the united kingdom south korea and germany whose trade surpluses of virtual water respectively amount to 22 40 gm3 22 04 gm3 11 29 gm3 10 59 gm3 and 10 10 gm3 the leading net exporters are india russia the united states indonesia and brazil whose trade deficits of virtual water are respectively 21 47 gm3 11 87 gm3 8 62 gm3 4 47 gm3 and 3 66 gm3 in final trade of virtual water the united states japan russia the united kingdom and canada come as the several leading net importers whose trade surpluses of virtual water are respectively 39 96 gm3 19 58 gm3 19 00 gm3 18 53 gm3 and 9 23 gm3 china india mexico turkey and spain come as the major deficit regions whose net export of virtual water amount to 50 64 gm3 24 97 gm3 13 96 gm3 6 63 gm3 and 4 52 gm3 as witnessed japan gains a considerable surplus of virtual water in both intermediate trade and final trade for china and the united states they play different roles in intermediate trade and final trade while china is a net importer in intermediate trade and net exporter in final trade the united states serves to be a net exporter in intermediate trade and net importer in final trade the trade imbalances of regions will be discussed in detail in section 4 1 the details of sectoral constituents of intermediate imports and exports of the three biggest surplus regions and three biggest deficit regions in intermediate trade are presented in fig 8 for china while agricultural sector answers for around 30 of its intermediate imports the contribution of agricultural industry to the intermediate exports of china is negligible since the opening up reform arable land area has encountered an evident decrease with the invasion of built up areas into rural areas desertion of arable land caused by migration of peasants into cities and water soil loss therefore currently china relies heavily on foreign agricultural products for domestic reproduction activities to offset domestic under capacity in food production correspondingly vast virtual water comes along with the imported agricultural products into china similarly for japan while agricultural industry contributes to around one fourth of its intermediate import of virtual water it only accounts for around 1 of its intermediate export for india as the largest deficit region in intermediate trade agricultural industry contributes dominantly to its intermediate export of virtual water sharing around half of the total meanwhile food industry and textiles industry altogether account for around one fifth of india s total intermediate export of virtual water illustrating the importance of light industry to india s economy besides it shall be also noted that foreign agricultural industry also delivers 6 62 of india s intermediate import of virtual water for russia mining industry takes up 44 38 of russia s intermediate export of virtual water at the same time while manufacturing industries are responsible for around 35 of russia s intermediate export of virtual water they answer for over 70 of its intermediate imports for the united states agricultural sector holds accountable for 15 10 and 23 17 of its intermediate import and export of virtual water respectively besides foreign mining industry provides essential support for the united states domestic production industries accounting for 13 17 of the united states intermediate import of virtual water the details for sectoral constituents of final imports and exports of the three leading surplus regions and three leading deficit regions in final trade are presented in fig 9 for the united states final import of virtual water agriculture industry food industry and textiles industry are the pillar contributors respectively accountable for 19 82 15 18 and 23 21 of the total for japan food industry contributes dominantly to its final import of virtual water occupying a share of around 40 which has demonstrated japan s intensive requirements for food products from abroad for russia with limited supply of light industry products textiles industry is observed to play a dominant role in its final import of virtual water taking up a proportion of around 40 followed by the food industry sharing around one fifth for china as the largest deficit region of virtual water in final trade textiles industry contributes to around one third of its final export of virtual water for india food industry agriculture industry and textiles industry as the three pillar contributors respectively dedicate to 35 90 26 36 and 19 82 of its total final export of virtual water 3 3 virtual water transfer between economies the virtual water transfer between economies is presented in this section the twenty eight european union countries have been integrated into one region namely eu fig 10 a and b illustrate the virtual water connections between these seventeen economies in intermediate trade and net intermediate trade respectively in fig 10a the chord linking the two economies represents the bilateral virtual water flows the different lengths at the two ends of a chord stand for the export volumes of the two linked economies to each other while the color of the chord is consistent with that of the larger exporter of the two economies linked for china as the largest virtual water exporter among these seventeen economies in intermediate trade around 16 08 of its intermediate export of virtual water is received by eu 11 07 by the united states 6 49 by south korea and 6 42 by japan for the united states the major receivers of its intermediate export are eu canada mexico and china which respectively take a share of 17 35 15 85 15 84 and 10 54 as seen canada and mexico as the neighbors of the united states altogether answer for around 30 of the united states intermediate import meanwhile for canada and mexico around two thirds of their intermediate export of virtual water comes into the united states which further illustrates the tight bilateral trade relationship between the united states and its neighbors india also acts as a notable exporter of virtual water in intermediate trade around half of its intermediate exports flow into row one seventh into eu one eighth into china and one twelfth into the united states in fig 10b the lengths at the two ends of a chord stand for the net virtual water transfer between the two economies connected while the color of the chord is consistent with that of the net exporter in intermediate trade china is illustrated to receive a deficit of virtual water 6 04 gm3 with eu but a surplus with brazil 4 44 gm3 a surplus with india 2 91 gm3 and a surplus with the united states 1 58 gm3 as seen in intermediate trade eu is a major receiver of the net outflows of virtual water from china while developing economies serve to be the suppliers of the net inflows of virtual water into china for eu it is demonstrated to receive a surplus of virtual water in intermediate trade with the majority of its trading partners for the united states it is observed to obtain a deficit of virtual water in intermediate trade with most of its trading partners such as that with mexico 6 22 gm3 that with eu 5 98 gm3 that with japan 3 09 gm3 and that with china 1 58 gm3 besides the united states maintains a surplus of virtual water in intermediate trade with canada 2 62 gm3 and brazil 0 75 gm3 the virtual water transfer between the seventeen economies in final trade is presented in fig 11 a notable couples of virtual water transfer in final trade are china row 30 10 gm3 18 72 gm3 india row 18 43 gm3 3 19 gm3 the united state row 12 63 gm3 28 14 gm3 eu row 22 57 gm3 42 89 gm3 china the united states 15 39 gm3 3 59 gm3 china eu 12 81 gm3 5 05 gm3 mexico usa 18 23 gm3 4 56 gm3 etc in final trade china is shown to be a major supplier of water use for all world regions for eu it exports a considerable amount of virtual water and at the same time receives massive water welfare from outside economies in final trade similar circumstance is also observed for the united states as seen in final trade canada and mexico are respectively responsible for around one quarter and about one tenth of the virtual water export of the united states in the meanwhile while around 70 of the final export of virtual water by canada goes into the united states around 80 of that by mexico is received by the united states the united states and canada are observed to reach a balance in bilateral final trade of virtual water while for the bilateral final trade between the united states and mexico the virtual water flow 10 89 gm3 from mexico to the united states is around four times that from the united states to mexico the net transfer of virtual water between the seventeen economies in final trade is shown in fig 11b while economies such as eu the united states russia japan and australia receive a surplus of virtual water with row in final trade china and india are shown to have a deficit of virtual water with row in final trade which respectively reach an amount of 11 38 gm3 and 15 24 gm3 this enunciates the contributive roles of these two emerging economies in supplying the economic utility of freshwater resources to the rest of the world besides in final trade china has a virtual water deficit of 7 76 gm3 with eu and a deficit of 11 80 gm3 with the united states meanwhile the united states receives a deficit of virtual water 0 21 gm3 in final trade with eu as demonstrated though the trade activities between the united states and eu are frequent the bilateral final trade of virtual water almost reaches a balance for the united states it mainly receives net final trade inflows of virtual water from china mexico and row for canada serving a most important trading partner of the united states it receives a net virtual water inflow of 3 43 gm3 from the united states in final trade 4 discussions 4 1 trade imbalances of regions fig 12 presents the trade balances of the forty three regions the horizonal axis represents the economic trade balances of the regions while the vertical axis corresponds to the trade balances of regions in terms of virtual water the spherical ball s size is on behalf of the total trade volume of each region in terms of virtual water the regions near the origin point generally maintain a balance in terms of both currency and virtual water such as australia spain portugal mexico and indonesia regions far from the origin point are accompanied by notable trade imbalances either in terms of currency or virtual water the trade imbalances of the united states and china are especially distinct although the united states has a notable economic trade deficit reaching up to 48 06 billion dollars it also enjoys a trade surplus of 31 34 gm3 in terms of virtual water the united states trade deficit has endured during the last several decades which appears as one of the most vexing problem of the united states government the trump administration has claimed to slash its economic trade deficit with its key trading partners such as china and germany trade protection measures such as largely increasing the tariffs have been carried out to lessen its trade deficit as well as to bring the manufacturing jobs back home ustr 2018 whereas as revealed in this study the virtual water surplus of the united states is also huge this shall be paid full attention in intergovernmental negotiations especially at current stage when sustainability has become one of the most urgent concerns for humans with large quantities of products imported from abroad the united states is capable of improving the living standards of domestic citizens by making full use of the environmental welfare endowed by freshwater resources in foreign countries this may in the meanwhile induce water scarcity problems in the territories of its trading partners such as china with a large population and an extremely unbalanced distribution of water resources nevertheless little attention has been focused on compensating the depletion of water resources in these regions as seen in fig 12 though china gets an economic trade surplus of 58 26 billion dollars its trade deficit of virtual water is as much as 28 24 gm3 as seen the trade imbalance of china is in magnitude approximate to that of the united states in terms of both currency and virtual water for india it has the largest trade deficit of virtual water that amounts to 46 44 gm3 in magnitude around one and a half times as much as that of china at the same time it needs to be noted that india nearly maintains a balance in economic trade this is mainly because that a large number of india s exports are agricultural products rice fruits cotton etc food products and textile products scarfs blankets soaps etc which are generally water intensive and low value added besides india needs to import lots of high value added finished products such as electronic products household appliances transport equipment etc in this way india exports a large quantity of low value added and water intensive products in exchange of the high value added goods therefore india is revealed to deliver massive water use to foreign regions but gain little trade surplus in terms of currency inversely japan is illustrated to be in an opposite situation japan receives the largest trade surplus of virtual water that reaches up to 41 61 gm3 which is in magnitude approximate to the trade deficit of virtual water for india at the same time japan s economic trade deficit is only 7 18 billion dollars as seen though japan is severely scarce of natural resources it attains the use of water resources by bringing in lots of raw materials and semi products from foreign agriculture and manufacturing industries for domestic reproduction as presented in section 3 2 meanwhile japan s exports are mainly high value added products including cars vehicle modules and electronic products which to a great extent neutralize its economic trade imbalance brought about by the massive imports for regions like the united kingdom and france they are scattered near the vertical axis these economies are almost balanced in economic trade but have a notable trade surplus of virtual water while for economies including germany and south korea they receive a trade surplus in terms of both currency and virtual water in particular germany enjoys an economic trade surplus of 39 04 billion dollars and a virtual water trade surplus of 17 67 gm3 as demonstrated international trade has brought into germany both currency and water use from foreign regions this is mainly because of their multiple roles in the global supply chain for instance germany outsources the industries situating at the low end value chain abroad and keeps advanced manufacturing industries situating in the medium to high end value chain such as cars and accessories medical equipment planes and aircrafts at home therefore along with the massive high value added products exported abroad germany may obtain a remarkable economic trade surplus besides due to the virtual water inflows associated with the low value added imports as well as the comparatively water efficient technologies in domestic industries a notable trade surplus of virtual water is achieved in fig 13 the intermediate trade balance and final trade balance in terms of virtual water are presented with the parting lines categorizing the nations and regions into four different kinds of trade patterns for the united states russia canada australia and the united kingdom that are near the positive vertical axis they are final trade oriented importers of virtual water their imbalance of virtual water in final trade in magnitude surpasses that in intermediate trade meantime while economies such as the united states russia and canada are net exporters of virtual water in intermediate trade economies such as the united kingdom and australia gain a virtual water surplus in intermediate trade in contrast china is featured as a final trade oriented exporter of virtual water as previously calculated the final trade imbalance of china in terms of virtual water is in magnitude over twice as much as its intermediate trade imbalance for economies near the positive horizonal axis such as south korea and taiwan they could be regarded as intermediate trade oriented importers of virtual water for south korea while its intermediate trade surplus of virtual water amounts to 10 59 gm3 it is almost balanced in final trade of virtual water for taiwan its intermediate trade imbalance of virtual water is around twice as much as its final trade imbalance in contrast economies including bulgaria brazil and indonesia are featured as intermediate trade oriented exporters of virtual water besides for economies including japan france india and mexico their intermediate trade imbalances of virtual water generally approach their final trade imbalances while japan and france get a surplus of virtual water in both intermediate trade and final trade india gains a deficit in both intermediate trade and final trade for mexico it receives a surplus of virtual water in intermediate trade but a deficit in final trade 4 2 water self sufficiency rate by source and that by sink consistent with the energy self sufficiency rate by source and that by sink raised in the work by chen and wu 2017 water self sufficiency rate by source and that by sink are devised here water self sufficiency rate by source of a region is defined as the use of the region s freshwater withdrawal that finally sinks into its own final consumption to the region s total freshwater exploited the water self sufficiency rates by source for the 43 regions are calculated and illustrated in fig 14 the water self sufficiency rates by source for the united kingdom japan and greece are respectively calculated as 80 09 83 56 and 87 92 suggesting that these regions keep the majority of the welfare bestowed by domestic freshwater resources at home meanwhile the water self sufficiency rate for india is calculated as 88 66 this is because that though india exports massive virtual water abroad via international trade india has for long remained as a self sufficient society the majority of the freshwater exploitation has thus ultimately sunk into the products used as their final consumption while for china and brazil their water self sufficient rates by source are respectively 59 30 and 66 15 due to the massive virtual water export to other countries for germany canada and france their water self sufficiency rates by source are respectively 33 36 28 05 and 46 36 water self sufficiency rate by sink of a region is defined as the ratio of the use of a region s freshwater withdrawal that finally sinks into its own final consumption to the region s total virtual water use the water self sufficiency rates by sink for nations and regions are calculated and illustrated in fig 15 the water self sufficiency rate by sink for india is calculated to be 96 15 which further re emphasizes india as a self sufficient economy for germany canada and france their water self sufficiency rates by sink are respectively 14 84 23 98 and 23 42 these economies are revealed to have a rather low water self sufficiency rate by sink and also a low water self sufficiency rate by source this has reflected the vitality of these economies in international trade they are just like active pumps driving vast virtual water flows to move in and move out in this way they could utilize the use of water resources from all other regions to serve its people and gain the economic trade surplus at the same time for china its water self sufficiency rate by sink is calculated to be 79 38 suggesting that water use embodied in the goods and services for local final consumption mainly originates from domestic freshwater exploitation as previously calculated the water self sufficiency rate by source for china is 59 30 which means that nearly 40 of the freshwater exploitation in china finally sinks into other regions to benefit their residents this has demonstrated that china is still not sufficiently involved into the global supply chain due to the weak consumptive power of local people china is more like a supplier of consumer products for the world but does not absorb sufficient goods or services from the rest of world to boost the global economic growth 5 conclusions by tracking the global virtual water flows from source to sink within the world economy as reflected by world input output database for 2014 this study investigated the virtual water use of world regions and explored the associated trade connections and imbalances in terms of virtual water the top five virtual water users are india the united states china japan and indonesia regarding the sectoral contributions agriculture sector contributes dominantly to the virtual water use of india while food beverage sector remains the leading contributor to that of the united states japan as well as china meanwhile tertiary industry makes remarkable contributions to the virtual water use of the developed economies such as the united states and japan which are characterized by the service biased economic structure overall the global total trade volume of virtual water is in magnitude over 30 of the global total freshwater resources directly exploited meanwhile the global transfer of virtual water associated with intermediate trade gains momentum with world regions being increasingly interconnected our analysis shows that water use embodied in intermediate trade amounting 727 21 gm3 is revealed to be in magnitude 1 4 times that embodied in final trade 518 43 gm3 in intermediate trade china japan and the united kingdom are revealed as the three leading net importers of virtual water corresponding to india russia and the united states as the leading net exporters while in final trade the united states japan and russia serve as the major net importers of virtual water corresponding to china india and mexico as the major net exporters the trade imbalances of world regions are discussed in detail for developed regions such as the united states japan france and the united kingdom their trade deficits in terms of currency come along with the net virtual water inflows which to a certain extent safeguard their affluent lifestyles while for germany it has a trade surplus in terms of both currency and virtual water it benefits both economically and biophysically from international trade for developing regions led by china the economic trade surplus is associated with the tremendous net outflows of virtual water while for india it obtains a deficit in terms of both currency and virtual water in the long term apart from the implementation of water conservation policies developing economies such as china and india are recommended to gradually replace the resource intensive and low value added industries by the knowledge intensive service oriented such as human intelligence big data and machine learning ones meanwhile for the united states a net virtual water exporter in intermediate trade and a net importer in final trade and china a net virtual water importer in intermediate trade but a net exporter in final trade their trade imbalances of virtual water are mainly driven by final trade the major recipients of the united states net intermediate export of virtual water are eu27 mexico and japan while china and mexico remain the suppliers of its net final import of virtual water for china it obtains a surplus of virtual water in intermediate trade with brazil india and the united states and a massive deficit of virtual water in final trade with regions led by the united states eu japan and russia while for india as a net virtual water exporter in both intermediate trade and final trade its intermediate trade imbalance of virtual water is in magnitude approximate to its final trade imbalance overall virtual water trade is gradually becoming the primary means for an economy to get the use of water resources from other regions for sustainable use of water resources nations and regions ought to assess their behaviors in intermediate trade and final trade in terms of both currency and virtual water so as to adapt their domestic industries to the global supply chain as well as to bring in more water use from abroad to benefit domestic consumers conflict of interest none acknowledgments this research is supported by china postdoctoral science foundation grant no 2018m640001 and the national natural science

6551,to reflect a key aspect of global socio hydrology this paper explores global virtual water use from source of exploitation to sink of final consumption via interregional trades within the world economy as reflected by world input output database for 2014 an embodiment accounting model is developed which takes full account of virtual water feedbacks related to primary inputs global total trade volume of virtual water is estimated to be in magnitude around 30 of the global direct freshwater withdrawal moreover it is revealed that global virtual water transfer in intermediate trade is in magnitude around 1 4 times that in final trade in intermediate trade of virtual water china japan and the united kingdom turn out to be the three leading net importers while india russia and the united states are revealed as the leading net exporters in final trade of virtual water the united states japan and russia are the major net importers in contrast to china india and mexico as the leading net exporters trade connections and imbalances of major economies in terms of virtual water are quantified and analyzed two new indicators in terms of water self sufficiency rate by source and that by sink are devised it is found that around 40 of the use of china s freshwater withdrawal finally sinks into foreign economies while only 20 of china s virtual water use originates from other regions with regard to germany canada and france they behave like active pumps driving vast virtual water inflows and outflows demonstrating their high involvement in the global supply chain in terms of virtual water with the increasingly frequent virtual water transfer within the world economy nations and regions ought to assess their behaviors in intermediate and final trades of virtual water for sustainable use of freshwater resources keywords global socio hydrology world economy virtual water global supply chain trade imbalance 1 introduction as a new interdisciplinary science of people and water socio hydrology has attracted wide attention in recent years sivapalan et al 2012 di baldassarre et al 2013 troy et al 2015 in contrast to eco hydrology that aims at studying the relations between water and ecological systems guo et al 2018 jiang and chen 2019 socio hydrology seeks to quantitatively explore how water resources interact with human and the world economy sivapalan et al 2012 blair and buytaert 2016 given the water availability and the changing nature of the world economy water resource management becomes much more uncertain and calls for wider interdisciplinary approaches combining social science just as pointed out in an editorial article of journal of hydrology ratna and syme 2014 as a crucial aspect of socio hydrology virtual water trade has gained wide exposure in the academic field in recent years as could be witnessed from the exponential growth of related studies fang and chen 2015 feng et al 2014 guan and hubacek 2007 liu et al 2017 lutter et al 2016 yang et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 in a globalized world where freshwater resources are distributed unbalancedly a water insufficient region may alleviate local water scarcity by importing large quantities of water intensive products such as food and beverage products from foreign regions oki and kanae 2004 vanham et al 2017 wang et al 2014 this phenomenon was first noticed by allan 1993 1996 1998a early in the 1990s who raised the concept of virtual water as a description of the conceptual amount of freshwater embedded in the traded products and used it to explain the absence of conflicts related with water resources in middle east regions allan 1997 1998b closely related with the notion of virtual water water footprint was later proposed by hoekstra and hung 2002 as a consumption based indicator to incorporate the offsite information into consideration which has been then widely applied to quantifying the amount of freshwater use induced to satisfy a nation s demand of all kinds of goods and services chapagain et al 2006 chapagain and hoekstra 2007 hoekstra and chapagain 2006 sun et al 2017 in fact the invisible transfer of ecological elements induced by international trade has been demonstrated not only for freshwater resources but also for primary energy resources chen and wu 2017 yang et al 2014 land resources qiang et al 2013 wu et al 2018 carbon emissions mi et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 particulate matters meng et al 2016 etc for instance the ipcc fifth assessment report ipcc 2014 has directed full attention to the carbon emissions induced outside the a nation s territory due to the international exchange of goods or services within a highly interconnected world economy virtual water trade is playing a more and more important role in redistributing the use of freshwater resources along the fragmented global supply chain carr et al 2013 hoekstra and hung 2005 chapagain and hoekstra 2008 according to carr et al 2012 the total amount of global virtual water trade has more than doubled over the period from 1986 to 2008 while the interconnectedness of the virtual water trade network as represented by the number of links between nations has risen by 92 similar results are derived by dalin et al 2012 in analyzing the global virtual water transfer associated with food trade from 1986 to 2007 as seen since almost all nations and regions have been involved in the global virtual water trade due to the high frequency of interregional exchange of goods and services it is essential to discuss their water supply and consumption under the global context hoekstra and hung 2005 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 hanasaki et al 2010 reimer 2012 whereas at present national and regional governments mainly adopt a local perspective instead of a global perspective when carrying out national or supranational policies towards water use and conservation such as the red line for freshwater exploitation raised in the opinions of the state council on applying the strictest water resources control system statecouncil 2012 in china and the water framework directive ec 2000 in the european union in the related policy packages measures such as promoting the development of irrigation infrastructure and improving the efficiency of water cycling facilities are often adopted to cope with water shortage which are demonstrated to be insufficient to deal with the rising water demand required by the booming population and economic growth lenzen et al 2013 konar et al 2012 few governmental policy makers recognized the important role of virtual water trade or considered altering their trade patterns as a possible means of mitigating the local scarcity of water resources such as reducing the exports of water intensive goods to other countries in particular currently a key trade related concern remains with the economic trade imbalance which has recently induced global trade disputes trump 2018 whitehouse 2018 nevertheless though the trade imbalance in monetary terms has been widely focused on the trade imbalance in terms of virtual water has been generally neglected in policy packages and intergovernmental negotiations in fact international trade inevitably leads to trade imbalance of virtual water in the study by lenzen et al 2013 it is found that japan germany and the united states are the major net importers of virtual water while pakistan and china turn out as the major deficit regions in virtual water trade regarding existing studies on virtual water it is noticed that they mainly adopt a demand pull perspective by assigning direct water use to final demand feng et al 2014 lenzen et al 2013 zhang and anadon 2014 which originates from normative economics that reflects subjective value judgements or ethical percepts on economic development samuelson and nordhaus 2010 it is worth pointing out that with different norms or value judgements held there exist different corresponding accounting frameworks such as production based accounting peters 2008 final demand based accounting davis et al 2011 lenzen et al 2013 sales based accounting kanemoto et al 2012 income based accounting marques et al 2012 liang et al 2017 household consumption based accounting wu et al 2019 total consumption based accounting wu et al 2019 etc while these normative accounting frameworks final demand based accounting is most commonly used at present are supportive to enhancing our understanding on virtual water use of nations and regions from different perspectives producers perspective final users perspective final producers perspective primary input providers perspective household consumers perspective total final consumers perspective etc they are unable to reflect the objective performance of the economy in terms of virtual water also a main focus of socio hydrology to give an objective measurement of the economy from the perspective of virtual water chen and his colleagues raised the embodiment accounting model supported by input output tables to trace the virtual water embodied in the monetary flows regardless of intermediate products or final products chen and chen 2013 han et al 2018 shao et al 2017 by extending the biophysical balance model of embodied energy proposed by herendeen 1973 for instance on the global scale chen and chen 2013 undertook virtual water accounting for the globalized world economy and investigated the international virtual water trade different from normative accounting methods as subjective assignment of water use to different agents embodiment accounting is capable of tracing the circulation of virtual water within global economic network which stems from positive economics that reflects the fact of an economy therefore for the goods and services within the economy virtual water becomes a property inherent in them the global economy could thus be treated as not only a network of monetary flows but also a network of virtual water flows with external freshwater support nevertheless it is also noticed that in previous studies by chen and his colleagues chen and chen 2013 han et al 2018 the embodiment accounting model proposed for the world economy fails to take account of the virtual water feedbacks associated with primary inputs from the society and is thus not consistent with the principle of circular economy it treats the products used for global final demand including household consumption consumption of non profit institutions government consumption gross fixed capital formation and changes in inventories and valuables as the sink of virtual water whereas for the world economy modelled by the global input output table only the products used for genuine final consumptive purposes including household consumption consumption of non profit institutions and government consumption could be treated as the sink of virtual water while the products used as capital goods namely those used as gross fixed capital formation and changes in inventories and valuables will move into the economic system via social redistribution matrix representing how final demand is linked with primary inputs to sustain the economic production as primary inputs thus making the economic network circular wu et al 2018 2019 in order to clearly explain how the global economy interacts with freshwater resources it is necessary to direct full consideration to the virtual water feedbacks associated with primary inputs from the society by resorting to the statistics for world economy in 2014 this study seeks to reflect a key aspect of global socio hydrology by exploring the circulation of virtual water within the global economic network from source of exploitation to sink of final consumption an embodiment accounting model that takes full account of virtual water feedbacks associated with primary inputs is proposed the interregional transfer of virtual water and the associated trade imbalances of nations and regions are quantified and analyzed two new indicators in terms of water self sufficiency rate by source and that by sink are devised which are expected to shed light on national water security as well as international collaboration on sustainable water use 2 methodology and data source 2 1 embodiment accounting in this study an embodiment accounting model supported by water withdrawal data and a global multi region input output account is developed based on the one reported in our previous studies chen and chen 2013 han et al 2018 embodiment accounting originated from embodied energy accounting that firstly appeared in the work by herendeen 1973 which attempted to calculate the direct and indirect energy cost of goods and services in the united states during the 1970s embodied energy accounting has been widely applied especially by the energy research group in the university of illinois to analyzing energy requirements of different economies bullard and herendeen 1975 bullard et al 1978 costanza 1980 denton 1975 hannon et al 1983 hannon 2010 herendeen 1974 1978a b later by an integration of the embodiment concept in systems ecology raised by odum 1983 1995 into the biophysical balance model raised by herendeen 1973 embodied energy accounting has been generalized by chen and his colleagues to embodiment accounting of ecological elements such as energy chen and chen 2011 2013 wu and chen 2017 2018 arable land chen and han 2015 wu et al 2018 water chen and chen 2013 han et al 2018 greenhouse gas chen and chen 2011 and mercury emissions chen et al 2016 li et al 2017 for the world economy details of the embodiment accounting model for water use by the world economy could be found in our previous works chen and chen 2013 han et al 2018 within which an economic sector is taken as the basic unit as illustrated in fig 1 a under our previous accounting model the biophysical balance of water use for an economic sector within the world economy is established as the sum of water use embodied in the intermediate inputs of the sector plus its direct freshwater withdrawal is equal to the water use embodied in the output products of the sector the direct freshwater withdrawal represents the exogenous environmental support for the economy while water use embodied in intermediate inputs may be regarded as internal feedback within the global economic system therefore bearing a resemblance to the flow field guo et al 2018 jiang et al 2017 wang and chen 2016 the world economy could be viewed as a network of embodied water flows namely virtual water flows with exogenous water inputs from the environment nevertheless the water use embodied in the primary inputs has not been accounted in this accounting model presented as illustrated in table 1 the economic inputs into a sector are classified as intermediate inputs from all the economic sectors and primary inputs from the society meanwhile a sector s output products flow in two directions some of them are used as intermediate inputs into economic sectors the others are presented to society within the global economic input output account a sector s output that is presented to society is used as household consumption consumption of non profit institutions government consumption gross fixed capital formation changes in inventories and valuables as previously mentioned the output products used as capital goods are not genuinely consumed and will go into the economic network as primary inputs to support the economic activities just as illustrated in fig 1 b nevertheless regarding the embodiment accounting model presented in fig 1 a attention is only directed to the water use embodied in the intermediate inputs from economic sectors while that embodied in the primary inputs is neglected by taking account of the water use embodied in both primary and intermediate inputs this study moves a step forward to rebuild the biophysical balance model in our previous work 2 2 algorithm as illustrated in table 1 the world economy has been disaggregated into m regions with each region comprising n l economic sectors l ranges from 1 to m the biophysical balance for an economic unit in terms of water use is presented in fig 2 for sector k in region t it could be expressed as unit j where j k l 1 t 1 n l as witnessed w j represents external freshwater withdrawal from the environment into unit j x i j e represents the amount of the output of unit i that is used as intermediate inputs into unit j x j represents the total output of unit j that comprises two parts namely i 1 n x j i e n l 1 m n l and x j s while i 1 n x j i e represents the amount of the output of unit j that is used as intermediate inputs into economic sectors x j s stands for the amount of the output of unit j that is presented to the society meanwhile x j s could be divided into two parts namely x jc s representing the amount of the output of unit j that is used as genuine final consumption and x jo s representing the amount of the output of unit j that is used as fixed capital formation as well as changes in inventories and valuables p j represents the primary inputs into unit j ε p represents the embodied water intensity of p j ε j is the embodied water intensity of x j ε i is the embodied water intensity of x i j e therefore i 1 n ε i x i j e represents the amount of water use embodied in the intermediate inputs from all economic sectors into unit j ε p p j represents the amount of water use embodied in the primary inputs into unit j the biophysical balance of water use for unit j is thus expressed as 1 w j i 1 n ε i x i j e ε p p j ε j x j the matrix notation for eq 1 is established as 2 w ε x e ε p p ε x where w w j 1 n is the row vector for freshwater withdrawal as exogenous environmental inputs p p j 1 n is the row vector for primary inputs x e x i j e n n is the square matrix for economic transactions between sectors x is the diagonal matrix for x x i n 1 besides ε ε j 1 n is a row vector in eq 2 w p x e and x are available from the environmental statistics and global economic input output account meanwhile it needs to be especially noted that the world economy as represented by global input output account contains several balance conditions first all the sectoral output products presented by the economy to the society maintain a monetary balance with the primary inputs from the society into the economy second the water use embodied in the capital goods products used as gross fixed capital formation and changes in inventories and valuables equals that embodied in the primary inputs in the input output account only through the social redistribution matrix or referred to as social accounting matrix in the fourth quadrant could the capital goods get into the economy as primary inputs it is worth noting that the global input output account makes a normalization of the economy so that capital goods may keep circulating in the world economy via the redistribution matrix currently though social accounting matrixes of some national economies for specific years have been released hanson and robinson 1991 wang and li 2008 such matrix that corresponds to the global input output account is unavailable without the social accounting matrix it is unable for us to differentiate the embodied water intensity of the primary inputs by sector hence as a preliminary treatment it is assumed that all the primary inputs have the same embodied water intensity therefore another biophysical balance equation in terms of water use is presented as 3 ε p j 1 n p j i 1 n ε i x io s in matrix form eq 3 is expressed as 4 ε p p sum ε x o s where p sum represents the sum total of all primary inputs x o s x jo s n 1 represents the sectoral output products used as capital goods therefore by combing eqs 2 and 4 the row vector for embodied water intensity of sectoral output could be derived as 5 ε w x x e 1 p sum x o s p 1 hence virtual water use vwu of region t as expressed by water embodied in the goods and services delivered for region t s final consumption is formulated as 6 vwu t i 1 n ε i x ic st besides the direct freshwater withdrawal dfw of region t is formulated as 7 dfw t k 1 l 1 t 1 n l l 1 t n l w k t meanwhile supported by embodied water intensity of the sectoral output products the virtual water embodied in region t s intermediate imports vwii t that embodied in its final imports vwfi t and that embodied in its total imports vwi t could be respectively expressed as 8 vwii t i 1 i 1 l 1 t 1 n l l 1 t n l n ε i x i et and 9 vwfi t i 1 i 1 l 1 t 1 n l l 1 t n l n ε i x i st and 10 vwi t vwii t vwfi t i 1 i 1 l 1 t 1 n l l 1 t n l n ε i x i et ε i x i st in which x i et and x i st respectively denote the amount of unit i s output that is used as intermediate inputs into the economic sectors of region t and the amount of unit i s output that is used as final demand of region t similarly the virtual water embodied in region t s intermediate exports vwie t that embodied in its final exports vwfe t and that embodied in its total exports vwe t could be respectively expressed as 11 vwie t k 1 l 1 t 1 n l l 1 t n l ε k x k te and 12 vwfe t k 1 l 1 t 1 n l l 1 t n l ε k x k ts and 13 vwe t vwie t vwfe t k 1 l 1 t 1 n l l 1 t n l ε k x k te ε k x k ts in which x k te and x k ts respectively denote the amount of the output of sector k in region t that is used as intermediate inputs into economic sectors and the amount of the output of sector k in region t that is delivered to the society as final demand meanwhile virtual water embodied in region t s intermediate trade balance that embodied in its final trade balance and that embodied in its total trade balance are respectively expressed as 14 vwitb t vwii t vwie t and 15 vwftb t vwfi t vwfe t and 16 vwttb t vei t vee t vwitb t vwftb t a positive vwitb t vwftb t and vwttb t respectively signify that region t is a net importer of virtual water in intermediate trade a net importer in final trade and a net importer in total trade 2 3 data sources the world bank 2017 presents us with the freshwater withdrawals of the world regions in the year 2014 which are adopted in this study as the exogenous freshwater inputs from the environment consistent with that in our previous work chen and chen 2013 this study does not take the rainwater direct utilization into account due to the high uncertainty the freshwater withdrawal includes agricultural water withdrawal industrial water withdrawal and domestic water withdrawal the agricultural water withdrawal refers to freshwater resources exploited by the agriculture sector for irrigation and other agricultural purposes industrial water withdrawal refers to freshwater resources exploited by the industrial sectors for production purposes such as mining manufacturing and electricity production domestic water withdrawal refers to freshwater resources exploited for residential daily use besides a most recent multi region input output account for world economy 2014 is adopted from the world input output database timmer et al 2015 in which the world is divided into 44 nations and regions including one modelling the rest of the world row each region is comprised of 56 economic sectors therefore altogether 2464 economic units are included in the model appendices a and b respectively present the details of the regions and economic sectors 3 results 3 1 virtual water use of nations and regions the direct freshwater withdrawal and virtual water use of the 43 regions are both demonstrated in fig 3 with the corresponding numerical values presented in appendix c as witnessed india china and the united states stand out as the prominent water users india occupies the leading place in terms of both direct freshwater withdrawal and virtual water use amounting to 761 02 billion cubic meters gm3 and 701 73 gm3 respectively china takes the second place in direct freshwater withdrawal 607 80 gm3 but comes third in virtual water use 454 08 gm3 with regard to the united states its virtual water use and direct freshwater withdrawal respectively amount to 595 75 gm3 and 485 60 gm3 as witnessed the direct freshwater withdrawal of china is in magnitude around one third higher than its virtual water use while that of the united states is in magnitude around one fifth lower than its virtual water use this is mainly due to the different trade patterns which will be discussed in the following sections the details for sectoral contributions to virtual water use of some leading users are presented in fig 4 in the outer ring of fig 4 the sectors are consistent with those listed in the world input output database while in the inner ring the sectors are aggregated into twenty sections to be consistent with those in the international standard industry classification revision 4 un 2008 as enunciated in appendix b as seen for india section a agriculture forestry and fishing accounts for 64 43 of its total virtual water use followed by section c manufacturing sharing 20 05 section e water supply sewerage etc sharing 6 46 section i accommodation and food service activities sharing 4 39 etc india is endowed with the largest area of arable land within the asian regions agriculture industry which is highly water intensive and involved with the overwhelming majority of india s population has long been a backbone industry of india s economy hence agriculture industry serves the dominant contributor to the virtual water use of india for the united states it shall arouse our attention that agricultural industry only accounts for less than 8 of its total virtual water use in the meanwhile section c manufacturing occupies 38 33 of the united states virtual water use which demonstrates the massive water requirement by the industrial activities among the manufacturing industries food beverage industry and textile industry are the two largest contributors respectively dedicating to 20 78 and 3 81 of the united states virtual water use besides section l real estate activities etc section o public administration and defense etc and section q human health and social work activities altogether contribute to over one quarter of the virtual water use of the united states revealing the nation s heavy investment into medical care and public administration activities for these service sectors they are located at the high end value chain therefore though the related activities do not require many direct water inputs they induce large quantities of water use associated with intermediate products from other sectors as well as primary inputs from the society similar to the united states japan is also highly reliant on service industries section i accommodation and food service activities section l real estate activities section o public administration and defense etc and section q human health and social work activities altogether account for approximately 30 of japan s virtual water use for china though with a long history of agricultural tradition it has been undergoing the drastic transitional process from a central planned economy to a market based economy during the last three decades since the reform and opening up as demonstrated in fig 4 section a agriculture forestry and fishing and section c manufacturing respectively hold accountable for 23 97 and 37 95 of china s virtual water use meanwhile section o public administration and defense etc section p education and section q human health and social work activities altogether account for over one sixth of china s virtual water use which has demonstrated the growing residential demands for services provided by tertiary industry in china fig 5 presents the per capita virtual water use of each region as natural resources are essential biophysical support to sustain the economy per capita resource use may serve as a biophysical index to measure the living standards of a region the per capita virtual water use of each region is illustrated to be unevenly distributed ranging from 320 70 m3 cap to 1871 11 m3 cap among the world regions excluding row covered in the world input output database thirty regions are revealed to be above the world average level 545 71 m3 cap in terms of per capita virtual water use as witnessed the per capita virtual water use of the united states far outstrips that of other regions this amount is up to 1870 11 m3 cap which is around five times as much as the average level of world economy and one and a half times as much as that of japan 1181 42 m3 cap the per capita virtual water use of the united kingdom 910 31 m3 cap france 902 39 m3 cap and germany 898 60 m3 cap generally remain on the same level which are in magnitude around half of that of the united states while for china india and brazil their per capita water use are respectively calculated to be 332 84 m3 cap 542 36 m3 cap and 409 40 m3 cap the per capita virtual water use of india stays on the same level with the world average for china its virtual water use is around three fifths of the world average and one sixth of that for the united states as seen though india and china are the major virtual water users in the world their per capita virtual water use are far below the world average level this has revealed the inferior domestic living standards in these two regions whose residents gain much less biophysical welfare in comparison to those developed economies 3 2 water use embodied in trade the water use embodied in the imports divided into intermediate imports and final imports and exports divided into final imports and final exports of the regions are respectively presented in fig 6 as distinguished by color the global total trade volume of virtual water the sum of the virtual water import of all 44 regions covered in the world input output database is calculated to amount to 1245 65 gm3 which is in magnitude equivalent to over 30 of the global total direct freshwater withdrawal within the world regions not including row the top ten importers of virtual water are the united states 164 89 gm3 china 124 15 gm3 germany 74 66 gm3 japan 66 50 gm3 the united kingdom 44 54 gm3 france 43 37 gm3 canada 42 12 gm3 south korea 33 99 gm3 italy 32 25 gm3 and netherlands 32 06 gm3 for the united states its intermediate import 77 54 gm3 and its final import of virtual water 87 35 gm3 stay on the same level suggesting the intensive requirements of its domestic industries as well as the residential consumers for the virtual water use from abroad the united kingdom canada and france are demonstrated to be in a similar situation while for germany and japan different pictures are observed for these two developed nations the ratios of whose intermediate import of virtual water to final import are respectively obtained as 1 29 and 1 27 for these two nations on one hand they need plenty of foreign products to satisfy domestic consumers needs on other hand germany and japan require massive intermediate products from abroad to manufacture high value added goods such as automobiles and electronic products therefore water use embodied in their intermediate import turns out be larger than that in their final import for china the intermediate import of virtual water 90 11 gm3 is around two and a half times as much as its final import 34 04 gm3 revealing the heavy dependency of china on the imported water use to manufacture the finished goods with regard to exports china and the united states are the two leading exporters of virtual water with the virtual water export amounting to 152 39 gm3 and 133 55 gm3 respectively the major exporters in the second echelon are india 68 42 gm3 and germany 56 99 gm3 followed by canada 35 32 gm3 mexico 33 92 gm3 italy 33 03 gm3 france 29 82 gm3 netherlands 28 06 gm3 and indonesia 26 13 gm3 coming in the third echelon while china s intermediate export of virtual water 67 71 gm3 is around 80 of its final export 84 69 the united states intermediate export 86 16 gm3 is around twice as much as its final export 47 39 gm3 china has the title of the world factory as it supplies the world with products made in china which are mainly consumer goods such as textile products appliances telecommunication products and plastic goods therefore a large amount of virtual water use flows from china into overseas economies for other major exporters including india germany canada mexico and netherlands the ratios of their intermediate export to final export of virtual water are respectively obtained as 1 22 1 28 2 19 0 49 and 1 71 as seen canada and netherlands which supply a large number of intermediate products to foreign economies stand out among these regions with comparatively higher ratios while for mexico according to existing statistics oec 2017 finished products such as automobiles electrical apparatuses and agricultural products tomatoes pepper watermelon onions pawpaw etc account for the bulk of its total exports therefore mexico s intermediate export of virtual water is only around half of its final export the net trades of virtual water as distinguished by net intermediate trade and net final trade are presented in fig 7 in intermediate trade of virtual water the leading net importers are china japan the united kingdom south korea and germany whose trade surpluses of virtual water respectively amount to 22 40 gm3 22 04 gm3 11 29 gm3 10 59 gm3 and 10 10 gm3 the leading net exporters are india russia the united states indonesia and brazil whose trade deficits of virtual water are respectively 21 47 gm3 11 87 gm3 8 62 gm3 4 47 gm3 and 3 66 gm3 in final trade of virtual water the united states japan russia the united kingdom and canada come as the several leading net importers whose trade surpluses of virtual water are respectively 39 96 gm3 19 58 gm3 19 00 gm3 18 53 gm3 and 9 23 gm3 china india mexico turkey and spain come as the major deficit regions whose net export of virtual water amount to 50 64 gm3 24 97 gm3 13 96 gm3 6 63 gm3 and 4 52 gm3 as witnessed japan gains a considerable surplus of virtual water in both intermediate trade and final trade for china and the united states they play different roles in intermediate trade and final trade while china is a net importer in intermediate trade and net exporter in final trade the united states serves to be a net exporter in intermediate trade and net importer in final trade the trade imbalances of regions will be discussed in detail in section 4 1 the details of sectoral constituents of intermediate imports and exports of the three biggest surplus regions and three biggest deficit regions in intermediate trade are presented in fig 8 for china while agricultural sector answers for around 30 of its intermediate imports the contribution of agricultural industry to the intermediate exports of china is negligible since the opening up reform arable land area has encountered an evident decrease with the invasion of built up areas into rural areas desertion of arable land caused by migration of peasants into cities and water soil loss therefore currently china relies heavily on foreign agricultural products for domestic reproduction activities to offset domestic under capacity in food production correspondingly vast virtual water comes along with the imported agricultural products into china similarly for japan while agricultural industry contributes to around one fourth of its intermediate import of virtual water it only accounts for around 1 of its intermediate export for india as the largest deficit region in intermediate trade agricultural industry contributes dominantly to its intermediate export of virtual water sharing around half of the total meanwhile food industry and textiles industry altogether account for around one fifth of india s total intermediate export of virtual water illustrating the importance of light industry to india s economy besides it shall be also noted that foreign agricultural industry also delivers 6 62 of india s intermediate import of virtual water for russia mining industry takes up 44 38 of russia s intermediate export of virtual water at the same time while manufacturing industries are responsible for around 35 of russia s intermediate export of virtual water they answer for over 70 of its intermediate imports for the united states agricultural sector holds accountable for 15 10 and 23 17 of its intermediate import and export of virtual water respectively besides foreign mining industry provides essential support for the united states domestic production industries accounting for 13 17 of the united states intermediate import of virtual water the details for sectoral constituents of final imports and exports of the three leading surplus regions and three leading deficit regions in final trade are presented in fig 9 for the united states final import of virtual water agriculture industry food industry and textiles industry are the pillar contributors respectively accountable for 19 82 15 18 and 23 21 of the total for japan food industry contributes dominantly to its final import of virtual water occupying a share of around 40 which has demonstrated japan s intensive requirements for food products from abroad for russia with limited supply of light industry products textiles industry is observed to play a dominant role in its final import of virtual water taking up a proportion of around 40 followed by the food industry sharing around one fifth for china as the largest deficit region of virtual water in final trade textiles industry contributes to around one third of its final export of virtual water for india food industry agriculture industry and textiles industry as the three pillar contributors respectively dedicate to 35 90 26 36 and 19 82 of its total final export of virtual water 3 3 virtual water transfer between economies the virtual water transfer between economies is presented in this section the twenty eight european union countries have been integrated into one region namely eu fig 10 a and b illustrate the virtual water connections between these seventeen economies in intermediate trade and net intermediate trade respectively in fig 10a the chord linking the two economies represents the bilateral virtual water flows the different lengths at the two ends of a chord stand for the export volumes of the two linked economies to each other while the color of the chord is consistent with that of the larger exporter of the two economies linked for china as the largest virtual water exporter among these seventeen economies in intermediate trade around 16 08 of its intermediate export of virtual water is received by eu 11 07 by the united states 6 49 by south korea and 6 42 by japan for the united states the major receivers of its intermediate export are eu canada mexico and china which respectively take a share of 17 35 15 85 15 84 and 10 54 as seen canada and mexico as the neighbors of the united states altogether answer for around 30 of the united states intermediate import meanwhile for canada and mexico around two thirds of their intermediate export of virtual water comes into the united states which further illustrates the tight bilateral trade relationship between the united states and its neighbors india also acts as a notable exporter of virtual water in intermediate trade around half of its intermediate exports flow into row one seventh into eu one eighth into china and one twelfth into the united states in fig 10b the lengths at the two ends of a chord stand for the net virtual water transfer between the two economies connected while the color of the chord is consistent with that of the net exporter in intermediate trade china is illustrated to receive a deficit of virtual water 6 04 gm3 with eu but a surplus with brazil 4 44 gm3 a surplus with india 2 91 gm3 and a surplus with the united states 1 58 gm3 as seen in intermediate trade eu is a major receiver of the net outflows of virtual water from china while developing economies serve to be the suppliers of the net inflows of virtual water into china for eu it is demonstrated to receive a surplus of virtual water in intermediate trade with the majority of its trading partners for the united states it is observed to obtain a deficit of virtual water in intermediate trade with most of its trading partners such as that with mexico 6 22 gm3 that with eu 5 98 gm3 that with japan 3 09 gm3 and that with china 1 58 gm3 besides the united states maintains a surplus of virtual water in intermediate trade with canada 2 62 gm3 and brazil 0 75 gm3 the virtual water transfer between the seventeen economies in final trade is presented in fig 11 a notable couples of virtual water transfer in final trade are china row 30 10 gm3 18 72 gm3 india row 18 43 gm3 3 19 gm3 the united state row 12 63 gm3 28 14 gm3 eu row 22 57 gm3 42 89 gm3 china the united states 15 39 gm3 3 59 gm3 china eu 12 81 gm3 5 05 gm3 mexico usa 18 23 gm3 4 56 gm3 etc in final trade china is shown to be a major supplier of water use for all world regions for eu it exports a considerable amount of virtual water and at the same time receives massive water welfare from outside economies in final trade similar circumstance is also observed for the united states as seen in final trade canada and mexico are respectively responsible for around one quarter and about one tenth of the virtual water export of the united states in the meanwhile while around 70 of the final export of virtual water by canada goes into the united states around 80 of that by mexico is received by the united states the united states and canada are observed to reach a balance in bilateral final trade of virtual water while for the bilateral final trade between the united states and mexico the virtual water flow 10 89 gm3 from mexico to the united states is around four times that from the united states to mexico the net transfer of virtual water between the seventeen economies in final trade is shown in fig 11b while economies such as eu the united states russia japan and australia receive a surplus of virtual water with row in final trade china and india are shown to have a deficit of virtual water with row in final trade which respectively reach an amount of 11 38 gm3 and 15 24 gm3 this enunciates the contributive roles of these two emerging economies in supplying the economic utility of freshwater resources to the rest of the world besides in final trade china has a virtual water deficit of 7 76 gm3 with eu and a deficit of 11 80 gm3 with the united states meanwhile the united states receives a deficit of virtual water 0 21 gm3 in final trade with eu as demonstrated though the trade activities between the united states and eu are frequent the bilateral final trade of virtual water almost reaches a balance for the united states it mainly receives net final trade inflows of virtual water from china mexico and row for canada serving a most important trading partner of the united states it receives a net virtual water inflow of 3 43 gm3 from the united states in final trade 4 discussions 4 1 trade imbalances of regions fig 12 presents the trade balances of the forty three regions the horizonal axis represents the economic trade balances of the regions while the vertical axis corresponds to the trade balances of regions in terms of virtual water the spherical ball s size is on behalf of the total trade volume of each region in terms of virtual water the regions near the origin point generally maintain a balance in terms of both currency and virtual water such as australia spain portugal mexico and indonesia regions far from the origin point are accompanied by notable trade imbalances either in terms of currency or virtual water the trade imbalances of the united states and china are especially distinct although the united states has a notable economic trade deficit reaching up to 48 06 billion dollars it also enjoys a trade surplus of 31 34 gm3 in terms of virtual water the united states trade deficit has endured during the last several decades which appears as one of the most vexing problem of the united states government the trump administration has claimed to slash its economic trade deficit with its key trading partners such as china and germany trade protection measures such as largely increasing the tariffs have been carried out to lessen its trade deficit as well as to bring the manufacturing jobs back home ustr 2018 whereas as revealed in this study the virtual water surplus of the united states is also huge this shall be paid full attention in intergovernmental negotiations especially at current stage when sustainability has become one of the most urgent concerns for humans with large quantities of products imported from abroad the united states is capable of improving the living standards of domestic citizens by making full use of the environmental welfare endowed by freshwater resources in foreign countries this may in the meanwhile induce water scarcity problems in the territories of its trading partners such as china with a large population and an extremely unbalanced distribution of water resources nevertheless little attention has been focused on compensating the depletion of water resources in these regions as seen in fig 12 though china gets an economic trade surplus of 58 26 billion dollars its trade deficit of virtual water is as much as 28 24 gm3 as seen the trade imbalance of china is in magnitude approximate to that of the united states in terms of both currency and virtual water for india it has the largest trade deficit of virtual water that amounts to 46 44 gm3 in magnitude around one and a half times as much as that of china at the same time it needs to be noted that india nearly maintains a balance in economic trade this is mainly because that a large number of india s exports are agricultural products rice fruits cotton etc food products and textile products scarfs blankets soaps etc which are generally water intensive and low value added besides india needs to import lots of high value added finished products such as electronic products household appliances transport equipment etc in this way india exports a large quantity of low value added and water intensive products in exchange of the high value added goods therefore india is revealed to deliver massive water use to foreign regions but gain little trade surplus in terms of currency inversely japan is illustrated to be in an opposite situation japan receives the largest trade surplus of virtual water that reaches up to 41 61 gm3 which is in magnitude approximate to the trade deficit of virtual water for india at the same time japan s economic trade deficit is only 7 18 billion dollars as seen though japan is severely scarce of natural resources it attains the use of water resources by bringing in lots of raw materials and semi products from foreign agriculture and manufacturing industries for domestic reproduction as presented in section 3 2 meanwhile japan s exports are mainly high value added products including cars vehicle modules and electronic products which to a great extent neutralize its economic trade imbalance brought about by the massive imports for regions like the united kingdom and france they are scattered near the vertical axis these economies are almost balanced in economic trade but have a notable trade surplus of virtual water while for economies including germany and south korea they receive a trade surplus in terms of both currency and virtual water in particular germany enjoys an economic trade surplus of 39 04 billion dollars and a virtual water trade surplus of 17 67 gm3 as demonstrated international trade has brought into germany both currency and water use from foreign regions this is mainly because of their multiple roles in the global supply chain for instance germany outsources the industries situating at the low end value chain abroad and keeps advanced manufacturing industries situating in the medium to high end value chain such as cars and accessories medical equipment planes and aircrafts at home therefore along with the massive high value added products exported abroad germany may obtain a remarkable economic trade surplus besides due to the virtual water inflows associated with the low value added imports as well as the comparatively water efficient technologies in domestic industries a notable trade surplus of virtual water is achieved in fig 13 the intermediate trade balance and final trade balance in terms of virtual water are presented with the parting lines categorizing the nations and regions into four different kinds of trade patterns for the united states russia canada australia and the united kingdom that are near the positive vertical axis they are final trade oriented importers of virtual water their imbalance of virtual water in final trade in magnitude surpasses that in intermediate trade meantime while economies such as the united states russia and canada are net exporters of virtual water in intermediate trade economies such as the united kingdom and australia gain a virtual water surplus in intermediate trade in contrast china is featured as a final trade oriented exporter of virtual water as previously calculated the final trade imbalance of china in terms of virtual water is in magnitude over twice as much as its intermediate trade imbalance for economies near the positive horizonal axis such as south korea and taiwan they could be regarded as intermediate trade oriented importers of virtual water for south korea while its intermediate trade surplus of virtual water amounts to 10 59 gm3 it is almost balanced in final trade of virtual water for taiwan its intermediate trade imbalance of virtual water is around twice as much as its final trade imbalance in contrast economies including bulgaria brazil and indonesia are featured as intermediate trade oriented exporters of virtual water besides for economies including japan france india and mexico their intermediate trade imbalances of virtual water generally approach their final trade imbalances while japan and france get a surplus of virtual water in both intermediate trade and final trade india gains a deficit in both intermediate trade and final trade for mexico it receives a surplus of virtual water in intermediate trade but a deficit in final trade 4 2 water self sufficiency rate by source and that by sink consistent with the energy self sufficiency rate by source and that by sink raised in the work by chen and wu 2017 water self sufficiency rate by source and that by sink are devised here water self sufficiency rate by source of a region is defined as the use of the region s freshwater withdrawal that finally sinks into its own final consumption to the region s total freshwater exploited the water self sufficiency rates by source for the 43 regions are calculated and illustrated in fig 14 the water self sufficiency rates by source for the united kingdom japan and greece are respectively calculated as 80 09 83 56 and 87 92 suggesting that these regions keep the majority of the welfare bestowed by domestic freshwater resources at home meanwhile the water self sufficiency rate for india is calculated as 88 66 this is because that though india exports massive virtual water abroad via international trade india has for long remained as a self sufficient society the majority of the freshwater exploitation has thus ultimately sunk into the products used as their final consumption while for china and brazil their water self sufficient rates by source are respectively 59 30 and 66 15 due to the massive virtual water export to other countries for germany canada and france their water self sufficiency rates by source are respectively 33 36 28 05 and 46 36 water self sufficiency rate by sink of a region is defined as the ratio of the use of a region s freshwater withdrawal that finally sinks into its own final consumption to the region s total virtual water use the water self sufficiency rates by sink for nations and regions are calculated and illustrated in fig 15 the water self sufficiency rate by sink for india is calculated to be 96 15 which further re emphasizes india as a self sufficient economy for germany canada and france their water self sufficiency rates by sink are respectively 14 84 23 98 and 23 42 these economies are revealed to have a rather low water self sufficiency rate by sink and also a low water self sufficiency rate by source this has reflected the vitality of these economies in international trade they are just like active pumps driving vast virtual water flows to move in and move out in this way they could utilize the use of water resources from all other regions to serve its people and gain the economic trade surplus at the same time for china its water self sufficiency rate by sink is calculated to be 79 38 suggesting that water use embodied in the goods and services for local final consumption mainly originates from domestic freshwater exploitation as previously calculated the water self sufficiency rate by source for china is 59 30 which means that nearly 40 of the freshwater exploitation in china finally sinks into other regions to benefit their residents this has demonstrated that china is still not sufficiently involved into the global supply chain due to the weak consumptive power of local people china is more like a supplier of consumer products for the world but does not absorb sufficient goods or services from the rest of world to boost the global economic growth 5 conclusions by tracking the global virtual water flows from source to sink within the world economy as reflected by world input output database for 2014 this study investigated the virtual water use of world regions and explored the associated trade connections and imbalances in terms of virtual water the top five virtual water users are india the united states china japan and indonesia regarding the sectoral contributions agriculture sector contributes dominantly to the virtual water use of india while food beverage sector remains the leading contributor to that of the united states japan as well as china meanwhile tertiary industry makes remarkable contributions to the virtual water use of the developed economies such as the united states and japan which are characterized by the service biased economic structure overall the global total trade volume of virtual water is in magnitude over 30 of the global total freshwater resources directly exploited meanwhile the global transfer of virtual water associated with intermediate trade gains momentum with world regions being increasingly interconnected our analysis shows that water use embodied in intermediate trade amounting 727 21 gm3 is revealed to be in magnitude 1 4 times that embodied in final trade 518 43 gm3 in intermediate trade china japan and the united kingdom are revealed as the three leading net importers of virtual water corresponding to india russia and the united states as the leading net exporters while in final trade the united states japan and russia serve as the major net importers of virtual water corresponding to china india and mexico as the major net exporters the trade imbalances of world regions are discussed in detail for developed regions such as the united states japan france and the united kingdom their trade deficits in terms of currency come along with the net virtual water inflows which to a certain extent safeguard their affluent lifestyles while for germany it has a trade surplus in terms of both currency and virtual water it benefits both economically and biophysically from international trade for developing regions led by china the economic trade surplus is associated with the tremendous net outflows of virtual water while for india it obtains a deficit in terms of both currency and virtual water in the long term apart from the implementation of water conservation policies developing economies such as china and india are recommended to gradually replace the resource intensive and low value added industries by the knowledge intensive service oriented such as human intelligence big data and machine learning ones meanwhile for the united states a net virtual water exporter in intermediate trade and a net importer in final trade and china a net virtual water importer in intermediate trade but a net exporter in final trade their trade imbalances of virtual water are mainly driven by final trade the major recipients of the united states net intermediate export of virtual water are eu27 mexico and japan while china and mexico remain the suppliers of its net final import of virtual water for china it obtains a surplus of virtual water in intermediate trade with brazil india and the united states and a massive deficit of virtual water in final trade with regions led by the united states eu japan and russia while for india as a net virtual water exporter in both intermediate trade and final trade its intermediate trade imbalance of virtual water is in magnitude approximate to its final trade imbalance overall virtual water trade is gradually becoming the primary means for an economy to get the use of water resources from other regions for sustainable use of water resources nations and regions ought to assess their behaviors in intermediate trade and final trade in terms of both currency and virtual water so as to adapt their domestic industries to the global supply chain as well as to bring in more water use from abroad to benefit domestic consumers conflict of interest none acknowledgments this research is supported by china postdoctoral science foundation grant no 2018m640001 and the national natural science

6552,runoff generation from rainfall events is a complex spatial and temporally dependent process strongly governed among other factors by catchment surface topography although it is widely known that many catchments experience morphological evolution it is often ignored in analysis for different reasons ranging from simplification to lack of data however young catchments and early landscapes such as those which are affected by natural or anthropogenic disturbances do exhibit topography changes which in turn affect catchment hydrodynamics hydrology and in particular runoff in this work we study the runoff generation and hydrodynamics of the hühnerwasser artificial catchment brandenburg germany during a period of erosion based topographical changes 2006 2010 nine digital elevation models from such period were used as topography over which physically based simulations were performed the results suggest that topographic evolution in this catchment mostly affects the onset of runoff whereas peak discharges and receding hydrograph limbs are less affected these differences in hydrological signatures can be explained through the changes in the spatial distribution of runoff hydrodynamics and their impact on surface runoff connectivity relatively small topographical differences produce changing ponding conditions and modify flowpaths which becomes evident only through inspection of the spatial distribution of hydrodynamic variables moreover the study shows that in order for simulations to be able to capture such responses appropriate computational mesh and topographical data resolution are critical since connectivity itself can be greatly affected by low resolution data or representation keywords rainfall runoff simulation runoff generation topographic evolution catchment morphodynamics surface runoff connectivity 1 introduction landscape evolution is the result of many different geomorphological and hydrological processes e g surface runoff sediment transport hüttl et al 2014 troch et al 2015 tucker and hancock 2010 these topographic changes have a significant impact on the hydrological response of a catchment appels et al 2016 they can affect the flow paths rainfall runoff infiltration partitioning and so on moussa 2008 schaaf et al 2013a b therefore understanding the possible impacts of topographic changes is of interest to understand how catchments evolve how they have matured and how different ecohydrological processes interact however because of the unique evolution of each catchment and because evolution of mature catchments occurs at very slow rates generalization of some of the observed impacts of changing topographies is very difficult merz et al 2004 mazur et al 2011 moreover given that the complexity of processes contributing to morphological changes within the catchment and the corresponding alteration of runoff signatures single catchment experiments and even comprehensive monitoring programmes of whole catchments will neither allow to decipher all processes interaction nor will it allow to apply a statistically derived experimental design commonly used in agriculture and ecological field studies hydrological processes play a significant role in the evolution of landscapes in many ways one of which is through sediment transport processes surface runoff is largely responsible for the redistribution of sediment across spatial scales from the plot scale to the hillslope scale and to the catchment scale cuomo et al 2016 at the hillslope scale the net effect of erosion is an evolving topography and the amount of transported sediment is related to the magnitude of topographic change heckmann and vericat 2018 there is a clear feedback between the hydrodynamic hydrological processes and the geomorphological change i e hydrodynamics drive erosion erosion leads to a change in topography which in turn constrains and reshapes hydrodynamics landscape evolution models lem e g chen 2014 tucker and hancock 2010 attempt to model such interactions originally at geological spatiotemporal scales but also being applied into smaller scales coulthard et al 2013 also addressed usually in small catchments by hydraulic based models cuomo et al 2015 juez et al 2018 it is also relevant to highlight that the magnitudes of morphological change are also different depending on scales and governing process e g erosion on hillslopes produces comparably low magnitude changes in contrast to the relief forming processes of geological catchment evolution cuomo et al 2015 the available literature includes a number studies of lem applications in the coupled hydromorphological process e g perron and fagherazzi 2012 salles and duclaux 2014 and the impact of hydrological factors and processes on the morphological evolution e g hancock et al 2006 hoober and cohen 2017 in contrast research seems to be scarce on how the evolving topography affects the hydrodynamics and therefore the hydrology of hillslopes there are arguably several reasons for this gap one is that hydrology is often concerned with systems which change at very slow rates which makes the topographic changes driven by hillslope erosion negligible when studying hydrological responses to rainfall events for example furthermore if there is topographic change it is often not measured since full scale dem acquisition has been historically non feasible to perform frequently current technology does allow for temporal dem datasets enabling studying the transient topographies and dems of differences dod e g heckmann and vericat 2018 moreover monitoring of evolving systems also has allowed to record topographic evolution from sediment processes at the hillslope scale hofer et al 2012 schneider et al 2013 the availability of these datasets allows to pursue modelling studies which may provide insights into how erosion caused topography evolution on hillslopes can affect hydrological processes which in turn affect both the overall ecohydrological and morphological evolution of the hillslope and even perhaps cascade along the landscape sweeney et al 2015 although observations and monitoring are key for a better understanding of these issues modelling is also an essential tool observations are by their own nature constrained by the events which occur when they occur therefore replications and their analysis are nearly impossible to conduct in the case of evolving topography it is of course possible to register the dynamic surface and to monitor rainfall and runoff but the same rainfall will not occur over different topographies making direct comparisons impossible modelling is the only tool which systematically allows to study sensitivity of the system to variations in processes and to make systematic observations of the response of the system to controlled forcing we focus in this work on the effects that topographic change due to erosion processes has on surface runoff generation the hydrological significance of the rainfall runoff process and the need for its modelling and simulation has been widely pointed out beven 2001 birkel et al 2012 paniconi and putti 2015 rodriguez iturbe 2000 the dependence of runoff response on catchment structure remains only partially understood since many factors interact topography vegetation geology with varying degrees of relative influence across a range of spatiotemporal scales jencso and mcglynn 2011 the possibility to model such processes and responses enhances our understanding and prediction capabilities of different hydrological responses and to assess the effects of climate and land use change on the hydrological behavior of systems hölzel et al 2011 although historically hydrologists have focused on the hydrograph as the main source of information from a catchment sivapalan 2018 the spatial distribution and flow paths of runoff in a catchment heavily influenced even by small topographical features may become a primary player when attempting to understand not only hydromorphological interactions czuba and foufoula georgiou 2015 but also biogeochemical hotspots frei et al 2012 groffman 2012 mcclain et al 2003 and long term vegetation development e g mcgrath et al 2012 many authors have proposed different approaches to link signatures such as the hydrograph to structural and morphological properties of the catchment either by observations or conceptual models e g karalis et al 2014 kirchner 2009 moussa 2008 post and jakeman 1996 furthermore the understanding of how small scale runoff generation and its patterns reflect in the catchment runoff response is still lacking ries et al 2017 hydrological connectivity can further help relating the spatial hydrodynamic features to the hydrological signatures which are easily observed and frequently the only source of hard data bracken and croke 2007 although many connectivity metrics and indices exist antoine et al 2009 borselli et al 2008 bracken et al 2013 lane et al 2009 mayor et al 2008 many of them only consider structural static connectivity disregarding the dynamic connectivity which occurs as a response to the transient hydrodynamics of runoff borselli et al 2008 cammerat 2002 lópez vicente and ben salem 2019 physically based models allow another approach to link spatial distributions and hydrological signatures since they represent and resolve processes at resolutions which are compatible to the scales and distributions at which the processes occur commonly rainfall runoff processes are modeled by means of empirical and lumped approaches mainly due to their inherent simplicity and low computational cost hollander et al 2009 caviedes voullieme et al 2012 it has been shown that the spatial distribution of different hydrological properties such as microtopography and processes e g infiltration can have significant effects on surface runoff generation rainfall runoff infiltration partitioning thompson et al 2010 on the resulting hydrographs appels et al 2011 and vegetation growth mcgrath et al 2012 however such lumped models fail to account for the spatial distribution of hydrological properties and processes furthermore they often mask and mix effects of different properties and processes since they allow for large parameter freedom enabling to achieve correct hydrological signatures typically hydrographs without any certainty of the internal distribution of water as it is mostly controlled by tunable parameters physically based models usually have stronger constrains on parameter freedom thus when calibration is achieved results are more accurate and meaningful fernández pato and garcía navarro 2016 an added advantage is that the spatially distributed hydrodynamic fields that these models produce can lead to the study of hydrological connectivity as an emergent property of the system keesstra et al 2018 lesschen et al 2009 the comparatively large computational cost of physically based models has limited their use in the past to a small variety of applications such as runoff simulation in small scale catchments and urban catchment areas caviedes voullieme et al 2012 dae hong and yongwon 2013 simons et al 2014 however increased computational power new hardware paradigms and more efficient numerical methods enable the application of physically based distributed models to a wider range of applications recently rainfall runoff simulation of large catchments and high resolution flood simulation in urban and rural areas is becoming common chen et al 2017 costabile et al 2017 paniconi and putti 2015 the hühnerwasser catchment located in northeast german offers an interesting opportunity to observe topographical changes and morphological evolution in the time span of a decade as the catchment quickly evolved from a highly perturbed landscape into a maturing catchment hüttl et al 2014 maurer and gerke 2016 the sustained monitoring effort produced a sequence of catchment digital elevation models dem throughout multiple years which documents the catchment s topographic evolution offers an opportunity to simulate the hydrological response under such evolution removing the interference of additional factors and thus study a simplified system in which only topography is changing and address the need to robustly identify to what extent the hydrological processes in the catchment are affected by these changes from a modelling perspective it is also crucial to be aware of the degree to which the data resolution is able to properly represent the hydrologically relevant geomorphic features of the catchment which therefore allow to capture the small scale hydrological processes that are involved the significance of small scale processes on runoff generation and other hydrological responses such as surface storage and surface flow connectivity has been shown in previous studies appels et al 2011 hallema et al 2016 thompson et al 2010 clearly signaling that proper spatial representation is key currently high resolution topography at the catchment scale is feasible although still not ubiquitous and running physically based simulations on such high resolution large scale surfaces remains challenging in physically distributed simulations a high computational cost exists due to the non linearity of the governing equations and the large number of cells that is usually required to represent the topography and achieve sufficient accuracy of the discrete solution wood et al 2011 fernández pato et al 2018 one way to reduce the computational costs is mesh coarsening which reduces resolution accuracy and computational cost yu and lane 2006 ozgen et al 2015 the degree of the accuracy loss is highly dependent on to what extend the chosen mesh is able to capture the microtopography and the small scale hydrological processes of the terrain this is non trivial as complex interactions exist between mesh resolution and surface features physical properties of the flow namely friction and even infiltration properties yu and lane 2006 caviedes voullieme et al 2012 fernández pato et al 2016 making model results strongly depending on mesh selection it is therefore relevant to assess what the possible effects of the often relatively low resolution available dem data or resolution reduction sampson et al 2012 for computational reasons on the hydrological signatures and most importantly on spatial distributions flow paths and connectivity lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 this is of course of particular importance when dealing with evolving topographies this work is concerned with studying the individual effects that evolving topography has on the rainfall runoff response of the hühnerwasser catchment we aim to observe characteristic catchment signatures and runoff flow fields the goal is to characterize how morphological changes interact with different rain intensities and how this manifests in hydrological responses an additional research question which strongly relates to topographical evolutions is how much does the topography resolution and its representation in a hydrological model artificially generate signatures that is for topographical evolution to be analyzed it is necessary to ensure that numerical artifacts often generated by inappropriate computational meshes are kept to a minimum we therefore perform simulations which cover the topographical evolution throughout 2006 to 2010 in the hühnerwasser catchment by means of a 2d zero inertia solver to facilitate the assessment of the effects of topographical evolution our simulations remove most sources of complexity such as complex rain signals infiltration and other involved processes which can strongly influence runoff generation and the resulting hydrographs as well as introducing added uncertainty and the models reducing explanatory power jencso and mcglynn 2011 indeed the issue of selecting which processes and model components to keep and which to simplify or discard is at the core of hydrology kirchner 2006 2009 therefore in this work we focus on conditions where infiltration has been completely removed and surface friction has been kept minimal and homogeneous in order to be able to clearly observe the different impacts of morphological evolution as well as the numerical effects of different mesh properties on the rainfall runoff simulation results although we also contrast with simulations considering infiltration we highlight that although an erosion driven topography change underlies the study erosion and sediment transport processes are not modelled and their effects are only present by the differences in the measured dems the simulations have been run on nine different dems with 1 m resolutions of the hühnerwasser catchment throughout the years 2006 to 2010 the high resolution data used in this study enables a reasonable representation of the topographic features of the catchment and allows for accurate hydrodynamics to be achieved mazur et al 2011 2 materials and methods 2 1 the catchment the hühnerwasser chicken creek catchment is located in southeast of brandenburg near the city of cottbus in the plain areas of northeast germany it lies within a post mining landscape in the rehabilitation area of an open cast lignite mine the catchment construction was completed in september 2005 to serve as a new artificial headwater that replaced the previous stream chicken creek that was destroyed as a result mining activities in the 1980s contrary to the surrounding landscape the catchment was not ecohydrologically rehabilitated but has been left unmanaged in order to monitor and document its morphological and ecohydrological evolution the development of the catchment has been reported to be fast in its first year with the formation of morphological components such as rill networks schneider et al 2013 and the initial development of vegetation but subsequently the catchment has seen a more gradual development gerwin et al 2011 hofer et al 2012 in which the initially dominating physical processes slowly lose dominance in favor of chemical and biological processes raab et al 2012 for details on the morphological changes of the catchment and assessments of the sediment balances we refer to schneider et al 2011 2012 2013 to illustrate the initial evolution of the topography the catchment and its possible effects on surface water dynamics fig 1 presents a conceptual line including key morphological and ecohydrological processes based on the account by several authors gerwin et al 2009 hüttl et al 2014 schaaf et al 2013a b schneider et al 2013 the catchment has an area of around 6 ha and has been constructed as a small hillslope with an elevation difference of about 15 m along the main axis and with the average longitudinal slope of 3 with the absolute heights of the catchment area ranging from 125 m a s l up to 140 m a s l gerwin et al 2009 the precipitation intensity of the area is reported to be from 1 2 mm h up to 25 mm h between the years 2007 and 2009 with the maximum rain rate generating a runoff of around 126 m3 h at the gauge located in the lower part of the catchment mazur et al 2011 it has also been reported that in the initial years of the catchment s development a minimum rain intensity of 9 mm h was required for runoff to be registered in the catchment hofer et al 2011 the runoff response of the catchment to rain events has also been reported as fast with small delays mazur et al 2011 at the lower part of the catchment a pond was constructed by the introduction of a depression in the clay layer construction the morphological evolution of the catchment was monitored by performing a set of aerial digital photogrammetry surveys between 2006 and 2010 nine dems with 1 m resolution schneider et al 2012 have been selected for this study and summarized in table 1 in this study the dems were cut to remove the pond area this is due to a set of reasons firstly the photogrammetry surveys did not provide real bathymetric data for the pond the existing data for the pond is extrapolated from additional observations and does not necessarily account for sediment depositions in the pond bed at the time the surveys where performed secondly the pond acts a severe runoff buffer if simulated runoff is monitored downstream of the pond hydrographs are severely dampened and delayed and hydrograph properties are very strongly dominated by the buffering capacity of the pond thus destroying the hydrograph response to changes in morphology therefore it is convenient to monitor simulated runoff upstream of the pond and the pond becomes unnecessary finally horizontal water surfaces such as the pond present a challenge to the stability of the selected numerical model caviedes voullieme et al 2018 by removing the pond stability constrains are alleviated time steps are larger and computational time is kept low table 1 summarizes the selected dems the number of cells which they contain after removal of the downstream pond region in all cases and geomorphic indicators average rill length average rill width and mean drainage density as reported by schneider et al 2013 which show the relatively small morphological variations that the hillslope experienced the hühnerwasser catchment has been subject of hydrological modeling studies hölzel et al 2013 used a spatially distributed hydrological water balance model and found that artificial sediment structures pour ribs dumped by stackers during the construction phase in the catchment have a reduction effect on the runoff generated as a result of different rain events since they act as hydraulic barriers and increase the water ponding capacity of the catchment hölzel et al 2013 further emphasized the importance of considering the heterogeneity of sediment properties at the catchment scale in hydrological modeling and therefore highlighting the importance of the spatial distribution of the processes involved hollander et al 2009 using several models both lumped for surface and subsurface flow and distributed based on methods such as the green ampt and richards equations for generating infiltration in the saturated and unsaturated zones respectively studied the influence of the modeler s choice in defining the boundaries and parametrization on model results and found that the modelers experience and preferences have significant impacts on the results of the model hofer et al 2011 using a physically based approach for 2d subsurface flow investigated the influence of the connectivity of drainage pathways in the catchment on the runoff generation process and found that the connectivity is highly sensitive on the antecedent soil water content and is also dependent on factors such as topography and soil hydraulic properties hofer et al 2012 with the use of two different physically based models for surface flow based on manning s equation and self organized critical networks studied the development of rill networks in the catchment and was able to reproduce the rills with small differences in the geometric characteristics such as length and depth in contrast to the observed data of the catchment all the aforementioned studies have emphasized on the importance of the spatial distribution of the processes involved and the resolution of the data being used in the modeling procedure of the hydrological processes fig 2 shows exemplary the change in topography between november 2007 and august 2008 and between august 2008 and june 2009 the figure illustrates the magnitude of the topographic changes in the catchment it shows that there is mostly a reduction of elevation as the catchment evolves which is the result of erosion processes during these years the catchment was undergoing the initial phases of vegetation development therefore it was still rather prone to erosive processes 2 2 the model

determined as usual by comparing rainfall and infiltration capacity 2 3 study setup 2 3 1 simulation setup the simulations were run on nine different elevation models between the years 2006 and 2010 selected dems are illustrated in fig 3 from the november 2006 dem until the november 2007 dem the catchment has been reported to experience an expansion of rill networks while subsequently the patterns have remained comparably stable schneider et al 2013 it has also been reported that the rills were widest in 2006 and have become narrower until the year 2008 whereas from 2008 up to 2009 they have seen a minor increase in their mean width schneider et al 2013 also a noticeably strong variation in drainage patterns for the november 2006 and november 2007 dems is reported the variations indicate straightening of rills and rills becoming more equally spaced throughout the november 2007 to march 2010 dems the drainage network has been reported to appear comparably stable schneider et al 2013 in order to reduce the complexity of the simulations and to allow for reasonably straightforward and clear analysis and conclusions the use of real rainfall signals has only been partially considered in turn two uniform rain intensities have been used for most of the simulations a low precipitation intensity of 10 mm h exceeding the 9 mm h threshold which has been reported for runoff generation in hühnerwasser and a very high 100 mm h intensity were chosen in order to be able to clearly assess the influence of different rain intensities on the runoff generation processes in the catchment uniform and long enough rain signals allow for a clear steady state discharge to be achieved while complex rain events due to their varying intensity may fail to clearly describe such a steady discharge altogether this accounts for 9 dem and 2 uniform rainfall setups complementary two different rain signals from an event reported in 2007 in the area have also been used to provide a comparison between the catchments response to complex precipitations and simple continuous rain the storm with largest accumulated rainfall 71 1 mm recorded in the cottbus weather station this rainfall event was recorded at an hourly resolution and the storm duration was 310 min a microcanonical random cascade model pohle et al 2018 was used to generate plausible sub hourly 10 min resolution rainfall distributions sixty distributions were stochastically generated of which two were chosen for simulations shown in fig 17 together with runoff results the two rain events herein called r1 and r2 have the same rainfall volume however their temporal distributions and intensities differ strongly the r1 event has very low precipitation early on followed by an intense 10 min peak at 151 7 mm hr the r2 event has a gradually growing intensity peaking late in the storm at 70 3 mm hr the average intensity is 13 76 mm hr for both cases putting it just above the lir rainfall which has a similar duration 300 min the r1 and r2 events were used with three dx 1 m dems april 2008 june 2009 and march 2010 in order to explore the catchment response throughout different years to real rain signals resulting in 3 dems and 2 rainfall setups the simulations were run with an idealized setup that included no infiltration and very low homogeneous values of friction in order for the results to demonstrate only the effects of morphological change and different mesh properties on the generated runoff this also allowed to achieve maximum steady discharges and to have very small delays between precipitation and the catchments response that noticeably reduced the required computational costs of the simulations a homogeneous surface roughness represented by manning s coefficient set to 0 009 s m1 3 which is practically equivalent to the smoothness of a glass surface and is in contrast considerably smoother than the actual catchment surface ideally friction would be set to zero but due to the nature of the zi equation this would introduce an indefinition caviedes voullieme et al 2018 it is therefore kept non zero but artificially extremely low stability was enforced by setting a courant friedrichs lewy value of 0 9 was chosen for the simulations simulation and rainfall durations were chosen so that the discharge in the hydrographs reached a clear steady state and the simulations ran for enough time for the water to leave the catchment runoff in the model has been measured at a defined outlet which was set to act as an outfall boundary at the same location for all the dems at the lower western part of the catchment on the main rill all other boundaries of the catchment were set as closed reflective boundaries 2 3 2 selected meshes meshes can consist of structured or unstructured grids with different cell shapes such as squares or triangles finer resolution meshes have a higher number of cells and a smaller cell size that result in higher required computational costs and data storage coarser mesh resolutions on the other hand have a lower number of cells with larger cell sizes however topography attributes in them only represent averaged properties of the surface that can result in a reduction in model accuracy to observe the difference between the behavior of coarser and finer meshes square structured meshes with the cell sizes of 0 5 m 1 m 2 m 4 m and 8 m were generated the base data used for mesh generation were the nine 1 m resolution dems throughout the years 2006 to 2010 of the catchment resulting in a total of 45 computational meshes the square structured meshes were generated in a way that the length of the edge of each cell was a result of a multiplication of the pixel edge length of the origin raster once generated the elevation of each cell in the mesh was the result of the average elevation of the raster data cells the five different meshes generated from the december 2008 dem are shown in fig 4 in order to clearly illustrate the difference in how the different mesh resolutions represent the slope and elevation in the catchment a close view of a surface located in the southern part of the december 2008 dem with meshes with the cell sizes of 1 m and 4 m is shown in fig 5 the figure shows the vertical dimensions scaled 10 times to allow its understanding it can be observed that as a result of coarsening the surface suffers a data loss and the small scale features of the morphology are smoothed out and no longer distinguishable in contrast to a finer mesh 2 4 postprocessing the model results in this work have been post processed into multiple signatures and indicators by ad hoc r scripts a brief description of the indicators and the procedure to obtain them is presented here steady discharge qst m3 s values have been estimated by computing the mean discharge using the last ten entries prior to the end of rainfall point at which the falling limb of the hydrograph starts we also define t50 s an indicator of time to 50 steady discharge estimated simply by linear interpolation of the appropriate data points in the rising limb of the hydrograph we further define a normalized steady discharge qstn this indicator is the difference of steady discharge between some mesh qstx and the corresponding 1 m resolution mesh qst1 normalized by the steady discharge of the corresponding dem with a resolution of 1 m qst1 as shown in eq 6 analogously we also define α for each dem as the normalized t50 difference as shown in eq 7 in which t50x is the time when the discharge reaches 50 of the steady discharge for a mesh with the resolution of x and t501 s is the same indicator for the dx 1 m mesh resolution the model was configured to produce spatial results of hydrodynamic fields every 60 s the transient water depth fields are then thresholded by a binary filter so that cells with depths lower than 2 mm are flagged as dry and those with higher depth are flagged as wet this produces a binary map with wet and dry clusters as described by renard and allard 2013 these clusters are simply a group of cells with the same state wet dry which share a common edge see renard and allard 2013 we then identify the number of wet clusters and use this as a connectivity metric renard and allard 2013 antoine et al 2009 an ad hoc r script was created for this purpose based on raster biclust and sdmtools packages this number of disconnected wet clusters is a quantitative indicator of connectivity in particular of dynamic connectivity and therefore dependent on the hydrodynamics and not only the dem a higher number of wet clusters for a constant flooded area implies lower surface water connectivity and viceversa that is for example when 80 of the catchment is flooded having 20 disconnected wet clusters implies a higher connectivity than having 200 disconnected wet clusters the limit is obviously having only a single cluster with a 100 flooded area implying that the entire catchment is connected we highlight the need to always consider the flooded area together with the number of clusters to draw this interpretation when comparing across different meshes with different number of cells the number of clusters is normalized by the number of cells to allow for comparison 6 q stn q stx q s t 1 q s t 1 7 t 50 x t 501 t 501 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological signatures hydrographs volume in this section the hydrographs and runoff volumes of the simulations are presented the results for the lower intensity rain lir cases are shown in fig 6 and for the higher intensity scenario hir are presented in fig 7 the figures show that all hydrographs for all meshes and dems achieve a steady state in a relatively short time this can be explained by the absence of infiltration which allows for the onset of runoff to follow very quickly the beginning of the rain and the very low value of friction used which enables a fast routing of water in the catchment each of the hydrographs can be divided into three sections the rising limb that characterizes the onset of runoff the steady state discharge and the falling limb from the point of view of topographical evolution the hydrographs exhibit differences among the steady discharges and the rising limbs throughout the different topographies of the catchment with the original resolution 1 m it is mostly the onset of runoff which is clearly affected by the change in morphology in the different years of the catchment steady discharge is always achieved sooner or later and it is very similar for all dems as expected given the lack of infiltration and the steady rainfall nonetheless it must be highlighted that the steady discharge is not identical this is due to slightly different catchment areas in each dem fig 13 the falling limbs see to be affected only very mildly by topographical evolution it is possible that larger differences in runoff generation could be observed during the formation of the rill network however since dems are not available in this case it has not been possible to assess this the different mesh resolutions result in much larger differences in the onset of runoff while the steady state and the receding limbs are only mildly affected mesh coarsening typically results in a significant delay in the onset of runoff and a delay in achieving the steady state 3 2 surface flow hydrodynamics and connectivity the lag observed in the onset of runoff among the different meshes can be linked to the connectivity degree among the water mass throughout each simulation this issue can be observed in the spatial distribution of the depth field fig 8 illustrates the spatial distribution of the flow field in the catchment at time 1000 s which is approximately the time when the discharge reaches 50 of the steady discharge for the december 2008 and may 2009 simulations both with a finer mesh dx 1 and a coarser mesh dx 8 it can be seen that the flooded areas more disconnected in the coarser mesh compared to the finer mesh due to this the water is capable of reaching the outlet at a considerably shorter time in the finer mesh compared to the coarser mesh setup this issue mainly arises due to the poor representation of topography in the coarser mesh due to this there is an underestimation of the local maxima and an overestimation of local minima of the terrain in the coarser meshes which result in larger area ponds compared to the finer mesh consequently more water is stored in the coarser meshes during the simulations in contrast to the finer mesh this can also be observed in the differences among the runoff volumes resulting from different meshes most clearly seen in figs 6 e and 7 e it is evident that the coarser meshes store a higher volume of water after the rain event compared to finer meshes and hence a lower volume of water outflows resulting in smaller volume values for the coarser mesh dx 4 m dx 8 m in comparison to the finer mesh dx 0 5 m dx 1 m the only exceptions are the november 2006 simulations in which all mesh resolutions approximately show the same behavior this may be due to the base data of that dem having a lower resolution than 1 m therefore causing coarsening to have small effects on the topographic features of the catchment it might also be due to the fact that the topographic features of the catchment were not as prominent in the initial years in comparison to the later dems there is uncertainty associated to the data acquisition and post processing strategy which allows for different causes of this schneider et al 2012 the transient water depth maps shown in fig 8 can be thresholded into binary wet dry maps as the ones shown in fig 9 showing the same cases and the same time as fig 8 during the onset of runoff the gray areas in fig 9 represent dry regions while the colored areas represent wet clusters the color scales indicates the size of the wet cluster in terms of the fraction of area of catchment it occupies the figure shows how a change in resolution changes drastically not only the number of wet clusters but the shape size and even location of them as is to be expected all the small local depressions are lost when coarsening thus eliminating all the low area fraction clusters moreover it can be seen that for both dems the reduction in resolution produces a complete disconnection at this time of the central rill from the outlet secondary rills are also all disconnected from the outlet some of the intermediate sized clusters completely disappear in the coarse meshes and the ones connected to the output do so no longer interestingly the largest cluster is in all cases the one corresponding to the central rill for 2008 the cluster nearly doubles its size while dramatically decreasing in length and increasing in width additionally comparing across dems dec 2008 vs may 2009 under high resolution also shows a change in terms of size location and number of wet clusters even a redirectioning of the west clusters fig 10 shows an equivalent figure but during the steady state t 300 m it shows that even at steady state the connectivity of the catchment is considerably different when reducing resolution even at steady state most of the minor rills are lost at low resolution the catchment behaves like a v shaped surface for the 2008 case the largest cluster doubles its area even though that large cluster encompasses several rills under high resolution in low resolution only the central rill is part of the largest connected wet cluster with severely overestimated width and with underestimated flow length for the 2009 case the area of the largest cluster is tripled the maximum flow length is similar but with severely enlarged width clearly showing how severely the spatial distribution of water and the hydrological connectivity is ill represented by the coarse mesh from 2008 to 2009 at high resolution the change in rill connectivity is quite clear the changes in connectivity both real as those which are artifacts of low resolution may not be very relevant for reproducing steady hydrographs but may be essential to model responses to intermittent rainfall sediment transport ecological processes vegetation establishment seed transport and morphological evolution of the catchment fig 11 shows the evolution of the number of clusters normalized by the number of cells of each dem for simulations with the december 2008 and may 2009 dems with both fine 1 m and coarse 8 m resolution the reason for normalization responds to the fact that the meshes have huge differences in number of cells making the comparison of cluster numbers which may include individual cells difficult the figure shows that the normalized number of clusters increases from zero representing a dry catchment during the rising limb of the hydrograph and eventually becomes steady during the state stage of the hydrograph high resolution meshes result in a lower number of clusters per cell than coarse resolution meshes i e finer meshes have a higher degree of connectivity more cells are part of a smaller number of connected clusters than the coarse mesh the flooded areas at time t 280 min with at least 2 mm water depth account for 16 06 of the total catchment area with the dx 1 m resolution and 19 5 with the dx 8 m resolution in the december 2008 simulations these values were 14 98 and 17 11 for the may 2009 simulations respectively at t 280 min the number of clusters has achieved a clear steady state in all four simulations in fig 11 since the flooded area deeper than 2 mm is very similar for both resolutions but the number of clusters is different it ensures that the cluster number is a proxy for connectivity in short the higher connectivity between hillslope and the drainage network increases the flashiness of the runoff response as has been highlighted by hallema et al 2016 also suggesting that connectivity metrics complement hydrograph data very well so that further insights can be drawn from the combined signatures 3 3 interpreting hydrographs through connectivity and the onset of runoff these delays in the onset of runoff caused by different mesh resolutions can be seen in a higher detail in fig 12 which illustrates the time when the discharge reaches 50 of the steady discharge indicator for how fast runoff develops for different topographies and different meshes as a result of the lir and hir rainfalls it can be seen that 0 5 m and 1 m meshes show similar predictions of the onset of runoff in most cases with variances below 20 of the 1 m mesh results the 2 m resolution mesh shows differences of up to 50 in comparison to the 1 m mesh with the coarser meshes the differences rise up to about 440 in contrast to the results generated by the 1 m reference mesh making the results completely inadequate in terms of the onset of runoff these differences clearly indicate that the impact that topography data representation can have on model results can be very large fig 12 also shows that topographic evolution of the catchment has a moderate impact in how runoff is initiated the time tends to increase towards a maximum for the june 2009 dem then falling back to similar times as in 2006 importantly the figure clearly shows that for this catchment mesh resolution can have a much more significant effect on the onset of runoff than the topographic evolution this highlights the importance of simulating runoff processes at an appropriate resolution so that the effects of morphological evolution are not overwhelmed or dampened by the numerical artifacts introduced by the computational mesh to get a better understanding on how mesh resolution affects the predicted steady discharge values in the model fig 13 shows the steady discharge values simulated in the different dems with different mesh configurations as a result of the hir and lir scenarios all the values have been normalized with respect to the results from the march 2010 simulation with the use of the 1 m resolution mesh from the figure it is evident that mesh resolution has small impacts on the steady discharge values estimated by the model with the coarser meshes having a difference of up to 6 with respect to the 1 m resolution mesh the steady discharge values of the 0 5 m mesh are all in line with the 1 m mesh results with differences smaller than 1 this suggests that 0 5 m resolution is unnecessary in terms of the quality of estimating steady discharge additionally the figure shows that the catchment area is not constant among the dems and that the differences in simulated steady discharge among the dems are mostly determined by the differences in area recall that from a morphological point of view the onset of runoff which is mostly affected by the change in morphology figs 6 and 7 to further study this consider fig 13 which shows that the steady discharges achieved among the different dems is mostly impacted by the area size of that dem complementary fig 14 a shows the depression storage volume for all dems and resolutions this is a topological feature of each discretized surface there is a general trend across resolutions coarser implies a larger depression storage meaning that the volume of local minima are mostly overestimated with coarser resolutions along time it is clear that there is initially a mild reduction in depression storage but in 2009 a high storage is registered which then falls back to the previous levels comparing this to fig 12 shows a very strong correlation between t50 and depression storage suggesting it is precisely the filling of local depressions which is strongly responsible for the delays in the onset of runoff fig 14b shows the ratio of static storage depression storage volume to the maximum dynamic storage maximum detention volume for both the lir and hir rainfall firstly the figure shows that this ratio is inversely proportional to resolution for both lir and hir meaning that depression storage takes a larger role in surface detention for coarser meshes the trend in time is similar to the trend of surface depression storage fig 14a and t50 fig 12 moreover clearly higher intensities hir dashed lines decrease the fraction of stored surface volume in depressions but the trends remain unchanged the trend of how this morphological change has affected runoff generation in the catchment can be seen from fig 12 the onset of runoff experiences a delay over time from november 2006 up to june 2009 and then a turn is seen in this trend with the delay decreasing until march 2010 these differences in the onsets of runoff among the different years clearly indicate the extent to which morphological change can impact the hydrological processes involved in a catchment fig 15 presents the instantaneous flow field at time 1000 s 16 6 min for the simulations on the april 2008 june 2009 and march 2010 dems with the 10 mm h rain intensity lir for a 1 m resolution this time is early on during the onset of runoff these flow fields allow to observe clearly how differently runoff builds up on the surface of the catchment and allow to explain some of the behaviors observed in the hydrographs fig 6 and summarized also in the onset of runoff indicator in fig 12 although hard to appreciate in fig 6 all three hydrographs result in different flowrates at t 1000 s the june 2009 dem produces a discharge roughly 3 times smaller than the discharge for the march 2010 case the april 2008 dem results in a discharge slightly around 10 larger at such time more importantly the shape of the hydrograph at such time is very similar for the april 2008 and the march 2010 cases but it is characteristically different for the march 2010 case the collective analysis of signals and spatial distributions consistently links the differences in the onset of runoff to changes in surface water connectivity caused by small topographic features which has been also recently been noted for agricultural catchments lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 fig 15 shows that the june 2009 simulation results in a higher number of small disconnected flooded areas in comparison to the april 2008 and march 2010 simulations both the 2008 and 2010 dems produce a higher flow concentration in their main rill at the same time of the simulations the high number of small clusters or ponds in the 2008 dem shows relevant microtopographic features present in the interrill surfaces they appear to allow for significant ponding thus not allowing for high flow concentration in the rills comparing the 2008 and the 2010 dems it appears that the 2010 dem results in higher flow concentration overall in the entire rill network than 2008 perhaps signaling that the microtopography in the interrill surfaces plays a smaller role or that the rill network is more strongly defined furthermore the flow fields in fig 15 offer a clear explanation of why the june 2009 dem results in the largest delay in the onset of runoff as shown in fig 12 and the lowest flow rate at t 1000 s hard to appreciate in fig 6 clearly the extent of microponding and the lower flow concentration are responsible for this interestingly as fig 12 shows the onset of runoff is very similar for the april 2008 and march 2010 dems which can also be appreciated in the flow fields regarding low lir 10 mm h and high hir 100 mm h rainfall intensities the obvious differences in runoff response is that steady state discharge is ten times higher for hir than for lir figs 6 and 7 given the absence of infiltration steady discharge is mostly determined by rainfall intensity fig 16 shows a comparison of runoff indicators between the two rainfall intensities fig 16 a and 16 b represent t50 s under both rainfall intensities for the different dems with four mesh resolutions fig 16 c and 16 d show the normalized steady discharge qstn for both hir and lir fig 16 a shows that different rainfall intensity results in smaller differences in α for the 0 5 m resolution mesh less than 25 than for the 2 m resolution mesh up to 110 the differences rise significantly with the coarsening of meshes with the dx 4 mesh having differences up to 200 and the dx 8 producing differences up to 300 these results show that there may be interactions between the rainfall signal and mesh resolution and thus suggest that mesh resolution analysis should be always assessed before using real rain signals for rainfall runoff simulations fig 16 c and d show that the dx 0 5 mesh has an almost identical behavior while estimating the peak discharge under different rain events with a maximum difference of less than 1 between the lir and hir setups these differences rise up to 4 for the dx 2 mesh size and up to 6 for the two coarser mesh configurations it can be concluded that different mesh resolutions have small effects on the steady discharge estimates of the model under different single pulse intensities however the absence of some processes such as infiltration soil heterogeneity and surface friction must be kept in mind while observing these results with the introduction of these processes the results are expected to alter and the degree in which the cell size of the mesh is capable of capturing these processes will become a significant factor in shaping the results 3 4 non uniform rainfall fig 17 shows the resulting hydrographs from the april 2008 june 2009 and march 2010 dems under two different rainfall signals r1 and r2 and the lir and hir scenarios for comparison fig 17 c and d show results corresponding to the same dems as is expected the r1 rainfall results in higher runoff than the r2 rainfall consistently with their peak intensities both rain events show that different topographies result in different hydrographs but mostly for the onset of runoff and the peaks flows the intermediate flow rates and the drainage limbs of the hydrographs are almost identical for all three dems regardless of the rain event a comparison with the lir and hir cases shows that the hydrographs behave essentially in the same way for r1 and r2 i e it is the onset of runoff which is delayed and milder for june 2009 compared to march 2010 and the april 2008 the march 2010 dem results in lower maximum discharge values in contrast to the other dems under the time dependent rainfall the ratio of maximum discharge between the april 2008 and march 2010 in the lir and hir cases is 1 043 interestingly the ratio for the r1 rain is 1 033 and for r2 is 1 043 the ratios for both r1 and r2 are very similar to the lir and hir ratios suggesting that the change in peak discharge is almost the same to the change in steady state discharge for steady rains which is mostly dominated by the difference in catchment area fig 13 that is the difference in peak discharge is a result of the change in catchment area not a result of introducing further rainfall complexity overall results from the r1 and r2 events show that the effects of changing topographies in the absence of infiltration manifest qualitatively in the same way independent of rainfall distribution 3 5 reintroducing infiltration preliminary assessment for the sake of completeness and in order to contextualize the aforementioned results fig 18 presents simulation results computed considering infiltration for this set of simulations only the 2 m resolution meshes have been used we show simulations only with the hir rainfall since for the selected infiltration parametrization the lir rain results in a trivial response without any runoff infiltration has calculated using the green ampt method with a simplistic domain wise homogenous saturated hydraulic conductivity of 2 53 10 6 ms 1 and suitable parameters for loamy sand soil average suction head at wetting front ψ 0 0613 m and porosity η 0 437 schaaf et al 2017 fig 18 shows the hydrographs only until t 50 min to enable a good resolution of the onset of runoff fig 18 a shows results without infiltration corresponding to results originally presented in figs 7 and 18b shows results with infiltration obviously runoff is reduced in the presence infiltration infiltration has additional effects firstly there is an increased delay to the onset of runoff which amplifies the differences across different topographies moreover the asymptotic trajectory towards the steady state is significantly extended these results suggest that the onset of runoff variations in response to morphological evolution studied in an idealized form without infiltration hold or might even be amplified by infiltration this remains to be studied systematically as it is a numerical experiment in its own right 4 conclusions the results of this study suggest that topographic evolution in the catchment can generate mild differences in the runoff generation process in particular the early stages of runoff the onset of runoff is mostly affected the changes appear to be related to the smoothening of the surface and the subsequent changes in runoff connectivity on both hillslopes and to a certain extent in the rill network since the variations in the onset of runoff appear to be related to connectivity and ponding it is expected that with the re introduction of the missing hydrological processes in particular infiltration the effects of topographic evolution on surface flow to become amplified in terms of hydrological partitioning the results suggest that a catchment which is experiencing rather small topographic changes in the interrill surfaces and to a very small extent in the rill network the process of runoff generation can be affected by small scale surface features this points out to the importance of interrill microtopography and its effect on hydrological partitioning thompson et al 2010 mcgrath et al 2012 but as this study shows also in the transient states and the sequence of how runoff is produced the changes in the onset of runoff can be related to surface dynamic connectivity which allows to explain in a succinct way how the spatial distributions of runoff correlate and are likely responsible for features of the hydrograph moreover despite the relatively small topographic changes significant differences can be appreciated in the spatial distribution flow paths and connectivity of surface runoff thus implying that even such small topographic evolution can have impacts in the formation of morphological ecological and biogeochemical hotspots additionally the results show that mesh resolution can have a significant impact on the runoff signatures and flow fields the poor representation of terrain features and inability of coarse meshes to capture the small scale processes involved manifests in a lower runoff connectivity which in turn manifests in runoff signatures as a delayed onset of runoff this numerical artifact is similar to and can overlap with that of a changing topography therefore highlighting the need of appropriate mesh selection to perform simulation based analysis of these systems in a broader outlook the artifacts introduced by computational resolution mimic the effects of field observations at different scales and the differences in connectivity from numerical resolution may also be analogous to scale dependent connectivity bracken et al 2013 the simplistic precipitations used in the majority of this study interact with mesh resolution to produce different signatures coarser meshes show a larger response variation when changing rainfall intensity interestingly the signatures response to topographic evolution seems to be relatively insensitive to rain intensity and intrastorm rainfall distribution this suggests that the expected effects of topographic evolution on catchment hydrodynamics are very weakly dependent on rainfall properties this may only be true in the absence of infiltration since morphological features can in fact amplify or reduce infiltration this remains to be studied systematically the results in this work highlight the fact that a deep understanding of catchment dynamics through computational modelling requires a systematic approach as multiple physical processes and numerical artifacts interact overlap and may dominate the indicators and signatures used to characterize and evaluate the response topographical effects may be completely drowned by numerical artifacts from the mesh and the emerging interactions between topography rainfall distribution and heterogeneous infiltration are not easy to untangle and in fact modelling is perhaps the only approach which allows to explore it the natural continuation of this work is to therefore explore the role of these interactions and whether or not the behavior of signatures observed in this work are amplified or simply completely overrun by other responses this has been pointed out as an evermore relevant issue in hydrology jencso and mcglynn 2011 this work is consistent in offering outlook towards further exploration of the effects of evolving catchment properties such as vegetation cover donohue et al 2007 birkel et al 2012 climate li et al 2012 and infiltration horton 1931 shuster et al 2007 on hydrological processes conflict of interest

6552,runoff generation from rainfall events is a complex spatial and temporally dependent process strongly governed among other factors by catchment surface topography although it is widely known that many catchments experience morphological evolution it is often ignored in analysis for different reasons ranging from simplification to lack of data however young catchments and early landscapes such as those which are affected by natural or anthropogenic disturbances do exhibit topography changes which in turn affect catchment hydrodynamics hydrology and in particular runoff in this work we study the runoff generation and hydrodynamics of the hühnerwasser artificial catchment brandenburg germany during a period of erosion based topographical changes 2006 2010 nine digital elevation models from such period were used as topography over which physically based simulations were performed the results suggest that topographic evolution in this catchment mostly affects the onset of runoff whereas peak discharges and receding hydrograph limbs are less affected these differences in hydrological signatures can be explained through the changes in the spatial distribution of runoff hydrodynamics and their impact on surface runoff connectivity relatively small topographical differences produce changing ponding conditions and modify flowpaths which becomes evident only through inspection of the spatial distribution of hydrodynamic variables moreover the study shows that in order for simulations to be able to capture such responses appropriate computational mesh and topographical data resolution are critical since connectivity itself can be greatly affected by low resolution data or representation keywords rainfall runoff simulation runoff generation topographic evolution catchment morphodynamics surface runoff connectivity 1 introduction landscape evolution is the result of many different geomorphological and hydrological processes e g surface runoff sediment transport hüttl et al 2014 troch et al 2015 tucker and hancock 2010 these topographic changes have a significant impact on the hydrological response of a catchment appels et al 2016 they can affect the flow paths rainfall runoff infiltration partitioning and so on moussa 2008 schaaf et al 2013a b therefore understanding the possible impacts of topographic changes is of interest to understand how catchments evolve how they have matured and how different ecohydrological processes interact however because of the unique evolution of each catchment and because evolution of mature catchments occurs at very slow rates generalization of some of the observed impacts of changing topographies is very difficult merz et al 2004 mazur et al 2011 moreover given that the complexity of processes contributing to morphological changes within the catchment and the corresponding alteration of runoff signatures single catchment experiments and even comprehensive monitoring programmes of whole catchments will neither allow to decipher all processes interaction nor will it allow to apply a statistically derived experimental design commonly used in agriculture and ecological field studies hydrological processes play a significant role in the evolution of landscapes in many ways one of which is through sediment transport processes surface runoff is largely responsible for the redistribution of sediment across spatial scales from the plot scale to the hillslope scale and to the catchment scale cuomo et al 2016 at the hillslope scale the net effect of erosion is an evolving topography and the amount of transported sediment is related to the magnitude of topographic change heckmann and vericat 2018 there is a clear feedback between the hydrodynamic hydrological processes and the geomorphological change i e hydrodynamics drive erosion erosion leads to a change in topography which in turn constrains and reshapes hydrodynamics landscape evolution models lem e g chen 2014 tucker and hancock 2010 attempt to model such interactions originally at geological spatiotemporal scales but also being applied into smaller scales coulthard et al 2013 also addressed usually in small catchments by hydraulic based models cuomo et al 2015 juez et al 2018 it is also relevant to highlight that the magnitudes of morphological change are also different depending on scales and governing process e g erosion on hillslopes produces comparably low magnitude changes in contrast to the relief forming processes of geological catchment evolution cuomo et al 2015 the available literature includes a number studies of lem applications in the coupled hydromorphological process e g perron and fagherazzi 2012 salles and duclaux 2014 and the impact of hydrological factors and processes on the morphological evolution e g hancock et al 2006 hoober and cohen 2017 in contrast research seems to be scarce on how the evolving topography affects the hydrodynamics and therefore the hydrology of hillslopes there are arguably several reasons for this gap one is that hydrology is often concerned with systems which change at very slow rates which makes the topographic changes driven by hillslope erosion negligible when studying hydrological responses to rainfall events for example furthermore if there is topographic change it is often not measured since full scale dem acquisition has been historically non feasible to perform frequently current technology does allow for temporal dem datasets enabling studying the transient topographies and dems of differences dod e g heckmann and vericat 2018 moreover monitoring of evolving systems also has allowed to record topographic evolution from sediment processes at the hillslope scale hofer et al 2012 schneider et al 2013 the availability of these datasets allows to pursue modelling studies which may provide insights into how erosion caused topography evolution on hillslopes can affect hydrological processes which in turn affect both the overall ecohydrological and morphological evolution of the hillslope and even perhaps cascade along the landscape sweeney et al 2015 although observations and monitoring are key for a better understanding of these issues modelling is also an essential tool observations are by their own nature constrained by the events which occur when they occur therefore replications and their analysis are nearly impossible to conduct in the case of evolving topography it is of course possible to register the dynamic surface and to monitor rainfall and runoff but the same rainfall will not occur over different topographies making direct comparisons impossible modelling is the only tool which systematically allows to study sensitivity of the system to variations in processes and to make systematic observations of the response of the system to controlled forcing we focus in this work on the effects that topographic change due to erosion processes has on surface runoff generation the hydrological significance of the rainfall runoff process and the need for its modelling and simulation has been widely pointed out beven 2001 birkel et al 2012 paniconi and putti 2015 rodriguez iturbe 2000 the dependence of runoff response on catchment structure remains only partially understood since many factors interact topography vegetation geology with varying degrees of relative influence across a range of spatiotemporal scales jencso and mcglynn 2011 the possibility to model such processes and responses enhances our understanding and prediction capabilities of different hydrological responses and to assess the effects of climate and land use change on the hydrological behavior of systems hölzel et al 2011 although historically hydrologists have focused on the hydrograph as the main source of information from a catchment sivapalan 2018 the spatial distribution and flow paths of runoff in a catchment heavily influenced even by small topographical features may become a primary player when attempting to understand not only hydromorphological interactions czuba and foufoula georgiou 2015 but also biogeochemical hotspots frei et al 2012 groffman 2012 mcclain et al 2003 and long term vegetation development e g mcgrath et al 2012 many authors have proposed different approaches to link signatures such as the hydrograph to structural and morphological properties of the catchment either by observations or conceptual models e g karalis et al 2014 kirchner 2009 moussa 2008 post and jakeman 1996 furthermore the understanding of how small scale runoff generation and its patterns reflect in the catchment runoff response is still lacking ries et al 2017 hydrological connectivity can further help relating the spatial hydrodynamic features to the hydrological signatures which are easily observed and frequently the only source of hard data bracken and croke 2007 although many connectivity metrics and indices exist antoine et al 2009 borselli et al 2008 bracken et al 2013 lane et al 2009 mayor et al 2008 many of them only consider structural static connectivity disregarding the dynamic connectivity which occurs as a response to the transient hydrodynamics of runoff borselli et al 2008 cammerat 2002 lópez vicente and ben salem 2019 physically based models allow another approach to link spatial distributions and hydrological signatures since they represent and resolve processes at resolutions which are compatible to the scales and distributions at which the processes occur commonly rainfall runoff processes are modeled by means of empirical and lumped approaches mainly due to their inherent simplicity and low computational cost hollander et al 2009 caviedes voullieme et al 2012 it has been shown that the spatial distribution of different hydrological properties such as microtopography and processes e g infiltration can have significant effects on surface runoff generation rainfall runoff infiltration partitioning thompson et al 2010 on the resulting hydrographs appels et al 2011 and vegetation growth mcgrath et al 2012 however such lumped models fail to account for the spatial distribution of hydrological properties and processes furthermore they often mask and mix effects of different properties and processes since they allow for large parameter freedom enabling to achieve correct hydrological signatures typically hydrographs without any certainty of the internal distribution of water as it is mostly controlled by tunable parameters physically based models usually have stronger constrains on parameter freedom thus when calibration is achieved results are more accurate and meaningful fernández pato and garcía navarro 2016 an added advantage is that the spatially distributed hydrodynamic fields that these models produce can lead to the study of hydrological connectivity as an emergent property of the system keesstra et al 2018 lesschen et al 2009 the comparatively large computational cost of physically based models has limited their use in the past to a small variety of applications such as runoff simulation in small scale catchments and urban catchment areas caviedes voullieme et al 2012 dae hong and yongwon 2013 simons et al 2014 however increased computational power new hardware paradigms and more efficient numerical methods enable the application of physically based distributed models to a wider range of applications recently rainfall runoff simulation of large catchments and high resolution flood simulation in urban and rural areas is becoming common chen et al 2017 costabile et al 2017 paniconi and putti 2015 the hühnerwasser catchment located in northeast german offers an interesting opportunity to observe topographical changes and morphological evolution in the time span of a decade as the catchment quickly evolved from a highly perturbed landscape into a maturing catchment hüttl et al 2014 maurer and gerke 2016 the sustained monitoring effort produced a sequence of catchment digital elevation models dem throughout multiple years which documents the catchment s topographic evolution offers an opportunity to simulate the hydrological response under such evolution removing the interference of additional factors and thus study a simplified system in which only topography is changing and address the need to robustly identify to what extent the hydrological processes in the catchment are affected by these changes from a modelling perspective it is also crucial to be aware of the degree to which the data resolution is able to properly represent the hydrologically relevant geomorphic features of the catchment which therefore allow to capture the small scale hydrological processes that are involved the significance of small scale processes on runoff generation and other hydrological responses such as surface storage and surface flow connectivity has been shown in previous studies appels et al 2011 hallema et al 2016 thompson et al 2010 clearly signaling that proper spatial representation is key currently high resolution topography at the catchment scale is feasible although still not ubiquitous and running physically based simulations on such high resolution large scale surfaces remains challenging in physically distributed simulations a high computational cost exists due to the non linearity of the governing equations and the large number of cells that is usually required to represent the topography and achieve sufficient accuracy of the discrete solution wood et al 2011 fernández pato et al 2018 one way to reduce the computational costs is mesh coarsening which reduces resolution accuracy and computational cost yu and lane 2006 ozgen et al 2015 the degree of the accuracy loss is highly dependent on to what extend the chosen mesh is able to capture the microtopography and the small scale hydrological processes of the terrain this is non trivial as complex interactions exist between mesh resolution and surface features physical properties of the flow namely friction and even infiltration properties yu and lane 2006 caviedes voullieme et al 2012 fernández pato et al 2016 making model results strongly depending on mesh selection it is therefore relevant to assess what the possible effects of the often relatively low resolution available dem data or resolution reduction sampson et al 2012 for computational reasons on the hydrological signatures and most importantly on spatial distributions flow paths and connectivity lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 this is of course of particular importance when dealing with evolving topographies this work is concerned with studying the individual effects that evolving topography has on the rainfall runoff response of the hühnerwasser catchment we aim to observe characteristic catchment signatures and runoff flow fields the goal is to characterize how morphological changes interact with different rain intensities and how this manifests in hydrological responses an additional research question which strongly relates to topographical evolutions is how much does the topography resolution and its representation in a hydrological model artificially generate signatures that is for topographical evolution to be analyzed it is necessary to ensure that numerical artifacts often generated by inappropriate computational meshes are kept to a minimum we therefore perform simulations which cover the topographical evolution throughout 2006 to 2010 in the hühnerwasser catchment by means of a 2d zero inertia solver to facilitate the assessment of the effects of topographical evolution our simulations remove most sources of complexity such as complex rain signals infiltration and other involved processes which can strongly influence runoff generation and the resulting hydrographs as well as introducing added uncertainty and the models reducing explanatory power jencso and mcglynn 2011 indeed the issue of selecting which processes and model components to keep and which to simplify or discard is at the core of hydrology kirchner 2006 2009 therefore in this work we focus on conditions where infiltration has been completely removed and surface friction has been kept minimal and homogeneous in order to be able to clearly observe the different impacts of morphological evolution as well as the numerical effects of different mesh properties on the rainfall runoff simulation results although we also contrast with simulations considering infiltration we highlight that although an erosion driven topography change underlies the study erosion and sediment transport processes are not modelled and their effects are only present by the differences in the measured dems the simulations have been run on nine different dems with 1 m resolutions of the hühnerwasser catchment throughout the years 2006 to 2010 the high resolution data used in this study enables a reasonable representation of the topographic features of the catchment and allows for accurate hydrodynamics to be achieved mazur et al 2011 2 materials and methods 2 1 the catchment the hühnerwasser chicken creek catchment is located in southeast of brandenburg near the city of cottbus in the plain areas of northeast germany it lies within a post mining landscape in the rehabilitation area of an open cast lignite mine the catchment construction was completed in september 2005 to serve as a new artificial headwater that replaced the previous stream chicken creek that was destroyed as a result mining activities in the 1980s contrary to the surrounding landscape the catchment was not ecohydrologically rehabilitated but has been left unmanaged in order to monitor and document its morphological and ecohydrological evolution the development of the catchment has been reported to be fast in its first year with the formation of morphological components such as rill networks schneider et al 2013 and the initial development of vegetation but subsequently the catchment has seen a more gradual development gerwin et al 2011 hofer et al 2012 in which the initially dominating physical processes slowly lose dominance in favor of chemical and biological processes raab et al 2012 for details on the morphological changes of the catchment and assessments of the sediment balances we refer to schneider et al 2011 2012 2013 to illustrate the initial evolution of the topography the catchment and its possible effects on surface water dynamics fig 1 presents a conceptual line including key morphological and ecohydrological processes based on the account by several authors gerwin et al 2009 hüttl et al 2014 schaaf et al 2013a b schneider et al 2013 the catchment has an area of around 6 ha and has been constructed as a small hillslope with an elevation difference of about 15 m along the main axis and with the average longitudinal slope of 3 with the absolute heights of the catchment area ranging from 125 m a s l up to 140 m a s l gerwin et al 2009 the precipitation intensity of the area is reported to be from 1 2 mm h up to 25 mm h between the years 2007 and 2009 with the maximum rain rate generating a runoff of around 126 m3 h at the gauge located in the lower part of the catchment mazur et al 2011 it has also been reported that in the initial years of the catchment s development a minimum rain intensity of 9 mm h was required for runoff to be registered in the catchment hofer et al 2011 the runoff response of the catchment to rain events has also been reported as fast with small delays mazur et al 2011 at the lower part of the catchment a pond was constructed by the introduction of a depression in the clay layer construction the morphological evolution of the catchment was monitored by performing a set of aerial digital photogrammetry surveys between 2006 and 2010 nine dems with 1 m resolution schneider et al 2012 have been selected for this study and summarized in table 1 in this study the dems were cut to remove the pond area this is due to a set of reasons firstly the photogrammetry surveys did not provide real bathymetric data for the pond the existing data for the pond is extrapolated from additional observations and does not necessarily account for sediment depositions in the pond bed at the time the surveys where performed secondly the pond acts a severe runoff buffer if simulated runoff is monitored downstream of the pond hydrographs are severely dampened and delayed and hydrograph properties are very strongly dominated by the buffering capacity of the pond thus destroying the hydrograph response to changes in morphology therefore it is convenient to monitor simulated runoff upstream of the pond and the pond becomes unnecessary finally horizontal water surfaces such as the pond present a challenge to the stability of the selected numerical model caviedes voullieme et al 2018 by removing the pond stability constrains are alleviated time steps are larger and computational time is kept low table 1 summarizes the selected dems the number of cells which they contain after removal of the downstream pond region in all cases and geomorphic indicators average rill length average rill width and mean drainage density as reported by schneider et al 2013 which show the relatively small morphological variations that the hillslope experienced the hühnerwasser catchment has been subject of hydrological modeling studies hölzel et al 2013 used a spatially distributed hydrological water balance model and found that artificial sediment structures pour ribs dumped by stackers during the construction phase in the catchment have a reduction effect on the runoff generated as a result of different rain events since they act as hydraulic barriers and increase the water ponding capacity of the catchment hölzel et al 2013 further emphasized the importance of considering the heterogeneity of sediment properties at the catchment scale in hydrological modeling and therefore highlighting the importance of the spatial distribution of the processes involved hollander et al 2009 using several models both lumped for surface and subsurface flow and distributed based on methods such as the green ampt and richards equations for generating infiltration in the saturated and unsaturated zones respectively studied the influence of the modeler s choice in defining the boundaries and parametrization on model results and found that the modelers experience and preferences have significant impacts on the results of the model hofer et al 2011 using a physically based approach for 2d subsurface flow investigated the influence of the connectivity of drainage pathways in the catchment on the runoff generation process and found that the connectivity is highly sensitive on the antecedent soil water content and is also dependent on factors such as topography and soil hydraulic properties hofer et al 2012 with the use of two different physically based models for surface flow based on manning s equation and self organized critical networks studied the development of rill networks in the catchment and was able to reproduce the rills with small differences in the geometric characteristics such as length and depth in contrast to the observed data of the catchment all the aforementioned studies have emphasized on the importance of the spatial distribution of the processes involved and the resolution of the data being used in the modeling procedure of the hydrological processes fig 2 shows exemplary the change in topography between november 2007 and august 2008 and between august 2008 and june 2009 the figure illustrates the magnitude of the topographic changes in the catchment it shows that there is mostly a reduction of elevation as the catchment evolves which is the result of erosion processes during these years the catchment was undergoing the initial phases of vegetation development therefore it was still rather prone to erosive processes 2 2 the model

selected dems are illustrated in fig 3 from the november 2006 dem until the november 2007 dem the catchment has been reported to experience an expansion of rill networks while subsequently the patterns have remained comparably stable schneider et al 2013 it has also been reported that the rills were widest in 2006 and have become narrower until the year 2008 whereas from 2008 up to 2009 they have seen a minor increase in their mean width schneider et al 2013 also a noticeably strong variation in drainage patterns for the november 2006 and november 2007 dems is reported the variations indicate straightening of rills and rills becoming more equally spaced throughout the november 2007 to march 2010 dems the drainage network has been reported to appear comparably stable schneider et al 2013 in order to reduce the complexity of the simulations and to allow for reasonably straightforward and clear analysis and conclusions the use of real rainfall signals has only been partially considered in turn two uniform rain intensities have been used for most of the simulations a low precipitation intensity of 10 mm h exceeding the 9 mm h threshold which has been reported for runoff generation in hühnerwasser and a very high 100 mm h intensity were chosen in order to be able to clearly assess the influence of different rain intensities on the runoff generation processes in the catchment uniform and long enough rain signals allow for a clear steady state discharge to be achieved while complex rain events due to their varying intensity may fail to clearly describe such a steady discharge altogether this accounts for 9 dem and 2 uniform rainfall setups complementary two different rain signals from an event reported in 2007 in the area have also been used to provide a comparison between the catchments response to complex precipitations and simple continuous rain the storm with largest accumulated rainfall 71 1 mm recorded in the cottbus weather station this rainfall event was recorded at an hourly resolution and the storm duration was 310 min a microcanonical random cascade model pohle et al 2018 was used to generate plausible sub hourly 10 min resolution rainfall distributions sixty distributions were stochastically generated of which two were chosen for simulations shown in fig 17 together with runoff results the two rain events herein called r1 and r2 have the same rainfall volume however their temporal distributions and intensities differ strongly the r1 event has very low precipitation early on followed by an intense 10 min peak at 151 7 mm hr the r2 event has a gradually growing intensity peaking late in the storm at 70 3 mm hr the average intensity is 13 76 mm hr for both cases putting it just above the lir rainfall which has a similar duration 300 min the r1 and r2 events were used with three dx 1 m dems april 2008 june 2009 and march 2010 in order to explore the catchment response throughout different years to real rain signals resulting in 3 dems and 2 rainfall setups the simulations were run with an idealized setup that included no infiltration and very low homogeneous values of friction in order for the results to demonstrate only the effects of morphological change and different mesh properties on the generated runoff this also allowed to achieve maximum steady discharges and to have very small delays between precipitation and the catchments response that noticeably reduced the required computational costs of the simulations a homogeneous surface roughness represented by manning s coefficient set to 0 009 s m1 3 which is practically equivalent to the smoothness of a glass surface and is in contrast considerably smoother than the actual catchment surface ideally friction would be set to zero but due to the nature of the zi equation this would introduce an indefinition caviedes voullieme et al 2018 it is therefore kept non zero but artificially extremely low stability was enforced by setting a courant friedrichs lewy value of 0 9 was chosen for the simulations simulation and rainfall durations were chosen so that the discharge in the hydrographs reached a clear steady state and the simulations ran for enough time for the water to leave the catchment runoff in the model has been measured at a defined outlet which was set to act as an outfall boundary at the same location for all the dems at the lower western part of the catchment on the main rill all other boundaries of the catchment were set as closed reflective boundaries 2 3 2 selected meshes meshes can consist of structured or unstructured grids with different cell shapes such as squares or triangles finer resolution meshes have a higher number of cells and a smaller cell size that result in higher required computational costs and data storage coarser mesh resolutions on the other hand have a lower number of cells with larger cell sizes however topography attributes in them only represent averaged properties of the surface that can result in a reduction in model accuracy to observe the difference between the behavior of coarser and finer meshes square structured meshes with the cell sizes of 0 5 m 1 m 2 m 4 m and 8 m were generated the base data used for mesh generation were the nine 1 m resolution dems throughout the years 2006 to 2010 of the catchment resulting in a total of 45 computational meshes the square structured meshes were generated in a way that the length of the edge of each cell was a result of a multiplication of the pixel edge length of the origin raster once generated the elevation of each cell in the mesh was the result of the average elevation of the raster data cells the five different meshes generated from the december 2008 dem are shown in fig 4 in order to clearly illustrate the difference in how the different mesh resolutions represent the slope and elevation in the catchment a close view of a surface located in the southern part of the december 2008 dem with meshes with the cell sizes of 1 m and 4 m is shown in fig 5 the figure shows the vertical dimensions scaled 10 times to allow its understanding it can be observed that as a result of coarsening the surface suffers a data loss and the small scale features of the morphology are smoothed out and no longer distinguishable in contrast to a finer mesh 2 4 postprocessing the model results in this work have been post processed into multiple signatures and indicators by ad hoc r scripts a brief description of the indicators and the procedure to obtain them is presented here steady discharge qst m3 s values have been estimated by computing the mean discharge using the last ten entries prior to the end of rainfall point at which the falling limb of the hydrograph starts we also define t50 s an indicator of time to 50 steady discharge estimated simply by linear interpolation of the appropriate data points in the rising limb of the hydrograph we further define a normalized steady discharge qstn this indicator is the difference of steady discharge between some mesh qstx and the corresponding 1 m resolution mesh qst1 normalized by the steady discharge of the corresponding dem with a resolution of 1 m qst1 as shown in eq 6 analogously we also define α for each dem as the normalized t50 difference as shown in eq 7 in which t50x is the time when the discharge reaches 50 of the steady discharge for a mesh with the resolution of x and t501 s is the same indicator for the dx 1 m mesh resolution the model was configured to produce spatial results of hydrodynamic fields every 60 s the transient water depth fields are then thresholded by a binary filter so that cells with depths lower than 2 mm are flagged as dry and those with higher depth are flagged as wet this produces a binary map with wet and dry clusters as described by renard and allard 2013 these clusters are simply a group of cells with the same state wet dry which share a common edge see renard and allard 2013 we then identify the number of wet clusters and use this as a connectivity metric renard and allard 2013 antoine et al 2009 an ad hoc r script was created for this purpose based on raster biclust and sdmtools packages this number of disconnected wet clusters is a quantitative indicator of connectivity in particular of dynamic connectivity and therefore dependent on the hydrodynamics and not only the dem a higher number of wet clusters for a constant flooded area implies lower surface water connectivity and viceversa that is for example when 80 of the catchment is flooded having 20 disconnected wet clusters implies a higher connectivity than having 200 disconnected wet clusters the limit is obviously having only a single cluster with a 100 flooded area implying that the entire catchment is connected we highlight the need to always consider the flooded area together with the number of clusters to draw this interpretation when comparing across different meshes with different number of cells the number of clusters is normalized by the number of cells to allow for comparison 6 q stn q stx q s t 1 q s t 1 7 t 50 x t 501 t 501 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological signatures hydrographs volume in this section the hydrographs and runoff volumes of the simulations are presented the results for the lower intensity rain lir cases are shown in fig 6 and for the higher intensity scenario hir are presented in fig 7 the figures show that all hydrographs for all meshes and dems achieve a steady state in a relatively short time this can be explained by the absence of infiltration which allows for the onset of runoff to follow very quickly the beginning of the rain and the very low value of friction used which enables a fast routing of water in the catchment each of the hydrographs can be divided into three sections the rising limb that characterizes the onset of runoff the steady state discharge and the falling limb from the point of view of topographical evolution the hydrographs exhibit differences among the steady discharges and the rising limbs throughout the different topographies of the catchment with the original resolution 1 m it is mostly the onset of runoff which is clearly affected by the change in morphology in the different years of the catchment steady discharge is always achieved sooner or later and it is very similar for all dems as expected given the lack of infiltration and the steady rainfall nonetheless it must be highlighted that the steady discharge is not identical this is due to slightly different catchment areas in each dem fig 13 the falling limbs see to be affected only very mildly by topographical evolution it is possible that larger differences in runoff generation could be observed during the formation of the rill network however since dems are not available in this case it has not been possible to assess this the different mesh resolutions result in much larger differences in the onset of runoff while the steady state and the receding limbs are only mildly affected mesh coarsening typically results in a significant delay in the onset of runoff and a delay in achieving the steady state 3 2 surface flow hydrodynamics and connectivity the lag observed in the onset of runoff among the different meshes can be linked to the connectivity degree among the water mass throughout each simulation this issue can be observed in the spatial distribution of the depth field fig 8 illustrates the spatial distribution of the flow field in the catchment at time 1000 s which is approximately the time when the discharge reaches 50 of the steady discharge for the december 2008 and may 2009 simulations both with a finer mesh dx 1 and a coarser mesh dx 8 it can be seen that the flooded areas more disconnected in the coarser mesh compared to the finer mesh due to this the water is capable of reaching the outlet at a considerably shorter time in the finer mesh compared to the coarser mesh setup this issue mainly arises due to the poor representation of topography in the coarser mesh due to this there is an underestimation of the local maxima and an overestimation of local minima of the terrain in the coarser meshes which result in larger area ponds compared to the finer mesh consequently more water is stored in the coarser meshes during the simulations in contrast to the finer mesh this can also be observed in the differences among the runoff volumes resulting from different meshes most clearly seen in figs 6 e and 7 e it is evident that the coarser meshes store a higher volume of water after the rain event compared to finer meshes and hence a lower volume of water outflows resulting in smaller volume values for the coarser mesh dx 4 m dx 8 m in comparison to the finer mesh dx 0 5 m dx 1 m the only exceptions are the november 2006 simulations in which all mesh resolutions approximately show the same behavior this may be due to the base data of that dem having a lower resolution than 1 m therefore causing coarsening to have small effects on the topographic features of the catchment it might also be due to the fact that the topographic features of the catchment were not as prominent in the initial years in comparison to the later dems there is uncertainty associated to the data acquisition and post processing strategy which allows for different causes of this schneider et al 2012 the transient water depth maps shown in fig 8 can be thresholded into binary wet dry maps as the ones shown in fig 9 showing the same cases and the same time as fig 8 during the onset of runoff the gray areas in fig 9 represent dry regions while the colored areas represent wet clusters the color scales indicates the size of the wet cluster in terms of the fraction of area of catchment it occupies the figure shows how a change in resolution changes drastically not only the number of wet clusters but the shape size and even location of them as is to be expected all the small local depressions are lost when coarsening thus eliminating all the low area fraction clusters moreover it can be seen that for both dems the reduction in resolution produces a complete disconnection at this time of the central rill from the outlet secondary rills are also all disconnected from the outlet some of the intermediate sized clusters completely disappear in the coarse meshes and the ones connected to the output do so no longer interestingly the largest cluster is in all cases the one corresponding to the central rill for 2008 the cluster nearly doubles its size while dramatically decreasing in length and increasing in width additionally comparing across dems dec 2008 vs may 2009 under high resolution also shows a change in terms of size location and number of wet clusters even a redirectioning of the west clusters fig 10 shows an equivalent figure but during the steady state t 300 m it shows that even at steady state the connectivity of the catchment is considerably different when reducing resolution even at steady state most of the minor rills are lost at low resolution the catchment behaves like a v shaped surface for the 2008 case the largest cluster doubles its area even though that large cluster encompasses several rills under high resolution in low resolution only the central rill is part of the largest connected wet cluster with severely overestimated width and with underestimated flow length for the 2009 case the area of the largest cluster is tripled the maximum flow length is similar but with severely enlarged width clearly showing how severely the spatial distribution of water and the hydrological connectivity is ill represented by the coarse mesh from 2008 to 2009 at high resolution the change in rill connectivity is quite clear the changes in connectivity both real as those which are artifacts of low resolution may not be very relevant for reproducing steady hydrographs but may be essential to model responses to intermittent rainfall sediment transport ecological processes vegetation establishment seed transport and morphological evolution of the catchment fig 11 shows the evolution of the number of clusters normalized by the number of cells of each dem for simulations with the december 2008 and may 2009 dems with both fine 1 m and coarse 8 m resolution the reason for normalization responds to the fact that the meshes have huge differences in number of cells making the comparison of cluster numbers which may include individual cells difficult the figure shows that the normalized number of clusters increases from zero representing a dry catchment during the rising limb of the hydrograph and eventually becomes steady during the state stage of the hydrograph high resolution meshes result in a lower number of clusters per cell than coarse resolution meshes i e finer meshes have a higher degree of connectivity more cells are part of a smaller number of connected clusters than the coarse mesh the flooded areas at time t 280 min with at least 2 mm water depth account for 16 06 of the total catchment area with the dx 1 m resolution and 19 5 with the dx 8 m resolution in the december 2008 simulations these values were 14 98 and 17 11 for the may 2009 simulations respectively at t 280 min the number of clusters has achieved a clear steady state in all four simulations in fig 11 since the flooded area deeper than 2 mm is very similar for both resolutions but the number of clusters is different it ensures that the cluster number is a proxy for connectivity in short the higher connectivity between hillslope and the drainage network increases the flashiness of the runoff response as has been highlighted by hallema et al 2016 also suggesting that connectivity metrics complement hydrograph data very well so that further insights can be drawn from the combined signatures 3 3 interpreting hydrographs through connectivity and the onset of runoff these delays in the onset of runoff caused by different mesh resolutions can be seen in a higher detail in fig 12 which illustrates the time when the discharge reaches 50 of the steady discharge indicator for how fast runoff develops for different topographies and different meshes as a result of the lir and hir rainfalls it can be seen that 0 5 m and 1 m meshes show similar predictions of the onset of runoff in most cases with variances below 20 of the 1 m mesh results the 2 m resolution mesh shows differences of up to 50 in comparison to the 1 m mesh with the coarser meshes the differences rise up to about 440 in contrast to the results generated by the 1 m reference mesh making the results completely inadequate in terms of the onset of runoff these differences clearly indicate that the impact that topography data representation can have on model results can be very large fig 12 also shows that topographic evolution of the catchment has a moderate impact in how runoff is initiated the time tends to increase towards a maximum for the june 2009 dem then falling back to similar times as in 2006 importantly the figure clearly shows that for this catchment mesh resolution can have a much more significant effect on the onset of runoff than the topographic evolution this highlights the importance of simulating runoff processes at an appropriate resolution so that the effects of morphological evolution are not overwhelmed or dampened by the numerical artifacts introduced by the computational mesh to get a better understanding on how mesh resolution affects the predicted steady discharge values in the model fig 13 shows the steady discharge values simulated in the different dems with different mesh configurations as a result of the hir and lir scenarios all the values have been normalized with respect to the results from the march 2010 simulation with the use of the 1 m resolution mesh from the figure it is evident that mesh resolution has small impacts on the steady discharge values estimated by the model with the coarser meshes having a difference of up to 6 with respect to the 1 m resolution mesh the steady discharge values of the 0 5 m mesh are all in line with the 1 m mesh results with differences smaller than 1 this suggests that 0 5 m resolution is unnecessary in terms of the quality of estimating steady discharge additionally the figure shows that the catchment area is not constant among the dems and that the differences in simulated steady discharge among the dems are mostly determined by the differences in area recall that from a morphological point of view the onset of runoff which is mostly affected by the change in morphology figs 6 and 7 to further study this consider fig 13 which shows that the steady discharges achieved among the different dems is mostly impacted by the area size of that dem complementary fig 14 a shows the depression storage volume for all dems and resolutions this is a topological feature of each discretized surface there is a general trend across resolutions coarser implies a larger depression storage meaning that the volume of local minima are mostly overestimated with coarser resolutions along time it is clear that there is initially a mild reduction in depression storage but in 2009 a high storage is registered which then falls back to the previous levels comparing this to fig 12 shows a very strong correlation between t50 and depression storage suggesting it is precisely the filling of local depressions which is strongly responsible for the delays in the onset of runoff fig 14b shows the ratio of static storage depression storage volume to the maximum dynamic storage maximum detention volume for both the lir and hir rainfall firstly the figure shows that this ratio is inversely proportional to resolution for both lir and hir meaning that depression storage takes a larger role in surface detention for coarser meshes the trend in time is similar to the trend of surface depression storage fig 14a and t50 fig 12 moreover clearly higher intensities hir dashed lines decrease the fraction of stored surface volume in depressions but the trends remain unchanged the trend of how this morphological change has affected runoff generation in the catchment can be seen from fig 12 the onset of runoff experiences a delay over time from november 2006 up to june 2009 and then a turn is seen in this trend with the delay decreasing until march 2010 these differences in the onsets of runoff among the different years clearly indicate the extent to which morphological change can impact the hydrological processes involved in a catchment fig 15 presents the instantaneous flow field at time 1000 s 16 6 min for the simulations on the april 2008 june 2009 and march 2010 dems with the 10 mm h rain intensity lir for a 1 m resolution this time is early on during the onset of runoff these flow fields allow to observe clearly how differently runoff builds up on the surface of the catchment and allow to explain some of the behaviors observed in the hydrographs fig 6 and summarized also in the onset of runoff indicator in fig 12 although hard to appreciate in fig 6 all three hydrographs result in different flowrates at t 1000 s the june 2009 dem produces a discharge roughly 3 times smaller than the discharge for the march 2010 case the april 2008 dem results in a discharge slightly around 10 larger at such time more importantly the shape of the hydrograph at such time is very similar for the april 2008 and the march 2010 cases but it is characteristically different for the march 2010 case the collective analysis of signals and spatial distributions consistently links the differences in the onset of runoff to changes in surface water connectivity caused by small topographic features which has been also recently been noted for agricultural catchments lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 fig 15 shows that the june 2009 simulation results in a higher number of small disconnected flooded areas in comparison to the april 2008 and march 2010 simulations both the 2008 and 2010 dems produce a higher flow concentration in their main rill at the same time of the simulations the high number of small clusters or ponds in the 2008 dem shows relevant microtopographic features present in the interrill surfaces they appear to allow for significant ponding thus not allowing for high flow concentration in the rills comparing the 2008 and the 2010 dems it appears that the 2010 dem results in higher flow concentration overall in the entire rill network than 2008 perhaps signaling that the microtopography in the interrill surfaces plays a smaller role or that the rill network is more strongly defined furthermore the flow fields in fig 15 offer a clear explanation of why the june 2009 dem results in the largest delay in the onset of runoff as shown in fig 12 and the lowest flow rate at t 1000 s hard to appreciate in fig 6 clearly the extent of microponding and the lower flow concentration are responsible for this interestingly as fig 12 shows the onset of runoff is very similar for the april 2008 and march 2010 dems which can also be appreciated in the flow fields regarding low lir 10 mm h and high hir 100 mm h rainfall intensities the obvious differences in runoff response is that steady state discharge is ten times higher for hir than for lir figs 6 and 7 given the absence of infiltration steady discharge is mostly determined by rainfall intensity fig 16 shows a comparison of runoff indicators between the two rainfall intensities fig 16 a and 16 b represent t50 s under both rainfall intensities for the different dems with four mesh resolutions fig 16 c and 16 d show the normalized steady discharge qstn for both hir and lir fig 16 a shows that different rainfall intensity results in smaller differences in α for the 0 5 m resolution mesh less than 25 than for the 2 m resolution mesh up to 110 the differences rise significantly with the coarsening of meshes with the dx 4 mesh having differences up to 200 and the dx 8 producing differences up to 300 these results show that there may be interactions between the rainfall signal and mesh resolution and thus suggest that mesh resolution analysis should be always assessed before using real rain signals for rainfall runoff simulations fig 16 c and d show that the dx 0 5 mesh has an almost identical behavior while estimating the peak discharge under different rain events with a maximum difference of less than 1 between the lir and hir setups these differences rise up to 4 for the dx 2 mesh size and up to 6 for the two coarser mesh configurations it can be concluded that different mesh resolutions have small effects on the steady discharge estimates of the model under different single pulse intensities however the absence of some processes such as infiltration soil heterogeneity and surface friction must be kept in mind while observing these results with the introduction of these processes the results are expected to alter and the degree in which the cell size of the mesh is capable of capturing these processes will become a significant factor in shaping the results 3 4 non uniform rainfall fig 17 shows the resulting hydrographs from the april 2008 june 2009 and march 2010 dems under two different rainfall signals r1 and r2 and the lir and hir scenarios for comparison fig 17 c and d show results corresponding to the same dems as is expected the r1 rainfall results in higher runoff than the r2 rainfall consistently with their peak intensities both rain events show that different topographies result in different hydrographs but mostly for the onset of runoff and the peaks flows the intermediate flow rates and the drainage limbs of the hydrographs are almost identical for all three dems regardless of the rain event a comparison with the lir and hir cases shows that the hydrographs behave essentially in the same way for r1 and r2 i e it is the onset of runoff which is delayed and milder for june 2009 compared to march 2010 and the april 2008 the march 2010 dem results in lower maximum discharge values in contrast to the other dems under the time dependent rainfall the ratio of maximum discharge between the april 2008 and march 2010 in the lir and hir cases is 1 043 interestingly the ratio for the r1 rain is 1 033 and for r2 is 1 043 the ratios for both r1 and r2 are very similar to the lir and hir ratios suggesting that the change in peak discharge is almost the same to the change in steady state discharge for steady rains which is mostly dominated by the difference in catchment area fig 13 that is the difference in peak discharge is a result of the change in catchment area not a result of introducing further rainfall complexity overall results from the r1 and r2 events show that the effects of changing topographies in the absence of infiltration manifest qualitatively in the same way independent of rainfall distribution 3 5 reintroducing infiltration preliminary assessment for the sake of completeness and in order to contextualize the aforementioned results fig 18 presents simulation results computed considering infiltration for this set of simulations only the 2 m resolution meshes have been used we show simulations only with the hir rainfall since for the selected infiltration parametrization the lir rain results in a trivial response without any runoff infiltration has calculated using the green ampt method with a simplistic domain wise homogenous saturated hydraulic conductivity of 2 53 10 6 ms 1 and suitable parameters for loamy sand soil average suction head at wetting front ψ 0 0613 m and porosity η 0 437 schaaf et al 2017 fig 18 shows the hydrographs only until t 50 min to enable a good resolution of the onset of runoff fig 18 a shows results without infiltration corresponding to results originally presented in figs 7 and 18b shows results with infiltration obviously runoff is reduced in the presence infiltration infiltration has additional effects firstly there is an increased delay to the onset of runoff which amplifies the differences across different topographies moreover the asymptotic trajectory towards the steady state is significantly extended these results suggest that the onset of runoff variations in response to morphological evolution studied in an idealized form without infiltration hold or might even be amplified by infiltration this remains to be studied systematically as it is a numerical experiment in its own right 4 conclusions the results of this study suggest that topographic evolution in the catchment can generate mild differences in the runoff generation process in particular the early stages of runoff the onset of runoff is mostly affected the changes appear to be related to the smoothening of the surface and the subsequent changes in runoff connectivity on both hillslopes and to a certain extent in the rill network since the variations in the onset of runoff appear to be related to connectivity and ponding it is expected that with the re introduction of the missing hydrological processes in particular infiltration the effects of topographic evolution on surface flow to become amplified in terms of hydrological partitioning the results suggest that a catchment which is experiencing rather small topographic changes in the interrill surfaces and to a very small extent in the rill network the process of runoff generation can be affected by small scale surface features this points out to the importance of interrill microtopography and its effect on hydrological partitioning thompson et al 2010 mcgrath et al 2012 but as this study shows also in the transient states and the sequence of how runoff is produced the changes in the onset of runoff can be related to surface dynamic connectivity which allows to explain in a succinct way how the spatial distributions of runoff correlate and are likely responsible for features of the hydrograph moreover despite the relatively small topographic changes significant differences can be appreciated in the spatial distribution flow paths and connectivity of surface runoff thus implying that even such small topographic evolution can have impacts in the formation of morphological ecological and biogeochemical hotspots additionally the results show that mesh resolution can have a significant impact on the runoff signatures and flow fields the poor representation of terrain features and inability of coarse meshes to capture the small scale processes involved manifests in a lower runoff connectivity which in turn manifests in runoff signatures as a delayed onset of runoff this numerical artifact is similar to and can overlap with that of a changing topography therefore highlighting the need of appropriate mesh selection to perform simulation based analysis of these systems in a broader outlook the artifacts introduced by computational resolution mimic the effects of field observations at different scales and the differences in connectivity from numerical resolution may also be analogous to scale dependent connectivity bracken et al 2013 the simplistic precipitations used in the majority of this study interact with mesh resolution to produce different signatures coarser meshes show a larger response variation when changing rainfall intensity interestingly the signatures response to topographic evolution seems to be relatively insensitive to rain intensity and intrastorm rainfall distribution this suggests that the expected effects of topographic evolution on catchment hydrodynamics are very weakly dependent on rainfall properties this may only be true in the absence of infiltration since morphological features can in fact amplify or reduce infiltration this remains to be studied systematically the results in this work highlight the fact that a deep understanding of catchment dynamics through computational modelling requires a systematic approach as multiple physical processes and numerical artifacts interact overlap and may dominate the indicators and signatures used to characterize and evaluate the response topographical effects may be completely drowned by numerical artifacts from the mesh and the emerging interactions between topography rainfall distribution and heterogeneous infiltration are not easy to untangle and in fact modelling is perhaps the only approach which allows to explore it the natural continuation of this work is to therefore explore the role of these interactions and whether or not the behavior of signatures observed in this work are amplified or simply completely overrun by other responses this has been pointed out as an evermore relevant issue in hydrology jencso and mcglynn 2011 this work is consistent in offering outlook towards further exploration of the effects of evolving catchment properties such as vegetation cover donohue et al 2007 birkel et al 2012 climate li et al 2012 and infiltration horton 1931 shuster et al 2007 on hydrological processes conflict of interest

6553,tree ring reconstructions of streamflow can provide long term perspectives of flow variability that may be useful in management strategies for water resources relative to other portions of the united states there is a dearth of tree ring based streamflow reconstructions in the midwest the wabash river is an important water resource in indiana and illinois where many sectors rely on it here to better understand the historic hydroclimate within the wabash river basin we reconstructed june september streamflow for a tributary of the wabash river using three statistical approaches the traditional basin approach and the recently developed climate footprint and drought reconstruction approaches our reconstructions explained 53 71 of the variance for the common period 1941 1984 we find that in our three reconstructions there are extreme droughts and pluvials that exceed those during the instrumental period including a sustained five decade low flow event in the early 19th century overall we find that the traditional basin approach produced the most robust model but had the shortest reconstruction length of the three approaches as it requires the predictor chronologies to be derived from within the basin our results indicate that there are merits and drawbacks to each approach with the general pattern of sacrificing variance explained for reconstruction length keywords dendrochronology midwest united states drought pluvial streamflow 1 introduction the wabash river is the largest river in the state of indiana united states us and is a key resource in the ohio river valley the wabash supplies water to many local sources including the energy production sector municipalities agricultural applications as well as other miscellaneous users recent data show an increase in usage across all of these sectors wiener et al 2016 beyond supplying water to these sectors the wabash river also plays host to 50 of the endangered species within the state of indiana simon 2006 despite its role as a key area of biodiversity in the region the wabash river has already experienced extirpations and range reductions of species due to flow alterations simon 2006 given the regional importance of the wabash river and the uncertainty regarding how changing climate will affect water resources in the future understanding the historical range of streamflow variability is important for resource managers of the wabash river currently water resource managers rely on temporally short records of streamflow to inform management policies these short 30 100 years records often do not convey the full variability of streamflow for a given river the limited perspective of extreme events droughts and pluvials afforded by these temporally short records can hinder water managers ability to plan for events that may fall outside of this range in the future tree ring reconstructions of streamflow offer perspectives of hydroclimate that can extend our knowledge of streamflow variability beyond the typically short instrumental record to date much attention has been given to reconstructing streamflow in the arid western us as water is a critical but often scarce resource in this region e g stockton and jacoby 1976 meko and graybill 1995 meko et al 2001 woodhouse et al 2006 margolis et al 2011 harley and maxwell 2018 however several recent efforts have focused on the historical discharge of rivers in the less arid central and eastern regions of the us emphasizing the need for further attention to studying streamflow in mesic environments beyond the temporally short records provided by agencies such as the united states geologic survey usgs cook and jacoby 1983 maxwell et al 2011 2017 harley et al 2017 these reconstructions often extend centuries prior to instrumental measurements offering a greater context of streamflow to resource managers which can contribute to more informed policies than those relying solely on the instrumental record of streamflow due to extensive anthropogenic alteration of streamflow in the region e g dredging diversions dams and the general availability of water resources there have been few undertakings of reconstructing streamflow in the midwestern us with only one known example from the missouri river basin ho et al 2016 in this paper we evaluate the efficacy of different streamflow reconstruction approaches in the midwestern us by comparing the customary approach of reconstructing streamflow using tree ring samples within the basin with two reconstruction approaches that have emerged more recently we examine the feasibility of using the climate footprint approach harley et al 2017 maxwell et al 2017 and the drought reconstruction approach ho et al 2016 2017 in the midwestern us due to anthropogenic influences throughout most of the wabash river we reconstruct streamflow for the embarras river a less anthropogenically impacted major tributary of the wabash basin fig 1 to better understand hydroclimatic patterns within the basin prior to initial streamflow measurements 2 data and methods 2 1 streamflow data we compiled mean monthly streamflow data for the north fork of the embarras river near oblong il usgs gauge 03346000 39 010042 n 87 945588 w as it offered a record of adequate length for model calibration and validation 44 years contained no missing data and was not characterized by high levels of anthropogenic influence this tributary is included in the usgs hydroclimatic data network hcdn a subset of gauges shown to be minimally impacted by anthropogenic factors slack and landwehr 1994 acquiring records that do not have an anthropogenic signal is paramount for reconstructions of streamflow that use tree rings to ensure that stream gauges were not affected by the heavily modified landscape that characterizes the region we relied on streamflow data from the hcdn in the wabash river basin which limited our options as many larger rivers are influenced by historical land use and other anthropogenic modifications we chose the embarras river gauge because 1 it was one of two gauges in the wabash river basin that met the hcdn criteria 2 it had the longest record of the two gauges and 3 it was significantly correlated with wabash river streamflow 1941 2009 r 0 42 p 0 01 given the anthropogenic influences on the wabash river streamflow we considered a correlation coefficient of 0 42 adequate to establish the similarities between the two rivers using records from the hcdn ensured that streamflow variability was predominantly influenced by natural factors e g climate and baseflow therefore the trees used for the reconstruction and the streamflow were responding to the same climatic variability the embarras river flows approximately 314 km from its headwaters in southern illinois to its point of confluence with the wabash river on the border of indiana and illinois illinois dnr 2018 climatologically the embarras river is characterized by peak flow centered on early spring march with the corresponding lowest flow occurring during the end of the growing season august november fig 2 a during the full instrumental period 1941 2009 we see numerous drought and pluvial events of varying degrees fig 2b 2 2 basin approach one established approach to reconstructing streamflow relies on the principle that precipitation that falls within the drainage basin of a river has a similar influence on both the radial growth of trees within that basin and its streamflow with the common influence of precipitation on both streamflow and tree growth we can use the radial growth of moisture sensitive trees as a proxy for streamflow stockton and jacoby 1976 meko and graybill 1995 woodhouse 2001 therefore we use tree ring chronologies that fall within the wabash river basin as potential predictors of streamflow for the basin reconstruction approach in the basin approach tree ring chronologies are drawn primarily from a multispecies network of published chronologies maxwell et al 2015 maxwell 2016 maxwell and harley 2017 wilde and maxwell 2018 and newly sampled sites within the wabash river basin fig 1 table 1 for the newly sampled sites we sampled mature individuals of targeted species that were identified by morphologic characteristics indicative of old trees pederson 2010 selected trees were sampled at breast height with 4 3 mm increment borers speer 2010 to limit the presence of reactionary wood growth in the samples trees were sampled parallel to any detectable slope with two radii of growth collected according to standard sampling procedures speer 2010 for the purposes of this study we produced 11 new moisture sensitive chronologies in indiana and illinois table 1 in addition to newly sampled sites we updated four existing chronologies from the international tree ring data bank itrdb that fell within the wabash river basin https www ncdc noaa gov data access paleoclimatology data datasets tree ring once collected samples were processed according to standard dendrochronological practices stokes and smiley 1968 using the list method we visually crossdated the samples yamaguchi 1991 once visually crossdated each of the series in the chronologies were then measured with a velmex stage with 0 001 mm precision using the program measurej2x voorhees 2000 we statistically crossdated the chronologies using the program cofecha holmes 1983 to ensure that each ring width measurement corresponded to the correct calendar year by examining interseries correlation coefficients 2 2 1 standardization of predictors while radial growth of trees records important hydroclimate variables in the closed canopy systems of the eastern us annual growth is also influenced by non climatic variables cook and peters 1981 we removed the non climatic influences including forest disturbances and age related growth trends using the program arstan cook 1985 to standardize predictors and allow for synchrony across all samples we fitted a smoothing spline that incorporated a 50 frequency response equal to two thirds 67 the length of each series cook and peters 1981 to the raw radial growth series of each tree standardized unit less series were created by dividing the raw ring width by the spline value for each year we then used a tukey s biweight robust mean of each standardized tree ring series to create a site based chronology of standardized width indices swi for each site and species cook and kairiukstis 2013 bunn et al 2016 standardized chronologies comprised of swi were then screened using a correlation analysis with streamflow during the common period 1941 1984 to determine which swis could be used in the streamflow reconstruction models fig 3 2 2 2 model development the swis that were significantly p 0 01 correlated to streamflow were then used as predictors of streamflow in a principal components regression model meko 1997 fig 3 prior to screening predictors we had a predictor pool comprised of the 36 chronologies sampled within the wabash river basin as well as lagged chronologies that allowed for climate to influence the following year t 1 for each chronology to account for the impact of antecedent conditions on tree growth fritts 1976 giving us a total of 72 potential predictors to determine the season of streamflow captured by the radial growth of trees in the drainage basin we performed correlation analyses with varying seasons and months between swis and embarras river streamflow we found that the seasonal average of june september streamflow exhibited the strongest correlation to the annual growth of trees within the basin indicating that this was the seasonality of streamflow represented by the annual growth of trees additionally streamflow was not normally distributed as indicated by a kolmogorov smirnov test and therefore we used a log10 transform of streamflow for the reconstruction following the screening of tree ring chronologies 42 chronologies t and t 1 comprised of 12 species were retained in the predictor pool to inform the reconstruction model to avoid multicollinearity in the model we combined the signal from the multiple chronologies using principal component analysis in the program pcreg http www ldeo columbia edu tree ring laboratory resources software using the correlation matrix of the screened chronologies the first n eigenvectors with an eigenvalue greater than one were retained and used as predictors of streamflow in the nested models to determine the final subset of pcs in the regression model we used the akaike information criterion aic to help with overfitting the model akaike 1974 this process was repeated for prescribed 25 year intervals or nests to form the reconstructions meko 1997 the first nest was the common period 1941 1984 with the following nest being an irregular length to allow subsequent nests fall on quarter century years e g 1925 1950 etc to ensure that each chronology had adequate sample depth to be retained in the model through each nest we followed the procedure outlined in maxwell et al 2017 and harley et al 2017 and withdrew chronologies from the pool of predictors when they exhibited an expressed population signal 0 80 wigley et al 1984 this measure is to ensure that variance in the reconstruction is not affected by chronologies comprised of few series 2 2 3 calibration and validation of models to assess the temporal stability of each nested model of the reconstruction we used a split sample calibration and validation approach common in dendroclimatic reconstructions the common period between the streamflow data 1941 2010 and the tree ring samples within the basin 1674 2004 was 1941 to 2004 however to more accurately evaluate the different reconstruction approaches we used the same common period from the approach with the shortest span climate footprint approach section 2 3 giving us a common period of 1941 1984 the climate footprint approach has the shortest common period due to the incorporation of itrdb chronologies that have not been recently updated for each nest we separated the instrumental period into two 22 year halves with one half used to calibrate a model that would then be used to predict values of the second half and then the process was reversed with the second half being used to inform a model to predict the first half we performed this calibration and validation technique for each nested model to ensure that as we go further back into time and subsequently lose chronologies from the predictor pool our model is still performing with good skill using common validation statistics see section 2 5 2 3 climate footprint approach compared to the western us the ohio valley has fewer sites where moisture sensitive trees have been sampled therefore methods that incorporate sites from outside the basin may provide additional predictive ability for streamflow reconstructions the climate footprint approach e g harley et al 2017 maxwell et al 2017 is one such method that uses the inherent relationship between radial tree growth and precipitation to potentially improve model performance by incorporating chronologies that may fall outside of the drainage basin but still experience similar climatic conditions to determine areas outside of the drainage basin that experienced similar climatic conditions to those within the basin we correlated a gridded 0 5 0 5 monthly precipitation field cru ts 4 01 harris et al 2014 with the streamflow of the embarras river for june september season of highest correlation between tree growth and streamflow from 1941 to 2010 common period between the datasets fig 4 this correlation analysis provided the footprint from which we identified additional tree ring chronologies for predictors of streamflow that fell outside of the basin we only considered chronologies collected within gridpoints where precipitation was significantly p value 0 05 correlated to embarras river streamflow with a pearson s correlation coefficient r 0 50 in addition to using the within basin chronologies that fell within the climate footprint fig 4 we also incorporated chronologies from the itrdb guyette 1996 cook 2002 duvick 2002a b c d e stahle et al 2002 speer et al 2010 guyette and stambaugh 2016 table 1s that fell within the aforementioned footprint these chronologies were downloaded as raw ring width data from the itrdb to allow for consistent standardization for all chronologies our initial pool of predictors prior to screening consisted of 84 chronologies of 14 species including the lag 1 chronologies described in the basin approach upon screening the predictors we retained 46 chronologies for the initial principal component regression model for this approach we followed the same standardization model development and model validation procedures as the basin approach 2 4 drought reconstruction approach the drought reconstruction approach uses a reconstruction of palmer meteorological drought index pmdi drawn from the living blended drought atlas lbda cook et al 2010 as predictors of streamflow the lbda is an update of the north american drought atlas cook and krusic 2004 and is a gridded 0 5 0 5 resolution reconstruction of summer june august pmdi this dataset uses tree ring chronologies within a 450 km radius of each grid point to reconstruct pmdi across the conterminous us the initial study by ho et al 2016 reconstructed streamflow for multiple streamflow gauges within the missouri river basin for predictors of their regression model they used both regularized canonical correlation analysis rcca to transform reconstructed pmdi data from grid points within a 450 km radius of the streamflow gauge as well as retained principal components from the lbda at the scale of the conterminous us given the size of the missouri river basin retaining pcs from the entire continental us may help to explain more variance across the basin given that the size of the wabash river basin and the embarras river is less expansive we chose to rely on pmdi data from the grid point reconstructions falling within a 450 km radius from the embarras river streamflow gauge which are then subjected to screening and principal component analysis pca following the same methodology of the basin and climate footprint approaches we used pca to create a reconstruction model rather than rcca to facilitate comparisons to the basin and climate footprint approaches we then screened our initial predictor pool 256 grid points within 450 km of the embarras river gauge to limit our predictors to reconstruction grid points that are significantly correlated p 0 01 to june september streamflow for the embarras river with a correlation coefficient r 0 50 this screening produced a predictor pool of 107 grid points which were then subjected to pca to reduce the dimensions of the predictors we used the pcs with eigenvalues 1 as predictors in a multiple regression of streamflow rather than use the nested model approach outlined in the basin and climate footprint approaches we use one model that spans until 1510 as all of our predictors are the same length and no additional variance is explained by using a nested approach 2 5 comparison of approaches to gauge the performance of the models we used common model fit and performance metrics coefficient of determination r 2 the coefficient of efficiency ce nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the reduction of error re fritts 1976 both re and ce evaluate the closeness of reconstructed values of streamflow to measured values of streamflow over the common period with minor differences in how they determine model accuracy both of these metrics range from to 1 a model that has positive values of re and ce is considered to have predictive skill with values closer to one indicating better predictive skill than those closer to zero once a nest fails to have positive values of re or ce it is not considered to have adequate skill in predicting streamflow and is where our reconstructions end we also evaluated the respective reconstructions over the common period with the instrumental streamflow data here 1941 1984 ce we examined the r 2 of each model to evaluate their relative performance as well as the root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae which is a more reliable measure of mean model performance willmott and matsuura 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 basin approach the basin approach for the june september streamflow reconstruction spanned 235 years from 1750 to 1984 ce fig 5 the reconstruction was comprised of one nest for the common period 1941 1984 between the instrumental streamflow data and the tree ring chronologies which explained 71 of the variance for mean june september embarras river discharge table 2 and eight 25 year nests that extend back in time to 1750 our nested models calibrated and verified until the 1725 1749 ce nest table 3 where the model produced a negative verification ce statistic indicating that the model was not reconstructing streamflow with skill the model was comprised of nests using between one and six principal component predictors and consistently explained approximately 60 of variance for the instrumental period across the nested models 3 2 climate footprint approach the climate footprint approach resulted in a reconstruction of june september streamflow that spanned 285 years from 1700 to 1984 fig 5 this reconstruction was comprised of one common period nest from 1941 to 1984 and ten 25 year nests extending backwards in time the nested models produced satisfactory calibration and verification statistics until the 1675 1699 ce nest table 3 where the verification period returned a negative value for the ce the nest spanning the common period 1941 1984 produced a model that explained 68 of the variance over this period table 2 the reconstruction model nests used between one and six principal component predictors and consistently explained 63 of the variance through the 1774 1750 nest the two subsequent nests explained 54 and 47 of the variance for the instrumental period illustrating the declining performance of the model as fewer chronologies were available to predict streamflow 3 3 drought reconstruction approach the drought reconstruction approach produced a reconstruction with a length of 476 years 1510 1985 fig 5 the reconstruction was comprised of one model that spanned the entire reconstruction length this model was comprised of one nest which used 4 principal component predictors and explained 53 of the variance for embarras river streamflow over the common period table 2 the length of this reconstruction was dictated by the lbda and could therefore be extended further back than 1510 however for the comparative nature of this study we chose to end the reconstruction at the year 1510 in accordance with ho et al 2016 3 4 evaluating model performance during the common period based on the measures of model performance table 2 the basin approach represented streamflow the best with the climate footprint approach performing superior to the drought reconstruction approach in terms of r 2 and rmse respectively for the log transformed streamflow values both the basin 0 71 and 0 32 and climate footprint 0 68 and 0 33 approaches were similar in performance while the drought reconstruction 0 53 and 0 38 was considerably lower table 2 mae which weights errors equally showed less discrepancies between the three reconstruction approaches 0 27 0 28 0 30 for the basin climate footprint and drought reconstruction approaches respectively but exhibited a similar pattern of the basin approach performing the best with the climate footprint performing better than the drought reconstruction approach the discrepancies between the three approaches were apparent when compared to instrumental streamflow over the common period fig 6 though no systematic over or under prediction was noted for the three approaches we did notice a pattern of systematic failure to predict streamflow at high and low amplitudes by the drought reconstruction approach when evaluating model performance based on the back transformed streamflow values m3s 1 we found that in terms of rmse and mae the ranking of model performance shifts where the basin approach was the best performing model with log transformed values the drought reconstruction approach appeared to perform best once reconstructed streamflow values were transformed to meaningful units m3s 1 table 2 upon examining scatterplots of observed vs predicted streamflow fig 7 we found that in the log scale the drought reconstruction approach had its largest discrepancies when predicting low values while the basin and climate footprint approaches had larger discrepancies when predicting high values when we back transformed the reconstructions to m3s 1 the discrepancies for high values became amplified more than lower values as is characteristic of the log scale 3 5 model agreement for droughts and pluvials our comparative approach to reconstructing embarras river streamflow resulted in models that have different variance explained and model performance statistics but they do show agreement for high and low flow events among each other each model appears to represent a sustained low flow 50 year period from 1800 to 1850 fig 5 the basin climate footprint and drought reconstruction approaches have means over this period of 0 95 1 02 and 1 13 m3s 1 respectively whereas the instrumental mean is 2 01 m 3 s 1 as a result this sustained drought period is characterized by streamflow that is 47 51 and 56 of the instrumental mean for the respective approaches the length of this sustained low flow period is five decades and surpasses any continuous low flow periods during the instrumental period other streamflow studies in parts of the eastern us also have sustained sub mean flow that falls within this period in their reconstruction of the potomac river from 950 to 2001 maxwell et al 2011 also show low flow from 1800 to 1820 but have higher than average flow from 1830 to 1850 additionally a later study maxwell et al 2017 reconstructs streamflow in three eastern rivers using the climate footprint approach and this sustained low flow period is present in the potomac river reconstruction additionally a reconstruction of precipitation for iowa and illinois blasing and duvick 1984 shows several dry periods during this time but interspersed with less dry years our three reconstructions also produce periods of high flow that are in agreement with each other the period of 1775 1785 produces peaks of high flow in each of the three reconstructions fig 5 in the basin and climate footprint approaches we see exceptionally high flow exceeding any event during the observed period in intensity the similar peak in these two reconstructions is unsurprising as there is considerable overlap with 34 of 48 chronologies in the climate footprint approach also in the basin approach we see a corresponding peak in the in the drought reconstruction approach though not of such magnitude as in the basin and climate footprint approaches similarly a reconstruction of pdsi in the ohio river valley maxwell and harley 2017 show elevated moisture during the period where we see these peaks in streamflow but many chronologies used in that reconstruction are also used in the basin and climate footprint models used here so this corroboration is expected 3 6 embarras river reconstructions in context of preceding studies the basin approach has been a staple of tree ring based reconstructions of streamflow in the western us where open canopy forests in an arid environment dominate the landscape the basin approach has been used to reconstruct streamflow for a variety of basins stockton and jacoby 1976 meko and graybill 1995 woodhouse et al 2006 meko et al 2007 trees within these basins are often long lived and moisture sensitive producing models that often explain 60 of the variance over the instrumental period sometimes with a small pool of chronologies informing the model meko et al 2007 with some reconstructions explaining as much as 81 the variance over the instrumental period woodhouse et al 2006 using the basin approach we produced a streamflow reconstruction that explained 71 of variance for the instrumental period placing it within the range of basin model performance results in the western us the basin approach has also been used to reconstruct streamflow in the eastern us cook and jacoby 1983 maxwell et al 2011 devineni et al 2013 in these studies r2 values are typically 0 5 showing a slight decrease in the fit of the model with regard to the observed streamflow compared to studies in the western us though our model produced higher r2 values for the basin approach than preceding streamflow studies in the eastern us it should be noted that this is a relative measure of model fit rather than model performance on independent observations cook and jacoby 1983 though less established than the basin approach the climate footprint approach has been used in recent studies and shows promise for extending records of streamflow in areas where moisture sensitive tree ring chronologies are sparse harley et al 2017 maxwell et al 2017 though an imperfect metric to compare the performance of models we use r2 values to place our climate footprint approach reconstruction in context of the studies that initially used the approach as it is the most widely reported model statistic the reconstruction of the suwannee river harley et al 2017 produced a 455 year reconstruction that explained 68 of the variance for the calibration period a later study maxwell et al 2017 produced three reconstructions of streamflow along a latitudinal gradient along the east coast these reconstructions explained between 40 and 61 of the variance for their respective calibration periods maxwell et al 2017 our model using the climate footprint approach produced a reconstruction spanning 285 years that explained 68 of the variance for the instrumental period placing our reconstruction at the upper limit of previous models using this approach the climate footprint has only been compared to the basin approach in one previous study of the potomac river and considerable improvement in both the length of reconstruction and variance explained was noted when using the climate footprint approach however these improvements cannot be attributed solely to the climate footprint approach as additional predictors were also available for this reconstruction maxwell et al 2017 in terms of improvement over the basin approach for our study area our reconstruction using the climate footprint approach produced a model that had similar albeit slightly lower variance explained 68 vs 71 but offered an additional 50 years of streamflow record because additional tree ring records from outside the basin were incorporated into the model to evaluate the benefits and tradeoffs of using the climate footprint approach over the basin approach further research should be undertaken to compare the relative performance in multiple basins with various characteristics including a range in drainage areas and streamflow the drought reconstruction approach has been used to reconstruct streamflow in two recent studies ho et al 2016 2017 the original study introduced the drought reconstruction approach in the missouri river basin and the subsequent study extended this approach to the rest of the conterminous us reconstructing streamflow on the regional scale for the initial study 55 models with r2 values ranging from 0 56 to 0 90 were produced for streamflow stations within the missouri river basin our model based on the drought reconstruction approach produced a reconstruction with r2 value of 0 53 placing it slightly below the streamflow stations reconstructed by ho et al 2016 3 7 extension of reconstruction and model performance for our study site we found a distinct relationship between incorporating methods to extend our reconstruction and the performance of the model the basin approach produced the shortest reconstruction 235 years compared to lengths of 285 and 476 years for the climate footprint and drought reconstruction approaches respectively but had the highest r2 value at 0 71 the climate footprint approach produced the second longest reconstruction and had the second highest r2 value at 0 68 our longest reconstruction was produced by the drought reconstruction approach but this reconstruction had the lowest r2 of the three with a value of 0 53 we see the same pattern for rmse and mae with regard to the length of the reconstruction for the reconstructed log transformed streamflow ho et al 2016 mentions that with some smaller drainage basins characterized by low baseflow in the missouri river basin the residuals do not appear to be normally distributed suggesting that the model is not performing well given the relatively small area and low average flow of the embarras river we propose that these may be contributing factors to the drought reconstruction approaches lower performance statistics rmse mae r2 in the log linear model further the lbda incorporates tree ring chronologies within a 450 km radius of each grid point cook et al 2010 therefore taking lbda reconstruction grid points from a 450 km radius of the streamflow gauge introduces many predictors that may fall well outside of the drainage basin given the performance statistics of the three models it appears that incorporating these predictors from well outside the basin potentially 900 km away captures more regional hydroclimate variability whereas the basin and climate footprint approaches are able to capture the more nuanced local variability this local variability is especially important for our study area as the reconstructed embarras river has a drainage basin area of 6 3x105 hectares making it considerably smaller than previous basins reconstructed with the drought reconstruction approach when taken into consideration this spatially small drainage basin likely contributes to the basin and climate footprint approaches performing better than the drought reconstruction in the log linear models chronologies further outside the basin such as those informing the lbda may not be tracking the hydroclimate immediately influencing the embarras river as well as chronologies more proximate to the basin given the findings of this study we believe that each of these approaches to reconstructing streamflow has its own strengths and weaknesses and therefore have some recommendations regarding their use for rivers characterized by low average streamflow and a corresponding small drainage basin the basin and climate footprint approaches appear to be well suited for streamflow reconstruction studies the basin approach in this case produced a model that explained more variance and had lower measures of error in the forms of rmse and mae for the log linear model the climate footprint approach is similar in performance statistics for the log linear model but with its incorporation of additional chronologies outside the basin is able to extend the record an additional 50 years in regions where moisture sensitive tree ring chronologies are sparse the climate footprint approach is helpful to extend records of streamflow variability when chronologies outside the basin are still closely coupled to the within basin hydroclimate the drought reconstruction approach appears to be best suited for large drainage basins e g missouri river basin with high average streamflow as suggested in the novel study that developed this approach ho et al 2016 and a subsequent study which extended it to other regions of the united states ho et al 2017 our findings support this notion as the muted variance in our reconstruction using this approach fig 5 appears to be an artifact of regional hydroclimate where peak high and low flows in the basin would become more muted when the model incorporated tree rings capturing climate on the regional scale the basin and climate footprint approaches however appear to be capturing hydroclimate more local to the streamflow gauge without being dampened by more general regional hydroclimate present in the lbda 4 conclusions in this study we reconstructed streamflow for the embarras river in the wabash river basin using three different tree ring based approaches these three reconstructions show the limited range of streamflow variability present in the instrumental period relative to longer timescales produced by our models managers relying on the instrumental period to inform management strategies may benefit from incorporating the extended perspective provided by these reconstructions we discovered a multi decadal low flow event that persisted at values 50 of the instrumental mean a reoccurrence of a sustained drought period such as this coupled with the increasing demand for water from the wabash river wiener et al 2016 could lead to shortages in available water if not addressed additionally we find synchronous high flow periods in our reconstructions that exceed any values in the instrumental period we were also able to evaluate the performance of the three reconstruction approaches basin climate footprint and drought reconstruction approaches against each other for the embarras river we found that in terms of model fit and performance statistics rmse r2 mae that the basin approach represented streamflow the best of the three approaches tested as a log linear model however the basin approach produced the shortest reconstruction only extending to 1750 the climate footprint approach had similar model fit and performance statistics table 2 to the basin approach but extended the record an additional 50 years farther than the basin approach the drought reconstruction approach produced the longest reconstruction but was also characterized by the worst model fit and performance statistics of the three approaches tested here in the log linear model considering the apparent relationship between methods to extend the reconstruction and the overall performance of the model in our basin we

6553,tree ring reconstructions of streamflow can provide long term perspectives of flow variability that may be useful in management strategies for water resources relative to other portions of the united states there is a dearth of tree ring based streamflow reconstructions in the midwest the wabash river is an important water resource in indiana and illinois where many sectors rely on it here to better understand the historic hydroclimate within the wabash river basin we reconstructed june september streamflow for a tributary of the wabash river using three statistical approaches the traditional basin approach and the recently developed climate footprint and drought reconstruction approaches our reconstructions explained 53 71 of the variance for the common period 1941 1984 we find that in our three reconstructions there are extreme droughts and pluvials that exceed those during the instrumental period including a sustained five decade low flow event in the early 19th century overall we find that the traditional basin approach produced the most robust model but had the shortest reconstruction length of the three approaches as it requires the predictor chronologies to be derived from within the basin our results indicate that there are merits and drawbacks to each approach with the general pattern of sacrificing variance explained for reconstruction length keywords dendrochronology midwest united states drought pluvial streamflow 1 introduction the wabash river is the largest river in the state of indiana united states us and is a key resource in the ohio river valley the wabash supplies water to many local sources including the energy production sector municipalities agricultural applications as well as other miscellaneous users recent data show an increase in usage across all of these sectors wiener et al 2016 beyond supplying water to these sectors the wabash river also plays host to 50 of the endangered species within the state of indiana simon 2006 despite its role as a key area of biodiversity in the region the wabash river has already experienced extirpations and range reductions of species due to flow alterations simon 2006 given the regional importance of the wabash river and the uncertainty regarding how changing climate will affect water resources in the future understanding the historical range of streamflow variability is important for resource managers of the wabash river currently water resource managers rely on temporally short records of streamflow to inform management policies these short 30 100 years records often do not convey the full variability of streamflow for a given river the limited perspective of extreme events droughts and pluvials afforded by these temporally short records can hinder water managers ability to plan for events that may fall outside of this range in the future tree ring reconstructions of streamflow offer perspectives of hydroclimate that can extend our knowledge of streamflow variability beyond the typically short instrumental record to date much attention has been given to reconstructing streamflow in the arid western us as water is a critical but often scarce resource in this region e g stockton and jacoby 1976 meko and graybill 1995 meko et al 2001 woodhouse et al 2006 margolis et al 2011 harley and maxwell 2018 however several recent efforts have focused on the historical discharge of rivers in the less arid central and eastern regions of the us emphasizing the need for further attention to studying streamflow in mesic environments beyond the temporally short records provided by agencies such as the united states geologic survey usgs cook and jacoby 1983 maxwell et al 2011 2017 harley et al 2017 these reconstructions often extend centuries prior to instrumental measurements offering a greater context of streamflow to resource managers which can contribute to more informed policies than those relying solely on the instrumental record of streamflow due to extensive anthropogenic alteration of streamflow in the region e g dredging diversions dams and the general availability of water resources there have been few undertakings of reconstructing streamflow in the midwestern us with only one known example from the missouri river basin ho et al 2016 in this paper we evaluate the efficacy of different streamflow reconstruction approaches in the midwestern us by comparing the customary approach of reconstructing streamflow using tree ring samples within the basin with two reconstruction approaches that have emerged more recently we examine the feasibility of using the climate footprint approach harley et al 2017 maxwell et al 2017 and the drought reconstruction approach ho et al 2016 2017 in the midwestern us due to anthropogenic influences throughout most of the wabash river we reconstruct streamflow for the embarras river a less anthropogenically impacted major tributary of the wabash basin fig 1 to better understand hydroclimatic patterns within the basin prior to initial streamflow measurements 2 data and methods 2 1 streamflow data we compiled mean monthly streamflow data for the north fork of the embarras river near oblong il usgs gauge 03346000 39 010042 n 87 945588 w as it offered a record of adequate length for model calibration and validation 44 years contained no missing data and was not characterized by high levels of anthropogenic influence this tributary is included in the usgs hydroclimatic data network hcdn a subset of gauges shown to be minimally impacted by anthropogenic factors slack and landwehr 1994 acquiring records that do not have an anthropogenic signal is paramount for reconstructions of streamflow that use tree rings to ensure that stream gauges were not affected by the heavily modified landscape that characterizes the region we relied on streamflow data from the hcdn in the wabash river basin which limited our options as many larger rivers are influenced by historical land use and other anthropogenic modifications we chose the embarras river gauge because 1 it was one of two gauges in the wabash river basin that met the hcdn criteria 2 it had the longest record of the two gauges and 3 it was significantly correlated with wabash river streamflow 1941 2009 r 0 42 p 0 01 given the anthropogenic influences on the wabash river streamflow we considered a correlation coefficient of 0 42 adequate to establish the similarities between the two rivers using records from the hcdn ensured that streamflow variability was predominantly influenced by natural factors e g climate and baseflow therefore the trees used for the reconstruction and the streamflow were responding to the same climatic variability the embarras river flows approximately 314 km from its headwaters in southern illinois to its point of confluence with the wabash river on the border of indiana and illinois illinois dnr 2018 climatologically the embarras river is characterized by peak flow centered on early spring march with the corresponding lowest flow occurring during the end of the growing season august november fig 2 a during the full instrumental period 1941 2009 we see numerous drought and pluvial events of varying degrees fig 2b 2 2 basin approach one established approach to reconstructing streamflow relies on the principle that precipitation that falls within the drainage basin of a river has a similar influence on both the radial growth of trees within that basin and its streamflow with the common influence of precipitation on both streamflow and tree growth we can use the radial growth of moisture sensitive trees as a proxy for streamflow stockton and jacoby 1976 meko and graybill 1995 woodhouse 2001 therefore we use tree ring chronologies that fall within the wabash river basin as potential predictors of streamflow for the basin reconstruction approach in the basin approach tree ring chronologies are drawn primarily from a multispecies network of published chronologies maxwell et al 2015 maxwell 2016 maxwell and harley 2017 wilde and maxwell 2018 and newly sampled sites within the wabash river basin fig 1 table 1 for the newly sampled sites we sampled mature individuals of targeted species that were identified by morphologic characteristics indicative of old trees pederson 2010 selected trees were sampled at breast height with 4 3 mm increment borers speer 2010 to limit the presence of reactionary wood growth in the samples trees were sampled parallel to any detectable slope with two radii of growth collected according to standard sampling procedures speer 2010 for the purposes of this study we produced 11 new moisture sensitive chronologies in indiana and illinois table 1 in addition to newly sampled sites we updated four existing chronologies from the international tree ring data bank itrdb that fell within the wabash river basin https www ncdc noaa gov data access paleoclimatology data datasets tree ring once collected samples were processed according to standard dendrochronological practices stokes and smiley 1968 using the list method we visually crossdated the samples yamaguchi 1991 once visually crossdated each of the series in the chronologies were then measured with a velmex stage with 0 001 mm precision using the program measurej2x voorhees 2000 we statistically crossdated the chronologies using the program cofecha holmes 1983 to ensure that each ring width measurement corresponded to the correct calendar year by examining interseries correlation coefficients 2 2 1 standardization of predictors while radial growth of trees records important hydroclimate variables in the closed canopy systems of the eastern us annual growth is also influenced by non climatic variables cook and peters 1981 we removed the non climatic influences including forest disturbances and age related growth trends using the program arstan cook 1985 to standardize predictors and allow for synchrony across all samples we fitted a smoothing spline that incorporated a 50 frequency response equal to two thirds 67 the length of each series cook and peters 1981 to the raw radial growth series of each tree standardized unit less series were created by dividing the raw ring width by the spline value for each year we then used a tukey s biweight robust mean of each standardized tree ring series to create a site based chronology of standardized width indices swi for each site and species cook and kairiukstis 2013 bunn et al 2016 standardized chronologies comprised of swi were then screened using a correlation analysis with streamflow during the common period 1941 1984 to determine which swis could be used in the streamflow reconstruction models fig 3 2 2 2 model development the swis that were significantly p 0 01 correlated to streamflow were then used as predictors of streamflow in a principal components regression model meko 1997 fig 3 prior to screening predictors we had a predictor pool comprised of the 36 chronologies sampled within the wabash river basin as well as lagged chronologies that allowed for climate to influence the following year t 1 for each chronology to account for the impact of antecedent conditions on tree growth fritts 1976 giving us a total of 72 potential predictors to determine the season of streamflow captured by the radial growth of trees in the drainage basin we performed correlation analyses with varying seasons and months between swis and embarras river streamflow we found that the seasonal average of june september streamflow exhibited the strongest correlation to the annual growth of trees within the basin indicating that this was the seasonality of streamflow represented by the annual growth of trees additionally streamflow was not normally distributed as indicated by a kolmogorov smirnov test and therefore we used a log10 transform of streamflow for the reconstruction following the screening of tree ring chronologies 42 chronologies t and t 1 comprised of 12 species were retained in the predictor pool to inform the reconstruction model to avoid multicollinearity in the model we combined the signal from the multiple chronologies using principal component analysis in the program pcreg http www ldeo columbia edu tree ring laboratory resources software using the correlation matrix of the screened chronologies the first n eigenvectors with an eigenvalue greater than one were retained and used as predictors of streamflow in the nested models to determine the final subset of pcs in the regression model we used the akaike information criterion aic to help with overfitting the model akaike 1974 this process was repeated for prescribed 25 year intervals or nests to form the reconstructions meko 1997 the first nest was the common period 1941 1984 with the following nest being an irregular length to allow subsequent nests fall on quarter century years e g 1925 1950 etc to ensure that each chronology had adequate sample depth to be retained in the model through each nest we followed the procedure outlined in maxwell et al 2017 and harley et al 2017 and withdrew chronologies from the pool of predictors when they exhibited an expressed population signal 0 80 wigley et al 1984 this measure is to ensure that variance in the reconstruction is not affected by chronologies comprised of few series 2 2 3 calibration and validation of models to assess the temporal stability of each nested model of the reconstruction we used a split sample calibration and validation approach common in dendroclimatic reconstructions the common period between the streamflow data 1941 2010 and the tree ring samples within the basin 1674 2004 was 1941 to 2004 however to more accurately evaluate the different reconstruction approaches we used the same common period from the approach with the shortest span climate footprint approach section 2 3 giving us a common period of 1941 1984 the climate footprint approach has the shortest common period due to the incorporation of itrdb chronologies that have not been recently updated for each nest we separated the instrumental period into two 22 year halves with one half used to calibrate a model that would then be used to predict values of the second half and then the process was reversed with the second half being used to inform a model to predict the first half we performed this calibration and validation technique for each nested model to ensure that as we go further back into time and subsequently lose chronologies from the predictor pool our model is still performing with good skill using common validation statistics see section 2 5 2 3 climate footprint approach compared to the western us the ohio valley has fewer sites where moisture sensitive trees have been sampled therefore methods that incorporate sites from outside the basin may provide additional predictive ability for streamflow reconstructions the climate footprint approach e g harley et al 2017 maxwell et al 2017 is one such method that uses the inherent relationship between radial tree growth and precipitation to potentially improve model performance by incorporating chronologies that may fall outside of the drainage basin but still experience similar climatic conditions to determine areas outside of the drainage basin that experienced similar climatic conditions to those within the basin we correlated a gridded 0 5 0 5 monthly precipitation field cru ts 4 01 harris et al 2014 with the streamflow of the embarras river for june september season of highest correlation between tree growth and streamflow from 1941 to 2010 common period between the datasets fig 4 this correlation analysis provided the footprint from which we identified additional tree ring chronologies for predictors of streamflow that fell outside of the basin we only considered chronologies collected within gridpoints where precipitation was significantly p value 0 05 correlated to embarras river streamflow with a pearson s correlation coefficient r 0 50 in addition to using the within basin chronologies that fell within the climate footprint fig 4 we also incorporated chronologies from the itrdb guyette 1996 cook 2002 duvick 2002a b c d e stahle et al 2002 speer et al 2010 guyette and stambaugh 2016 table 1s that fell within the aforementioned footprint these chronologies were downloaded as raw ring width data from the itrdb to allow for consistent standardization for all chronologies our initial pool of predictors prior to screening consisted of 84 chronologies of 14 species including the lag 1 chronologies described in the basin approach upon screening the predictors we retained 46 chronologies for the initial principal component regression model for this approach we followed the same standardization model development and model validation procedures as the basin approach 2 4 drought reconstruction approach the drought reconstruction approach uses a reconstruction of palmer meteorological drought index pmdi drawn from the living blended drought atlas lbda cook et al 2010 as predictors of streamflow the lbda is an update of the north american drought atlas cook and krusic 2004 and is a gridded 0 5 0 5 resolution reconstruction of summer june august pmdi this dataset uses tree ring chronologies within a 450 km radius of each grid point to reconstruct pmdi across the conterminous us the initial study by ho et al 2016 reconstructed streamflow for multiple streamflow gauges within the missouri river basin for predictors of their regression model they used both regularized canonical correlation analysis rcca to transform reconstructed pmdi data from grid points within a 450 km radius of the streamflow gauge as well as retained principal components from the lbda at the scale of the conterminous us given the size of the missouri river basin retaining pcs from the entire continental us may help to explain more variance across the basin given that the size of the wabash river basin and the embarras river is less expansive we chose to rely on pmdi data from the grid point reconstructions falling within a 450 km radius from the embarras river streamflow gauge which are then subjected to screening and principal component analysis pca following the same methodology of the basin and climate footprint approaches we used pca to create a reconstruction model rather than rcca to facilitate comparisons to the basin and climate footprint approaches we then screened our initial predictor pool 256 grid points within 450 km of the embarras river gauge to limit our predictors to reconstruction grid points that are significantly correlated p 0 01 to june september streamflow for the embarras river with a correlation coefficient r 0 50 this screening produced a predictor pool of 107 grid points which were then subjected to pca to reduce the dimensions of the predictors we used the pcs with eigenvalues 1 as predictors in a multiple regression of streamflow rather than use the nested model approach outlined in the basin and climate footprint approaches we use one model that spans until 1510 as all of our predictors are the same length and no additional variance is explained by using a nested approach 2 5 comparison of approaches to gauge the performance of the models we used common model fit and performance metrics coefficient of determination r 2 the coefficient of efficiency ce nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the reduction of error re fritts 1976 both re and ce evaluate the closeness of reconstructed values of streamflow to measured values of streamflow over the common period with minor differences in how they determine model accuracy both of these metrics range from to 1 a model that has positive values of re and ce is considered to have predictive skill with values closer to one indicating better predictive skill than those closer to zero once a nest fails to have positive values of re or ce it is not considered to have adequate skill in predicting streamflow and is where our reconstructions end we also evaluated the respective reconstructions over the common period with the instrumental streamflow data here 1941 1984 ce we examined the r 2 of each model to evaluate their relative performance as well as the root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae which is a more reliable measure of mean model performance willmott and matsuura 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 basin approach the basin approach for the june september streamflow reconstruction spanned 235 years from 1750 to 1984 ce fig 5 the reconstruction was comprised of one nest for the common period 1941 1984 between the instrumental streamflow data and the tree ring chronologies which explained 71 of the variance for mean june september embarras river discharge table 2 and eight 25 year nests that extend back in time to 1750 our nested models calibrated and verified until the 1725 1749 ce nest table 3 where the model produced a negative verification ce statistic indicating that the model was not reconstructing streamflow with skill the model was comprised of nests using between one and six principal component predictors and consistently explained approximately 60 of variance for the instrumental period across the nested models 3 2 climate footprint approach the climate footprint approach resulted in a reconstruction of june september streamflow that spanned 285 years from 1700 to 1984 fig 5 this reconstruction was comprised of one common period nest from 1941 to 1984 and ten 25 year nests extending backwards in time the nested models produced satisfactory calibration and verification statistics until the 1675 1699 ce nest table 3 where the verification period returned a negative value for the ce the nest spanning the common period 1941 1984 produced a model that explained 68 of the variance over this period table 2 the reconstruction model nests used between one and six principal component predictors and consistently explained 63 of the variance through the 1774 1750 nest the two subsequent nests explained 54 and 47 of the variance for the instrumental period illustrating the declining performance of the model as fewer chronologies were available to predict streamflow 3 3 drought reconstruction approach the drought reconstruction approach produced a reconstruction with a length of 476 years 1510 1985 fig 5 the reconstruction was comprised of one model that spanned the entire reconstruction length this model was comprised of one nest which used 4 principal component predictors and explained 53 of the variance for embarras river streamflow over the common period table 2 the length of this reconstruction was dictated by the lbda and could therefore be extended further back than 1510 however for the comparative nature of this study we chose to end the reconstruction at the year 1510 in accordance with ho et al 2016 3 4 evaluating model performance during the common period based on the measures of model performance table 2 the basin approach represented streamflow the best with the climate footprint approach performing superior to the drought reconstruction approach in terms of r 2 and rmse respectively for the log transformed streamflow values both the basin 0 71 and 0 32 and climate footprint 0 68 and 0 33 approaches were similar in performance while the drought reconstruction 0 53 and 0 38 was considerably lower table 2 mae which weights errors equally showed less discrepancies between the three reconstruction approaches 0 27 0 28 0 30 for the basin climate footprint and drought reconstruction approaches respectively but exhibited a similar pattern of the basin approach performing the best with the climate footprint performing better than the drought reconstruction approach the discrepancies between the three approaches were apparent when compared to instrumental streamflow over the common period fig 6 though no systematic over or under prediction was noted for the three approaches we did notice a pattern of systematic failure to predict streamflow at high and low amplitudes by the drought reconstruction approach when evaluating model performance based on the back transformed streamflow values m3s 1 we found that in terms of rmse and mae the ranking of model performance shifts where the basin approach was the best performing model with log transformed values the drought reconstruction approach appeared to perform best once reconstructed streamflow values were transformed to meaningful units m3s 1 table 2 upon examining scatterplots of observed vs predicted streamflow fig 7 we found that in the log scale the drought reconstruction approach had its largest discrepancies when predicting low values while the basin and climate footprint approaches had larger discrepancies when predicting high values when we back transformed the reconstructions to m3s 1 the discrepancies for high values became amplified more than lower values as is characteristic of the log scale 3 5 model agreement for droughts and pluvials our comparative approach to reconstructing embarras river streamflow resulted in models that have different variance explained and model performance statistics but they do show agreement for high and low flow events among each other each model appears to represent a sustained low flow 50 year period from 1800 to 1850 fig 5 the basin climate footprint and drought reconstruction approaches have means over this period of 0 95 1 02 and 1 13 m3s 1 respectively whereas the instrumental mean is 2 01 m 3 s 1 as a result this sustained drought period is characterized by streamflow that is 47 51 and 56 of the instrumental mean for the respective approaches the length of this sustained low flow period is five decades and surpasses any continuous low flow periods during the instrumental period other streamflow studies in parts of the eastern us also have sustained sub mean flow that falls within this period in their reconstruction of the potomac river from 950 to 2001 maxwell et al 2011 also show low flow from 1800 to 1820 but have higher than average flow from 1830 to 1850 additionally a later study maxwell et al 2017 reconstructs streamflow in three eastern rivers using the climate footprint approach and this sustained low flow period is present in the potomac river reconstruction additionally a reconstruction of precipitation for iowa and illinois blasing and duvick 1984 shows several dry periods during this time but interspersed with less dry years our three reconstructions also produce periods of high flow that are in agreement with each other the period of 1775 1785 produces peaks of high flow in each of the three reconstructions fig 5 in the basin and climate footprint approaches we see exceptionally high flow exceeding any event during the observed period in intensity the similar peak in these two reconstructions is unsurprising as there is considerable overlap with 34 of 48 chronologies in the climate footprint approach also in the basin approach we see a corresponding peak in the in the drought reconstruction approach though not of such magnitude as in the basin and climate footprint approaches similarly a reconstruction of pdsi in the ohio river valley maxwell and harley 2017 show elevated moisture during the period where we see these peaks in streamflow but many chronologies used in that reconstruction are also used in the basin and climate footprint models used here so this corroboration is expected 3 6 embarras river reconstructions in context of preceding studies the basin approach has been a staple of tree ring based reconstructions of streamflow in the western us where open canopy forests in an arid environment dominate the landscape the basin approach has been used to reconstruct streamflow for a variety of basins stockton and jacoby 1976 meko and graybill 1995 woodhouse et al 2006 meko et al 2007 trees within these basins are often long lived and moisture sensitive producing models that often explain 60 of the variance over the instrumental period sometimes with a small pool of chronologies informing the model meko et al 2007 with some reconstructions explaining as much as 81 the variance over the instrumental period woodhouse et al 2006 using the basin approach we produced a streamflow reconstruction that explained 71 of variance for the instrumental period placing it within the range of basin model performance results in the western us the basin approach has also been used to reconstruct streamflow in the eastern us cook and jacoby 1983 maxwell et al 2011 devineni et al 2013 in these studies r2 values are typically 0 5 showing a slight decrease in the fit of the model with regard to the observed streamflow compared to studies in the western us though our model produced higher r2 values for the basin approach than preceding streamflow studies in the eastern us it should be noted that this is a relative measure of model fit rather than model performance on independent observations cook and jacoby 1983 though less established than the basin approach the climate footprint approach has been used in recent studies and shows promise for extending records of streamflow in areas where moisture sensitive tree ring chronologies are sparse harley et al 2017 maxwell et al 2017 though an imperfect metric to compare the performance of models we use r2 values to place our climate footprint approach reconstruction in context of the studies that initially used the approach as it is the most widely reported model statistic the reconstruction of the suwannee river harley et al 2017 produced a 455 year reconstruction that explained 68 of the variance for the calibration period a later study maxwell et al 2017 produced three reconstructions of streamflow along a latitudinal gradient along the east coast these reconstructions explained between 40 and 61 of the variance for their respective calibration periods maxwell et al 2017 our model using the climate footprint approach produced a reconstruction spanning 285 years that explained 68 of the variance for the instrumental period placing our reconstruction at the upper limit of previous models using this approach the climate footprint has only been compared to the basin approach in one previous study of the potomac river and considerable improvement in both the length of reconstruction and variance explained was noted when using the climate footprint approach however these improvements cannot be attributed solely to the climate footprint approach as additional predictors were also available for this reconstruction maxwell et al 2017 in terms of improvement over the basin approach for our study area our reconstruction using the climate footprint approach produced a model that had similar albeit slightly lower variance explained 68 vs 71 but offered an additional 50 years of streamflow record because additional tree ring records from outside the basin were incorporated into the model to evaluate the benefits and tradeoffs of using the climate footprint approach over the basin approach further research should be undertaken to compare the relative performance in multiple basins with various characteristics including a range in drainage areas and streamflow the drought reconstruction approach has been used to reconstruct streamflow in two recent studies ho et al 2016 2017 the original study introduced the drought reconstruction approach in the missouri river basin and the subsequent study extended this approach to the rest of the conterminous us reconstructing streamflow on the regional scale for the initial study 55 models with r2 values ranging from 0 56 to 0 90 were produced for streamflow stations within the missouri river basin our model based on the drought reconstruction approach produced a reconstruction with r2 value of 0 53 placing it slightly below the streamflow stations reconstructed by ho et al 2016 3 7 extension of reconstruction and model performance for our study site we found a distinct relationship between incorporating methods to extend our reconstruction and the performance of the model the basin approach produced the shortest reconstruction 235 years compared to lengths of 285 and 476 years for the climate footprint and drought reconstruction approaches respectively but had the highest r2 value at 0 71 the climate footprint approach produced the second longest reconstruction and had the second highest r2 value at 0 68 our longest reconstruction was produced by the drought reconstruction approach but this reconstruction had the lowest r2 of the three with a value of 0 53 we see the same pattern for rmse and mae with regard to the length of the reconstruction for the reconstructed log transformed streamflow ho et al 2016 mentions that with some smaller drainage basins characterized by low baseflow in the missouri river basin the residuals do not appear to be normally distributed suggesting that the model is not performing well given the relatively small area and low average flow of the embarras river we propose that these may be contributing factors to the drought reconstruction approaches lower performance statistics rmse mae r2 in the log linear model further the lbda incorporates tree ring chronologies within a 450 km radius of each grid point cook et al 2010 therefore taking lbda reconstruction grid points from a 450 km radius of the streamflow gauge introduces many predictors that may fall well outside of the drainage basin given the performance statistics of the three models it appears that incorporating these predictors from well outside the basin potentially 900 km away captures more regional hydroclimate variability whereas the basin and climate footprint approaches are able to capture the more nuanced local variability this local variability is especially important for our study area as the reconstructed embarras river has a drainage basin area of 6 3x105 hectares making it considerably smaller than previous basins reconstructed with the drought reconstruction approach when taken into consideration this spatially small drainage basin likely contributes to the basin and climate footprint approaches performing better than the drought reconstruction in the log linear models chronologies further outside the basin such as those informing the lbda may not be tracking the hydroclimate immediately influencing the embarras river as well as chronologies more proximate to the basin given the findings of this study we believe that each of these approaches to reconstructing streamflow has its own strengths and weaknesses and therefore have some recommendations regarding their use for rivers characterized by low average streamflow and a corresponding small drainage basin the basin and climate footprint approaches appear to be well suited for streamflow reconstruction studies the basin approach in this case produced a model that explained more variance and had lower measures of error in the forms of rmse and mae for the log linear model the climate footprint approach is similar in performance statistics for the log linear model but with its incorporation of additional chronologies outside the basin is able to extend the record an additional 50 years in regions where moisture sensitive tree ring chronologies are sparse the climate footprint approach is helpful to extend records of streamflow variability when chronologies outside the basin are still closely coupled to the within basin hydroclimate the drought reconstruction approach appears to be best suited for large drainage basins e g missouri river basin with high average streamflow as suggested in the novel study that developed this approach ho et al 2016 and a subsequent study which extended it to other regions of the united states ho et al 2017 our findings support this notion as the muted variance in our reconstruction using this approach fig 5 appears to be an artifact of regional hydroclimate where peak high and low flows in the basin would become more muted when the model incorporated tree rings capturing climate on the regional scale the basin and climate footprint approaches however appear to be capturing hydroclimate more local to the streamflow gauge without being dampened by more general regional hydroclimate present in the lbda 4 conclusions in this study we reconstructed streamflow for the embarras river in the wabash river basin using three different tree ring based approaches these three reconstructions show the limited range of streamflow variability present in the instrumental period relative to longer timescales produced by our models managers relying on the instrumental period to inform management strategies may benefit from incorporating the extended perspective provided by these reconstructions we discovered a multi decadal low flow event that persisted at values 50 of the instrumental mean a reoccurrence of a sustained drought period such as this coupled with the increasing demand for water from the wabash river wiener et al 2016 could lead to shortages in available water if not addressed additionally we find synchronous high flow periods in our reconstructions that exceed any values in the instrumental period we were also able to evaluate the performance of the three reconstruction approaches basin climate footprint and drought reconstruction approaches against each other for the embarras river we found that in terms of model fit and performance statistics rmse r2 mae that the basin approach represented streamflow the best of the three approaches tested as a log linear model however the basin approach produced the shortest reconstruction only extending to 1750 the climate footprint approach had similar model fit and performance statistics table 2 to the basin approach but extended the record an additional 50 years farther than the basin approach the drought reconstruction approach produced the longest reconstruction but was also characterized by the worst model fit and performance statistics

6554,the quantitative estimation of the quick flow runoff component of streamflow is required for many hydrologic applications estimation at the monthly timescale and national spatial scale would be particularly useful for national water availability modeling this paper reviews a sample of commonly used equations for quick flow runoff including several currently in use in continental scale models the review shows the wide range of equation forms or heuristics currently in use to predict quick flow runoff the limited spatial scale over which these equations are often developed or calibrated and the scarcity of well tested equations available for quick flow runoff at the monthly timescale data were gathered from a set of 1301 gaged watersheds across the united states to test a range of equations from the literature along with several alternative equations to assess and compare their performance in predicting quick flow runoff at the monthly timescale the highest performing equation was selected for application to monthly maps of explanatory variables to produce monthly quick flow runoff water budget contribution maps this equation is a regression against precipitation soil saturated hydraulic conductivity surficial geology type and slope data its application indicates that average quick flow runoff across the conterminous united states in the winter exceeds that in the summer by up to a factor of three the monthly maps were explored and evaluated for the timespan of 2000 2015 the comparison of equation forms and produced monthly maps will be useful for a variety of hydrologic modeling and monitoring applications keywords runoff water budget streamflow quick flow 1 introduction 1 1 problem statement the dynamics of streamflow are central to hydrologic science many applications in hydrology require a basis for predicting the rapidly varying quick flow runoff portion of the streamflow hydrograph as separated from base flow such that streamflow is equal to the sum of quick flow and base flow often the timescale of interest is longer than the event or daily scale at which such quantities have more often been studied chapman 1999 ponce and hawkins 1996 niu et al 2005 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 the spatial scale of interest is also often larger than the local or regional scale at which such efforts have often been developed larsen et al 1999 mockus 1949 horton 1933 there is a lack of readily applicable and nationally tested equations for predicting quick flow runoff across large spatial scales at monthly or seasonal timesteps and this lack is a major gap in our understanding and our ability to estimate and forecast water availability for large spatial scales and longer than event timescales streamflow prediction efforts often focus on the total streamflow only and typically make estimates at resolutions of the watershed scale or coarser vogel et al 1999 wolock and mccabe 1999 with the exception of the 1 km base flow index grid of wolock 2003 with a higher spatial resolution however there are several reasons why an equation specifically for quick flow runoff at a higher spatial resolution would be useful the distillation from the base flow component of streamflow is an advantage because base flow and groundwater dynamics are generally slower than quick flow runoff dynamics with feedbacks often on a monthly or longer timescale for example the widely used modflow groundwater flow model is typically run on at least a monthly timestep clark and hart 2009 faunt 2009 peterson et al 2016 this delay in watershed response obscures the relationship between explanatory variables such as precipitation for a given month and the base flow observed for that month the quick flow runoff component having shorter response times is more likely to show a direct relationship with a month s forcing climate variables this separation of quick flow runoff estimation from base flow also loosens the restrictions on base flow values changes in groundwater storage at monthly seasonal or longer timescales can be substantial and the response timescales depend on subsurface properties that are often not well constrained forcing quick flow runoff and base flow components to vary together for predicting monthly total streamflow lumps together positive or negative base flow changes due to storage changes and would reduce the accuracy of the flow prediction as well as lose detail in the base flow component that reflects real physical processes estimation of the quick flow component of streamflow has tended to focus on the event or daily timescale and on the tracking of transient dynamics such as soil moisture infiltration excess and storage koster and suarez 1996 liang and xie 2001 niu et al 2005 markstrom et al 2015 the monthly timestep is a useful one for water budget modeling because of its ability to capture seasonal dynamics and address many critical water availability questions such as water supply changes through an agricultural growing season climatic data at a monthly timestep are also often more readily available for hindcasting or forecasting adler et al 2003 daly et al 2008 from the focus on the event scale in previous work one might think it were not possible to predict quick flow runoff water budget volumes at longer than event timescales it would not be a trivial effort to extrapolate event scale equations to monthly or longer timescales especially when estimates are sought across the multiple terrain types and climate zones of the national scale however event scale dynamics may not need to be resolved to estimate water budget quantities at the monthly timescale for such an estimate the complexity of event scale dynamics could be averaged to produce a bulk response described in a simpler way we are encouraged in this possibility for quick flow runoff because it has been done for the annual average timescale where prediction of quick flow runoff at the national scale agreed with observations with an r 2 of 0 78 reitz et al 2017a as the need to quantify present and future water resources increases in urgency several efforts are underway to estimate water cycle dynamics for regional national and global scales for timescales as short as hours such as the national water model salas et al 2018 or the national land data assimilation system mitchell et al 2004 and some predicting water availability out to year 2100 such as the monthly water balance model futures portal bock et al 2017 these efforts rely on water balance models driven by forcing data sets such as precipitation and temperature which use sets of equations to relate the components of the water cycle to estimate water budget dynamics through time as the development and running of such a model requires an intensive effort the scope of such work generally does not include developing new relationships among water balance components but rather using previously published forms drawn from the hydrologic literature however theoretical uncertainties and regional differences lead to many alternative forms being present in the literature for some of the water cycle connections evapotranspiration et for example has many options for predicting potential e g thornthwaite 1948 hamon 1961 jensen and haise 1963 or actual e g blaney and criddle 1962 hargreaves and samani 1985 values other connections in the water cycle lack for literature equations particularly at timescales above the event scale and spatial scales at the national or global level because these components nonetheless must be represented in the model the lack of readily applicable forms leads to such processes being described by heuristics based on behaviors that are intuitive and based on physical reasoning koster and suarez 1996 koster and milly 1997 boughton 2004 these are reasonable assumptions for modelers to make to fill in these gaps in the water cycle but complementary studies such as the one described here are needed for each water cycle interaction to compare treatment options in a thorough way climate landscape and streamflow data are readily available for testing and comparing different approaches of estimating quick flow runoff however national scale comparisons of methods used to estimate quick flow runoff for the monthly timescale are lacking the goals of this paper are to 1 provide an overview of different methods currently in use for quick flow runoff estimation 2 test equation forms in a comparison against monthly quick flow runoff data and 3 apply a relatively high performing equation to monthly timescale data sets to produce and explore monthly quick flow runoff maps for the conterminous united states conus 1 2 quick flow runoff in the literature many research efforts have worked to estimate quick flow runoff at different temporal and spatial scales a summary of several of the resulting equations is presented in table 1 this summary is not comprehensive as there are more formulations in use than those listed here e g famiglietti and wood 1994 sivapalan et al 1996 yadupathi putty 2009 table 1 provides a sample of some widely used formulations and shows the variety in equation form complexity and explanatory variables that are actively used to predict quick flow runoff rainfall runoff modeling has been one established focus for estimating runoff volumes e g moradkhani and sorooshian 2009 beven 2011 birkel and soulsby 2015 taormina and chau 2015 the first four equations in table 1 are variations of the popular curve number approach to describe rainfall runoff partitioning the curve number approach was developed primarily for the event timescale although extensions to longer timescales have been proposed mishra and singh 2004 simonit and perrings 2013 the approach describes the runoff volume as that portion of rainfall that is not abstracted by infiltration into the ground with the abstraction volume proportional to the soil retention potential by a factor of λ soil conservation service 1985 it is not clear that this conceptual model for the event scale would apply directly to predicting the quick flow component of the hydrograph as some water volume that temporarily abstracts into the root zone can eventually contribute to the quick flow component by the outlet of a watershed yadupathi putty 2009 and conversely some of the initial event runoff predicted by the curve number could abstract later into a recharge or base flow contribution however the curve number approach is included here because of the ubiquity of this form and because the runoff estimated in this way is sometimes used interchangeably with direct runoff the definition of which overlaps with quick flow runoff ponce and hawkins 1996 fohrer et al 2005 another common approach to estimating quick flow runoff is to track the soil moisture storage potential and then designate the excess precipitation after filling available soil moisture storage volume as either the quick flow runoff in some cases koster and suarez 1996 liang and xie 2001 markstrom et al 2015 or the total streamflow in others wolock and mccabe 1999 westenbroek et al 2010 as with the curve number approach the volume estimated by this event scale formulation does not necessarily equate with the ultimate quick flow component of a watershed hydrograph its accuracy depends on the accuracy of the theory for tracking transient soil moisture storage capacity and the rate at which some of the runoff volume is abstracted into the ground to fill this void because the volume of water available for runoff or soil moisture storage is often calculated as the precipitation reduced by et uncertainties in both et and precipitation estimation are also transferred to these calculations other approaches to quick flow runoff estimation have included system convolution of unit hydrographs singh 1988 and the inclusion of linear reservoirs rimmer and salingar 2006 in general quick flow runoff estimation methods in the literature make intuitive sense and are based on physical reasoning such as water filling available soil storage space before producing runoff however comprehensive tests of these equations against each other and against data across large regional spatial scales are rare of the quick flow runoff estimation methods that are currently in use in large domain water balance models none that we found were presented with evidence that the selected formulation had been tested against other formulations using data at a national spatial domain before its selection in this paper we aim to contribute to this need for evaluative quick flow runoff comparisons through testing a variety of equation forms against a national scale data set 2 material and methods 2 1 data sets for testing quick flow runoff equation performance we gathered stream gage data for a conus wide set of watersheds the data from each watershed are collected from a gage at the watershed s outlet these watersheds were selected from the u s geological survey usgs gages ii database falcone 2011 with the criteria that they be 1 100 2500 km2 in size 2 without noted diversions or regulations and 3 without other caveats described in the database comments such as a large percentage of the watershed is open water the watersheds were limited to those for which at least 1 year of continuous daily water discharge data were available from the usgs national water information system nwis u s geological survey 2018 between the years of 2000 2015 the restrictions are similar to the reference gage criteria in falcone 2011 in that they avoid disturbed watersheds but they differ in the application of a watershed size restriction and a data availability criterion for the 2000 2015 timespan these criteria resulted in a total of 1301 watersheds which are shown in fig 1 the total number of months of data was 209 448 with an average number of years of continuous data for each watershed of 13 to separate total streamflow into base flow and quick flow runoff components investigators have typically used either graphical or chemical approaches a graphical approach requires assumptions to be made from the shape of the hydrograph as to when the flow changes from quick flow and base flow to only base flow chemical base flow separation provides additional tracer information that can ideally tag the quick flow runoff to track how much of it contributes to the total flow during the entire flow duration however even chemical tracer approaches involve assumptions about solute solid interactions about what part of the flow qualifies as quick and about how far this water can travel beneath the land surface as a result no technique can be considered a direct observation of quick flow but only an estimate with uncertainty that cannot be meaningfully quantified for the lack of ground truth data in general chemical techniques have been considered closer to a gold standard but the data required for their application are costly to collect and thus are available for only a small percentage of stream reaches the ability to generate estimates for all watersheds that have streamflow data thus makes graphical separation techniques more useful and appropriate than chemical approaches for studies that require data across a large spatial domain another chemical tracer that has been used is specific conductance which requires more assumptions about its signal but is relatively inexpensive to collect studies have been done comparing specific conductance quick flow estimates to graphical techniques over multiple watersheds for example sanford et al 2011 used specific conductance data to produce estimates of quick flow fractions of total flow that were lower than those from a graphical technique the usgs software program part rutledge 1998 in 80 of the watersheds across the state of virginia in addition comparisons of many different graphical techniques raffensperger et al 2017 have shown part results to give the lowest estimates of the graphical techniques and thus closest on average to chemical separation results for the above reasons the part program was chosen as our graphical separation method of choice with the acknowledgment that it is only one routine that can been used and it gives one particular estimate of quick flow runoff from the observed total flow data at stream gages for this study part was run on each watershed for each year of data yielding estimates of average monthly quick flow runoff for each available year for each watershed a variety of national scale maps of potential explanatory variables were collected to test literature based or alternative quick flow runoff equations monthly precipitation p and mean temperature t data at 800 m resolution were obtained from the prism climate group at oregon state university daly et al 2008 soil properties of saturated hydraulic conductivity k porosity por field capacity fc available water capacity awc and soil thickness th were obtained from the 100 m resolution statsgo database compiled by the u s department of agriculture s natural resources conservation service soil survey staff http websoilsurvey nrcs usda gov and resampled to a 1 km resolution these properties are averaged over soil depths down to bedrock or to whatever depth data have been collected slope s data at 30 m resolution were also obtained from the regions in the national hydrography dataset stitched together and resampled to a 1 km resolution we acknowledge that the 1 km common sampling resolution may adversely impact the accuracy of results aggregated for smaller spatial scales more so than larger ones but a common grid size was chosen for data processing based on the coarsest resolution input data sets to produce a defensible spatial accuracy in the final product a map of surficial geology was also used reitz et al 2017a adapted from soller et al 2009 annual land cover type was included from the usgs earth resources observation and science eros center data set of sohl et al 2016 monthly timescale snow water equivalent swe change from the snodas snow data assimilation system data set at 1 km resolution was also tested for inclusion as a potential accumulating or melting sink or source of monthly available water national operational hydrologic remote sensing center 2017 monthly et at 1 km resolution was tested as a potential reduction from precipitation in water available for quick flow runoff reitz et al 2017b in testing these reductions or enhancements from et and swe we are not attempting to include all elements of the water mass balance e g infiltration to recharge but only determining whether water supply reduced by loss to et or reduced enhanced by swe changes provides better explanatory power than raw precipitation data alone separation by conditions of high or low precipitation was tested where we used a threshold cutoff of 0 10 m month to divide watersheds into high and low precipitation populations and calibrated each separately we tested a separation of frozen or non frozen ground using the first order condition of a mean monthly temperature of zero degrees celsius based on zhang et al 2003 soil water retention potential st is a common variable in runoff estimation often used at the event timescale for the water void to be filled before supplied water begins to contribute to quick flow runoff for the monthly timescale the average soil moisture retention potential was estimated from soil properties as the porosity multiplied by the soil thickness to give total void space the use of statsgo soils data to estimate average soil moisture storage capacity has precedent in other studies e g wolock and mccabe 1999 average values of each of the potential explanatory variables were calculated as averages over all pixels within each of the 1301 watersheds time series variables such as precipitation and temperature were measured for every month for the years between 2000 and 2015 except for the snodas data for swe which were measured for the snodas available range from october 2003 to december 2015 for continuous data sets such as soil hydraulic conductivity or et the values calculated were the average of the pixel values within each watershed for discrete data sets such as land cover the histogram of how many pixel values of each type were present in the watershed was measured 2 2 equation tests a wide range of equation forms relating the part separated quick flow runoff data for a watershed to the potential explanatory variables measured within that watershed was explored because the part data are generated from data at the watershed outlet the input data for the equation form comparisons e g average precipitation values are averages over all pixels within the watershed as well the tested functional forms included many based on the literature forms described in table 1 the subset of table 1 equations selected for testing were those for which we had adequate data sets for the required input variables they also included many alternative ways of relating the explanatory variables to the data to include discrete categorical data such as the surficial geology cover or land cover classifications in the regressions the approach taken for a selected equation was to first measure the overall adjusted r 2 for all watersheds and then to fit the quick flow equation separately only for watersheds containing each surficial geology type the fitting parameters of individual surficial geology types were saved unless the individual fit correlation did not provide an improvement over the overall fit in which case the overall fitting parameters were saved for that type in cases where using the specific surficial geology type did not improve the fit geology type was not serving as a key explanatory parameter in the basin to compile the estimates for a given watershed to compare the prediction with the observed value the predictions using fit parameters for each surficial geology type were weighted by the fraction of the watershed area covered by that type and summed the equations were tested using the curve fitting function in python s scipy package jones et al 2001 this curve fitting function uses the levenberg marquardt nonlinear least squares optimization algorithm to find coefficients that minimize the root mean squared error rmse to fit the data to a given functional form levenberg 1944 marquardt 1963 for all tested equations separate calibration coefficients were used for each month of the year which allowed seasonal variability to be evaluated the statistical metrics we used to compare equation performance were 1 r 2 the square of the correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed monthly quick flow runoff values 2 an adjusted r 2 to account for the number of variables in the equation being tested defined as r adj 2 1 1 r 2 n 1 n v 1 where n is the sample size and v is the number of explanatory variables 3 the rmse and 4 the akaike information criterion aic which compares model performance adjusted for the number of equation parameters where the simplified definition used here assuming normally distributed errors and linear models is aic 2 k n log rss n where k is the number of model parameters and rss is the residual sum of squares and a lower number indicates a simpler and better performing equation this suite of metrics rather than any one in particular was used to compare the relative performance of the different equations and to select one for application to further test the selected equation and generate calibration coefficients the monthly quick flow runoff data set was randomly split into 80 and 20 of the data for calibration and validation respectively this split was randomly repeated 10 times and the final calibration coefficients were averages over the 10 calibrations 2 3 equation application mapped estimates of each pixel s contribution to quick flow referred to here as contributed quick flow were generated for the conus at a 1 km scale using the selected equation including areas within and outside of the watersheds used for calibration through the application of the selected equation to the spatially continuous data sets for the explanatory variables each contributed quick flow map pixel s value represents the portion of the precipitation into that pixel area that ultimately contributes to the quick flow component of the water budget we use the term contributed quick flow to distinguish the mapped values from actual quick flow fluxes on the ground though the equation was calibrated with data collected at the watershed scale it was applied at the pixel scale pixel area of 1 km2 to capture within watershed variation based on variation in the driving explanatory variables although we recognize that the pixel scale accuracy is likely lower than the watershed scale calibration correlation the approach of developing an equation using watershed scale data and applying it at the pixel scale is justified based on use in other studies sauquet et al 2000 sanford and selnick 2013 reitz et al 2017a this approach does not account for quick flow fluxes between neighboring pixels quick flow quantities do show strong systematic within watershed variation with significant inter pixel transfers and downstream locations collecting greater volumes the approach taken here does not capture these inter pixel dynamics therefore the produced quick flow maps should not be interpreted as representing quick flow values accumulated across the landscape at these pixel locations for our purposes of water budget estimation a map showing contributed quick flow values can be preferable to a map that estimates accumulated quick flow values the benefit is the ability to sum the local quick flow contributions over arbitrary spatial scales or to combine them with estimates of local precipitation and et to yield local recharge quantity estimates the equation was applied to produce maps for each month within each year after applying the equation we noted outlier locations where the contributed quick flow generated by the fit was less than zero or rarely greater than the incoming precipitation for values of contributed quick flow runoff less than zero it is physically unrealistic for these values to be negative but it is plausible that the relationship between precipitation on the x axis and quick flow runoff on the y axis would have a positive x intercept due to areas with very low precipitation being consumed by et or recharge without producing quick flow runoff this positive x intercept would lead to the equation predicting negative runoff values in locations with very low precipitation negative values were therefore set to zero to account for this effect though it is possible that the contributed quick flow runoff could exceed precipitation due to groundwater influx into the watershed it is unlikely that the regression would capture these effects it is also possible that the precipitation data could be the source of error but the contributed quick flow runoff estimates were deemed more likely to be in error and were thus bounded between zero and the monthly precipitation to explore and evaluate the produced maps we created maps showing the magnitude of errors of the predictions within the calibrating watersheds across the conus we plotted the equation predictions against the quick flow runoff data for three individual watersheds in different regions of the country to provide a metric of uncertainty for the gridded maps we also measured the standard error of the estimate between the watershed scale part data and the gridded monthly maps measured within the watersheds where the standard error of the estimate is defined as s est rss n 2 finally we compared the monthly gridded maps with a previously published map of long term annual average contributed quick flow runoff for the time period 2000 2013 by summing the monthly maps to annual totals for the same time period 3 results 3 1 equation comparison equations that were based on forms found in the literature table 1 for which we had adequate input data sets were tested first the results of these tests are listed in table 2 where the equations are listed in order of reference to the equation numbers in the literature review of table 1 these were tested for monthly quick flow runoff and the reported statistics are based on comparison with data at the monthly time step the monthly statistical metrics r 2 etc were evaluated using the complete data set of all 209 448 individual months of data for the 1301 test watersheds i e using 17 454 data points per month a variety of additional regression equations relating the collected explanatory variables to the quick flow runoff values were also explored several of the highest performing equations are listed in table 3 along with their r 2 adjusted r 2 rmse bias and aic for lack of a feasible methodology for testing all possible equation forms the forms in table 3 were developed in this study through a trial and error process we do not therefore claim that this list is any sort of exhaustive representation of possible empirical equation forms or that forms with better explanatory power do not exist only that these were the higher performing equation forms of the ones that we tested in this study the equation testing was further extended to include surficial geology classifications using the methods described in section 2 2 and similar to that which produced eq 12 in reitz et al 2017a b this refinement was tested on a subset of the equations in tables 2 and 3 the table 2 equations eqs 1 and 10 were selected as representing the common curve number approach and an example of another literature derived form with a relatively high adjusted r 2 the table 3 equations selected eqs 27 29 were those with the highest adjusted r 2 and lowest aic results are summarized in table 4 in all cases the inclusion of surficial geology data increased the adjusted r 2 of the equation tested a similar classification algorithm was tested for land cover classifications but this distinction did not enhance the equation performances splitting the datasets by conditions of frozen non frozen mean watershed temperature of zero degrees celsius zhang et al 2003 calibrating the equations separately for the two populations and recompiling did not result in increased correlations the calibrating split by conditions of low and high precipitation watersheds also did not increase the correlations finally variations were tested in which the precipitation variable was replaced by either precipitation minus et precipitation plus minus snow water equivalent change or precipitation minus et plus minus snow water equivalent change though it was plausible that accounting for available water after the reductions for et or snow accumulation or increases from snow melt would have increased the accuracy of the estimates when tested these options did not increase the correlation coefficients examples of this lack of improved explanatory power are shown in table s1 using the same five equation forms that were tested for surficial geology type inclusion the equation that was selected for producing monthly runoff maps was eq 34 below which had the lowest aic and tied for the highest tested adjusted r 2 of 0 64 34 r g g g p p a g k k b g p l p l c g h

individual fit for a total of 1064 coefficients is provided in table s2 in the supplementary information along with the r 2 associated with each fit the surficial geology types that tended to produce the highest correlations were coastal fine grained and eolian in cases where using the specific surficial geology type did not improve the fit geology type did not seem to act as a key explanatory parameter for the watershed s quick flow runoff the correlations for this equation for individual months are listed in table 5 with an average monthly calibration r 2 of 0 63 and validation r 2 of 0 65 the data sets for each month were split into calibration and validation populations as described in the methods section and the correlations of each are listed in table 5 there was not an obvious trend of correlation with time of the year the highest correlations occurred for the october fit and the lowest for the april fit though the correlation values listed in table 5 for individual monthly fits are not perfect falling mostly between 0 6 and 0 7 they do significantly outperform the other equation types tested against the monthly timescale data for comparison the monthly correlations for four of the literature derived equation options are listed in table s3 of the supplementary information to compare behaviors of the selected equation by month and by surficial geology type table 6 was compiled to show the values for each month under average conditions in this table the values for average conditions are estimated from eq 34 by using the average conditions of p pl k and sl reducing those ratios to average values to 1 to obtain average runoff values for each of the 15 surficial geology types as gg hg jg low to high values are highlighted in gradients from red to white to blue the comparison shows lower values predicted in the summer months with some variation by surficial geology type the volcanic type stands out as having low values throughout the year 3 2 contributed quick flow runoff maps the selected equation eq 34 was applied to the conus using the spatially continuous maps of slope surficial geology type soil hydraulic conductivity and precipitation described in section 2 1 the maps shown here are averages over 2000 2015 individual monthly maps within each year were also produced and are available for download in the data release specified in the acknowledgements and data section fig 2 shows averages over the spring season and for the individual months of march april and may fig 3 shows the summer monthly and seasonal averages fig 4 shows the fall monthly and seasonal averages and fig 5 shows the winter monthly and seasonal averages the runoff variation with time in the year generally shows patterns of high values in the winter and spring with lower values in the summer and fall consistent with the average values shown in table 6 the progression of the average value across the conus through the year is shown in fig 6 maps showing the average differences and percent differences between the watershed scale predicted values and the part generated quick flow runoff data points are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively the maps illustrate the spatial variability in the agreement between the predictions and the observations overall the average bias between the predicted and observed values fell within a narrow range thirty percent of the values had an average magnitude difference less than 2 mm month and 66 had an average magnitude difference less than 5 mm month some regional patterns included generally positive monthly biases in texas and florida and negative biases in west virginia the monthly difference expressed as a percentage of the observed value from part showed high values particularly in the southwest where the observed values are very small we also plotted the results of the watershed scale predicted values for three randomly selected watersheds in different regions in the conus with one in arizona one in south carolina and one in minnesota the plots are shown in fig s1 to provide an estimate of uncertainty for the gridded monthly maps we also measured the mean values of the gridded monthly maps to compare with the original part quick flow data a scatter plot of the comparison is shown in fig 8 the standard error of the estimate was computed to be 0 0159 m mo finally we compared the monthly gridded maps with a previously published map of long term annual average quick flow runoff for the 2000 2013 time period reitz et al 2017a by summing the monthly maps to annual totals and averaging over the same time period we found general consistency between the two long term annual average maps the two maps and a map of their differences are shown in the supplementary information fig s2 4 discussion 4 1 overview of quick flow runoff treatment equations for quick flow runoff are required for many hydrologic applications including the development of water budget models quick flow runoff equations in the literature are generally proposed based on simple physical reasoning such as through the curve number or other formulations that conceptualize soil moisture voids to be filled before runoff generation ponce and hawkins 1996 koster and suarez 1996 mishra and singh 2004 the same general physical concepts are implemented through a variety of equation options table 1 in some cases testing of the equation form and calibration is shown ponce and hawkins 1996 reitz et al 2017a though regions of testing can be spatially limited compared with the eventual application of the equation markstrom et al 2015 in other cases testing and calibration are not shown only the general physical reasoning and proposed equation form koster and suarez 1996 koster and milly 1997 boughton and chiew 2007 comparisons of quick flow runoff equation form and performance before selection and application of an equation to produce runoff estimates are rare our review of equation forms for the quick flow component of streamflow yielded a wide range of forms in use of the major water balance models applied at spatial scales of the conus or larger no two used the same treatment for quick flow runoff none reported testing of this component with comparisons against quick flow runoff data from across large spatial scales or comparisons against other equation options wide application of equations for quick flow runoff based on general physical reasoning or locally calibrated empirical equations are currently common in national and global scale models of the hydrologic cycle koster and suarez 1996 liang and xie 2001 niu et al 2005 the accumulation of errors resulting from theoretical uncertainties can be seen when results from different water balance models using the same input datasets are compared and found to give significantly different results for example xia et al 2012 shows estimates of total streamflow varying by a factor of two in the long term national scale annual average across the four main models run in the national land data assimilation system nldas mitchell et al 2004 we acknowledge that some of the equations described here were developed for the event timescale and that water balance models run at shorter timescales such as hours could potentially track event scale runoff response and quantities like transient soil moisture dynamics which are not captured here testing these forms with monthly timescale data is not therefore a definitive test of the usefulness of these equations we primarily included them for the lack of availability of monthly or longer timescale quick flow runoff equations for comparison we targeted the monthly timescale as a useful one that is particularly underquantified readily analyzed with available data sets and has high potential for dependency on monthly variation in explanatory variables such as precipitation the monthly estimates produced here based on a parsimonious set of readily available explanatory variables will be useful for projecting and backcasting monthly water budgets in combination with estimates of et they can also be used to produce estimates of monthly recharge which will be useful for applications in groundwater modeling 4 2 equation testing and selection one caveat for our equation testing and application results is that the distribution of gages for testing and calibration was weighted toward the eastern conus where a greater number of gages met the selection criteria therefore estimates in regions without many watersheds as shown in fig 1 will likely show more uncertainty our use of part generated data as the truth value against which equations were evaluated and calibrated presents a source of uncertainty in that part provides only one estimate of quick flow runoff and without access to true quick flow data without estimation assumptions we acknowledge that what is actually being evaluated here is the ability of the equations to reproduce part generated data though the absolute values of the metrics of equation performance may well vary with the use of different hydrograph separation methods the evaluation of relative equation performance is likely to be more robust particularly since the calibrating coefficients are not constrained here but only the general form is tested if however the differences between part and another method are systematic in a specific way that favors one equation form over another our conclusions could be altered depending on the hydrograph separation method choice we also stress the point that the application at the pixel scale of these equations results in quick flow runoff values that are not designed or intended to reflect inter pixel transfers such as downstream flow accumulation the values targeted with the application to spatially continuous data sets are the portion of the precipitation entering each pixel that ultimately contributes to the quick flow runoff component of the water budget application at this pixel scale is uniquely advantageous to efforts to constrain other water budget components for which knowledge of the local water budget contribution at the pixel scale is useful such as recharge another caveat for use of these data sets is that our analysis does not control for nonstationarity which could introduce error especially if there are significant changes in variables that impact quick flow runoff but are not included as explanatory variables in our selected equation for example it is plausible that long term trends in temperature could impact et and indirectly affect quick flow runoff quantities we acknowledge this limitation particularly as a caveat for use of these methods in estimating quick flow runoff far outside of the time period of testing and calibration also we reiterate that we do not claim that our list of tested equations is an exhaustive representation of all possible equation forms or that forms with better explanatory power do not exist but only that these were the higher performing equation forms of the ones that we tested in this study an advantage of the selected equation is that it depends on variables that are either available historically such as monthly mean precipitation or are fairly static in time such as slope and surficial geology type the equation can therefore be applied to produce estimates of quick flow runoff for any month for which precipitation data are available for that month and the previous month though the approach does not map inter pixel flow routing the usefulness of the previous month s precipitation as an explanatory variable is likely due to the fact that routing and some time delay between precipitation events and surface runoff watershed outflow can occur so that there can be an increasing or decreasing effect of a higher or lower previous month s precipitation particularly in its final days onto a pixel on that pixel s contribution to the watershed quick flow value though the effects of hydrological events in the last days of the month cannot be explicitly expressed by this equation at the monthly timestep the additional explanatory power of including the previous month s precipitation suggests the possible indirect effect the other potential explanatory variables that were tested for inclusion but ultimately excluded for lack of improved predictive power provide interesting information as well the testing of the modification of the available water supply for runoff by et and or by snow melt or accumulation did not improve the estimates over using precipitation alone as shown in the examples in table s1 the lack of improved explanatory power with the inclusion of these data was a nonintuitive result with a possible explanation that the errors inherent in those data sets were high enough that they masked any real effect of et or snow melt accumulation on altering the water available for quick flow runoff during that month the monthly and seasonal maps produced through application of the selected equation showed regional and temporal patterns that can inform our understanding of quick flow runoff behavior for use in hydrologic modeling or comparison efforts the calculated standard error of the estimate of 0 0159 m mo can be used as a measure of uncertainty to be associated with the monthly gridded maps the trend of 3 or 4 times higher quick flow runoff values in the winter and spring as compared with the summer and fall is perhaps unintuitive considering the generally higher precipitation values in the summer a significantly higher fraction of the precipitation is apportioned to quick flow runoff in the winter this observed trend could be partially due to cold weather effects such as frozen ground or snow melt or due to warm weather increases in et claiming higher fractions of the water supply with lower et in the winter more water remains for streamflow and for increasing the soil water content which can lead to quicker times for soils to reach full water capacity during rainfall events and greater quick flow runoff also the soil hydraulic conductivity is impacted by both the temperature of water where water at 0 c has a higher viscosity than water at 25 c by a factor of 2 korson et al 1969 and by the relative permeability muskat and meres 1936 where an order of magnitude change has been observed in laboratory measured infiltration rates when temperature was varied between 2 c and 25 c constantz 1982 our results are consistent with these findings where a substantial decrease in the infiltration rate at lower temperatures would lead to more quickly saturated soils and increased quick flow runoff this work provides a novel validation that this effect observed at the laboratory scale can also be shown to occur empirically at the regional and continental scales the associated data release for this paper reitz and sanford 2019 contains the monthly contributed quick flow runoff maps presented and described in this paper as well as those produced through application of the selected equation to monthly precipitation data back to 1895 5 conclusions in this paper we have provided an overview of the treatment of monthly quick flow runoff formulations in the literature we have particularly targeted the monthly timestep because of its usefulness for backcasting and forecasting quick flow runoff values using readily available data sets the appropriateness for many hydrologic applications such as groundwater modeling and the practical ability to average over more complex dynamics at smaller temporal scales while still capturing seasonal variability in flows the testing of functional forms drawn from the literature yielded a range in performance and the inclusion of several new regression options for relating explanatory variables to quick flow runoff yielded several that performed better an equation was selected based on the suite of tested statistical metrics of equation performance particularly the adjusted r 2 and aic and was applied to monthly timescale data to produce monthly timescale maps of the contributions to the quick flow runoff water budget component these monthly maps were presented and explored here for the 2000 2015 timeframe equations for quick flow runoff water budget contributions are sparse in general and the forms in active use in hydrologic applications and modeling efforts show a wide range equations are particularly lacking for the monthly timescale our review of existing methods indicated a need for studies where monthly timescale quick flow runoff data at a conus scale are used to test a suite of equation options the testing of equations linking different components of the water cycle is increasingly needed as the technical ability to build national and global scale water balance models has grown rapidly in recent years outpacing the rate at which different water cycle component equations are being thoroughly vetted across the same spatial scales the comparisons here have focused on the quick flow runoff volume prediction aspect of the water balance we demonstrated in the overview that no two of the major water balance models are currently treating quick flow runoff prediction in the same way that some of the equations used were developed using regional instead of national scale data and that many equation forms are assumptions or heuristics based on physical reasoning that make intuitive sense but are not tested and are often simplified similar comparisons are needed for all linking equations in the water cycle including et soil moisture and base flow it need not be the responsibility of those building these water balance models to also develop and test new equations for each component as there is already substantial technical work to be done to build and run these models the hydrologic community can work to better provide such modeling efforts with

6554,the quantitative estimation of the quick flow runoff component of streamflow is required for many hydrologic applications estimation at the monthly timescale and national spatial scale would be particularly useful for national water availability modeling this paper reviews a sample of commonly used equations for quick flow runoff including several currently in use in continental scale models the review shows the wide range of equation forms or heuristics currently in use to predict quick flow runoff the limited spatial scale over which these equations are often developed or calibrated and the scarcity of well tested equations available for quick flow runoff at the monthly timescale data were gathered from a set of 1301 gaged watersheds across the united states to test a range of equations from the literature along with several alternative equations to assess and compare their performance in predicting quick flow runoff at the monthly timescale the highest performing equation was selected for application to monthly maps of explanatory variables to produce monthly quick flow runoff water budget contribution maps this equation is a regression against precipitation soil saturated hydraulic conductivity surficial geology type and slope data its application indicates that average quick flow runoff across the conterminous united states in the winter exceeds that in the summer by up to a factor of three the monthly maps were explored and evaluated for the timespan of 2000 2015 the comparison of equation forms and produced monthly maps will be useful for a variety of hydrologic modeling and monitoring applications keywords runoff water budget streamflow quick flow 1 introduction 1 1 problem statement the dynamics of streamflow are central to hydrologic science many applications in hydrology require a basis for predicting the rapidly varying quick flow runoff portion of the streamflow hydrograph as separated from base flow such that streamflow is equal to the sum of quick flow and base flow often the timescale of interest is longer than the event or daily scale at which such quantities have more often been studied chapman 1999 ponce and hawkins 1996 niu et al 2005 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 the spatial scale of interest is also often larger than the local or regional scale at which such efforts have often been developed larsen et al 1999 mockus 1949 horton 1933 there is a lack of readily applicable and nationally tested equations for predicting quick flow runoff across large spatial scales at monthly or seasonal timesteps and this lack is a major gap in our understanding and our ability to estimate and forecast water availability for large spatial scales and longer than event timescales streamflow prediction efforts often focus on the total streamflow only and typically make estimates at resolutions of the watershed scale or coarser vogel et al 1999 wolock and mccabe 1999 with the exception of the 1 km base flow index grid of wolock 2003 with a higher spatial resolution however there are several reasons why an equation specifically for quick flow runoff at a higher spatial resolution would be useful the distillation from the base flow component of streamflow is an advantage because base flow and groundwater dynamics are generally slower than quick flow runoff dynamics with feedbacks often on a monthly or longer timescale for example the widely used modflow groundwater flow model is typically run on at least a monthly timestep clark and hart 2009 faunt 2009 peterson et al 2016 this delay in watershed response obscures the relationship between explanatory variables such as precipitation for a given month and the base flow observed for that month the quick flow runoff component having shorter response times is more likely to show a direct relationship with a month s forcing climate variables this separation of quick flow runoff estimation from base flow also loosens the restrictions on base flow values changes in groundwater storage at monthly seasonal or longer timescales can be substantial and the response timescales depend on subsurface properties that are often not well constrained forcing quick flow runoff and base flow components to vary together for predicting monthly total streamflow lumps together positive or negative base flow changes due to storage changes and would reduce the accuracy of the flow prediction as well as lose detail in the base flow component that reflects real physical processes estimation of the quick flow component of streamflow has tended to focus on the event or daily timescale and on the tracking of transient dynamics such as soil moisture infiltration excess and storage koster and suarez 1996 liang and xie 2001 niu et al 2005 markstrom et al 2015 the monthly timestep is a useful one for water budget modeling because of its ability to capture seasonal dynamics and address many critical water availability questions such as water supply changes through an agricultural growing season climatic data at a monthly timestep are also often more readily available for hindcasting or forecasting adler et al 2003 daly et al 2008 from the focus on the event scale in previous work one might think it were not possible to predict quick flow runoff water budget volumes at longer than event timescales it would not be a trivial effort to extrapolate event scale equations to monthly or longer timescales especially when estimates are sought across the multiple terrain types and climate zones of the national scale however event scale dynamics may not need to be resolved to estimate water budget quantities at the monthly timescale for such an estimate the complexity of event scale dynamics could be averaged to produce a bulk response described in a simpler way we are encouraged in this possibility for quick flow runoff because it has been done for the annual average timescale where prediction of quick flow runoff at the national scale agreed with observations with an r 2 of 0 78 reitz et al 2017a as the need to quantify present and future water resources increases in urgency several efforts are underway to estimate water cycle dynamics for regional national and global scales for timescales as short as hours such as the national water model salas et al 2018 or the national land data assimilation system mitchell et al 2004 and some predicting water availability out to year 2100 such as the monthly water balance model futures portal bock et al 2017 these efforts rely on water balance models driven by forcing data sets such as precipitation and temperature which use sets of equations to relate the components of the water cycle to estimate water budget dynamics through time as the development and running of such a model requires an intensive effort the scope of such work generally does not include developing new relationships among water balance components but rather using previously published forms drawn from the hydrologic literature however theoretical uncertainties and regional differences lead to many alternative forms being present in the literature for some of the water cycle connections evapotranspiration et for example has many options for predicting potential e g thornthwaite 1948 hamon 1961 jensen and haise 1963 or actual e g blaney and criddle 1962 hargreaves and samani 1985 values other connections in the water cycle lack for literature equations particularly at timescales above the event scale and spatial scales at the national or global level because these components nonetheless must be represented in the model the lack of readily applicable forms leads to such processes being described by heuristics based on behaviors that are intuitive and based on physical reasoning koster and suarez 1996 koster and milly 1997 boughton 2004 these are reasonable assumptions for modelers to make to fill in these gaps in the water cycle but complementary studies such as the one described here are needed for each water cycle interaction to compare treatment options in a thorough way climate landscape and streamflow data are readily available for testing and comparing different approaches of estimating quick flow runoff however national scale comparisons of methods used to estimate quick flow runoff for the monthly timescale are lacking the goals of this paper are to 1 provide an overview of different methods currently in use for quick flow runoff estimation 2 test equation forms in a comparison against monthly quick flow runoff data and 3 apply a relatively high performing equation to monthly timescale data sets to produce and explore monthly quick flow runoff maps for the conterminous united states conus 1 2 quick flow runoff in the literature many research efforts have worked to estimate quick flow runoff at different temporal and spatial scales a summary of several of the resulting equations is presented in table 1 this summary is not comprehensive as there are more formulations in use than those listed here e g famiglietti and wood 1994 sivapalan et al 1996 yadupathi putty 2009 table 1 provides a sample of some widely used formulations and shows the variety in equation form complexity and explanatory variables that are actively used to predict quick flow runoff rainfall runoff modeling has been one established focus for estimating runoff volumes e g moradkhani and sorooshian 2009 beven 2011 birkel and soulsby 2015 taormina and chau 2015 the first four equations in table 1 are variations of the popular curve number approach to describe rainfall runoff partitioning the curve number approach was developed primarily for the event timescale although extensions to longer timescales have been proposed mishra and singh 2004 simonit and perrings 2013 the approach describes the runoff volume as that portion of rainfall that is not abstracted by infiltration into the ground with the abstraction volume proportional to the soil retention potential by a factor of λ soil conservation service 1985 it is not clear that this conceptual model for the event scale would apply directly to predicting the quick flow component of the hydrograph as some water volume that temporarily abstracts into the root zone can eventually contribute to the quick flow component by the outlet of a watershed yadupathi putty 2009 and conversely some of the initial event runoff predicted by the curve number could abstract later into a recharge or base flow contribution however the curve number approach is included here because of the ubiquity of this form and because the runoff estimated in this way is sometimes used interchangeably with direct runoff the definition of which overlaps with quick flow runoff ponce and hawkins 1996 fohrer et al 2005 another common approach to estimating quick flow runoff is to track the soil moisture storage potential and then designate the excess precipitation after filling available soil moisture storage volume as either the quick flow runoff in some cases koster and suarez 1996 liang and xie 2001 markstrom et al 2015 or the total streamflow in others wolock and mccabe 1999 westenbroek et al 2010 as with the curve number approach the volume estimated by this event scale formulation does not necessarily equate with the ultimate quick flow component of a watershed hydrograph its accuracy depends on the accuracy of the theory for tracking transient soil moisture storage capacity and the rate at which some of the runoff volume is abstracted into the ground to fill this void because the volume of water available for runoff or soil moisture storage is often calculated as the precipitation reduced by et uncertainties in both et and precipitation estimation are also transferred to these calculations other approaches to quick flow runoff estimation have included system convolution of unit hydrographs singh 1988 and the inclusion of linear reservoirs rimmer and salingar 2006 in general quick flow runoff estimation methods in the literature make intuitive sense and are based on physical reasoning such as water filling available soil storage space before producing runoff however comprehensive tests of these equations against each other and against data across large regional spatial scales are rare of the quick flow runoff estimation methods that are currently in use in large domain water balance models none that we found were presented with evidence that the selected formulation had been tested against other formulations using data at a national spatial domain before its selection in this paper we aim to contribute to this need for evaluative quick flow runoff comparisons through testing a variety of equation forms against a national scale data set 2 material and methods 2 1 data sets for testing quick flow runoff equation performance we gathered stream gage data for a conus wide set of watersheds the data from each watershed are collected from a gage at the watershed s outlet these watersheds were selected from the u s geological survey usgs gages ii database falcone 2011 with the criteria that they be 1 100 2500 km2 in size 2 without noted diversions or regulations and 3 without other caveats described in the database comments such as a large percentage of the watershed is open water the watersheds were limited to those for which at least 1 year of continuous daily water discharge data were available from the usgs national water information system nwis u s geological survey 2018 between the years of 2000 2015 the restrictions are similar to the reference gage criteria in falcone 2011 in that they avoid disturbed watersheds but they differ in the application of a watershed size restriction and a data availability criterion for the 2000 2015 timespan these criteria resulted in a total of 1301 watersheds which are shown in fig 1 the total number of months of data was 209 448 with an average number of years of continuous data for each watershed of 13 to separate total streamflow into base flow and quick flow runoff components investigators have typically used either graphical or chemical approaches a graphical approach requires assumptions to be made from the shape of the hydrograph as to when the flow changes from quick flow and base flow to only base flow chemical base flow separation provides additional tracer information that can ideally tag the quick flow runoff to track how much of it contributes to the total flow during the entire flow duration however even chemical tracer approaches involve assumptions about solute solid interactions about what part of the flow qualifies as quick and about how far this water can travel beneath the land surface as a result no technique can be considered a direct observation of quick flow but only an estimate with uncertainty that cannot be meaningfully quantified for the lack of ground truth data in general chemical techniques have been considered closer to a gold standard but the data required for their application are costly to collect and thus are available for only a small percentage of stream reaches the ability to generate estimates for all watersheds that have streamflow data thus makes graphical separation techniques more useful and appropriate than chemical approaches for studies that require data across a large spatial domain another chemical tracer that has been used is specific conductance which requires more assumptions about its signal but is relatively inexpensive to collect studies have been done comparing specific conductance quick flow estimates to graphical techniques over multiple watersheds for example sanford et al 2011 used specific conductance data to produce estimates of quick flow fractions of total flow that were lower than those from a graphical technique the usgs software program part rutledge 1998 in 80 of the watersheds across the state of virginia in addition comparisons of many different graphical techniques raffensperger et al 2017 have shown part results to give the lowest estimates of the graphical techniques and thus closest on average to chemical separation results for the above reasons the part program was chosen as our graphical separation method of choice with the acknowledgment that it is only one routine that can been used and it gives one particular estimate of quick flow runoff from the observed total flow data at stream gages for this study part was run on each watershed for each year of data yielding estimates of average monthly quick flow runoff for each available year for each watershed a variety of national scale maps of potential explanatory variables were collected to test literature based or alternative quick flow runoff equations monthly precipitation p and mean temperature t data at 800 m resolution were obtained from the prism climate group at oregon state university daly et al 2008 soil properties of saturated hydraulic conductivity k porosity por field capacity fc available water capacity awc and soil thickness th were obtained from the 100 m resolution statsgo database compiled by the u s department of agriculture s natural resources conservation service soil survey staff http websoilsurvey nrcs usda gov and resampled to a 1 km resolution these properties are averaged over soil depths down to bedrock or to whatever depth data have been collected slope s data at 30 m resolution were also obtained from the regions in the national hydrography dataset stitched together and resampled to a 1 km resolution we acknowledge that the 1 km common sampling resolution may adversely impact the accuracy of results aggregated for smaller spatial scales more so than larger ones but a common grid size was chosen for data processing based on the coarsest resolution input data sets to produce a defensible spatial accuracy in the final product a map of surficial geology was also used reitz et al 2017a adapted from soller et al 2009 annual land cover type was included from the usgs earth resources observation and science eros center data set of sohl et al 2016 monthly timescale snow water equivalent swe change from the snodas snow data assimilation system data set at 1 km resolution was also tested for inclusion as a potential accumulating or melting sink or source of monthly available water national operational hydrologic remote sensing center 2017 monthly et at 1 km resolution was tested as a potential reduction from precipitation in water available for quick flow runoff reitz et al 2017b in testing these reductions or enhancements from et and swe we are not attempting to include all elements of the water mass balance e g infiltration to recharge but only determining whether water supply reduced by loss to et or reduced enhanced by swe changes provides better explanatory power than raw precipitation data alone separation by conditions of high or low precipitation was tested where we used a threshold cutoff of 0 10 m month to divide watersheds into high and low precipitation populations and calibrated each separately we tested a separation of frozen or non frozen ground using the first order condition of a mean monthly temperature of zero degrees celsius based on zhang et al 2003 soil water retention potential st is a common variable in runoff estimation often used at the event timescale for the water void to be filled before supplied water begins to contribute to quick flow runoff for the monthly timescale the average soil moisture retention potential was estimated from soil properties as the porosity multiplied by the soil thickness to give total void space the use of statsgo soils data to estimate average soil moisture storage capacity has precedent in other studies e g wolock and mccabe 1999 average values of each of the potential explanatory variables were calculated as averages over all pixels within each of the 1301 watersheds time series variables such as precipitation and temperature were measured for every month for the years between 2000 and 2015 except for the snodas data for swe which were measured for the snodas available range from october 2003 to december 2015 for continuous data sets such as soil hydraulic conductivity or et the values calculated were the average of the pixel values within each watershed for discrete data sets such as land cover the histogram of how many pixel values of each type were present in the watershed was measured 2 2 equation tests a wide range of equation forms relating the part separated quick flow runoff data for a watershed to the potential explanatory variables measured within that watershed was explored because the part data are generated from data at the watershed outlet the input data for the equation form comparisons e g average precipitation values are averages over all pixels within the watershed as well the tested functional forms included many based on the literature forms described in table 1 the subset of table 1 equations selected for testing were those for which we had adequate data sets for the required input variables they also included many alternative ways of relating the explanatory variables to the data to include discrete categorical data such as the surficial geology cover or land cover classifications in the regressions the approach taken for a selected equation was to first measure the overall adjusted r 2 for all watersheds and then to fit the quick flow equation separately only for watersheds containing each surficial geology type the fitting parameters of individual surficial geology types were saved unless the individual fit correlation did not provide an improvement over the overall fit in which case the overall fitting parameters were saved for that type in cases where using the specific surficial geology type did not improve the fit geology type was not serving as a key explanatory parameter in the basin to compile the estimates for a given watershed to compare the prediction with the observed value the predictions using fit parameters for each surficial geology type were weighted by the fraction of the watershed area covered by that type and summed the equations were tested using the curve fitting function in python s scipy package jones et al 2001 this curve fitting function uses the levenberg marquardt nonlinear least squares optimization algorithm to find coefficients that minimize the root mean squared error rmse to fit the data to a given functional form levenberg 1944 marquardt 1963 for all tested equations separate calibration coefficients were used for each month of the year which allowed seasonal variability to be evaluated the statistical metrics we used to compare equation performance were 1 r 2 the square of the correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed monthly quick flow runoff values 2 an adjusted r 2 to account for the number of variables in the equation being tested defined as r adj 2 1 1 r 2 n 1 n v 1 where n is the sample size and v is the number of explanatory variables 3 the rmse and 4 the akaike information criterion aic which compares model performance adjusted for the number of equation parameters where the simplified definition used here assuming normally distributed errors and linear models is aic 2 k n log rss n where k is the number of model parameters and rss is the residual sum of squares and a lower number indicates a simpler and better performing equation this suite of metrics rather than any one in particular was used to compare the relative performance of the different equations and to select one for application to further test the selected equation and generate calibration coefficients the monthly quick flow runoff data set was randomly split into 80 and 20 of the data for calibration and validation respectively this split was randomly repeated 10 times and the final calibration coefficients were averages over the 10 calibrations 2 3 equation application mapped estimates of each pixel s contribution to quick flow referred to here as contributed quick flow were generated for the conus at a 1 km scale using the selected equation including areas within and outside of the watersheds used for calibration through the application of the selected equation to the spatially continuous data sets for the explanatory variables each contributed quick flow map pixel s value represents the portion of the precipitation into that pixel area that ultimately contributes to the quick flow component of the water budget we use the term contributed quick flow to distinguish the mapped values from actual quick flow fluxes on the ground though the equation was calibrated with data collected at the watershed scale it was applied at the pixel scale pixel area of 1 km2 to capture within watershed variation based on variation in the driving explanatory variables although we recognize that the pixel scale accuracy is likely lower than the watershed scale calibration correlation the approach of developing an equation using watershed scale data and applying it at the pixel scale is justified based on use in other studies sauquet et al 2000 sanford and selnick 2013 reitz et al 2017a this approach does not account for quick flow fluxes between neighboring pixels quick flow quantities do show strong systematic within watershed variation with significant inter pixel transfers and downstream locations collecting greater volumes the approach taken here does not capture these inter pixel dynamics therefore the produced quick flow maps should not be interpreted as representing quick flow values accumulated across the landscape at these pixel locations for our purposes of water budget estimation a map showing contributed quick flow values can be preferable to a map that estimates accumulated quick flow values the benefit is the ability to sum the local quick flow contributions over arbitrary spatial scales or to combine them with estimates of local precipitation and et to yield local recharge quantity estimates the equation was applied to produce maps for each month within each year after applying the equation we noted outlier locations where the contributed quick flow generated by the fit was less than zero or rarely greater than the incoming precipitation for values of contributed quick flow runoff less than zero it is physically unrealistic for these values to be negative but it is plausible that the relationship between precipitation on the x axis and quick flow runoff on the y axis would have a positive x intercept due to areas with very low precipitation being consumed by et or recharge without producing quick flow runoff this positive x intercept would lead to the equation predicting negative runoff values in locations with very low precipitation negative values were therefore set to zero to account for this effect though it is possible that the contributed quick flow runoff could exceed precipitation due to groundwater influx into the watershed it is unlikely that the regression would capture these effects it is also possible that the precipitation data could be the source of error but the contributed quick flow runoff estimates were deemed more likely to be in error and were thus bounded between zero and the monthly precipitation to explore and evaluate the produced maps we created maps showing the magnitude of errors of the predictions within the calibrating watersheds across the conus we plotted the equation predictions against the quick flow runoff data for three individual watersheds in different regions of the country to provide a metric of uncertainty for the gridded maps we also measured the standard error of the estimate between the watershed scale part data and the gridded monthly maps measured within the watersheds where the standard error of the estimate is defined as s est rss n 2 finally we compared the monthly gridded maps with a previously published map of long term annual average contributed quick flow runoff for the time period 2000 2013 by summing the monthly maps to annual totals for the same time period 3 results 3 1 equation comparison equations that were based on forms found in the literature table 1 for which we had adequate input data sets were tested first the results of these tests are listed in table 2 where the equations are listed in order of reference to the equation numbers in the literature review of table 1 these were tested for monthly quick flow runoff and the reported statistics are based on comparison with data at the monthly time step the monthly statistical metrics r 2 etc were evaluated using the complete data set of all 209 448 individual months of data for the 1301 test watersheds i e using 17 454 data points per month a variety of additional regression equations relating the collected explanatory variables to the quick flow runoff values were also explored several of the highest performing equations are listed in table 3 along with their r 2 adjusted r 2 rmse bias and aic for lack of a feasible methodology for testing all possible equation forms the forms in table 3 were developed in this study through a trial and error process we do not therefore claim that this list is any sort of exhaustive representation of possible empirical equation forms or that forms with better explanatory power do not exist only that these were the higher performing equation forms of the ones that we tested in this study the equation testing was further extended to include surficial geology classifications using the methods described in section 2 2 and similar to that which produced eq 12 in reitz et al 2017a b this refinement was tested on a subset of the equations in tables 2 and 3 the table 2 equations eqs 1 and 10 were selected as representing the common curve number approach and an example of another literature derived form with a relatively high adjusted r 2 the table 3 equations selected eqs 27 29 were those with the highest adjusted r 2 and lowest aic results are summarized in table 4 in all cases the inclusion of surficial geology data increased the adjusted r 2 of the equation tested a similar classification algorithm was tested for land cover classifications but this distinction did not enhance the equation performances splitting the datasets by conditions of frozen non frozen mean watershed temperature of zero degrees celsius zhang et al 2003 calibrating the equations separately for the two populations and recompiling did not result in increased correlations the calibrating split by conditions of low and high precipitation watersheds also did not increase the correlations finally variations were tested in which the precipitation variable was replaced by either precipitation minus et precipitation plus minus snow water equivalent change or precipitation minus et plus minus snow water equivalent change though it was plausible that accounting for available water after the reductions for et or snow accumulation or increases from snow melt would have increased the accuracy of the estimates when tested these options did not increase the correlation coefficients examples of this lack of improved explanatory power are shown in table s1 using the same five equation forms that were tested for surficial geology type inclusion

individual fit for a total of 1064 coefficients is provided in table s2 in the supplementary information along with the r 2 associated with each fit the surficial geology types that tended to produce the highest correlations were coastal fine grained and eolian in cases where using the specific surficial geology type did not improve the fit geology type did not seem to act as a key explanatory parameter for the watershed s quick flow runoff the correlations for this equation for individual months are listed in table 5 with an average monthly calibration r 2 of 0 63 and validation r 2 of 0 65 the data sets for each month were split into calibration and validation populations as described in the methods section and the correlations of each are listed in table 5 there was not an obvious trend of correlation with time of the year the highest correlations occurred for the october fit and the lowest for the april fit though the correlation values listed in table 5 for individual monthly fits are not perfect falling mostly between 0 6 and 0 7 they do significantly outperform the other equation types tested against the monthly timescale data for comparison the monthly correlations for four of the literature derived equation options are listed in table s3 of the supplementary information to compare behaviors of the selected equation by month and by surficial geology type table 6 was compiled to show the values for each month under average conditions in this table the values for average conditions are estimated from eq 34 by using the average conditions of p pl k and sl reducing those ratios to average values to 1 to obtain average runoff values for each of the 15 surficial geology types as gg hg jg low to high values are highlighted in gradients from red to white to blue the comparison shows lower values predicted in the summer months with some variation by surficial geology type the volcanic type stands out as having low values throughout the year 3 2 contributed quick flow runoff maps the selected equation eq 34 was applied to the conus using the spatially continuous maps of slope surficial geology type soil hydraulic conductivity and precipitation described in section 2 1 the maps shown here are averages over 2000 2015 individual monthly maps within each year were also produced and are available for download in the data release specified in the acknowledgements and data section fig 2 shows averages over the spring season and for the individual months of march april and may fig 3 shows the summer monthly and seasonal averages fig 4 shows the fall monthly and seasonal averages and fig 5 shows the winter monthly and seasonal averages the runoff variation with time in the year generally shows patterns of high values in the winter and spring with lower values in the summer and fall consistent with the average values shown in table 6 the progression of the average value across the conus through the year is shown in fig 6 maps showing the average differences and percent differences between the watershed scale predicted values and the part generated quick flow runoff data points are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively the maps illustrate the spatial variability in the agreement between the predictions and the observations overall the average bias between the predicted and observed values fell within a narrow range thirty percent of the values had an average magnitude difference less than 2 mm month and 66 had an average magnitude difference less than 5 mm month some regional patterns included generally positive monthly biases in texas and florida and negative biases in west virginia the monthly difference expressed as a percentage of the observed value from part showed high values particularly in the southwest where the observed values are very small we also plotted the results of the watershed scale predicted values for three randomly selected watersheds in different regions in the conus with one in arizona one in south carolina and one in minnesota the plots are shown in fig s1 to provide an estimate of uncertainty for the gridded monthly maps we also measured the mean values of the gridded monthly maps to compare with the original part quick flow data a scatter plot of the comparison is shown in fig 8 the standard error of the estimate was computed to be 0 0159 m mo finally we compared the monthly gridded maps with a previously published map of long term annual average quick flow runoff for the 2000 2013 time period reitz et al 2017a by summing the monthly maps to annual totals and averaging over the same time period we found general consistency between the two long term annual average maps the two maps and a map of their differences are shown in the supplementary information fig s2 4 discussion 4 1 overview of quick flow runoff treatment equations for quick flow runoff are required for many hydrologic applications including the development of water budget models quick flow runoff equations in the literature are generally proposed based on simple physical reasoning such as through the curve number or other formulations that conceptualize soil moisture voids to be filled before runoff generation ponce and hawkins 1996 koster and suarez 1996 mishra and singh 2004 the same general physical concepts are implemented through a variety of equation options table 1 in some cases testing of the equation form and calibration is shown ponce and hawkins 1996 reitz et al 2017a though regions of testing can be spatially limited compared with the eventual application of the equation markstrom et al 2015 in other cases testing and calibration are not shown only the general physical reasoning and proposed equation form koster and suarez 1996 koster and milly 1997 boughton and chiew 2007 comparisons of quick flow runoff equation form and performance before selection and application of an equation to produce runoff estimates are rare our review of equation forms for the quick flow component of streamflow yielded a wide range of forms in use of the major water balance models applied at spatial scales of the conus or larger no two used the same treatment for quick flow runoff none reported testing of this component with comparisons against quick flow runoff data from across large spatial scales or comparisons against other equation options wide application of equations for quick flow runoff based on general physical reasoning or locally calibrated empirical equations are currently common in national and global scale models of the hydrologic cycle koster and suarez 1996 liang and xie 2001 niu et al 2005 the accumulation of errors resulting from theoretical uncertainties can be seen when results from different water balance models using the same input datasets are compared and found to give significantly different results for example xia et al 2012 shows estimates of total streamflow varying by a factor of two in the long term national scale annual average across the four main models run in the national land data assimilation system nldas mitchell et al 2004 we acknowledge that some of the equations described here were developed for the event timescale and that water balance models run at shorter timescales such as hours could potentially track event scale runoff response and quantities like transient soil moisture dynamics which are not captured here testing these forms with monthly timescale data is not therefore a definitive test of the usefulness of these equations we primarily included them for the lack of availability of monthly or longer timescale quick flow runoff equations for comparison we targeted the monthly timescale as a useful one that is particularly underquantified readily analyzed with available data sets and has high potential for dependency on monthly variation in explanatory variables such as precipitation the monthly estimates produced here based on a parsimonious set of readily available explanatory variables will be useful for projecting and backcasting monthly water budgets in combination with estimates of et they can also be used to produce estimates of monthly recharge which will be useful for applications in groundwater modeling 4 2 equation testing and selection one caveat for our equation testing and application results is that the distribution of gages for testing and calibration was weighted toward the eastern conus where a greater number of gages met the selection criteria therefore estimates in regions without many watersheds as shown in fig 1 will likely show more uncertainty our use of part generated data as the truth value against which equations were evaluated and calibrated presents a source of uncertainty in that part provides only one estimate of quick flow runoff and without access to true quick flow data without estimation assumptions we acknowledge that what is actually being evaluated here is the ability of the equations to reproduce part generated data though the absolute values of the metrics of equation performance may well vary with the use of different hydrograph separation methods the evaluation of relative equation performance is likely to be more robust particularly since the calibrating coefficients are not constrained here but only the general form is tested if however the differences between part and another method are systematic in a specific way that favors one equation form over another our conclusions could be altered depending on the hydrograph separation method choice we also stress the point that the application at the pixel scale of these equations results in quick flow runoff values that are not designed or intended to reflect inter pixel transfers such as downstream flow accumulation the values targeted with the application to spatially continuous data sets are the portion of the precipitation entering each pixel that ultimately contributes to the quick flow runoff component of the water budget application at this pixel scale is uniquely advantageous to efforts to constrain other water budget components for which knowledge of the local water budget contribution at the pixel scale is useful such as recharge another caveat for use of these data sets is that our analysis does not control for nonstationarity which could introduce error especially if there are significant changes in variables that impact quick flow runoff but are not included as explanatory variables in our selected equation for example it is plausible that long term trends in temperature could impact et and indirectly affect quick flow runoff quantities we acknowledge this limitation particularly as a caveat for use of these methods in estimating quick flow runoff far outside of the time period of testing and calibration also we reiterate that we do not claim that our list of tested equations is an exhaustive representation of all possible equation forms or that forms with better explanatory power do not exist but only that these were the higher performing equation forms of the ones that we tested in this study an advantage of the selected equation is that it depends on variables that are either available historically such as monthly mean precipitation or are fairly static in time such as slope and surficial geology type the equation can therefore be applied to produce estimates of quick flow runoff for any month for which precipitation data are available for that month and the previous month though the approach does not map inter pixel flow routing the usefulness of the previous month s precipitation as an explanatory variable is likely due to the fact that routing and some time delay between precipitation events and surface runoff watershed outflow can occur so that there can be an increasing or decreasing effect of a higher or lower previous month s precipitation particularly in its final days onto a pixel on that pixel s contribution to the watershed quick flow value though the effects of hydrological events in the last days of the month cannot be explicitly expressed by this equation at the monthly timestep the additional explanatory power of including the previous month s precipitation suggests the possible indirect effect the other potential explanatory variables that were tested for inclusion but ultimately excluded for lack of improved predictive power provide interesting information as well the testing of the modification of the available water supply for runoff by et and or by snow melt or accumulation did not improve the estimates over using precipitation alone as shown in the examples in table s1 the lack of improved explanatory power with the inclusion of these data was a nonintuitive result with a possible explanation that the errors inherent in those data sets were high enough that they masked any real effect of et or snow melt accumulation on altering the water available for quick flow runoff during that month the monthly and seasonal maps produced through application of the selected equation showed regional and temporal patterns that can inform our understanding of quick flow runoff behavior for use in hydrologic modeling or comparison efforts the calculated standard error of the estimate of 0 0159 m mo can be used as a measure of uncertainty to be associated with the monthly gridded maps the trend of 3 or 4 times higher quick flow runoff values in the winter and spring as compared with the summer and fall is perhaps unintuitive considering the generally higher precipitation values in the summer a significantly higher fraction of the precipitation is apportioned to quick flow runoff in the winter this observed trend could be partially due to cold weather effects such as frozen ground or snow melt or due to warm weather increases in et claiming higher fractions of the water supply with lower et in the winter more water remains for streamflow and for increasing the soil water content which can lead to quicker times for soils to reach full water capacity during rainfall events and greater quick flow runoff also the soil hydraulic conductivity is impacted by both the temperature of water where water at 0 c has a higher viscosity than water at 25 c by a factor of 2 korson et al 1969 and by the relative permeability muskat and meres 1936 where an order of magnitude change has been observed in laboratory measured infiltration rates when temperature was varied between 2 c and 25 c constantz 1982 our results are consistent with these findings where a substantial decrease in the infiltration rate at lower temperatures would lead to more quickly saturated soils and increased quick flow runoff this work provides a novel validation that this effect observed at the laboratory scale can also be shown to occur empirically at the regional and continental scales the associated data release for this paper reitz and sanford 2019 contains the monthly contributed quick flow runoff maps presented and described in this paper as well as those produced through application of the selected equation to monthly precipitation data back to 1895 5 conclusions in this paper we have provided an overview of the treatment of monthly quick flow runoff formulations in the literature we have particularly targeted the monthly timestep because of its usefulness for backcasting and forecasting quick flow runoff values using readily available data sets the appropriateness for many hydrologic applications such as groundwater modeling and the practical ability to average over more complex dynamics at smaller temporal scales while still capturing seasonal variability in flows the testing of functional forms drawn from the literature yielded a range in performance and the inclusion of several new regression options for relating explanatory variables to quick flow runoff yielded several that performed better an equation was selected based on the suite of tested statistical metrics of equation performance particularly the adjusted r 2 and aic and was applied to monthly timescale data to produce monthly timescale maps of the contributions to the quick flow runoff water budget component these monthly maps were presented and explored here for the 2000 2015 timeframe equations for quick flow runoff water budget contributions are sparse in general and the forms in active use in hydrologic applications and modeling efforts show a wide range equations are particularly lacking for the monthly timescale our review of existing methods indicated a need for studies where monthly timescale quick flow runoff data at a conus scale are used to test a suite of equation options the testing of equations linking different components of the water cycle is increasingly needed as the technical ability to build national and global scale water balance models has grown rapidly in recent years outpacing the rate at which different water cycle component equations are being thoroughly vetted across the same spatial scales the comparisons here have focused on the quick flow runoff volume prediction aspect of the water balance we demonstrated in the overview that no two of the major water balance models are currently treating quick flow runoff prediction in the same way that some of the equations used were developed using regional instead of national scale data and that many equation forms are assumptions or heuristics based on physical reasoning that make intuitive sense but are not tested and are often simplified similar comparisons are needed for all linking equations in the water cycle including et soil moisture and base flow it need not be the responsibility of those building these water balance models to also develop and test new equations for each component as there is already substantial technical work to be done to build and run these models the hydrologic community can work to better provide such modeling efforts with
