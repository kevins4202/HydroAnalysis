9610,in order to alleviate the shortage of water resources for cotton gossypium hirsutum l planting in xinjiang of china a reasonable amount of nitrogen application under brackish water irrigation was sought a two year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity on seed cotton yield nitrogen partial factor productivity and fiber quality in xinjiang under mulched drip irrigation in 2019 and 2020 in this study we selected four nitrogen application rates i e 100 200 300 and 400 kg n ha 1 respectively and three irrigation water salinity i e 1 3 and 5 g l 1 respectively our results showed that nitrogen application rates and irrigation water salinity significantly affected the seed cotton yield nitrogen partial factor productivity micronaire fiber length fiber strength uniformity index and elongation as the salinity of irrigation water increased seed cotton yield and nitrogen partial factor productivity increased first and then decreased micronaire decreased but fiber length fiber strength uniformity index and elongation increased moreover seed cotton yield micronaire fiber length fiber strength uniformity index and elongation increased first and then decreased and nitrogen partial factor productivity decreased with the amount of nitrogen application the optimal combination of nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity were 200 kg n ha 1 and 5 g l 1 by principal component analysis we concluded that the normalized relative value of seed cotton yield and comprehensive evaluation value was 0 85 when the nitrogen application rate and the irrigation water salinity were 197 04 237 94 kg n ha 1 and 3 60 3 88 g l 1 respectively keywords brackish water drip irrigation cotton yield cotton quality 1 introduction cotton which was largely planted in china the united states india pakistan and brazil was the main cash crop in the world wang et al 2012 meyer 2019 and played an important role in agriculture industrial production and economic trade of cotton producing countries hulsekemp et al 2014 li et al 2019a xinjiang which located in northwest china is characterized by a temperate continental climate and very suitable for the growth of cotton hou et al 2021a it has become the main cotton producing areas in china yang et al 2020a in 2019 the cotton planting area in xinjiang was 2 5 106 ha and output was 5 0 106 t accounting for 76 08 of the national cotton planting area and 84 94 of the total cotton output csyb 2019 xinjiang is also the largest widest range most typical arid area in china with annual rainfall of 50 250 mm and evaporation of more than 1000 mm wang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c 2019d water shortage limits agricultural development in xinjiang wu et al 2014 guo and shen 2016 yang et al 2019 2020b therefore it is very important to seek alternative water resources to irrigate cotton the underground brackish water reserve is about 1 72 109 m3 a 1 in xinjiang which accounting for 40 70 of the exploitable underground brackish water in the inland areas of northwest china in order to solve the problem of water resources shortage in xinjiang drip irrigation with brackish water under film has been introduced and popularized yang et al 2020a previous studies showed that drip irrigation under film increased water and fertilizer use efficiency and crop yield but reduced soil water evaporation kang et al 2010 li et al 2020 in addition some observations indicated that brackish water could replace the fresh water to irrigate the crop when the irrigation water salinity was within a certain extent wang et al 2011a 2011b jin et al 2016 however bouksila et al 2013 found that the use of brackish water for irrigation will cause the salt accumulation in the soil resulting in crop physiological drought and decrease in soil oxygen content root anaerobic respiration and accumulation of toxic substances additionally use of brackish water irrigation will damage plant lipids and proteins inhibit crop growth and decrease the water absorption capacity of crop roots affect crop yield and quality parida et al 2005 wang et al 2015 ren et al 2021 therefore the understandings of the responses of water and fertilizer use efficiency and crop yield to different irrigation water salinity could provide a better explanation of the mechanism underlying the brackish water irrigation nitrogen participates in the physiological process of crops to resist environmental stress salt stress and further affects crop yield and quality lawlor 2002 chen et al 2010 reported that increasing nitrogen application could decrease the adverse effects of salt on soil in low salt treatment lower nitrogen fertilizer application reduced soil nitrogen content which did not meet nitrogen demand of crops further weakening the photosynthesis capacity and reducing the yield devkota et al 2013 li et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 showed that when the nitrogen application rate was 180 270 kg ha 1 it would not lead to the accumulation of soil salt in the root zone of crops when using brackish water for irrigation excessive nitrogen application would cause more alkaline cations in the soil increase soil salinity and inhibit the absorption of nitrogen by roots and thus reduce crop yields min et al 2014 han et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 found that salt water irrigation reduced cotton fiber quality by reducing micronaire appropriate nitrogen application rate could improve cotton fiber quality while excessive nitrogen application would reduce cotton fiber quality sui et al 2017 previous observations mainly focused on the effects of single factors such as nitrogen application rate or irrigation water salinity on cotton yield and fiber quality or the interaction of nitrogen and salt on the soil physical and chemical properties and the growth and yield of seed cotton but few studies showed the effect of interaction of nitrogen and salt on cotton fiber quality the study aimed to explore the effects of different nitrogen application rates and irrigation water salinity on seed cotton yield and fiber quality under mulch drip irrigation and to fit the optimal range of nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity to reach maximum seed cotton yield together with fiber quality therefore we used comprehensive evaluation method to search for optimal combination of nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity the conclusion will provide a scientific basis for the rational nitrogen application rate of drip irrigation cotton under the film with brackish water in xinjiang 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the field experiment was conducted at the key laboratory of modern water saving irrigation of xinjiang

water was used for irrigation during the seedling stage other growth periods were irrigated according to the test design table 2 the agronomic measures such as weeding and spraying medicines are consistent with the local planting habits 3 measurement methods 3 1 seed cotton yield and npfp at the boll opening stage october 7 we selected three plots 1 m 2 m in each field for picking and then converted the yield in the experiment plot into the actual agricultural land in this study we used the converted seed cotton yield nitrogen partial factor productivity npfp was determined according to the equation as follows ierna et al 2011 1 npfp y n where y and n are the seed cotton yield kg ha 1 and the nitrogen application rate kg n ha 1 respectively 3 2 fiber quality at the boll opening stage

agriculture and rural affairs anyang henan china the fiber quality indexes include micronaire fiber length fiber strength uniformity index and elongation in this study the cotton fiber detector high volume instruments hvi 1000 uster switzerland was used to test fiber quality and the cotton fiber calibrator hvicc was used for calibration u s department of agriculture china fiber inspection bureau

significantly affected the seed cotton yield and npfp fig 3 and table 3 the seed cotton yield and npfp in each treatment of nitrogen application first increased and then decreased with the increase of irrigation water salinity in 2019 and 2020 fig 3 and table 3 for instance the seed cotton yield and npfp increased by 0 58 and 0 59 in n1s2 10 29 and 10 29 in n1s3 compared with n1s1 in 2019 increased by 13 36 and 13 35 in n2s2 1 03 and 1 04 in n2s3 compared with n2s1 increased by 3 29 and 3 29 in n3s2 23 20 and 23 21 in n3s3 compared with n3s1 increased by 5 83 and 5 84 in n4s2 4 82 and 4 82 in n4s3 compared with n4s1 respectively however the seed cotton yield in each salinity of irrigation water significantly first increased and then significantly decreased with the increase of nitrogen application in 2019 and 2020 fig 3 and table 3 the seed cotton yield increased by 6 54 in s1n2 10 91 in s1n3 and 15 11 in s1n4 compared with s1n1 in 2019 increased by 20 07 in s2n2 13 88 in s2n3 and 8 60 in s2n4 compared with s2n1 increased by 17 54 in s3n2 5 06 in s3n3 and 7 82 in s3n4 respectively but the npfp in each salinity of irrigation water significantly decreased with increasing nitrogen application fig 3 and table 3 the npfp decreased by 46 73 in s1n2 63 03 in s1n3 and 78 28 in s1n4 compared with s1n1 in 2019 decreased by 39 97 in s2n2 62 03 in s2n3 and 77 15 in s2n4 compared with s2n1 decreased by 41 24 in s3n2 68 35 in s3n3 and 76 95 in s3n4 respectively in this study the seed cotton yield was highest in s2n2 treatment and the npfp was highest in s2n1 treatment respectively 4 2 micronaire length and strength of fiber uniformity index and elongation the nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity significantly affected the quality indexes of cotton i e micronaire length strength of fiber uniformity index and elongation in 2019 and 2020 fig 4 and table 3 in addition the interaction of nitrogen application rate with irrigation water salinity significantly affected the micronaire and length of fiber in 2019 and 2020 fig 4 and table 3 however the interaction of nitrogen application rate with irrigation water salinity did not significantly affect the strength uniformity index and elongation of fiber the micronaire of fiber in each treatment of nitrogen application decreased but the length and strength of fiber in each treatment of nitrogen application increased with the increase of irrigation water salinity in 2019 and 2020 fig 4 and table 3 additionally the uniformity index and elongation of fiber in each treatment of nitrogen application increased with the increase of irrigation water salinity in 2019 and 2020 p 0 05 fig 4 and table 3 the micronaire length and strength of fiber uniformity index and elongation in each salinity of irrigation water first significantly increased and then significantly decreased with the increase of nitrogen application in 2019 and 2020 fig 4 and table 3 the length and strength of fiber uniformity index and elongation in each salinity of irrigation water significantly increased with increase from n1 to n2 of nitrogen application but significantly decreased with increase from n2 to n4 of nitrogen application in 2020 fig 4 and table 3 however the length and strength of fiber in each salinity of irrigation water increased with increase from n1 to n2 of nitrogen application but significantly decreased with increase from n2 to n4 of nitrogen application in 2019 while uniformity index and elongation increased with increase from n1 to n3 of nitrogen application but decreased with increase from n3 to n4 of nitrogen application in 2019 furthermore our result showed that the highest value in the micronaire occurred in s1n2 treatment but the highest values in the strength of fiber uniformity index and elongation were investigated in s3n2 treatment in 2019 and 2020 and the highest fiber length was s3n3 treatment in 2019 and s3n2 treatment in 2020 it indicated that the interaction of irrigation water salinity with the nitrogen application rate decreased micronaire but increased length and strength of fiber uniformity index and elongation 4 3 determination of optimal amount of nitrogen application rate and salinity of irrigation water in this study we used the principal component analysis method to comprehensively analyze and evaluate the cotton fiber quality index and further truly and comprehensively reflect the quality of cotton there is no difference among micronaire fiber length fiber strength uniformity index and elongation in 2019 and 2020 p 0 05 table 4 in 2019 and 2020 fiber length was significantly positively correlated with fiber strength uniformity index p 0 01 and elongation p 0 05 in addition uniformity index was significantly positively related to elongation p 0 01 in this study the optimal treatment i e interaction of amount of nitrogen application rate with salinity of irrigation water for cotton fiber quality was s3n2 treatment with a comprehensive score of 3 310 and 3 000 in 2019 and 2020 respectively the worst treatment was s1n1 treatment with a score of 3 960 and 3 730 respectively table 5 in addition the comprehensive score of s3 level was higher than s1 and s2 levels indicating that the appropriate increase of irrigation water salinity was prone to the improvement of the comprehensive quality of cotton fiber when irrigation water salinity was at the same level the appropriate nitrogen application rate was conducive to the improvement of the comprehensive fiber quality 4 4 determination of optimal nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity interval in cotton field with drip irrigation under film the multiple nonlinear regression analysis was carried out on two year seed cotton yield and comprehensive quality evaluation value to pursue the high yield and high efficiency of drip irrigated cotton under mulch the nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity significantly affected the dependent variables which the determination coefficient was higher than 0 81 table 6 furthermore the interaction of nitrogen application rate with irrigation water salinity on seed cotton yield and comprehensive evaluation value of cotton quality was an upward convex surface in 2019 and 2020 the effects of nitrogen application rate on seed cotton yield were similar to the effects of irrigation water salinity which seed cotton yield increased first and then decreased with increase of nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity the comprehensive evaluation value of cotton quality showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing with more nitrogen application which also was growing up with the increase of irrigation water salinity fig 5 in this study when nitrogen application rate was 229 71 kg n ha 1 and irrigation water salinity was 2 49 g l 1 in 2019 the maximum seed cotton yield and comprehensive evaluation value of cotton quality were 7035 50 kg ha 1 and 0 91 respectively when nitrogen application rate was 230 59 kg n ha 1 and irrigation water salinity was 2 48 g l 1 in 2020 the maximum seed cotton yield and comprehensive evaluation value of cotton quality were 6890 10 kg ha 1 and 0 97 respectively when the maximum comprehensive quality evaluation value was 3 50 in 2019 the corresponding nitrogen application rate irrigation water salinity and seed cotton yield were 250 98 kg n ha 1 5 00 g l 1 and 6268 33 kg ha 1 respectively when the maximum comprehensive quality evaluation value was 3 04 in 2020 the corresponding nitrogen application rate irrigation water salinity and seed cotton yield were 226 86 kg n ha 1 5 00 g l 1 and 6127 96 kg ha 1 respectively table 7 in general seed cotton yield and comprehensive evaluation value of cotton quality did not synchronously reach the maximum value therefore we normalized the values of seed cotton yield and comprehensive evaluation value of cotton quality and further obtained the relationship between the normalized relative value of seed cotton yield and comprehensive quality evaluation value with nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity in 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 6 based on comprehensive evaluation of seed cotton yield and principal component evaluation values in 2019 and 2020 the seed cotton yield and comprehensive quality evaluation values overlapped and generated an oblique area when the relative value was 0 85 therefore the relative value of 0 85 was selected as a reasonable evaluation standard to obtain the optimal seed cotton yield and quality fig 7 in this study when the normalized relative value of seed cotton yield and comprehensive evaluation value was 0 85 and seed cotton yield and comprehensive evaluation value generated an oblique area the optimal nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity interval were 197 04 237 94 kg n ha 1 and 3 60 3 88 g l 1 respectively 5 discussion 5 1 effects of different nitrogen application rates and irrigation water salinity on seed cotton yield and npfp in this study the seed cotton yield and npfp in each treatment of nitrogen application first increased and then decreased with the increase of irrigation water salinity on the one hand salt will enhance the water and nitrogen absorption rate of the plant roots and its photosynthetic capacity when there is less salt content in the irrigation water 3 g l 1 further causing increases in seed cotton yield and npfp hodge et al 2009 sobhani et al 2014 on the other hand the concentration of salt ions in soil exceeded the salt concentration threshold 0 3 of the crop root zone with the increase of irrigation water salinity 3 g l 1 which leads to decrease in the root osmotic potential and soil structure stability and adversely affecting the cell water relationship thus the water absorption and nitrogen absorption capacity of crop roots were reduced which further lead to the decrease of seed cotton yield and npfp mansour 1994 rengasamy 2010 li et al 2018a 2018b lima et al 2018 che et al 2021 ren et al 2021 our results were consistent with the findings that seed cotton yield and npfp increased when the irrigation water salinity was less than 3 g l 1 yang et al 2020a but decreased when the irrigation water salinity was greater than 3 g l 1 in shihezi city xinjiang in 2018 yang et al 2020a che et al 2021 nitrogen fertilizer not only promoted crop growth and development but also played an indispensable role in the formation of crop yield and quality melek et al 2019 we found that seed cotton yield first increased and then decreased with the increase of nitrogen application rate although lower nitrogen levels restricted plant growth higher nitrogen levels only increased yield in a certain range albornoz and lietn 2015 because the appropriate nitrogen application rate can alleviate the salt hazard and thus be prone the growth of crops in a suitable growth environment zeng et al 2015 khan et al 2017 ma et al 2017 the application of nitrogen fertilizer reduced the soil ph but increased the dissolution of soil ca2 further reducing the salt damage caused by the competition between na and ca2 this was because the application of nitrogen fertilizer did not increase the content of na in the soil on the contrary the nitrification of nitrogen fertilizer led to soil acidification and thus a decrease in ph value dong et al 2021 at the same time the nitrification of nitrogen fertilizers will result in the removal of alkaline cations in neutral soils xie et al 2019 additionally the salt concentration in the crop root zone reduced due to offsetting excess chloride with nitrogen xu et al 1999 che et al 2021 our results were in agreement with that the seed cotton yield increased first and then decreased with the increase of nitrogen application in the korla area of xinjiang in 2018 and 2019 hou et al 2021a in this study the npfp in each salinity of irrigation water significantly decreased with increasing nitrogen application the results were attributed to that nitrogen nutrients were more prone to be absorbed due to nitrogen demand of crop growth when the nitrogen application rate was lower thus causing increase in npfp zotarelli et al 2009 however when nitrogen application rate was excessively added into soils some nitrogen fertilizer was not absorbed by the crop and further remained in soils and the residual nitrogen rate in soils was more than the absorption rate of plant wang et al 2018 which resulted in decrease in npfp the explanation was supported by our findings that with the increase of nitrogen application rate seed cotton yield increased as the nitrogen application amount was 100 300 kg n ha 1 but decreased as the nitrogen application amount was 300 400 kg n ha 1 the result was consistent with zhang et al 2012 who showed that the npfp reduced with increasing the amount of nitrogen application 5 2 effects of different nitrogen application rates and irrigation water salinity on cotton quality fiber quality which reflected the combination characteristic of micronaire fiber length fiber strength uniformity index and elongation is affected by genotype and environmental conditions such as irrigation fertilization irrigation water quality and agronomic measures girma et al 2007 bilalis et al 2010 papastylianou and argyrokastritis 2014 our results showed that micronaire reduced and fiber length and fiber strength increased with increase of the irrigation water salinity salt affected the growth and development of cotton by inhibiting the division of cotton cells and destroying the osmotic potential in the body thereby decreasing the quality of cotton fiber aslam et al 2011 the explanation was supported by previous observations that salt had an inhibitory effect on cotton fiber quality zhang et al 2013a 2013b peng et al 2016a 2016b as the salt content increased the micronaire decreased razzouk and whittington 1991 wu et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 fiber length and strength increased ye et al 1997 wu et al 2010 our results showed that micronaire fiber length and strength first increased and then decreased with the increase of nitrogen application the results could be attributed to that small nitrogen application reduced the photosynthetic rate of cotton thereby reduced the activities of beneficial enzymes such as vacuum invertase and sucrose synthase increased the activities of destructive enzymes such as hydrolase and cellulase and then resulted in the weakening of fiber development and the reduction of fiber quality hu et al 2019 rehman and farooq 2019 however excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer enhanced the nitrate in soil and reduced the osmotic potential of the crop which affected fiber cell expansion and carbohydrate metabolism to interfere with fiber development and resulted in poor fiber quality gao et al 2020 witt et al 2020 our results were in accordance with that the micronaire fiber length and strength first increased and then decreased with increasing nitrogen application rate in korla xinjiang in 2018 and 2019 hou et al 2021a generally the fiber quality of cotton increased with increasing uniformity index zhang et al 2017 showed that the uniformity index increased with the increase of salt concentration in water this further confirmed our results with the increase of irrigation water salinity the uniformity index increased we found that the uniformity index of s3 treatment in 2019 and s2 treatment in 2020 were the largest and there was no significant difference between s2 and s3 treatment in two years with the increase of nitrogen application rate the uniformity index first increased and then decreased elongation is one of the indicators affecting fiber quality and there are few studies at present we showed that increasing irrigation water salinity can increase the elongation this was consistent with the results of zhang et al 2014 the elongation in 2019 was generally lower than that in 2020 which may be caused by the leaching of the salinity of irrigation water in the test field due to the large rainfall in 2019 additionally elongation first increased and then decreased with the increase of nitrogen application rate this was consistent with the results of hou et al 2021a the maximum elongation was obtained in s3n2 treatment in 2019 and 2020 which were 6 23 and 6 83 respectively within 2 years the interaction of nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity significantly affected micronaire and fiber length but did not affect fiber strength uniformity index and elongation this is because micronaire and fiber length were more sensitive to the physiological water and salinity deficit stress compared with fiber strength uniformity index and elongation abdelraheem and zhang 2016 therefore increasing nitrogen fertilizer alleviated the interference of salt on the expansion pressure of fiber cells during the development of micronaire and fiber length but reduced micronaire and increase fiber length ullah et al 2017 our results showed that the maximum micronaire value occurred in the s1n2 treatment while the maximum fiber strength uniformity index and elongation occurred in the s3n2 treatment in 2019 and 2020 the maximum fiber length was s3n3 treatment in 2019 and s3n2 treatment in 2020 therefore we should use low salinity brackish water for irrigation and appropriately increase the amount of nitrogen application to obtain higher micronaire in the planting however we need to use high salt brackish water for irrigation and apply higher nitrogen application rate to get higher fiber length and strength uniformity index and elongation 5 3 determination of optimal nitrogen application rate and salinity interval of irrigation water the fiber quality of cotton is affected by various fiber properties it is unreasonable to evaluate fiber quality of cotton without considering the relationship between the fiber indicators hou et al 2021a therefore we analyzed the correlation of five quality indicators i e micronaire fiber length fiber strength uniformity index and elongation the results showed that micronaire had negative correlation with fiber length fiber strength uniformity index and elongation the four indicators of fiber length fiber strength uniformity index and elongation were significantly positively correlated with each other in addition the principal component analysis method was used to comprehensively evaluate the fiber quality sort was obtained from the comprehensive evaluation of the principal components according to the fiber quality evaluation values finally we concluded that the optimal treatment of nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity was s3n2 treatment 3 310 in 2019 and 3 000 in 2020 but the worst treatment was s1n1 treatment 3 960 in 2019 and 3 730 in 2020 our results indicated that four indicators i e fiber length fiber strength uniformity index and elongation comprehensively affected the fiber quality the optimal value was not obtained at the same time due to the different dimensions of the required indicators which indicated that the yield and quality of seed cotton did not reach highest at the same time therefore many researchers have combined the establishment of multiple nonlinear regression equations with spatial analysis to fit the optimal interval of multiple target overlapping areas according to the determined evaluation indicators wang et al 2018a 2018b yan et al 2020 2021 zou et al 2020 dai et al 2021 hou et al 2021b in this study we established the regression equations of nitrogen application rate irrigation water salinity seed cotton yield and comprehensive fiber quality evaluation value by two year experiment combined with normalization and spatial analysis methods the two year optimal evaluation value of seed cotton yield and fiber quality as well as the corresponding nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity were obtained in the overlapping area with a relative value of 0 85 seed cotton yield and comprehensive fiber quality were higher therefore we concluded that the optimal ranges of nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity were 197 04 237 94 kg n ha 1 and 3 60 3 88 g l 1 respectively however hou et al 2021a indicated that the high yield and fertilizer saving nitrogen application rate for cotton was 350 kg n ha 1 in korla southern xinjiang the difference was because the air temperature and soil salibity in southern xinjiang is larger than those in northern xinjiang so it is necessary to reduce the stress of drought on cotton by increasing the nitrogen application rate iqbal et al 2020 our results were supported by observation from yang et al 2020a who found that the irrigation water salinity used to irrigate cotton was less than 6 g l 1 in shihezi xinjiang 6 conclusion in this study we addressed the main effects of nitrogen application and brackish water irrigation and interaction of nitrogen application with brackish water irrigation on yield and quality of cotton in an artificial oasis agroecosystem of northwest china with increase of irrigation water salinity seed cotton yield and nitrogen partial factor productivity first increased and then decreased micronaire decreased but fiber length and strength uniformity index and elongation increased with the increase of irrigation water salinity however with increase of nitrogen application rate seed cotton yield micronaire fiber length and strength uniformity index and elongation first increased and then decreased but the nitrogen partial factor productivity decreased the optimal combination of nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity was 200 kg n ha 1 and 5 g l 1 furthermore we concluded that yield and quality of cotton could reach the maximum together when nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity were 197 04 237 94 kg n ha 1 and 3 60 3 88 g l 1 respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9610,in order to alleviate the shortage of water resources for cotton gossypium hirsutum l planting in xinjiang of china a reasonable amount of nitrogen application under brackish water irrigation was sought a two year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity on seed cotton yield nitrogen partial factor productivity and fiber quality in xinjiang under mulched drip irrigation in 2019 and 2020 in this study we selected four nitrogen application rates i e 100 200 300 and 400 kg n ha 1 respectively and three irrigation water salinity i e 1 3 and 5 g l 1 respectively our results showed that nitrogen application rates and irrigation water salinity significantly affected the seed cotton yield nitrogen partial factor productivity micronaire fiber length fiber strength uniformity index and elongation as the salinity of irrigation water increased seed cotton yield and nitrogen partial factor productivity increased first and then decreased micronaire decreased but fiber length fiber strength uniformity index and elongation increased moreover seed cotton yield micronaire fiber length fiber strength uniformity index and elongation increased first and then decreased and nitrogen partial factor productivity decreased with the amount of nitrogen application the optimal combination of nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity were 200 kg n ha 1 and 5 g l 1 by principal component analysis we concluded that the normalized relative value of seed cotton yield and comprehensive evaluation value was 0 85 when the nitrogen application rate and the irrigation water salinity were 197 04 237 94 kg n ha 1 and 3 60 3 88 g l 1 respectively keywords brackish water drip irrigation cotton yield cotton

in agriculture industrial production and economic trade of cotton producing countries hulsekemp et al 2014 li et al 2019a xinjiang which located in northwest china is characterized by a temperate continental climate and very suitable for the growth of cotton hou et al 2021a it has become the main cotton producing areas in china yang et al 2020a in 2019 the cotton planting area in xinjiang was 2 5 106 ha and output was 5 0 106 t accounting for 76 08 of the national cotton planting area and 84 94 of the total cotton output csyb 2019 xinjiang is also the largest widest range most typical arid area in china with annual rainfall of 50 250 mm and evaporation of more than 1000 mm wang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c 2019d water shortage limits agricultural development in xinjiang wu et al 2014 guo and shen 2016 yang et al 2019 2020b therefore it is very important to seek alternative water resources to irrigate cotton the underground brackish water reserve is about 1 72 109 m3 a 1 in xinjiang which accounting for 40 70 of the exploitable underground brackish water in the inland areas of northwest china in order to solve the problem of water resources shortage in xinjiang drip irrigation with brackish water under film has been introduced and popularized yang et al 2020a previous studies showed that drip irrigation under film increased water and fertilizer use efficiency and crop yield but reduced soil water evaporation kang et al 2010 li et al 2020 in addition some observations indicated that brackish water could replace the fresh water to irrigate the crop when the irrigation water salinity was within a certain extent wang et al 2011a 2011b jin et al 2016 however bouksila et al 2013 found that the use of brackish water for irrigation will cause the salt accumulation in the soil resulting in crop physiological drought and decrease in soil oxygen content root anaerobic respiration and accumulation of toxic substances additionally use of brackish water irrigation will damage plant lipids and proteins inhibit crop growth and decrease the water absorption capacity of crop roots affect crop yield and quality parida et al 2005 wang et al 2015 ren et al 2021 therefore the understandings of the responses of water and fertilizer use efficiency and crop yield to different irrigation water salinity could provide a better explanation of the mechanism underlying the brackish water irrigation nitrogen participates in the physiological process of crops to resist environmental stress salt stress and further affects crop yield and quality lawlor 2002 chen et al 2010 reported that increasing nitrogen application could decrease the adverse effects of salt on soil in low salt treatment lower nitrogen fertilizer application reduced soil nitrogen content which did not meet nitrogen demand of crops further weakening the photosynthesis capacity and reducing the yield devkota et al 2013 li et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 showed that when the nitrogen application rate was 180 270 kg ha 1 it would not lead to the accumulation of soil salt in the root zone of crops when using brackish water for irrigation excessive nitrogen application would cause more alkaline cations in the soil increase soil salinity and inhibit the absorption of nitrogen by roots and thus reduce crop yields min et al 2014 han et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 found that salt water irrigation reduced cotton fiber quality by reducing micronaire appropriate nitrogen application rate could improve cotton fiber quality while excessive nitrogen application would reduce cotton fiber quality sui et al 2017 previous observations mainly focused on the effects of single factors such as nitrogen application rate or irrigation water salinity on cotton yield and fiber quality or the interaction of nitrogen and salt on the soil physical and chemical properties and the growth and yield of seed cotton but few studies showed the effect of interaction of nitrogen and salt on cotton fiber quality the study aimed to explore the effects of different nitrogen application rates and irrigation water salinity on seed cotton yield and fiber quality under mulch drip irrigation and to fit the optimal range of nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity to reach maximum seed cotton yield together with fiber quality therefore we used comprehensive evaluation method to search for optimal combination of nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity the conclusion will provide a scientific basis for the rational nitrogen application rate of drip irrigation cotton under the film with brackish water in xinjiang 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the field experiment was conducted at the key laboratory of modern water saving irrigation of xinjiang

water was used for irrigation during the seedling stage other growth periods were irrigated according to the test design table 2 the agronomic measures such as weeding and spraying medicines are consistent with the local planting habits 3 measurement methods 3 1 seed cotton yield and npfp at the boll opening stage october 7 we selected three plots 1 m 2 m in each field for picking and then converted the yield in the experiment plot into the actual agricultural land in this study we used the converted seed cotton yield nitrogen partial factor productivity npfp was determined according to the equation as follows ierna et al 2011 1 npfp y n where y and n are the seed cotton yield kg ha 1 and the nitrogen application rate kg n ha 1 respectively 3 2 fiber quality at the boll opening stage october 7 20 g cotton from each field was used to analyze the fiber quality the fiber quality was determined by the cotton quality supervision inspection and testing center of the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs anyang henan china the fiber quality indexes include micronaire fiber length fiber strength uniformity index and elongation in this study the cotton fiber detector high volume instruments hvi 1000 uster switzerland was used to test fiber quality and the cotton fiber calibrator hvicc was used for calibration u s department of agriculture china fiber inspection bureau

significantly affected the seed cotton yield and npfp fig 3 and table 3 the seed cotton yield and npfp in each treatment of nitrogen application first increased and then decreased with the increase of irrigation water salinity in 2019 and 2020 fig 3 and table 3 for instance the seed cotton yield and npfp increased by 0 58 and 0 59 in n1s2 10 29 and 10 29 in n1s3 compared with n1s1 in 2019 increased by 13 36 and 13 35 in n2s2 1 03 and 1 04 in n2s3 compared with n2s1 increased by 3 29 and 3 29 in n3s2 23 20 and 23 21 in n3s3 compared with n3s1 increased by 5 83 and 5 84 in n4s2 4 82 and 4 82 in n4s3 compared with n4s1 respectively however the seed cotton yield in each salinity of irrigation water significantly first increased and then significantly decreased with the increase of nitrogen application in 2019 and 2020 fig 3 and table 3 the seed cotton yield increased by 6 54 in s1n2 10 91 in s1n3 and 15 11 in s1n4 compared with s1n1 in 2019 increased by 20 07 in s2n2 13 88 in s2n3 and 8 60 in s2n4 compared with s2n1 increased by 17 54 in s3n2 5 06 in s3n3 and 7 82 in s3n4 respectively but the npfp in each salinity of irrigation water significantly decreased with increasing nitrogen application fig 3 and table 3 the npfp decreased by 46 73 in s1n2 63 03 in s1n3 and 78 28 in s1n4 compared with s1n1 in 2019 decreased by 39 97 in s2n2 62 03 in s2n3 and 77 15 in s2n4 compared with s2n1 decreased by 41 24 in s3n2 68 35 in s3n3 and 76 95 in s3n4 respectively in this study the seed cotton yield was highest in s2n2 treatment and the npfp was highest in s2n1 treatment respectively 4 2 micronaire length and strength of fiber uniformity index and elongation the nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity significantly affected the quality indexes of cotton i e micronaire length strength of fiber uniformity index and elongation in 2019 and 2020 fig 4 and table 3 in addition the interaction of nitrogen application rate with irrigation water salinity significantly affected the micronaire and length of fiber in 2019 and 2020 fig 4 and table 3 however the interaction of nitrogen application rate with irrigation water salinity did not significantly affect the strength uniformity index and elongation of fiber the micronaire of fiber in each treatment of nitrogen application decreased but the length and strength of fiber in each treatment of nitrogen application increased with the increase of irrigation water salinity in 2019 and 2020 fig 4 and table 3 additionally the uniformity index and elongation of fiber in each treatment of nitrogen application increased with the increase of irrigation water salinity in 2019 and 2020 p 0 05 fig 4 and table 3 the micronaire length and strength of fiber uniformity index and elongation in each salinity of irrigation water first significantly increased and then significantly decreased with the increase of nitrogen application in 2019 and 2020 fig 4 and table 3 the length and strength of fiber uniformity index and elongation in each salinity of irrigation water significantly increased with increase from n1 to n2 of nitrogen application but significantly decreased with increase from n2 to n4 of nitrogen application in 2020 fig 4 and table 3 however the length and strength of fiber in each salinity of irrigation water increased with increase from n1 to n2 of nitrogen application but significantly decreased with increase from n2 to n4 of nitrogen application in 2019 while uniformity index and elongation increased with increase from n1 to n3 of nitrogen application but decreased with increase from n3 to n4 of nitrogen application in 2019 furthermore our result showed that the highest value in the micronaire occurred in s1n2 treatment but the highest values in the strength of fiber uniformity index and elongation were investigated in s3n2 treatment in 2019 and 2020 and the highest fiber length was s3n3 treatment in 2019 and s3n2 treatment in 2020 it indicated that the interaction of irrigation water salinity with the nitrogen application rate decreased micronaire but increased length and strength of fiber uniformity index and elongation 4 3 determination of optimal amount of nitrogen application rate and salinity of irrigation water in this study we used the principal component analysis method to comprehensively analyze and evaluate the cotton fiber quality index and further truly and comprehensively reflect the quality of cotton there is no difference among micronaire fiber length fiber strength uniformity index and elongation in 2019 and 2020 p 0 05 table 4 in 2019 and 2020 fiber length was significantly positively correlated with fiber strength uniformity index p 0 01 and elongation p 0 05 in addition uniformity index was significantly positively related to elongation p 0 01 in this study the optimal treatment i e interaction of amount of nitrogen application rate with salinity of irrigation water for cotton fiber quality was s3n2 treatment with a comprehensive score of 3 310 and 3 000 in 2019 and 2020 respectively the worst treatment was s1n1 treatment with a score of 3 960 and 3 730 respectively table 5 in addition the comprehensive score of s3 level was higher than s1 and s2 levels indicating that the appropriate increase of irrigation water salinity was prone to the improvement of the comprehensive quality of cotton fiber when irrigation water salinity was at the same level the appropriate nitrogen application rate was conducive to the improvement of the comprehensive fiber quality 4 4 determination of optimal nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity interval in cotton field with drip irrigation under film the multiple nonlinear regression analysis was carried out on two year seed cotton yield and comprehensive quality evaluation value to pursue the high yield and high efficiency of drip irrigated cotton under mulch the nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity significantly affected the dependent variables which the determination coefficient was higher than 0 81 table 6 furthermore the interaction of nitrogen application rate with irrigation water salinity on seed cotton yield and comprehensive evaluation value of cotton quality was an upward convex surface in 2019 and 2020 the effects of nitrogen application rate on seed cotton yield were similar to the effects of irrigation water salinity which seed cotton yield increased first and then decreased with increase of nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity the comprehensive evaluation value of cotton quality showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing with more nitrogen application which also was growing up with the increase of irrigation water salinity fig 5 in this study when nitrogen application rate was 229 71 kg n ha 1 and irrigation water salinity was 2 49 g l 1 in 2019 the maximum seed cotton yield and comprehensive evaluation value of cotton quality were 7035 50 kg ha 1 and 0 91 respectively when nitrogen application rate was 230 59 kg n ha 1 and irrigation water salinity was 2 48 g l 1 in 2020 the maximum seed cotton yield and comprehensive evaluation value of cotton quality were 6890 10 kg ha 1 and 0 97 respectively when the maximum comprehensive quality evaluation value was 3 50 in 2019 the corresponding nitrogen application rate irrigation water salinity and seed cotton yield were 250 98 kg n ha 1 5 00 g l 1 and 6268 33 kg ha 1 respectively when the maximum comprehensive quality evaluation value was 3 04 in 2020 the corresponding nitrogen application rate irrigation water salinity and seed cotton yield were 226 86 kg n ha 1 5 00 g l 1 and 6127 96 kg ha 1 respectively table 7 in general seed cotton yield and comprehensive evaluation value of cotton quality did not synchronously reach the maximum value therefore we normalized the values of seed cotton yield and comprehensive evaluation value of cotton quality and further obtained the relationship between the normalized relative value of seed cotton yield and comprehensive quality evaluation value with nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity in 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 6 based on comprehensive evaluation of seed cotton yield and principal component evaluation values in 2019 and 2020 the seed cotton yield and comprehensive quality evaluation values overlapped and generated an oblique area when the relative value was 0 85 therefore the relative value of 0 85 was selected as a reasonable evaluation standard to obtain the optimal seed cotton yield and quality fig 7 in this study when the normalized relative value of seed cotton yield and comprehensive evaluation value was 0 85 and seed cotton yield and comprehensive evaluation value generated an oblique area the optimal nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity interval were 197 04 237 94 kg n ha 1 and 3 60 3 88 g l 1 respectively 5 discussion 5 1 effects of different nitrogen application rates and irrigation water salinity on seed cotton yield and npfp in this study the seed cotton yield and npfp in each treatment of nitrogen application first increased and then decreased with the increase of irrigation water salinity on the one hand salt will enhance the water and nitrogen absorption rate of the plant roots and its photosynthetic capacity when there is less salt content in the irrigation water 3 g l 1 further causing increases in seed cotton yield and npfp hodge et al 2009 sobhani et al 2014 on the other hand the concentration of salt ions in soil exceeded the salt concentration threshold 0 3 of the crop root zone with the increase of irrigation water salinity 3 g l 1 which leads to decrease in the root osmotic potential and soil structure stability and adversely affecting the cell water relationship thus the water absorption and nitrogen absorption capacity of crop roots were reduced which further lead to the decrease of seed cotton yield and npfp mansour 1994 rengasamy 2010 li et al 2018a 2018b lima et al 2018 che et al 2021 ren et al 2021 our results were consistent with the findings that seed cotton yield and npfp increased when the irrigation water salinity was less than 3 g l 1 yang et al 2020a but decreased when the irrigation water salinity was greater than 3 g l 1 in shihezi city xinjiang in 2018 yang et al 2020a che et al 2021 nitrogen fertilizer not only promoted crop growth and development but also played an indispensable role in the formation of crop yield and quality melek et al 2019 we found that seed cotton yield first increased and then decreased with the increase of nitrogen application rate although lower nitrogen levels restricted plant growth higher nitrogen levels only increased yield in a certain range albornoz and lietn 2015 because the appropriate nitrogen application rate can alleviate the salt hazard and thus be prone the growth of crops in a suitable growth environment zeng et al 2015 khan et al 2017 ma et al 2017 the application of nitrogen fertilizer reduced the soil ph but increased the dissolution of soil ca2 further reducing the salt damage caused by the competition between na and ca2 this was because the application of nitrogen fertilizer did not increase the content of na in the soil on the contrary the nitrification of nitrogen fertilizer led to soil acidification and thus a decrease in ph value dong et al 2021 at the same time the nitrification of nitrogen fertilizers will result in the removal of alkaline cations in neutral soils xie et al 2019 additionally the salt concentration in the crop root zone reduced due to offsetting excess chloride with nitrogen xu et al 1999 che et al 2021 our results were in agreement with that the seed cotton yield increased first and then decreased with the increase of nitrogen application in the korla area of xinjiang in 2018 and 2019 hou et al 2021a in this study the npfp in each salinity of irrigation water significantly decreased with increasing nitrogen application the results were attributed to that nitrogen nutrients were more prone to be absorbed due to nitrogen demand of crop growth when the nitrogen application rate was lower thus causing increase in npfp zotarelli et al 2009 however when nitrogen application rate was excessively added into soils some nitrogen fertilizer was not absorbed by the crop and further remained in soils and the residual nitrogen rate in soils was more than the absorption rate of plant wang et al 2018 which resulted in decrease in npfp the explanation was supported by our findings that with the increase of nitrogen application rate seed cotton yield increased as the nitrogen application amount was 100 300 kg n ha 1 but decreased as the nitrogen application amount was 300 400 kg n ha 1 the result was consistent with zhang et al 2012 who showed that the npfp reduced with increasing the amount of nitrogen application 5 2 effects of different nitrogen application rates and irrigation water salinity on cotton quality fiber quality which reflected the combination characteristic of micronaire fiber length fiber strength uniformity index and elongation is affected by genotype and environmental conditions such as irrigation fertilization irrigation water quality and agronomic measures girma et al 2007 bilalis et al 2010 papastylianou and argyrokastritis 2014 our results showed that micronaire reduced and fiber length and fiber strength increased with increase of the irrigation water salinity salt affected the growth and development of cotton by inhibiting the division of cotton cells and destroying the osmotic potential in the body thereby decreasing the quality of cotton fiber aslam et al 2011 the explanation was supported by previous observations that salt had an inhibitory effect on cotton fiber quality zhang et al 2013a 2013b peng et al 2016a 2016b as the salt content increased the micronaire decreased razzouk and whittington 1991 wu et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 fiber length and strength increased ye et al 1997 wu et al 2010 our results showed that micronaire fiber length and strength first increased and then decreased with the increase of nitrogen application the results could be attributed to that small nitrogen application reduced the photosynthetic rate of cotton thereby reduced the activities of beneficial enzymes such as vacuum invertase and sucrose synthase increased the activities of destructive enzymes such as hydrolase and cellulase and then resulted in the weakening of fiber development and the reduction of fiber quality hu et al 2019 rehman and farooq 2019 however excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer enhanced the nitrate in soil and reduced the osmotic potential of the crop which affected fiber cell expansion and carbohydrate metabolism to interfere with fiber development and resulted in poor fiber quality gao et al 2020 witt et al 2020 our results were in accordance with that the micronaire fiber length and strength first increased and then decreased with increasing nitrogen application rate in korla xinjiang in 2018 and 2019 hou et al 2021a generally the fiber quality of cotton increased with increasing uniformity index zhang et al 2017 showed that the uniformity index increased with the increase of salt concentration in water this further confirmed our results with the increase of irrigation water salinity the uniformity index increased we found that the uniformity index of s3 treatment in 2019 and s2 treatment in 2020 were the largest and there was no significant difference between s2 and s3 treatment in two years with the increase of nitrogen application rate the uniformity index first increased and then decreased elongation is one of the indicators affecting fiber quality and there are few studies at present we showed that increasing irrigation water salinity can increase the elongation this was consistent with the results of zhang et al 2014 the elongation in 2019 was generally lower than that in 2020 which may be caused by the leaching of the salinity of irrigation water in the test field due to the large rainfall in 2019 additionally elongation first increased and then decreased with the increase of nitrogen application rate this was consistent with the results of hou et al 2021a the maximum elongation was obtained in s3n2 treatment in 2019 and 2020 which were 6 23 and 6 83 respectively within 2 years the interaction of nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity significantly affected micronaire and fiber length but did not affect fiber strength uniformity index and elongation this is because micronaire and fiber length were more sensitive to the physiological water and salinity deficit stress compared with fiber strength uniformity index and elongation abdelraheem and zhang 2016 therefore increasing nitrogen fertilizer alleviated the interference of salt on the expansion pressure of fiber cells during the development of micronaire and fiber length but reduced micronaire and increase fiber length ullah et al 2017 our results showed that the maximum micronaire value occurred in the s1n2 treatment while the maximum fiber strength uniformity index and elongation occurred in the s3n2 treatment in 2019 and 2020 the maximum fiber length was s3n3 treatment in 2019 and s3n2 treatment in 2020 therefore we should use low salinity brackish water for irrigation and appropriately increase the amount of nitrogen application to obtain higher micronaire in the planting however we need to use high salt brackish water for irrigation and apply higher nitrogen application rate to get higher fiber length and strength uniformity index and elongation 5 3 determination of optimal nitrogen application rate and salinity interval of irrigation water the fiber quality of cotton is affected by various fiber properties it is unreasonable to evaluate fiber quality of cotton without considering the relationship between the fiber indicators hou et al 2021a therefore we analyzed the correlation of five quality indicators i e micronaire fiber length fiber strength uniformity index and elongation the results showed that micronaire had negative correlation with fiber length fiber strength uniformity index and elongation the four indicators of fiber length fiber strength uniformity index and elongation were significantly positively correlated with each other in addition the principal component analysis method was used to comprehensively evaluate the fiber quality sort was obtained from the comprehensive evaluation of the principal components according to the fiber quality evaluation values finally we concluded that the optimal treatment of nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity was s3n2 treatment 3 310 in 2019 and 3 000 in 2020 but the worst treatment was s1n1 treatment 3 960 in 2019 and 3 730 in 2020 our results indicated that four indicators i e fiber length fiber strength uniformity index and elongation comprehensively affected the fiber quality the optimal value was not obtained at the same time due to the different dimensions of the required indicators which indicated that the yield and quality of seed cotton did not reach highest at the same time therefore many researchers have combined the establishment of multiple nonlinear regression equations with spatial analysis to fit the optimal interval of multiple target overlapping areas according to the determined evaluation indicators wang et al 2018a 2018b yan et al 2020 2021 zou et al 2020 dai et al 2021 hou et al 2021b in this study we established the regression equations of nitrogen application rate irrigation water salinity seed cotton yield and comprehensive fiber quality evaluation value by two year experiment combined with normalization and spatial analysis methods the two year optimal evaluation value of seed cotton yield and fiber quality as well as the corresponding nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity were obtained in the overlapping area with a relative value of 0 85 seed cotton yield and comprehensive fiber quality were higher therefore we concluded that the optimal ranges of nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity were 197 04 237 94 kg n ha 1 and 3 60 3 88 g l 1 respectively however hou et al 2021a indicated that the high yield and fertilizer saving nitrogen application rate for cotton was 350 kg n ha 1 in korla southern xinjiang the difference was because the air temperature and soil salibity in southern xinjiang is larger than those in northern xinjiang so it is necessary to reduce the stress of drought on cotton by increasing the nitrogen application rate iqbal et al 2020 our results were supported by observation from yang et al 2020a who found that the irrigation water salinity used to irrigate cotton was less than 6 g l 1 in shihezi xinjiang 6 conclusion in this study we addressed the main effects of nitrogen application and brackish water irrigation and interaction of nitrogen application with brackish water irrigation on yield and quality of cotton in an artificial oasis agroecosystem of northwest china with increase of irrigation water salinity seed cotton yield and nitrogen partial factor productivity first increased and then decreased micronaire decreased but fiber length and strength uniformity index and elongation increased with the increase of irrigation water salinity however with increase of nitrogen application rate seed cotton yield micronaire fiber length and strength uniformity index and elongation first increased and then decreased but the nitrogen partial factor productivity decreased the optimal combination of nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity was 200 kg n ha 1 and 5 g l 1 furthermore we concluded that yield and quality of cotton could reach the maximum together when nitrogen application rate and irrigation water salinity were 197 04 237 94 kg n ha 1 and 3 60 3 88 g l 1 respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9611,wheat fallow rotation is the major land use system in the rainfed cropping system of pakistan crop production in rainfed cropping systems is often jeopardized due to the scare and erratic seasonal patterns of rainfall climate change is further threatening the extent and productivity of rainfed agriculture in pakistan climatic risk reduction strategies such as supplemental irrigation si can assist in sustaining the productivity of rainfed agriculture however little has been done to investigate the potential of si in sustaining the productivity of the rainfed cropping system of pakistan despite the recent water resource developments in the rainfed regions of the country for this purpose a four year 2010 2014 study was conducted to assess wheat yield and water productivity under rainfed and si using a crop modeling approach calibrated ceres wheat was evaluated for its ability to simulate soil moisture dynamics water productivity canopy growth in season biomass phenology grain yield and biomass at harvest based on soil water balance results showed a good to excellent performance of ceres wheat during evaluation for example combined values of soil moisture content between different layers root zone soil moisture seasonal crop evapotranspiration in season biomass growth and canopy cover showed nrmse values ranging from 13 89 5 11 2 17 12 26 and 13 22 respectively the nrmse values of rainfall productivity of biomass and grain yield and water productivity of biomass and grain yield ranged from 18 16 and 17 6 respectively the model was also applied to determine favorable management practices appropriate planting dates from 15 october to 15 december at 15 day intervals and si of 50 mm either at planting or 30 days after planting as their determination under actual field conditions is laborious simulations for the best combination of planting date and si suggested that higher crop yield and water productivity can be achieved with planting in november with irrigation applied 30 days after planting keywords rainfed agriculture wheat yield water productivity crop model evaluation 1 introduction wheat triticum aestivum l being a major source of food feed and livelihoods for smallholder farmers play a decisive role in global food and nutritional security therefore improving wheat productivity is imperative for ensuring global food security however wheat productivity is highly dependent on the availability of irrigation water during the crop growth period ensuring continuous water supply for crop production particularly in rainfed regions is becoming challenging under the current climate change scenarios and increasing competition between agriculture and industrial sectors for water flörke et al 2018 rijsberman 2006 it emphasizes the necessity of enhancing crop water productivity in irrigated and adopting water conservation practices in rainfed agriculture the rainfed production system is the world s predominant production system as it accounts for 60 and 80 of global food production and cropping area respectively reynolds et al 2007 besides the crop productivity of rainfed cropping systems in developing countries is considerably lower than that of developed countries due to a lack of risk avoiding strategies such as crop insurance and water reservoirs for storage of rainwater to ensure water availability during periods of low rainfall rainfed agriculture has great potential to significantly contribute to global food production by increasing crop yields by employing low cost and relatively simple strategies however it requires a higher attention to improve crop productivity which is as low as half of the achievable potential yield currently observed under rainfed agriculture osman et al 2021 consequently it requires optimizing the water productivity under a rainfed environment as lower soil water availability is a major limiting factor for crop production in these regions bhattacharya 2019 dryland areas in pakistan cover the pothowar plateau salt range northern plains and northern mountains making the largest contiguous block of rainfed farming the pothowar region has significant agricultural potential for reducing the country s agricultural import load as agricultural activities in these areas account for approximately 10 of total agricultural production kazmi and rasul 2009 about 80 of the farmers in the area are practicing wheat fallow crop rotation the fallow period before crop sowing conserves the stored soil moisture from monsoon rains thereby reducing the risk of damage by drought therefore sowing time varies from year to year depending on rainfall in september and october as well as on the availability of sufficient soil moisture to support crop growth and development during the early stages of crop growth however crop yields have been significantly reduced due to the lack of synchroneity between the seasonal pattern of winter rain and crop water requirement at critical growth stages tadross et al 2009 rashid and rasul 2011 ain et al 2020 osman et al 2021 additionally extreme air temperature during early spring limits plants vegetative growth and reduces their water use efficiency wue in rainfed regions jia et al 2018 consequently developing and implementing effective crop water management strategies to maximize water productivity is imperative to ensure sustained crop production in the region water availability and productivity can be improved through a range of well established conservation techniques supplemental irrigation si is the application of limited amounts of water to essentially rainfed crops to improve and stabilize yields when rainfall fails to provide sufficient moisture for normal plant growth molla et al 2021 the concept of si is to enhance crop water productivity by applying limited irrigation to the rainfed crops which fail to receive enough rainfall to meet their water demand at critical growth stages nangia and oweis 2016 previously si has been reported to significantly improve crop yield biomass harvest index and wue man et al 2016 reported a 46 and 18 increase in wheat grain yield and wue for si at 40 cm depth while molla et al 2021 reported 64 25 and 15 increase in rice grain yield biomass and harvest index in transplanted rice with 3 cm ponding water than dry planted rainfed rice however optimal si strategy is difficult to determine in advance because of spatial and temporal variability of rainfall yet it can be scheduled to maintain and ensure minimum soil moisture availability during critical crop growth stages for ensuring timely sowing and achieving optimal yield nangia and oweis 2016 site specific crop management requires measuring crop yield and water productivity on a long term basis by conducting trials under diverse conditions particularly soil and weather conditions which is an expensive and laborious task benli et al 2007 however recent advances in crop simulation models have enabled crop growers to analyze and understand the complex mechanisms of crop production and the environment for maximizing crop productivity crop simulation models not only provide reasonable approximations of crop yield under different abiotic stresses tenreiro et al 2020 osman et al 2020 but also assist in irrigation scheduling attia et al 2016 decision support system for agro technology transfer dssat that includes ceres wheat is one of the most extensively used models hoogenboom et al 2014 to optimize water resources according to the socio economic prospects under water limiting conditions rötter et al 2012 anothai et al 2013 the present research mainly focuses on the conjunctive use of rainfall and harvest water to provide a theoretical basis for si scheduling of available water during wheat production the study was endeavored to determine the stability of wheat yield and water productivity under rainfed and si conditions using a crop modeling approach in the rainfed cropping system of pakistan 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site field experiments were conducted at barani agricultural research institute bari chakwal 32 55 n 72 43 e and 522 m asl pakistan fig 1 the climate of the region is characterized as subtropical continental lowlands having intense hot summers and cold winters according to the cwa köppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 the daily climatic data of the study site 1994 2014 including maximum tmax minimum tmin average temperatures tavg relative humidity rh wind speed and sunshine hours were obtained from the meteorological station of soil and water conservation research institute sawcri adjacent to the experimental field the available data of mean monthly rainfall from 1978 2014 37 years were used to calculate the probability of exceedance pr of total growing season rainfall and crop growing months fig 2 using the weibull formula chow et al 1988 benli et al 2007 1 p r 100 m n 1 where m is the rank of the value arranged in descending order and n is the total number of observations which were thirty eight in this study the soil of the study site was calcareous non saline ec 1

characteristics of the experimental site are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental details and data recording the evaluation of ceres wheat was made with the data acquired during wheat growing seasons 2010 11 2011 12 2012 13 and 2013 14 a spring wheat cultivar sehar 2006 was planted during all growing seasons under rainfed conditions with six replicates unlike the mediterranean environment where initially stored soil moisture is unimportant zhang et al 1998 zhang and oweis 1999 soil moisture plays an important role in rainfed wheat production under semi arid conditions in pakistan therefore the sowing date among study years differed depending on rainfall events in september and october soil workability and soil moisture contents at sowing the details regarding sowing dates initial soil water content planting density and harvesting dates are mentioned in table 2 adequate rainfall in september 2010 and 2012 resulted in earlier crop planting second week of october with initial soil moisture of 141 and 127 mm in the top 115 cm soil depth however cumulative rainfall of 17 mm was recorded in the third and fourth week of october 2011 and planting was delayed to 1 november total soil moisture 151 mm similarly higher cumulative rainfall of 39 mm from 15 october to 15 november in 2013 resulted in further delay in crop sowing to 21 november at soil moisture of 133 mm within the root zone 0 115 cm crop growth events including days from planting to emergence the start of flowering duration of flowering senescence and physiological maturity were considered when 50 of the plants showed visual signs of these events in season canopy cover cc was determined for growth analysis with duplicate photographs and digitized using a java program image j biomass was measured after harvesting a randomly selected area of 1 m2 at a 14 days interval from each replicate and dried to constant weight at 70 for 48 h total biomass and grain yield were recorded at physiological maturity crop harvest crop evapotranspiration etc during the growing season was calculated using the water balance approach allen et al 1998 2 etc p r d sini send where p r and d represent rainfall runoff and drainage below the root zone while sini and send are the soil moisture storage at the start and end of the crop growing season respectively the runoff was prevented by making bunds around each

soil moisture θv m3 m 3 by multiplying with the bulk density of the respective soil layer therefore etc was calculated from the rainfall data and the difference of soil moisture at sowing and the physiological maturity of the crop 2 3 ceres wheat evaluation the ceres wheat model used in this study is part of dssat version 4 6 hoogenboom et al 2014 the model uses the concept of biomass production from the intercepted solar radiation and radiation use efficiency relationship crop phenology growth in daily time step biomass and yield are simulated as a function of soil plant atmospheric dynamics under prescribed management options ritchie et al 1998 jones et al 2003 ceres wheat can estimate reference crop evapotranspiration eto either through priestley taylor 1972 or penman montieth fao56 allen et al 1998 approach latter was used in this study the soil evaporation component of eto was computed as a function of the maximum rate of water used by the crop with full canopy cover and non limiting water soil moisture conditions eo jones and kiniry 1986 sau et al 2004 whereas potential crop transpiration was estimated from eo using an extinction coefficient k which can vary from 0 54 to 0 63 for wheat kang et al 2003 phenological development and growth stage duration in response to temperature and photoperiod were managed by specific genetic coefficients these crop specific genetic coefficients relating to photoperiod sensitivity vernalization requirement duration of grain filling conversion of mass to grain number and grain filling rate were among the major inputs required for the model evaluation hunt et al 1993 a detailed description of the model can be found in ritchie et al 1998 the data for ceres wheat calibration in the present study were acquired from the field experiments conducted during 2007 08 2008 09 and 2009 10 growing seasons under unstressed well watered conditions calibration was started with the basic information for the cultivar coefficients provided within the model and adjustments were made sequentially starting with phenology including days to flowering days to maturity and then crop growth parameters ishaque et

soil moisture content in individual soil layers root zone soil moisture crop phenology canopy development in season biomass growth total biomass and grain yield at harvest simulated and measured

and green 1991 2 4 model application scenarios one of the major applications of crop models is their use as a decision support tool for developing appropriate soil water and crop management practices to ensure sustainable crop production determining crop calendar under rainfed conditions requires synchronization of water availability from rainfall and crop water requirement at different growth stages therefore the sowing time of wheat should coincide with the duration in which water requirement from the rainfall at critical crop growth stages is met keeping in mind the probability of rainfall occurrence in wheat growing months simulations were carried out for different planting dates from 15 october to 15 december at 15 day intervals under rainfed conditions with one si of 50 mm applied at crop planting i1 or 30 days after planting dap i2 time series simulated values of yield at harvest as affected by the combination of planting dates and si strategies were plotted against the probabilities for which these yield values would exceed the simulated values of seasonal crop transpiration and evapotranspiration were used to calculate crop water productivity based on transpiration wpyt and evapotranspiration wpyet 3 results and discussion 3 1 climatic conditions 3 1 1 temperature temperature conditions during the study period remained approximately similar to long term averages with mean tmax and tmin around 23 and 8 respectively overall mean tmax 30 1 5 16 1 during the crop growth period october to april was less than the physiologically critical threshold 40 mean tmin during crop growth was highest for october 15 2 and lowest for january 1 1 5 however mean tmin for january remained below 0 during the 2010 11 growing season generally all the study years with respect to temperature were normal for the wheat crop growth 3 1 2 rainfall the study area receives rainfall from both south asian monsoon and western disturbances giving a twin peak type distribution mean annual rainfall was around 630 40 mm with comparatively higher events concentrated in summer june to september contributing over 50 65 of the annual rainfall 30 of the total rainfall during the wheat growing season 190 mm was associated with the western disturbance however annual rainfall variability during winter was much higher 78 cv 170 compared to that in the summer rainfall in the monsoon season 55 cv 115 the mean annual rainfall 206 mm during the study period 2010 11 to 2013 14 was higher than the long term average mean annual rainfall during initial crop growth stages november january was less than 10 mm however slightly higher rainfall of 22 and 28 mm was recorded in january and december 2012 the highest rainfall 213 mm was measured in february 2013 followed by march 2014 94 mm and february 2011 88 mm respectively 3 1 3 rainfall probability analysis the historical record of 37 years 1978 2014 means monthly rainfall during the wheat growing season was subjected to probability analysis using weibull formula fig 2 the annual rainfall with a probability level of 75 exceedance was 140 mm the corresponding wheat growing season rainfall for a 25 pr was about 280 mm the probability level of 50 exceedance for the wheat growing season october to april was 15 1 5 4 10 35 40 and 22 mm respectively with a total rainfall during the growing season of 188 mm although the probability level of 47 exceedance was 211 mm sufficient for crop water requirement in the area the expected rainfall during the initial crop growth phase in november december and january were 2 5 4 and 14 mm only 3 2 ceres wheat evaluation 3 2 1 soil moisture content simulation in individual soil layers the evaluation of model performance to simulate θv in individual soil layers 0 15 15 35 35 55 55 75 75 95 and 95 115 cm was carried out for all study years model evaluation outcomes are presented in table 4 a higher fluctuation of θv was simulated in the upper 35 cm soil profile as compared to measured θv while higher variation of soil moisture in deeper layers was observed in crop seasons 2010 11 2012 13 and 2013 14 respectively after rainfall events of 111 mm 231 mm and 131 mm in february and march combined values of simulated vs measured θv in the studied soil layers generally followed a 1 1 line of equality with a slope of 1 the slope of the regression line for simulated and measured θv was 0 67 with a y intercept of 0 03 and r2 0 60 showed higher differences among simulated and measured soil moisture contents model performance was not satisfactory in simulating θv in the top 0 15 cm soil layer in which it over estimated the moisture depletion resulting in high nrmse 44 89 in all the study years similar results were obtained for soil moisture distribution among different soil layers for crop season 2010 11 nrmse 13 65 and 15 35 cm soil depth in wheat season 2013 14 nrmse 53 however simulated and measured θv was in satisfactory to good agreement for the rest of the crop seasons and soil depths nrmse 2 26 the difference in simulated and measured soil moisture distribution among soil layers was attributed to the water balance sub routine module of ceres wheat and estimates of root growth dynamics eitzinger et al 2004 the soil water balance module within the model was based on the one dimensional cascading approach of water accounting in each soil layer considered in the soil profile ritchie et al 1998 and using the concept of the drained upper limit and drained lower limit of the soil as the basis of the available soil water drainage out of soil layer was calculated by empirical relation between θv and volumetric moisture content at field capacity θfc of the soil which was computed when θv in a soil layer at any time t was above θfc and no water flux beyond the studied layer was possible when θv in the layer was below θfc moreover one dimensional downward flow computed through cascading assumes evaporation losses from the top 0 5 cm soil depth and under estimated the upward flux from the deeper layers during the drying phase of the soil faria and bowen 2003 3 2 2 root zone soil moisture and soil water balance despite the lower efficiency of the model to simulate θv in different soil layers the response was satisfactory for the root zone 0 115 cm soil moisture fig 3 paired values of simulated vs measured total soil moisture mm in root zone closely followed 1 1 line of perfect agreement the slope of the regression line between the simulated and measured total soil moisture was closer to 1 0 97 with a y intercept of 3 5 and r2 0 82 statistical indicators of model performance for crop seasons 2010 11 2011 12 and 2012 13 showed a higher d 0 91 0 98 and lower rmse 5 71 13 86 mm however the d value of 0 6 was lower for crop season 2013 14 overall the ability of the model to simulate total soil moisture in this study was good to excellent nrmse 5 11 comparison of simulated and measured cumulative seasonal etc calculated using the water balance approach showed a reasonable model comparison measured etc for crop seasons 2010 11 2011 12 2012 13 and 2013 14 were 167 mm 128 mm 242 mm and 181 mm as compared to simulated values of 147 mm 144 mm 238 mm and 211 mm respectively overall a higher d of 0 99 rmse 20 mm and nrmse 11 showed satisfactory behavior of the model to predict etc 3 2 3 in season biomass and canopy cover measured in season biomass growth varied considerably among different growing seasons the model was able to capture the trends of biomass growth with higher r2 0 96 0 99 and reasonable nrmse 12 26 in different growing seasons fig 4a c e and g except in 2011 12 where in season biomass was under estimated by 11 the lower simulated biomass during 2011 12 was attributed to higher soil moisture stress due to early season rainfall resulting in reduced crop growth overall model predictions were good for growing seasons of 2012 13 2013 14 while it was satisfactory for 2010 11 and 2011 12 with respective rmse of 0 80 t ha 1 0 82 t ha 1 0 95 t ha 1 and 1 53 t ha 1 and nrmse 12 15 20 and 26 the four year pooled data showed a general under prediction of in season biomass growth with the following linear relationship 7 m 0 98 s 0 73 where s and m are simulated and measured in season biomass the slope of the regression line 0 98 closer to unity indicated an excellent relationship between the two while positive y intercept showed marginally under predicted simulation by 0 73 t ha 1 however higher r2 0 96 along with mean d rmse and nrmse of 0 99 1 05 t ha 1 and 18 respectively showed satisfactory model behavior for in season biomass growth simulation fig 4a canopy cover in this study was determined with digital photographs model simulated leaf area index was converted to percent cc using the relationship described by hsiao et al 2009 8 cc 94 0 1 exp 0 43 lai 0 52 simulated compared to measured cc showed over estimation during early crop growth phases fig 4b d f and h however overall values were in close agreement with reasonable rmse 8 11 nrmse 13 22 and d 0 90 0 93 showing a good relationship between simulated and measured cc the data pairs of simulated and measured values of cc when pooled across the years showed the following linear relationship 9 m 1 1 s 9 0 the higher slope of the regression line indicated a higher increase in simulated cc per unit increase in the measured value additionally a negative y intercept of 9 0 showed higher simulated cc growth particularly during early crop growth phases which was also evident from the canopy development curves shown in fig 4b however a higher coefficient of determination r2 0 80 along with four year mean d 0 99 rmse 10 and nrmse 19 indicated excellent to good performance of the model to predict the canopy growth 3 2 4 crop phenology biomass and grain yield at harvest simulated and measured values for days taken by the crop from planting to flowering and physiological maturity fig 5a were generally in good agreement the performance of the model was better for days taken to flowering d 0 81 compared to physiological maturity d 0 65 simulated values for days to physiological maturity were 2 8 different from measured days model under predicted days to maturity in comparatively dryer crop season 2011 12 rainfall 80 mm by 15 days whereas model over predicted by 6 days in wettest crop season of 2012 13 rainfall 270 mm statistical indicators of model performance showed an rmse of 8 days for days to maturity and 4 days for flowering with a similar nrmse 5 for both these parameters measured biomass and grain yield were significantly different among the growing seasons higher biomass of 13 9 1 41 t ha 1 was observed in crop season 2012 13 compared to the rest of the seasons the lowest biomass 9 7 1 08 t ha 1 was observed for crop season 2010 11 which was non significantly different from that 10 2 1 3 t ha 1 of crop season 2011 12 biomass at harvest in crop season 2013 14 was 12 1 0 95 t ha 1 grain yield 4 7 0 87 t ha 1 was significantly higher in crop season 2012 13 compared to the rest of the crop growing seasons which were non significantly different 3 3 0 51 3 9 0 55 t ha 1 from one another ceres wheat followed a similar trend of higher biomass 14 8 t ha 1 in crop season 2012 13 followed by 2013 14 13 1 t ha 1 2010 11 10 3 t ha 1 and 2012 13 9 1 t ha 1 simulated values of yield for 2010 2013 were 3 t ha 1 3 3 t ha 1 4 t ha 1 and 3 9 t ha 1 respectively simulated and measured data pairs of both biomass and yield pooled across the years were close to the 1 1 line fig 5b of perfect agreement the d was 0 94 for biomass with rmse 0 91 t ha 1 and nrmse of 8 these statistical indicators confirmed an excellent simulation of biomass at harvest however the model generally over predicted aboveground biomass some under estimation was shown by the model with a lower d 0 70 and nrmse of 13 in grain yield rmse of 0 51 t ha 1 between the simulated and observed grain yield indicated a good performance of the model to predict wheat yield under rainfed conditions an earlier study conducted in the area reported a less satisfactory performance of ceres wheat with a lower d for biomass 0 85 0 76 and grain yield 0 65 0 69 with respective higher rmse of 2 87 4 58 t ha 1 and 0 44 0 73 t ha 1 ahmed and hassan 2011 the differences described by rmse in the study seemed to be linear and could certainly be reduced through new parameterization or recalibrating present functions by modifying specific crop genetic coefficients or soil parameters willmott 1982 however parameterization or recalibration of soil parameters might result in the site specific behavior of the model other than logical or calibration errors the lower model simulations may also be attributed to input errors which have been reported as a more serious source of poor model predictions jones and kiniry 1986 3 2 5 rainfall and crop water productivity measured rfpb showed higher variability among study years 12 8 1 63 5 2 0 51 kg m 3 rfpb was generally higher in comparatively drier crop season 2011 12 rainfall 80 mm and lowered in wet season 2012 13 rainfall 270 mm fig 5c mean measured rfpb in crop seasons 2010 11 rainfall 138 mm and 2013 14 rainfall 196 mm was 7 0 0 81 and 6 2 0 50 kg m 3 respectively measured rfpy followed a similar trend with higher productivity of 4 1 0 7 kg m 3 for 2011 12 followed by 2 7 0 4 1 7 0 3 and 2 0 0 3 kg m 3 in crop seasons 2010 11 2012 13 and 2013 14 respectively model predicted rfpb and rfpy showed higher productivity under lower rainfall conditions and lowered productivity in the years with higher rainfall fig 5c simulated values of rfpb were 7 5 kg m 3 11 4 kg m 3 5 5 kg m 3 and 8 5 kg m 3 during 2010 11 to 2013 14 respectively however data pairs of simulated and observed rfpb a higher scattering around the 1 1 line model over estimated rfpb in crop season 2013 14 while it under estimated for 2011 12 the difference was due to higher simulated biomass produced in crop season 2013 14 and lower in 2011 12 overall the d for simulated and measured rfpb was 0 99 while nrmse represented 18 of the mean observed rfpb and rmse of 0 41 kg m 3 simulated values of rfpy were 2 14 kg m 3 4 2 kg m 3 1 5 kg m 3 and 2 5 kg m 3 for the study years 2010 11 to 2013 14 the simulated and measured data pairs were close to the 1 1 line d was high 0 99 and nrmse represented 16 of the average relative deviation between the simulated and the measured rfpy indicating the good performance of the model measured wpbet and wpyet based on soil water balance under rainfed conditions was also higher in the year receiving lower growing season rainfall fig 5d respective measured wpbet and wpyet values for wheat seasons 2010 11 to 2013 14 were 5 8 0 7 kg m 3 7 9 1 0 kg m 3 5 7 0 6 kg m 3 6 6 0 5 kg m 3 and 2 2 0 33 kg m 3 2 6 0 43 kg m 3 1 9 0 37 kg m 3 2 1 0 30 kg m 3 with corresponding simulated values of 7 2 kg m 3 6 6 kg m 3 6 7 kg m 3 7 1 kg m 3 and 2 1 kg m 3 2 4 kg m 3 1 8 kg m 3 2 1 kg m 3 the simulated and measured data pairs of wpbet pooled across growing seasons indicated an over estimation in the years receiving higher rainfall with an overall bias of 6 however a higher d 0 99 and reasonable nrmse 17 indicated a good performance of the model for simulating wpbet conversely the model slightly under estimated wpyet in growing seasons with higher rainfall however simulated and measured data pairs were closer to a 1 1 line of perfect agreement excellent performance of the model to simulate wpyet was confirmed from high agreement index 0 99 lower rmse 0 12 kg m 3 and the nrmse representing 6 of the average relative deviation between the simulated and the measured values 3 3 model applications 3 3 1 biomass at harvest appropriate planting date and si for crop production stability coupled with higher water productivity were carried out based on expected pr of rainfall during the wheat growing season using historical weather data the amount and timing of the rainfall events demonstrated a pronounced effect on biomass production under rainfed conditions generally 50 of the study years had lower simulated median biomass this lower biomass was simulated for the years that either received a rainfall 100 mm during crop growing season or with early dry phase and 100 150 mm cumulative rainfall near the crop s anthesis or grain formation phases similarly osman et al 2021 found that growing seasons with optimum rainfall resulted in higher biomass while growing seasons with a lack of early season rainfall resulted in reduced biomass the crop biomass at harvest was positively impacted by rainfall received in december and january corresponding to early phases of crop growth and or cumulative rainfall above 150 mm the analysis for appropriate planting date under rainfed conditions indicated a negative effect of early october planting on biomass production which was attributed to lower expected early season november and december rainfall affecting crown root initiation and tillering stages due to soil moisture stress fig 6a b and c similarly planting carried out in december may expose the crop to lower temperature and solar radiation during the early growth phases resulting in retarded biomass growth before booting or anthesis long term simulated biomass with higher variability 8 2 3 7 t ha 1 for early planting of 15 october was 37 40 37 which was 24 lower as compared to successive plantings from 01 november to 15 december simulated median biomass 9 5 t ha 1 for the crop planted on 15 october with 50 mm si application at planting was 37 higher than that of rainfed conditions the simulations for other crop planting dates from 01 november through 15 december showed a respective increase of 45 50 40 and 30 in biomass than early planting the si application of 50 mm at 30 dap had a positive effect on biomass simulation 15 6 t ha 1 in early planted crops with an increase of 125 than that of the same sowing date under rainfed conditions it indicated that lower rainfall in late october and november could be compensated by si application of 50 mm at 30 dap a sequential delay of 15 days in crop planting from 01 november to 15 december had lesser biomass of 2 8 14 and 22 respectively as compared to 15 october however whiskers of the plot show more consistent biomass associated with the si application at 30 dap than si applied at the planting dates 15 30 november and 15 december 3 3 2 grain yield ceres wheat simulated a similar trend of grain yield at harvest as that for simulated biomass fig 6d e and f median simulated yield under rainfed conditions increased from 2 4 t ha 1 in early planting of october to 4 9 t ha 1 for planting in december although there was a higher probability of getting a lower yield than the rest of the plantings in november model simulated median yield for november plantings did not show much difference the application of si at planting increased median yield by 54 3 7 t ha 1 in an early planted crop of 15 october than that under rainfed conditions the expected median yield was 67 higher in 15 november planting compared to earlier planting for the rest of the time the median yield increase ranged from 41 in late to 55 for 30 november box and whisker plot fig 6e showed an expected yield of 5 7 t ha 1 with the lesser difference in maximum and minimum yield for the crop planted on 01 november with 50 mm si application at the time of planting as an appropriate strategy to obtain more consistent yield in this scenario the application of si at 30 dap showed a comparatively narrow interquartile range compared to si application at crop planting the median simulated yield was 4 6 t ha 1 for early and 6 0 t ha 1 for the crop planted on 15 november with the si application at 30 dap the 19 23 and 11 increase was simulated for plantings on 1 30 november and 15 december respectively as compared to early planting the respective percent differences between simulated median yields with si applied at 30 dap from those at crop planting were 27 3 1 and 2 for the crop planted from 15 october through 30 november the crop planting on 1 or 15 november with si application at 30 dap was the most appropriate strategy to obtain higher and sustainable yield under the soil and climatic conditions of the study region harvest index calculated as a fraction of grain yield and biomass at harvest did not show much difference between rainfed and both of the si irrigation strategies however the application of si as i2 had a slightly more probability of getting a higher harvest index 3 3 3 probability of exceedance time series simulated values of yield at harvest as affected by the combination of planting date and si strategies were plotted against the pr fig 7 the pr was expressed as the percentage of time a particular yield value will be exceeded 80 of the years are expected to produce 1 14 t ha 1 grain yield compared to 3 14 t ha 1 3 02 t ha 1 3 8 t ha 1 and 3 1 t ha 1 in successive plantings from 01 november through 15 december respectively under rainfed conditions and sowing on 15 october however si application as i1 and i2 may increase the 80 pr to 2 1 t ha 1 4 4 t ha 1 5 2 t ha 1 5 1 t ha 1 4 4 t ha 1 in the crop planted on 15 october and 4 0 t ha 1 5 3 t ha 1 5 5 t ha 1 5 0 t ha 1 and 4 3 t ha 1 in the crop planted on 1 15 30 november and 15 december respectively the simulated biomass and grain yield using ceres wheat in this study were supported by the findings of ahmed 2011 who conducted a two year study on wheat under rainfed conditions in the same area with different planting windows from mid october to mid december reporting that higher biomass and yield for the sowing carried out during first 10 days of november compared to an early plantation in october or delayed planting in late november or december other studies conducted with si as a management option for rainfed cropping system also indicated that crop production with declining and erratic seasonal rainfall might not be feasible without si nangia and oweis 2016 as si has the potential to significantly increase crop yield and productivity man et al 2016 nangia and oweis 2016 molla et al 2021 the si application is reported as a tool for dry spell mitigation and crop yield productivity enhancement by protecting crop failure as a consequence of dry spells nangia and oweis 2016 3 3 4 evapotranspiration and transpiration productivity simulated values of wpyet were generally higher for 15 and 30 november plantings with a decreasing trend before and after these dates fig 8b d and f the spread in the productivity was higher for the 15 november planting whereas a higher consistency was simulated for the crop planted on 30 november the model simulated a higher wpyet 12 in early crop planting with i1 as compared with the rainfed condition si applied as i1 reduced the productivity in late november and 15 december plantings by 7 and 3 respectively the model simulated a probability of getting higher wpyet for the crop planted on 15 november in this scenario however model simulated wpyet showed almost similar median values 2 5 2 6 kg m 3 for november plantings which tend to decrease in the early and late planted crop for si of 50 mm applied at 30 dap application of si either as i1 or i2 increased simulated wpyt from early october to mid november plantings after which it tends to decrease fig 8a c and e median wpyt did not show any appreciable increase or decrease between si treatments however the probability of getting higher wpyt was more for planting on 15 november in i1 and 01 november with i2 comparison between model simulated yield biomass fig 6 and wpyet wpyt fig 8 for 1 and 15 november plantings with i2 showed higher values for all these parameters indicating efficient utilization of irrigation water higher wpyet and wpyt may be associated with lower evaporation components of total etc more water may have been evaporated from the soil surface due to comparatively higher prevailing temperature during early crop growth phases with incomplete canopy cover in early sowing crop growth tends to be slower in late planting due to lower temperature and solar radiation in january and february the crop canopy does not completely cover the soil surface which may expose the land surface for evaporation thus resulting in lower wpyt moreover lower biomass and grain yield for the early and late sown crops were also reflected as lower wpyet and wpyt a previous study by el sadek and salem 2016 under mediterranean conditions also showed si application of 150 mm at tillering booting and grain filling substantially increased plant height number of grains spikes grain weight aboveground biomass grain yield and wue these findings indicated that si has a significant potential for improving water productivity without compromising the land productivity of the study site 4 conclusion soil moisture content aboveground biomass growth in season canopy development grain yield and biomass at harvest under rainfed conditions were satisfactorily simulated in this study by using the calibrated ceres wheat the outcomes of model simulations suggested that the appropriate planting time for achieving higher wheat yield in the rainfed region of pakistan is from 1 to 15 november the findings also suggested that one si of 50 mm applied at 30 dap can assure higher wheat yield and water productivity in the rainfed region of pakistan however sufficient initial soil moisture at sowing to ensure crop emergence and growth in the initial 30 days is a prerequisite for achieving higher wheat yield and water productivity in the region additionally wheat can also be planted in the third and fourth weeks of october in case of sufficient rainfall events in late september and early october along with si at 30 dap however crop planting can be delayed to the second week of november with si of 50 mm at sowing in the scenario with lower or no rainfall in late september and early october a single si application 30 dap has the potential to serve as an alternative irrigation scheme for additional water savings in rainfed regions based on the simulation results it is recommended that wheat plantation in the rainfed region of pakistan should be carried out from november 1 15 with 50 mm si at 30 dap for ensuring higher grain yield and water productivity the calibrated ceres wheat showed its potential to serve as a decision support tool for the extrapolation of wheat yield and water productivity in other rainfed areas with similar variables of soil and climate however further studies are required to test the applicability of calibrated ceres wheat in regions with different crop management practices cultivars and variables soil and climate declaration of competing interest the

9611,wheat fallow rotation is the major land use system in the rainfed cropping system of pakistan crop production in rainfed cropping systems is often jeopardized due to the scare and erratic seasonal patterns of rainfall climate change is further threatening the extent and productivity of rainfed agriculture in pakistan climatic risk reduction strategies such as supplemental irrigation si can assist in sustaining the productivity of rainfed agriculture however little has been done to investigate the potential of si in sustaining the productivity of the rainfed cropping system of pakistan despite the recent water resource developments in the rainfed regions of the country for this purpose a four year 2010 2014 study was conducted to assess wheat yield and water productivity under rainfed and si using a crop modeling approach calibrated ceres wheat was evaluated for its ability to simulate soil moisture dynamics water productivity canopy growth in season biomass phenology grain yield and biomass at harvest based on soil water balance results showed a good to excellent performance of ceres wheat during evaluation for example combined values of soil moisture content between different layers root zone soil moisture seasonal crop evapotranspiration in season biomass growth and canopy cover showed nrmse values ranging from 13 89 5 11 2 17 12 26 and 13 22 respectively the nrmse values of rainfall productivity of biomass and grain yield and water productivity of biomass and grain yield ranged from 18 16 and 17 6 respectively the model was also applied to determine favorable management practices appropriate planting dates from 15 october to 15 december at 15 day intervals and si of 50 mm either at planting or 30 days after planting as their determination under actual field conditions is laborious simulations for the best combination of planting date and si suggested that higher crop yield and water productivity can be achieved with planting in november with irrigation applied 30 days after planting keywords rainfed agriculture wheat yield water productivity crop model evaluation 1 introduction wheat triticum aestivum l being a major source of food feed and livelihoods for smallholder farmers play a decisive role in global food and nutritional security therefore improving wheat productivity is imperative for ensuring global food security however wheat productivity is highly dependent on the availability of irrigation water during the crop growth period ensuring continuous water supply for crop production particularly in rainfed regions is becoming challenging under the current climate change scenarios and increasing competition between agriculture and industrial sectors for water flörke et al 2018 rijsberman 2006 it emphasizes the necessity of enhancing crop water productivity in irrigated and adopting water conservation practices in rainfed agriculture the rainfed production system is the world s predominant production system as it accounts for 60 and 80 of global food production and cropping area respectively reynolds et al 2007 besides the crop productivity of rainfed cropping systems in developing countries is considerably lower than that of developed countries due to a lack of risk avoiding strategies such as crop insurance and water reservoirs for storage of rainwater to ensure water availability during periods of low rainfall rainfed agriculture has great potential to significantly contribute to global food production by increasing crop yields by employing low cost and relatively simple strategies however it requires a higher attention to improve crop productivity which is as low as half of the achievable potential yield currently observed under rainfed agriculture osman et al 2021 consequently it requires optimizing the water productivity under a rainfed environment as lower soil water availability is a major limiting factor for crop production in these regions bhattacharya 2019 dryland areas in pakistan cover the pothowar plateau salt range northern plains and northern mountains making the largest contiguous block of rainfed farming the pothowar region has significant agricultural potential for reducing the country s agricultural import load as agricultural activities in these areas account for approximately 10 of total agricultural production kazmi and rasul 2009 about 80 of the farmers in the area are practicing wheat fallow crop rotation the fallow period before crop sowing conserves the stored soil moisture from monsoon rains thereby reducing the risk of damage by drought therefore sowing time varies from year to year depending on rainfall in september and october as well as on the availability of sufficient soil moisture to support crop growth and development during the early stages of crop growth however crop yields have been significantly reduced due to the lack of synchroneity between the seasonal pattern of winter rain and crop water requirement at critical growth stages tadross et al 2009 rashid and rasul 2011 ain et al 2020 osman et al 2021 additionally extreme air temperature during early spring limits plants vegetative growth and reduces their water use efficiency wue in rainfed regions jia et al 2018 consequently developing and implementing effective crop water management strategies to maximize water productivity is imperative to ensure sustained crop production in the region water availability and productivity can be improved through a range of well established conservation techniques supplemental irrigation si is the application of limited amounts of water to essentially rainfed crops to improve and stabilize yields when rainfall fails to provide sufficient moisture for normal plant growth molla et al 2021 the concept of si is to enhance crop water productivity by applying limited irrigation to the rainfed crops which fail to receive enough rainfall to meet their water demand at critical growth stages nangia and oweis 2016 previously si has been reported to significantly improve crop yield biomass harvest index and wue man et al 2016 reported a 46 and 18 increase in wheat grain yield and wue for si at 40 cm depth while molla et al 2021 reported 64 25 and 15 increase in rice grain yield biomass and harvest index in transplanted rice with 3 cm ponding water than dry planted rainfed rice however optimal si strategy is difficult to determine in advance because of spatial and temporal variability of rainfall yet it can be scheduled to maintain and ensure minimum soil moisture availability during critical crop growth stages for ensuring timely sowing and achieving optimal yield nangia and oweis 2016 site specific crop management requires measuring crop yield and water productivity on a long term basis by conducting trials under diverse conditions particularly soil and weather conditions which is an expensive and laborious task benli et al 2007 however recent advances in crop simulation models have enabled crop growers to analyze and understand the complex mechanisms of crop production and the environment for maximizing crop productivity crop simulation models not only provide reasonable approximations of crop yield under different abiotic stresses tenreiro et al 2020 osman et al 2020 but also assist in irrigation scheduling attia et al 2016 decision support system for agro technology transfer dssat that includes ceres wheat is one of the most extensively used models hoogenboom et al 2014 to optimize water resources according to the socio economic prospects under water limiting conditions rötter et al 2012 anothai et al 2013 the present research mainly focuses on the conjunctive use of rainfall and harvest water to provide a theoretical basis for si scheduling of available water during wheat production the study was endeavored to determine the stability of wheat yield and water productivity under rainfed and si conditions using a crop modeling approach in the rainfed cropping system of pakistan 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site field experiments were conducted at barani agricultural research institute bari chakwal 32 55 n 72 43 e and 522 m asl pakistan fig 1 the climate of the region is characterized as subtropical continental lowlands having intense hot summers and cold winters according to the cwa köppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 the daily climatic data of the study site 1994 2014 including maximum tmax minimum tmin average temperatures tavg relative humidity rh wind speed and sunshine hours were obtained from the meteorological station of soil and water conservation research institute sawcri adjacent to the experimental field the available data of mean monthly rainfall from 1978 2014 37 years were used to calculate the probability of exceedance pr of total growing season rainfall and crop growing months fig 2 using the weibull formula chow et al 1988 benli et al 2007 1 p r 100 m n 1

characteristics of the experimental site are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental details and data recording the evaluation of ceres wheat was made with the data acquired during wheat growing seasons 2010 11 2011 12 2012 13 and 2013 14 a spring wheat cultivar sehar 2006 was planted during all growing seasons under rainfed conditions with six replicates unlike the mediterranean environment where initially stored soil moisture is unimportant zhang et al 1998 zhang and oweis 1999 soil moisture plays an important role in rainfed wheat production under semi arid conditions in pakistan therefore the sowing date among study years differed depending on rainfall events in september and october soil workability and soil moisture contents at sowing the details regarding sowing dates initial soil water content planting density and harvesting dates are mentioned in table 2 adequate rainfall in september 2010 and 2012 resulted in earlier crop planting second week of october with initial soil moisture of 141 and 127 mm in the top 115 cm soil depth however cumulative rainfall of 17 mm was recorded in the third and fourth week of october 2011 and planting was delayed to 1 november total soil moisture 151 mm similarly higher cumulative rainfall of 39 mm from 15 october to 15 november in 2013 resulted in further delay in crop sowing to 21 november at soil moisture of 133 mm within the root zone 0 115 cm crop growth events including days from planting to emergence the start of flowering duration of flowering senescence and physiological maturity were considered when 50 of the plants

harvesting a randomly selected area of 1 m2 at a 14 days interval from each replicate and dried to constant weight at 70 for 48 h total biomass and grain yield were recorded at physiological maturity

drainage below the root zone while sini and send are the soil moisture storage at the start and end of the crop growing season respectively the runoff was prevented by making bunds around each

canopy cover and non limiting water soil moisture conditions eo jones and kiniry 1986 sau et al 2004 whereas potential crop transpiration was estimated from eo using an extinction coefficient k which can vary from 0 54 to 0 63 for wheat kang et al 2003 phenological development and growth stage duration in response to temperature and photoperiod were managed by specific genetic coefficients these crop specific genetic coefficients relating to photoperiod sensitivity vernalization requirement duration of grain filling conversion of mass to grain number and grain filling rate were among the major inputs required for the model evaluation hunt et al 1993 a detailed description of the model can be found in ritchie et al 1998 the data for ceres wheat calibration in the present study were acquired from the field experiments conducted during 2007 08 2008 09 and 2009 10 growing seasons under unstressed well watered conditions calibration was started with the basic information for the cultivar coefficients provided within the model and adjustments were made sequentially starting with phenology including days to flowering days to maturity and then crop growth parameters ishaque et

and green 1991 2 4 model application scenarios one of the major applications of crop models is their use as a decision support tool for developing appropriate soil water and crop management practices to ensure sustainable crop production determining crop calendar under rainfed conditions requires synchronization of water availability from rainfall and crop water requirement at different growth stages therefore the sowing time of wheat should coincide with the duration in which water requirement from the rainfall at critical crop growth stages is met keeping in mind the probability of rainfall occurrence in wheat growing months simulations were carried out for different planting dates from 15 october to 15 december at 15 day intervals under rainfed conditions with one si of 50 mm applied at crop planting i1 or 30 days after planting dap i2 time series simulated values of yield at harvest as affected by the combination of planting dates and si strategies were plotted against the probabilities for which these yield values would exceed the simulated values of seasonal crop transpiration and evapotranspiration were used to calculate crop water productivity based on transpiration wpyt and evapotranspiration wpyet 3 results and discussion 3 1 climatic conditions 3 1 1 temperature temperature conditions during the study period remained approximately similar to long term averages with mean tmax and tmin around 23 and 8 respectively overall mean tmax 30 1 5 16 1 during the crop growth period october to april was less than the physiologically critical threshold 40 mean tmin during crop growth was highest for october 15 2 and lowest for january 1 1 5 however mean tmin for january remained below 0 during the 2010 11 growing season generally all the study years with respect to temperature were normal for the wheat crop growth 3 1 2 rainfall the study area receives rainfall from both south asian monsoon and western disturbances giving a twin peak type distribution mean annual rainfall was around 630 40 mm with comparatively higher events concentrated in summer june to september contributing over 50 65 of the annual rainfall 30 of the total rainfall during the wheat growing season 190 mm was associated with the western disturbance however annual rainfall variability during winter was much higher 78 cv 170 compared to that in the summer rainfall in the monsoon season 55 cv 115 the mean annual rainfall 206 mm during the study period 2010 11 to 2013 14 was higher than the long term average mean annual rainfall during initial crop growth stages november january was less than 10 mm however slightly higher rainfall of 22 and 28 mm was recorded in january and december 2012 the highest rainfall 213 mm was measured in february 2013 followed by march 2014 94 mm and february 2011 88 mm respectively 3 1 3 rainfall probability analysis the historical record of 37 years 1978 2014 means monthly rainfall during the wheat growing season was subjected to probability analysis using weibull formula fig 2 the annual rainfall with a probability level of 75 exceedance was 140 mm the corresponding wheat growing season rainfall for a 25 pr was about 280 mm the probability level of 50 exceedance for the wheat growing season october to april was 15 1 5 4 10 35 40 and 22 mm respectively with a total rainfall during the growing season of 188 mm although the probability level of 47 exceedance was 211 mm sufficient for crop water requirement in the area the expected rainfall during the initial crop growth phase in november december and january were 2 5 4 and 14 mm only 3 2 ceres wheat evaluation 3 2 1 soil moisture content simulation in individual soil layers the evaluation of model performance to simulate θv in individual soil layers 0 15 15 35 35 55 55 75 75 95 and 95 115 cm was carried out for all study years model evaluation outcomes are presented in table 4 a higher fluctuation of θv was simulated in the upper 35 cm soil profile as compared to measured θv while higher variation of soil moisture in deeper layers was observed in crop seasons 2010 11 2012 13 and 2013 14 respectively after rainfall events of 111 mm 231 mm and 131 mm in february and march combined values of simulated vs measured θv in the studied soil layers generally followed a 1 1 line of equality with a slope of 1 the slope of the regression line for simulated and measured θv was 0 67 with a y intercept of 0 03 and r2 0 60 showed higher differences among simulated and measured soil moisture contents model performance was not satisfactory in simulating θv in the top 0 15 cm soil layer in which it over estimated the moisture depletion resulting in high nrmse 44 89 in all the study years similar results were obtained for soil moisture distribution among different soil layers for crop season 2010 11 nrmse 13 65 and 15 35 cm soil depth in wheat season 2013 14 nrmse 53 however simulated and measured θv was in satisfactory to good agreement for the rest of the crop seasons and soil depths nrmse 2 26 the difference in simulated and measured soil moisture distribution among soil layers was attributed to the water balance sub routine module of ceres wheat and estimates of root growth dynamics eitzinger et al 2004 the soil water balance module within the model was based on the one dimensional cascading approach of water accounting in each soil layer considered in the soil profile ritchie et al 1998 and using the concept of the drained upper limit and drained lower limit of the soil as the basis of the available soil water drainage out of soil layer was calculated by empirical relation between θv and volumetric moisture content at field capacity θfc of the soil which was computed when θv in a soil layer at any time t was above θfc and no water flux beyond the studied layer was possible when θv in the layer was below θfc moreover one dimensional downward flow computed through cascading assumes evaporation losses from the top 0 5 cm soil depth and under estimated the upward flux from the deeper layers during the drying phase of the soil faria and bowen 2003 3 2 2 root zone soil moisture and soil water balance despite the lower efficiency of the model to simulate θv in different soil layers the response was satisfactory for the root zone 0 115 cm soil moisture fig 3 paired values of simulated vs measured total soil moisture

simulated values of 147 mm 144 mm 238 mm and 211 mm respectively overall a higher d of 0 99 rmse 20 mm and nrmse 11 showed satisfactory behavior of the model to predict etc 3 2 3 in season biomass and canopy cover measured in season biomass growth varied considerably among different growing seasons the model was able to capture the trends of biomass growth with higher r2 0 96 0 99 and reasonable nrmse 12 26 in different growing seasons fig 4a c e and g except in 2011 12 where in season biomass was under estimated by 11 the lower simulated biomass during 2011 12 was attributed to higher soil moisture stress due to early season rainfall resulting in reduced crop growth overall model predictions were good for growing seasons of 2012 13 2013 14 while it was satisfactory for 2010 11 and 2011 12 with respective rmse of 0 80 t ha 1 0 82 t ha 1 0 95 t ha 1 and 1 53 t ha 1 and nrmse 12 15 20 and 26 the four year pooled data showed a general under prediction of in season biomass growth with the following linear relationship 7 m 0 98 s 0 73 where s and m are simulated and measured in season biomass the slope of the regression line 0 98 closer to unity indicated an excellent relationship between the two while positive y intercept showed marginally under predicted simulation by 0 73 t ha 1 however higher r2 0 96 along with mean d rmse and nrmse of 0 99 1 05 t ha 1 and 18 respectively showed satisfactory model behavior for in season biomass growth simulation fig 4a canopy cover in this study was determined with digital photographs model simulated leaf area index was converted to

however overall values were in close agreement with reasonable rmse 8 11 nrmse 13 22 and d 0 90 0 93 showing a good relationship between simulated and measured cc the data pairs of simulated and measured values of cc when pooled across the years showed the following linear relationship 9 m 1 1 s 9 0 the higher slope of the regression line indicated a higher increase in simulated cc per unit increase in the measured value additionally a negative y intercept of 9 0 showed higher simulated cc growth particularly during early crop growth phases which was also evident from the canopy development curves shown in fig 4b however a higher coefficient of determination r2 0 80 along with four year mean d 0 99 rmse 10 and nrmse 19 indicated excellent to good performance of the model to predict the canopy growth 3 2 4 crop phenology biomass and grain yield at harvest simulated and measured values for days taken by the crop from planting to flowering and physiological maturity fig 5a were generally in good agreement the performance of the model was better for days taken to flowering d 0 81 compared to physiological maturity d 0 65 simulated values for days to physiological

wettest crop season of 2012 13 rainfall 270 mm statistical indicators of model performance showed an rmse of 8 days for days to maturity and 4 days for flowering with a similar nrmse 5 for both these

simulated values of yield for 2010 2013 were 3 t ha 1 3 3 t ha 1 4 t ha 1 and 3 9 t ha 1 respectively simulated and measured data pairs of both biomass and yield pooled across the years were close to the 1 1 line fig 5b of perfect agreement the d was 0 94 for biomass with rmse 0 91 t ha 1 and nrmse of 8 these statistical indicators confirmed an excellent simulation of biomass at harvest however the model generally over predicted aboveground biomass some under estimation was shown by the model with a lower d 0 70 and nrmse of 13 in grain yield rmse of 0 51 t ha 1 between the simulated and observed grain yield indicated a good performance of the model to predict wheat yield under rainfed conditions an earlier study conducted in the area reported a less satisfactory performance of ceres wheat with a lower d for biomass 0 85 0 76 and grain yield 0 65 0 69 with respective higher rmse of 2 87 4 58 t ha 1 and 0 44 0 73 t ha 1 ahmed and hassan 2011 the differences described by rmse in the study seemed to be linear and could certainly be reduced through new parameterization or recalibrating present functions by modifying specific crop genetic coefficients or soil parameters willmott 1982 however parameterization or recalibration of soil parameters might result in the site specific behavior of the model other than logical or calibration errors the lower model simulations may also be attributed to input errors which have been reported as a more serious source of poor model predictions jones and kiniry 1986 3 2 5 rainfall and crop water productivity measured rfpb showed higher variability among study years 12 8 1 63 5 2 0 51 kg m 3 rfpb was generally higher in comparatively drier crop season 2011 12 rainfall 80 mm and lowered in wet season 2012 13 rainfall 270 mm fig 5c mean measured rfpb in crop seasons 2010 11 rainfall 138 mm and 2013 14 rainfall 196 mm was 7 0 0 81 and 6 2 0 50 kg m 3 respectively measured rfpy followed a similar trend with higher productivity of 4 1 0 7 kg m 3 for 2011 12 followed by 2 7 0 4 1 7 0 3 and 2 0 0 3 kg m 3 in crop seasons 2010 11 2012 13 and 2013 14 respectively model predicted rfpb and rfpy showed higher productivity under lower rainfall conditions and lowered productivity in the years with higher rainfall fig 5c simulated values of rfpb were 7 5 kg m 3 11 4 kg m 3 5 5 kg m 3 and 8 5 kg m 3 during 2010 11 to 2013 14 respectively however data pairs of simulated and observed rfpb a higher scattering around the 1 1 line model over estimated rfpb in crop season 2013 14 while it under estimated for 2011 12 the difference was due to higher simulated biomass produced in crop season 2013 14 and lower in 2011 12 overall the d for simulated and measured rfpb was 0 99 while nrmse represented 18 of the mean observed rfpb and rmse of 0 41 kg m 3 simulated values of rfpy were 2 14 kg m 3 4 2 kg m 3 1 5 kg m 3 and 2 5 kg m 3 for the study years 2010 11 to 2013 14 the simulated and measured data pairs were close to the 1 1 line d was high 0 99 and nrmse represented 16 of the average relative deviation between the simulated and the measured rfpy indicating the good performance of the model measured wpbet and wpyet based on soil water balance under rainfed conditions was also higher in the year receiving lower growing season rainfall fig 5d respective measured wpbet and wpyet values for wheat seasons 2010 11 to 2013 14 were 5 8 0 7 kg m 3 7 9 1 0 kg m 3 5 7 0 6 kg m 3 6 6 0 5 kg m 3 and 2 2 0 33 kg m 3 2 6 0 43 kg m 3 1 9 0 37 kg m 3 2 1 0 30 kg m 3 with corresponding simulated values of 7 2 kg m

years receiving higher rainfall with an overall bias of 6 however a higher d 0 99 and reasonable nrmse 17 indicated a good performance of the model for simulating wpbet conversely the model slightly under estimated wpyet in growing seasons with higher rainfall however simulated and measured data pairs were closer to a 1 1 line of perfect agreement excellent performance of the model to simulate wpyet was confirmed from high agreement index 0 99 lower rmse 0 12 kg m 3 and the nrmse representing 6 of the average relative deviation between the simulated and the measured values 3 3 model applications 3 3 1 biomass at harvest appropriate planting date and si for crop production stability coupled with higher water productivity were carried out based on expected pr of rainfall during the wheat growing season using historical weather data the amount and timing of the rainfall events demonstrated a pronounced effect on biomass production under rainfed conditions generally 50 of the study years had lower simulated median biomass this lower biomass was simulated for the years that either received a rainfall 100 mm during crop growing season or with early dry phase and 100 150 mm cumulative rainfall near the crop s anthesis or grain formation phases similarly osman et al 2021 found that growing seasons with optimum rainfall resulted in higher biomass while growing seasons with a lack of early season rainfall resulted in reduced biomass the crop biomass at harvest was positively impacted by rainfall received in december and january corresponding to early phases of crop growth and or cumulative rainfall above 150 mm the analysis for appropriate planting date under rainfed conditions indicated a negative effect of early october planting on biomass production which was attributed to lower expected early season november and december rainfall affecting crown root initiation and tillering stages due to soil moisture stress fig 6a b and c similarly planting carried out in december may expose the crop to lower temperature and solar radiation during the early growth phases resulting in retarded biomass growth before booting or anthesis long term simulated biomass with higher variability 8 2 3 7 t ha 1 for early planting of 15 october was 37 40 37 which was 24 lower as compared to successive plantings from 01 november to 15 december simulated median biomass 9 5 t ha 1 for the crop planted on 15 october with 50 mm si application at planting was 37 higher than that of rainfed conditions the simulations for other crop planting dates from 01 november through 15 december showed a respective increase of 45 50 40 and 30 in biomass than early planting the si application of 50 mm at 30 dap had a positive effect on biomass simulation 15 6 t ha 1 in early planted crops with an increase of 125 than that of the same sowing date under rainfed conditions it indicated that lower rainfall in late october and november could be compensated by si application of 50 mm at 30 dap a sequential delay of 15 days in crop planting from 01 november to 15 december had lesser biomass of 2 8 14 and 22 respectively as compared to 15 october however whiskers of the plot show more consistent biomass associated with the si application at 30 dap than si applied at the planting dates 15 30 november and 15 december 3 3 2 grain yield ceres wheat simulated a similar trend of grain yield at harvest as that for simulated biomass fig 6d e and f median simulated yield under rainfed conditions increased from 2 4 t ha 1 in early planting of october to 4 9 t ha 1 for planting in december although there was a higher probability of getting a lower yield than the rest of the plantings in november model simulated median yield for november plantings did not show much difference the application of si at planting increased median yield by 54 3 7 t ha 1 in an early planted crop of 15 october than that under rainfed conditions the expected median yield was 67 higher in 15 november planting compared to earlier planting for the rest of the time the median yield increase ranged from 41 in late to 55 for 30 november box and whisker plot fig 6e showed an expected yield of 5 7 t ha 1 with the lesser difference in maximum and minimum yield for the crop planted on 01 november with 50 mm si application at the time of planting as an appropriate strategy to obtain more consistent yield in this scenario the application of si at 30 dap showed a comparatively narrow interquartile range compared to si application at crop planting the median simulated yield was 4 6 t ha 1 for early and 6 0 t ha 1 for the crop planted on 15 november with the si application at 30 dap the 19 23 and 11 increase was simulated for plantings on 1 30 november and 15 december respectively as compared to early planting the respective percent differences between simulated median yields with si applied at 30 dap from those at crop planting were 27 3 1 and 2 for the crop planted from 15 october through 30 november the crop planting on 1 or 15 november with si application at 30 dap was the most appropriate strategy to obtain higher and sustainable yield under the soil and climatic conditions of the study region harvest index calculated as a fraction of grain yield and biomass at harvest did not show much difference between rainfed and both of the si irrigation strategies however the application of si as i2 had a slightly more probability of getting a higher harvest index 3 3 3 probability of exceedance time series simulated values of yield at harvest as affected by the combination of planting date and si strategies were plotted against the pr fig 7 the pr was expressed as the percentage of time a particular yield value will be exceeded 80 of the years are expected to produce 1 14 t ha 1 grain yield compared to 3 14 t ha 1 3 02 t ha 1 3 8 t ha 1 and 3 1 t ha 1 in successive plantings from 01 november through 15 december respectively under rainfed conditions and sowing on 15 october however si application as i1 and i2 may increase the 80 pr to 2 1 t ha 1 4 4 t ha 1 5 2 t ha 1 5 1 t ha 1 4 4 t ha 1 in the crop planted on 15 october and 4 0 t ha 1 5 3 t ha 1 5 5 t ha 1 5 0 t ha 1 and 4 3 t ha 1 in the crop planted on 1 15 30 november and 15 december respectively the simulated biomass and grain yield using ceres wheat in this study were supported by the findings of ahmed 2011 who conducted a two year study on wheat under rainfed conditions in the same area with different planting windows from mid october to mid december reporting that higher biomass and yield for the sowing carried out during first 10 days of november compared to an early plantation in october or delayed planting in late november or december other studies conducted with si as a management option for rainfed cropping system also indicated that crop production with declining and erratic seasonal rainfall might not be feasible without si nangia and oweis 2016 as si has the potential to significantly increase crop yield and productivity man et al 2016 nangia and oweis 2016 molla et al 2021 the si application is reported as a tool for dry spell mitigation and crop yield productivity enhancement by protecting crop failure as a consequence of dry spells nangia and oweis 2016 3 3 4 evapotranspiration and transpiration productivity simulated values of wpyet were generally higher for 15 and 30 november plantings with a decreasing trend before and after these dates fig 8b d and f the spread in the productivity was higher for the 15 november planting whereas a higher consistency was simulated for the crop planted on 30 november the model simulated a higher wpyet 12 in early crop planting with i1 as compared with the rainfed condition si applied as i1 reduced the productivity in late november and 15 december plantings by 7 and 3 respectively the model simulated a probability of getting higher wpyet for the crop planted on 15 november in this scenario however model simulated wpyet showed almost similar median values 2 5 2 6 kg m 3 for november plantings which tend to decrease in the early and late planted crop for si of 50 mm applied at 30 dap application of si either as i1 or i2 increased simulated wpyt from early october to mid november plantings after which it tends to decrease fig 8a c and e median wpyt did not show any appreciable increase or decrease between si treatments however the probability of getting higher wpyt was more for planting on 15 november in i1 and 01 november with i2 comparison between model simulated yield biomass fig 6 and wpyet wpyt fig 8 for 1 and 15 november plantings with i2 showed higher values for all these parameters indicating efficient utilization of irrigation water higher wpyet and wpyt may be associated with lower evaporation components of total etc more water may have been evaporated from the soil surface due to comparatively higher prevailing temperature during early crop growth phases with incomplete canopy cover in early sowing crop growth tends to be slower in late planting due to lower temperature and solar radiation in january and february the crop canopy does not completely cover the soil surface which may expose the land surface for evaporation thus resulting in lower wpyt moreover lower biomass and grain yield for the early and late sown crops were also reflected as lower wpyet and wpyt a previous study by el sadek and salem 2016 under mediterranean conditions also showed si application of 150 mm at tillering booting and grain filling substantially increased plant height number of grains spikes grain weight aboveground biomass grain yield and wue these findings indicated that si has a significant potential for improving water productivity without compromising the land productivity of the study site 4 conclusion soil moisture content aboveground biomass growth in season canopy development grain yield and biomass at harvest under rainfed conditions were satisfactorily simulated in this study by using the calibrated ceres wheat the outcomes of model simulations suggested that the appropriate planting time for achieving higher wheat yield in the rainfed region of pakistan is from 1 to 15 november the findings also suggested that one si of 50 mm applied at 30 dap can assure higher wheat yield and water productivity in the rainfed region of pakistan however sufficient initial soil moisture at sowing to ensure crop emergence and growth in the initial 30 days is a prerequisite for achieving higher wheat yield and water productivity in the region additionally wheat can also be planted in the third and fourth weeks of october in case of sufficient rainfall events in late september and early october along with si at 30 dap however crop planting can be delayed to the second week of november with si of 50 mm at sowing in the scenario with lower or no rainfall in late september and early october a single si application 30 dap has the potential to serve as an alternative irrigation scheme for additional water savings in rainfed regions based on the simulation results it is recommended that wheat plantation in the rainfed region of pakistan should be carried out from november 1 15 with 50 mm si at 30 dap for ensuring higher grain yield and water productivity the calibrated ceres wheat showed its potential to serve as a decision support tool for the extrapolation of wheat yield and water productivity in other rainfed areas with similar variables of soil and climate however further studies are required to test the applicability of calibrated ceres wheat in regions with different crop management practices cultivars and variables soil and climate declaration of competing interest the

producing areas in china is facing the severe challenge of agricultural water shortages improving water use efficiency wue is the most appropriate way to achieve sustainable agricultural development and obtain high returns however farmers knew little about efficient irrigation strategies for flood irrigated fields in the hid in this study the noah mp land surface model lsm with dynamic crop and irrigation schemes is used to jointly simulate the maize yield and irrigation amount in the hid from 2003 to 2012 a sensitivity test for ten sets of irrigation setup with different soil moisture sm triggering thresholds cri 0 1 is conducted and the corresponding wue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue are evaluated and analyzed in addition irrigation at different crop growth stages affects total irrigation amounts and crop yield the results show that under rain fed conditions the severe sm deficit during the growing season significantly decreases the maize yield in the hid with almost no harvest in dry years with traditional flood irrigation the irrigation amount per unit area exceeds 1000 mm leading to low wue and iwue while more than 18 25 of irrigation water is wasted as runoff with the increase of irrigation intensity both wue and iwue show a significant diminishing marginal effect usually occurring when sm is greater than 0 24 0 27 m3 m3 the optimal wue is obtained near cri 0 6 while the worst wue is obtained at cri 1 in a normal year efficient irrigation amount is about 390 480 mm 53 63 less than that in flood irrigation in this scenario most irrigation water becomes sm and transpiration and less than 5 becomes runoff with effective irrigation in the reproductive stage only a small amount of irrigation is needed to promote yield formation fully considering the maize yield wue ecosystems and the available water resources in the hid the recommended irrigation amount is about 600 650 mm to achieve the optimal maize yield and wue keywords the hetao irrigation district water use efficiency irrigation water use efficiency irrigation amount crop growth stage 1 introduction water is critical for agricultural production and plays an important role in global food security according to the latest report from the world bank 2020 more than 20 of the global cultivated lands are under irrigation and contribute to 40 of the global total food production despite its arid and semi arid climate the hetao irrigation district hid is one of the important food producing areas in china thanks to irrigation liu et al 2015 the agricultural production in hid depends heavily on irrigation water use from the yellow river and is and will continue to be undoubtedly affected by global climate change and water security liu et al 2015 before 2000 the hid diverted about 5 billion m3 year of water from the yellow river every year more than 90 of this water was used for agricultural production irrigation and salt leaching ren et al 2016 long term extensive field flood irrigation and inappropriate canal drainage management tend to cause salt accumulation in the surface soil negatively affecting crop yields qadir et al 2009 zhao et al 2014 at the same time global warming is intensifying inevitably and extreme weather is occurring more frequently along with increases in industrial agricultural and residential water use as a result the yellow river basin runoff has substantially declined over the past 50 years fu et al 2004 shi et al 2017 moreover recent global and regional forecasts indicate that the warm dry trend of the upper reaches of the yellow river basin in the 21st century may continue to intensify further aggravating agricultural water shortages in the hid li et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 with changing climate and greater demand water scarcity became a global phenomenon and affecting every economic sector as the highest water consumer agricultural irrigation has a lower return per unit of water than other economic sectors according to the quota allocated by the watershed management agency the hid can divert 4 billion m3 year of water from the yellow river but the actual water diversion is always 25 higher than the allocated quota liu and zhang 2008 the water allocation for irrigation in the hid will be reduced according to a plan created by the yellow river water conservancy commission ye et al 2010 through this action the watershed management agency hopes to steer hid towards water saving agriculture improve water use efficiency for more crop per drop and curb excessive water use in irrigated areas the amount of water diverted from the yellow river to the hid in the future will be reduced by at least 20 from the previous 5 billion m3 year zhang et al 2017 when the water resources per unit of farmland decrease the water shortages may severely restrict the agricultural productivity of the hid demanding more effective water management in irrigated agriculture to sustain the food production in the region it is essential to adopt advanced water saving technologies and optimize irrigation scheduling this is more critical in semi arid and arid regions as water scarcity along with other associated problems poses the most critical abiotic constraint in food production minhas et al 2020 on the other hand the agricultural land in the hid has been divided into small farms due to the special farmland use rights i e household contract responsibility system tan et al 2006 this forms a small scale household based individual production resulting in a very complex planting structure in hid hid has mainly grown alimentary crops such as wheat and maize and economic crops such as sunflower sugar beet and tomato for a long time in the past ten years the planting area of wheat with high water consumption has decreased significantly while the sunflower with low water consumption has increased significantly among the alimentary crops wheat planted in hid has plummeted from 52 in 2000 to 9 in 2018 while maize has steadily increased from 15 in 2000 to 32 in 2018 gao et al 2021 liu et al 2017 ren et al 2016 furthermore maize is the most widely grown food crop not only globally but also in china and plays an important role in ensuring food security li et al 2017 in arid regions such as hid water is a major factor limiting crop yields therefore effective use of limited water in arid areas to increase maize yield per unit area is of great significance for alleviating food security problems traditional irrigation practices such as flood irrigation in the hid are not optimized for water usage efficiency due to the high ratio of potential evaporation to precipitation in the hid the irrigation water demand during the crop growing season is relatively high furthermore local farmers tend irrigate excessively to ensure maximum yield resulting in low wue and economic returns flood irrigation is usually carried out four to five times during the crop growing season and irrigation accounts for about two thirds of the water diversion from the yellow river after the crop harvest usually one third of the water diverted from the yellow river is also used for fall irrigation to flush the soil s accumulated salts feng et al 2005 zhang et al 2011 traditional flood irrigation usually causes copious deep leakage reducing irrigation water use efficiency and causing large nutrient losses feng et al 2005 liu et al 2017 xu et al 2010 therefore reducing water loss in irrigation and improving wue are critical to the sustainable development of hid agriculture various methods have been developed to improve crop water use efficiency and optimize irrigation in the hid water saving irrigation measures have been applied to corn planting including mulching drip irrigation and deficit irrigation in northern china drip irrigation and mulching are simultaneously used for corn and other crops saving water and increasing crop yields although efficient in water usage drip irrigation usually requires higher equipment installation and maintenance costs than do other irrigation measures zhang et al 2017 deficit irrigation is a lower cost water saving irrigation strategy for farmers allowing crops to suffer from only slight water stress which studies show can improve water use efficiency and improve specific quality indicators of crops zhang et al 2017 however water stress on crop yield varies with crop types soils and climatic conditions for example zhang et al 2017 found that tomatoes in the hid can obtain the maximum yield when deficit irrigation is performed according to 80 of crop evapotranspiration on the other hand liu et al 2017 found that water deficit irrigation of 20 30 can achieve the best wue but can also reduce the corn yield by 10 although the benefits of deficit irrigation have been verified in some crops in the hid and northwest china in general the effective management of deficit irrigation for spring maize in the hid area needs to be studied in depth although field experiments are the best way to determine optimal irrigation strategy long term field campaigns are not only costly but also highly susceptible to field conditions and climatic variation thus mathematical models can provide insight into various crop growth processes in space and time and play a key role in understanding the dynamic interactions between climate soil water and crop growth albano et al 2017 milly 2001 recent efforts have been dedicated to integrating crop growth dynamics and irrigation parameterizations into various host land surface models liu et al 2016 mcdermid et al 2017 nazemi and wheater 2015 pokhrel et al 2016 for example liu et al 2016 used noah mplsm coupled with a dynamic crop module to study corn and soybean yields in illinois and nebraska in the united states ozdogan et al 2010 used irrigated tile crop growing season and root zone sm availability sma to study the irrigation trigger mechanism the sm deficit approach is incorporated into noah mp lsm xu et al 2019 to dynamically represent the implementation of irrigation and to calculate irrigation water demand by subtracting the current root zone sm from the field capacity i e the sm deficit meanwhile the current modified version of the noah mp lsm improves surface energy balance enhances lai simulation and provides a more reasonable biomass estimate the improved and more complex dynamic irrigation scheme and crop model coupled with noah mp lsm is applied to study the localization of irrigation parameters and the long term effects on soybean and corn at both a farm scale and regional scale in the united states liu et al 2016 xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 at the same time various irrigation methods including flood irrigation drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation have been developed in lsm and coupled wrf model lawston et al 2017 valmassoi et al 2020 which can analyze the relationship between the amount of irrigation water and the crop yield under different irrigation modes due to the above advantages and the fact that it has never been used to study the effects of deficit irrigation on maize yield and wue in the hid the noah mp lsm will be applied in this study the main objectives of the study are as follows 1 to evaluate the performance of offline noah mp lsm coupled with irrigation and the crop module in the hid 2 to examine the relationship between crop yield and water use efficiency under different deficit irrigation schemes as well as the optimal irrigation amount and corresponding soil moisture of spring maize in the hid under different climatic conditions and 3 to explore the impact of different irrigation intensities at different crop growth stages on irrigation amounts and on crop yields section 2 introduces the noah mp lsm data and methodology section 3 presents model results of crop yield irrigation amounts and water use efficiency section 4 discusses the relationship among crop yield water use efficiency and soil moisture section 5 summarizes the important findings of this study the results will provide an essential scientific basis for further research on water saving irrigation in the hid 2 data model and methodology 2 1 data preparation surrounded by mountain ranges and deserts in western inner mongolia about 41 n 108e fig 1 the hid is one of the three major irrigation areas in china and featuring an arid climate and scarce precipitation fig 1 the multi year average precipitation in the hid area is about 150 mm of which about 60 are concentrated in july and august the spatial difference of precipitation in hid is large and precipitation gradually decreases from east to west the annual average temperature is about 7 and the potential evapotranspiration is about 2300 mm year wang et al 2020 the altitude of the hid is about 1000 1700 m with the terrain sloping down from the southwest to the northeast covered with mainly clay loam xue and ren 2017 spring maize is one of the main crops in the hid and from 2002 to 2012 its planting area steadily increased from 1 22 million mu 1 mu 1 15 hectare to 1 84 million mu the largest maize planting irrigation district in the central part of the hid is the yongji irrigation district accounting for about 30 of the maize planting area in the east of hid the ulat irrigation district accounts for about 12 of the total maize planting area in hid wuliangsu lake the eighth largest freshwater lake in china is also within the ulat irrigation district according to the bayan nur water resources bulletin statistics from 2002 to 2012 the hid irrigation area is about 8 47 million mu the total water diversion from the yellow river is about 4 5 billion m3 and the irrigation per unit area is about 800 mm year the hid generally performs four to five times of flood irrigations during the crop growing season additional high intensity flood irrigation is performed after the harvest in autumn commonly known as autumn irrigation accounting for about one third of the annual irrigation about 1 52 billion m3 due to the perennial water diversion from the yellow river to hid for irrigation the hid groundwater level is relatively shallow and annual variation of the groundwater level is between 1 17 and 2 3 m in this study the 10 day resolution relative sm of two agrometeorological stations in china s farmland crop growth and soil moisture dataset csmd were obtained from china s meteorological administration the csmd of spring maize is only available at agrometeorological stations in the ulat irrigation district wlt station and the yongji irrigation district lhe station from 2010 to 2012 the observed sm of wlt and lhe in csmd are used to evaluate the simulated sm of the noah mp lsm compared with lhe wlt has a more humid soil environment mainly because wlt is in a low lying area adjacent to wuliangsu lake and downstream of the hid main drainage canal resulting in shallower groundwater depth than in lhe the atmospheric forcing data are from the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 from january 2002 to december 2012 the gldas data provide rainfall snowfall wind speed temperature and humidity and radiation forcing at 0 25 grid spacing and 3 hourly intervals in this study the cn05 gao et al 2011 observation analysis data sets are used to evaluate the accuracy of precipitation and temperature from gldas the cn05 with a spatial and temporal resolution of 0 25 and with daily records is a grid dataset generated by china s meteorological administration using observation data of more than 2000 meteorological stations from 1961 to 2015 2 2 irrigation and crop model description the offline noah mp lsm under the high resolution land surface data assimilation system framework hrldas v3 9 chen et al 2007 is used for the numerical experiments in this study this section briefly introduces irrigation and crop modules in the noah mp lsm more detailed contents can be found in xu et al 2019 and zhang et al 2020 the variables needed in this study such as precipitation kg m 2 s 1 crop transpiration kg m 2 s 1 underground runoff mm surface runoff mm irrigation amount mm soil moisture m3 m 3 and mass of grain g m 2 can be obtained from noah mp lsm output as a reflection of the degree of water stress soil moisture availability sma in the root zone is the primary irrigation trigger in noah mp for irrigated farmland the root zone sma is defined as the ratio of the current available root zone sm to the non stress sm 1 sma sm sm wlt sm ref sm wlt where sm is soil moisture and sm fc and sm wp are field water capacity and wilting coefficient respectively the irrigation scheme is activated when sma is lower than the sm trigger threshold irr cri abbreviated as cri in addition the irrigation trigger in the study is limited to the crop growing season and can be adjusted according to the harvest date the noah mp crop model liu et al 2016 includes dynamic crop specific growth processes to allocate the carbohydrate product from photosynthesis into different crop parts during the growing season the dynamic crop growth model also calculates time varying leaf area index lai which directly impacts the surface radiation photosynthesis process soil moisture and surface energy fluxes to simulate the biomass of grain yield an important variable for the agricultural community noah mp crop uses carbohydrate flux instead of carbon flux in noah mp crop growth models are implemented in noah mp crop to simulate the seasonal evolution of various crop types of biomasses e g root mass leaf mass and grain mass current version of the noah mp crop model has relatively complete simulation capabilities for maize and soybean and has been extensively tested in other regions with good results liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 while other crop types such as wheat are still in the developmental testing phase the maize growth module has been established in liu et al 2016 and its parameters have been applied at a field site at bondville illinois and regionally in the u s corn belt in zhang et al 2020 the accumulated growing degree days gdd is adopted to determine crop plant growth stages pgs liu et al 2016 in the noah mp crop model in total eight pgs are defined before seeding emergence initial vegetative normal vegetative initial reproductive to maturity after maturity and after harvesting for different pgs the total carbohydrates calculated by the psn scheme are allocated to different parts of crop bodies such as leaves stems roots and grains depending on the stage function from 0 to 1 for example in the vegetable and reproductive stages the most assimilated carbon is allocated to the leaves and grains of the crop respectively in this study the crop growing season is mainly divided into two stages the vegetative stage v and the reproductive stage r this analysis reveals the irrigation impacts on different growing season periods and their corresponding crop yields 2 3 model setup and numerical experiments seventeen groups 1 17 of experiments are designed as seen in table 1 the simulation period is from 2002 to 2012 with the first year treated as spin up and the other ten years analyzed the analysis periods 2003 2012 can be separated into three groups based on their precipitation in the crop growing season according to cumulative distribution function cdf of precipitation observed at lhe and wlt during crop growing season may to september from 1961 to 2015 the years 2010 2011 and 2012 are selected as a normal year cdf 0 5 extremely dry year cdf 0 1 and extremely wet year cdf 0 9 respectively the first set of experiments listed in table 1 simulates crop yields and irrigation under rain fed conditions groups 2 11 are used to analyze the sensitivity of the irrigation amount and crop yield to root zone sma triggers the cri1 scenario is used to simulate a flood irrigation scenario the optimal irrigation is determined in the following analysis by the cri parameter to reveal the impact of irrigation at different crop growth stages six sets of experiments 12 17 are designed experiments 12 14 represent the optimal irrigation implemented only at v r and v r experiments 15 17 are similar to 12 14 but with flood irrigation spring corn in the hid is usually planted from late april to early may and harvested from mid to late september with slight variations depending on climatic and environmental conditions liu et al 2017 to facilitate data processing and modeling the planting 120 365 and harvest dates 270 365 of spring maize in the hid are uniformly set to the same value according to the csmd irrigation is only carried out during the crop growing season and ends 30 days before harvest with no autumn irrigation the dynamic crop module is enabled for all experiments listed in table 1 2 4 water use efficiency to evaluate the water use efficiency in hid agricultural crop water use efficiency wue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue are analyzed in this study wue is defined as the ratio of crop transpiration to agricultural crop available water wue can be expressed as 2 wue tr p irr sm where tr is the crop transpiration mm p is the local precipitation mm irr is irrigation depth mm sm is the soil moisture change mm p irr sm is the agricultural crop s total available water taw during the crop growing season iwue reflects the crop products that can be produced per unit of irrigation water consumption iwue is expressed as 3 iwue y irr where y is the grain yield g m 2 and irr is the corresponding irrigation depth during the crop growing season mm 3 results 3 1 forcing data and model performance high consistencies of temperature and precipitation from gldas and cn05 are shown in fig 2 suggesting that gldas can provide reliable climate forcing for this research for precipitation r2 of wlt and lhe is 0 85 and 0 92 and the resm is 7 78 mm and 7 55 mm respectively for temperature r2 of wlt and lhe is above 0 99 and resm is within 0 7 fig 2b for observation the root zone relative soil moisture rsm of wlt is higher than that of lhe especially in the surface soil rsm1 the observed three layer rsm of the wlt and lhe fluctuates between 75 and 99 during the crop growing season the sm and irrigation intensity during the crop growing season simulated in noah mp lsm are sensitive to and can be adjusted by the cri parameter under no irrigation ni red line the rsm of both wlt and lhe gradually decreases with soil depth and the average rsm of multi layered soil is usually less than 50 the rsm of wlt is higher than that of lhe especially in deep soil soil layers 2 3 in the noah mp lsm under the irrigation scenario the simulated rsm gradually approaches saturation as the cri cri 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 increases when cri 1 blue line considered as flood irrigation the simulated rsm during the crop growing season is close to the observed rsm the noah mp lsm provides reasonable estimations of irrigation amounts while huge uncertainties exist in the actual irrigation amount from official statistics according to zhou et al 2020 the irrigation amount in hid reaches 2000 mm year while according to official statistics it is about 800 mm including autumn irrigation this difference may be caused by the different statistical calibers of the two data sets in the irrigation area and the total irrigation water amount for example the official irrigation statistics consider only the water diverted from the yellow river considering the combined use of water diverted from the yellow river and groundwater the available irrigation water per unit area of the hid is 1100 1500 mm without considering water loss wang et al 2007 yang et al 2003 and in some areas it even reaches 1800 2000 mm zhang et al 2011 in the noah mp lsm simulation the irrigation amount under medium and high intensity cri 0 4 is about 400 1100 mm compared with the actual irrigation amount the simulated irrigation amount is within a reasonable range indicating that noah mp lsm can obtain simulations similar to the actual irrigation amount of hid by optimizing and adjusting the cri parameter 3 2 climate soil moisture and crop yield in simulation under different climatic conditions the difference in precipitation between wlt and lhe is significant especially in wet years but there is almost no difference in temperature wlt is slightly higher in fig 4a and b precipitation has large interannual variability and peak precipitation can occur late in the crop growing season when water demand is low e g in october in a normal year 2010 while precipitation peaks during the critical growth period from elongation to milking stages in july and august in typical years they are still too low to meet the high evapotranspiration demand only in extremely wet years can the precipitation in the crop growing season meet the needs of maize growth about 350 400 mm more than 70 of the precipitation in a typical year for lhe and wlt is concentrated within the crop growing season fig 4a in wet years the precipitation of lhe and wlt during the crop growing season is 280 mm and 404 mm respectively the peak precipitation appears in july and the corresponding peak precipitation is 116 mm and 80 mm respectively in dry years and normal years the precipitation of lhe and wlt during the crop growing season is less than 200 mm and the precipitation peak appears in august to september wlt has higher sm than lhe even when precipitation is equally scarce in dry years the sm of wlt simulated by noah mp lsm is usually between 0 1 m3 m3 and 0 2 m3 m3 while the sm of lhe is usually less than 0 1 m3 m3 fig 4c in the crop growing season the sm of a normal year dry year wet year and multi year averages in wlt are 0 16 0 133 0 189 and 0 183 m3 m3 respectively while in lhe they are 0 057 0 049 0 085 and 0 081 m3 m3 maize yields in lhe where precipitation is less and soils are drier are significantly lower than in wlt and lhe suffers almost a total loss in a dry year therefore it is difficult to obtain stable crop yields under rain fed conditions which can decimate the yields in dry years in typical years the biomass accumulation process is usually from early july to mid august compared with wlt lhe starts biomass accumulation ten days later but reaches maximum biomass ten days earlier in a dry normal and wet year maize yields in lhe are 1 6 and 64 g m2 respectively while in wlt they are 22 81 and 154 g m2 respectively fig 4d the wetter conditions of the wlt bring greater yields than those in the lhe only under rain fed conditions 3 3 impacts of irrigation on surface hydrometeorology and crop yield the differences in irrigation amount irr days of irrigation irrdn sm runoff r underground runoff plus surface runoff crop transpiration rate tr and crop yield grain are significant for irrigation under different cri triggered conditions compared to the rain fed condition fig 5 when cri 0 7 the irr and irrdn in lhe are higher than those in wlt while when cri 0 7 the irr and irrdn at both sites are almost the same fig 5a b these results may be because under low intensity irrigation compared with lhe wlt has a lower soil water deficit and more water sources such as deep soil water resulting in lower irr and irrdn however under high intensity irrigation irrigation water contribution to the available water resources of lhe and wlt increases reducing the difference between irr and irrdn at these two sites similarly with increasing intensity of deficit irrigation increasing cri the difference in sm between lhe and wlt gradually decreases fig 5c when cri exceeds a particular value r and tr and grain exhibit varying degrees of diminishing or increasing marginal effects when cri 0 7 r increases exponentially with increasing cri indicating that a large amount of irrigation is lost to runoff fig 5d irrigation can promote the tr of crops under appropriate irrigation intensity in fact when cri exceeds 0 5 0 6 all high intensity irrigation has a negative effect on tr fig 5e similarly for wlt only when the cri is less than 0 3 0 4 can irrigation promote tr fig 5e notably the tr of lhe is always greater than the tr of wlt regardless of whether the scenario is rain fed or irrigation even under suitable irrigation intensity the tr of wlt and lhe also show great differences which may be related to the slight difference in radiation and temperature between the two sites compared with wlt lhe has fewer precipitation events and drier soil likely implying more radiation and sunny days sacks et al 2009 compared with rain fed conditions irrigation greatly improves hid crop yields under rain fed conditions although the tr of lhe is much greater than that of wlt fig 5e the crop yield of lhe is much lower than that of wlt due to water scarcity during the crop growing season fig 5f after irrigation the crop yield of lhe significantly increases with the increase of irrigation intensity the difference in crop yield between wlt and lhe becomes more evident however as the cri increases especially when the cri 0 7 the diminishing marginal effects on grain in lhe is clear similarly the diminishing marginal effects on grain are found in wlt they also occur earlier and are more pronounced compared to those in lhe the diminishing marginal effects on grain are related to the inhibition of plant self regulation and control ability which can be reflected by the weakening of tr under high intensity irrigation fig 5e 3 4 impacts of irrigation on water use efficiency the wue of lhe and wlt varied considerably under different climatic conditions especially at low levels of total available water taw in dry and wet years with the increase of taw wue gradually decreases to its lowest level fig 6 the wue of lhe is always higher than that of wlt because even under the same taw the tr of lhe is always higher than that of wlt fig 6c f indicating that lhe has higher water use capacity compared with a dry year or a normal year tr is usually lower in a wet year which is evident in both lhe and wlt fig 6c f this result further demonstrates that rainy weather and moist soil may affect radiation and ground temperature which may negatively affect the wue of lhe and wlt at both lhe and wlt tr always reaches a maximum after taw and sm reach a certain level fig 6c f and then decreases with increasing taw the taws are at similar values when trs reach maxima for all years the main difference between taw for maximum tr at wlt and lhe is that the drier lhe needs higher taw to reach higher maximum tr compared to lhe when the tr reaches the maximum the sm of lhe and wlt in typical years is about 0 24 0 27 m3 m3 in addition to being affected by radiation sacks et al 2009 tr changes are also associated with waterlogging stress and hypoxia conditions steduto et al 2012 zhang et al 2021 although gldas forcing data were used in all experiments we speculate that increasing irrigation intensity may reduce net radiation thereby suppressing tr adegoke et al 2003 yang et al 2020 with increasing irrigation intensity simulated by noah mp soil temperature decreased and soil evaporation rate increased proving the influence of irrigation on surface energy flux maize may also suffer from waterlogging stress resulting in root hypoxia and weakened tr besides the above possible factors cooler air temperature and higher relative humidity due to irrigation activities may also reduce the driving force for transpiration sorooshian et al 2011 yang et al 2019 however further investigations and modeling studies are needed to confirm this finding which we will facilitate in future studies the wue vs taw plots in fig 6a and d reflect eq 2 where tr wue taw the wue of lhe and wlt changes in three main phases with the increase of taw or sm with a rapid decrease in the first phase a smooth change in the second phase and a slight decrease in the third phase fig 6 although the phase change of wue between wlt and lhe is slightly different it is evident that sm at around 0 26 m3 m3 is an inflection point of the second and third phases of wue the phase change characteristics between wue and taw can be observed but climate differences make it challenging to identify the inflection point of each phase change from the relationship between wue and taw in lhe and wlt however this point can be found in the relationship between wue and sm the first stage of wue for lhe and wlt is usually at sm 0 16 m3 m3 the second stage at 0 16 m3 m3 sm 0 26 m3 m3 and the third stage at sm 0 26 m3 m3 fig 6a b when sm gradually increases to saturated moisture the wue of lhe and wlt decrease to a minimum iwue can reflect the management level of agricultural irrigation water and the degree of water saving the level of iwue depends not only on crop yield but also on the irrigation amount under different climatic conditions humid climate conditions or soil environments generally have higher iwue fig 7a b d e the iwue of the two sites is the largest in wet years and the smallest in dry years because wet years usually have higher yields than dry years fig 7c f the maximum grain of wlt is usually around 400 g m2 while lhe is almost double wlt under the same medium and high intensity irrigation or soil wet conditions except for wet years the grain of wlt is usually much smaller than that of lhe which makes the iwue of lhe higher than wlt in most cases in a wet year due to the low degree of soil water deficit in wlt grain can reach about 150 g m2 even under rain fed conditions which leads to very high iwue under low intensity irrigation fig 7f for lhe there is almost no harvest under rain fed conditions even in wet years fig 7c iwue has clear characteristics of diminishing marginal effect on irr or sm although the changing trends of lhe and wlt are different the marginal effect usually decreases when sm exceeds 0 24 0 27 m3 m3 in lhe the changing trend of iwue has been divided into two stages the ascending stage and the descending stage fig 7a b under water scarcity conditions lhe s grain is almost impossible to harvest but irrigation can effectively increase its grain therefore when crop yields substantially increase with irr iwue shows an upward trend after the iwue of lhe reaches its peak the marginal effect on iwue decreases with the increase of irr in wet normal and dry years the irr of peak iwue in wet normal and dry years is 323 mm 480 mm and 535 mm respectively and the corresponding sm is mainly concentrated at 0 24 0 27 m3 m3 with the increase of irrigation intensity the marginal effect on grain diminishes and this decrease is increasingly clear which is consistent with the diminishing marginal effect on tr under high intensity irrigation the iwue of wlt has only a clear monotonous downward trend especially in wet years fig 7d e the most significant difference between wlt and lhe is that wlt s iwue lacks a prominent rising stage for example in the sensitivity test in the previous section compared with those of lhe wlt s tr and grain are not sensitive to irrigation especially under low intensity irrigation even though the two sites used almost equal irrigation amounts crop yields in wlt are not significantly improved by irrigation like in lhe this difference may be attributed to the different biogeochemical characteristics between the two stations in their wue as mentioned compared with wlt lhe has less precipitation and drier soil meaning more radiation and sunny days these conditions are more conducive for lhe crops to efficiently use light energy to assimilate carbon dioxide and water complete biomass accumulation and release more oxygen these processes may cause the iwue of wlt to show only a single trend especially in wet years note that the initial sm when the iwue of wlt starts to decline is around 0 24 m3 m3 which is close to the sm 0 24 m3 m3 to 0 27 m3 m3 corresponding to the inflection point of iwue in lhe fig 7b 4 discussion 4 1 optimum soil moisture and irrigation amount appropriate irrigation effectively increases crop yields and saves water resources at least to a certain extent in this study we found that the crop yield of spring maize is sensitive to the deficit irrigation triggered by different cri especially under rain fed and deficit irrigation scenarios the difference in maize yield is significant however the sensitivity of maize yield to cri decreases as the cri increases fig 5f in previous studies crops usually show significant yield increases with increasing irrigation and gradually reach a peak maximum potential yield for specific growth conditions zhang et al 2021 however crop yields tend to show diminishing marginal effects as irrigation increases which may be related to yield reduction due to over irrigation and root anoxia zhang et al 2021 the difference in wue and iwue between wlt and lhe reflects crop water use efficiency and irrigation water productivity under different climatic conditions and sm under the same soil biochemical environment and similar climatic conditions there must be an optimal sm environment for a particular crop the analysis in sections 3 3 and 3 4 shows that the marginal effect on crop yield appears with an obvious inflection point with the increase of irrigation the optimal wue and the best iwue can usually be obtained at the inflection point this particular inflection point can be determined using taw and irr in this study however due to the differences in the climate and environment in the two sites taw and irr vary significantly in typical years making it challenging to guide irrigation in actual production in this study the sm at the optimal wue and iwue range from 0 24 m3 m3 to 0 27 m3 m3 applying these sm values to determine the optimal irrigation amount is controllable and maneuverable in actual deficit irrigation management although the optimized irrigation scenario cri 0 6 slightly reduces crop yield by 20 it could effectively save up to 95 of water loss to runoff compared to flood irrigation which saves about 196 248 mm the irr in lhe with the most efficient irrigation cri 0 6 is typically at 480 mm normal year 53 less than irr with flood irrigation fig 8a b in wlt the irr of the most efficient irrigation cri 0 6 is usually 394 mm normal year 63 less than irr with flood irrigation in dry years and wet years the optimal irrigation amount for lhe and wlt is 496 535 mm and 213 417 mm respectively less than flood irrigation by 51 60 and 58 80 compared with efficient irrigation flood irrigation practices use 50 more water and lose 18 25 of irrigation water to runoff similarly water percolated from the 0 3 0 m soil occupied over 35 of irrigation for maize in the hid ren et al 2016 about 58 9 and 70 2 of irrigated water for wheat and maize recharged groundwater in an arid area of northwest china li 2020 deep percolation from the 0 1 2 m soil accounted for 32 3 and 42 9 of applied water for spring wheat and spring maize and that from the 0 2 0 m soil occupied 43 0 of irrigated water for spring wheat in the same region ji et al 2007 zhou and zhao 2019 differences in meteorology irrigation strategy specific cultivar soil properties and groundwater regime might explain the differences of the above studies additionally when deficit irrigation intensity is greater than the optimal irrigation amount a slight reduction in tr may not necessarily lead to a significant decrease in crop yields du et al 2015 liang et al 2002 for example with the cri 0 8 irrigation scheme the crop yield is only reduced by less than 10 compared with flood irrigation which is reduced by 19 46 g m2 but the irr can be reduced by 36 48 and the r can be reduced by 87 92 economically the most efficient irrigation intensity lies between the most water efficient cri 0 6 and the most water consuming flood irrigation strategy that maximizes crop yields while still saving substantial irrigation water and reducing losses to runoff from the perspective of farmers benefits determining the appropriate cri value also requires economic analysis of the relationship between crop yield benefits and water consumption expenditures zhang et al 2021 in similar studies zhang et al 2017 found that the optimal irrigation amount for spring maize in arid areas of northwest china under drip irrigation is about 540 mm tang et al 2014 found that compared with furrow irrigation with an average irrigation level of 900 mm drip irrigation under plastic film mulching 600 mm irrigation can increase corn yields by 47 3 under the 300 450 mm drip irrigation level irrigation water can be saved by 50 66 7 liu et al 2017 conducted field experiments in two crop growing seasons from 2013 to 2014 and calculated the optimal deficit irrigation amount for hid maize to be about 400 mm based on actual crop evapotranspiration these studies usually obtained the best irrigation amount for maize fields in arid areas based on short term experiments but lacked irrigation schemes for reference in typical years moreover other limitations related to crop growth may prevent these field experiments from obtaining maximum crop yields in addition to the optimal water conditions these limitations affect the evaluation of the optimal wue or iwue leading to deviations in the optimal irrigation amount 4 2 effects of irrigation at stages on yield to improve crop yields and water use efficiency it is essential to allocate irrigation water reasonably according to the water needs at different crop growth stages especially during a drought maize is well known to be susceptible to drought at different production stages from sprouting to maturity aslam et al 2015 uwizeyimana et al 2018 drought stress affects cell division and proliferation in the growth stages of maize and affects tassels embryos endosperm development ears pollination and fertilization grail filling reducing crop yields aslam et al 2015 farmers irrigate fields over the long term primarily based on the amount of water currently available rather than on crops water needs during the growth stage heavy irrigation during the crop growth stage with low water requirements does not mean high yields and high water use efficiency compared with the vegetation stage mid may to mid july about 65 days full irrigation in the reproductive stage late july to early september about 45 days can obtain higher crop yields and significantly improve irrigation water use efficiency fig 9a and b show the difference in irrigation amounts between lhe and wlt at three different growth stages v r and v r there is no doubt that the v r stage has the highest irrigation amount followed by the vegetative stage and the reproductive stage there are many reasons for the large differences in irrigation amounts at different growth stages in the noah mp crop model the vegetation stage lasts about 20 days longer than the reproductive stage resulting in more irrigation events occurring under the same irrigation trigger mechanism for example with efficient irrigation irrdn of the two sites in the v and r stages are about 34 days and 16 days respectively while with flood irrigation irrigation events occur almost daily in the v and r stages in addition higher tr and sm deficits lead to more irrigation amounts in v than in r based on the deficit irrigation mechanism for crops high yields can be obtained with both efficient irrigation and flood irrigation in the v r in lhe and wlt however irrigation in the vegetative stage only whether by the most efficient or flood irrigation significantly reduces crop yields in lhe and wlt higher crop yields and water use efficiency are obtained by irrigating during the reproductive stage rather than at the vegetative stage with efficient irrigation cri 0 6 the crop yield of r is almost equal to that of v r while with flood irrigation cri 1 the crop yield of r directly exceeds that of v r the yield differences resulting from irrigation at different growth stages are mainly due to the fact that the vegetative stages of maize are the least sensitive stages to water stress while the productive stages tasseling silking and pollination are the opposite vegetative stage comes earlier than productive stage and is cooler and wetter than productive stage compared with the productive stage corn plants in the vegetable stage have smaller leaf area and root zone resulting in lower water requirements in tasseling stage the root zone and leaf area of maize have been fully developed and the water requirement for maize growth begins to increase water stress during silking can have the greatest impact on yield potential due to desiccation of the silks and pollen grains which will result in poor pollination although flood irrigation and efficient irrigation can be used for productive stage efficient irrigation will make maize face water stress which will lead to yield reduction therefore water stress should be avoided during the reproductive stage and ensure adequate water supply to the crop during the stage under flood irrigation the irrigation amount of lhe wlt at v r reaches 903 962 mm median while at r the amount is only 441 366 mm median with efficient irrigation the irrigation amount of lhe wlt in v r reaches 405 318 mm median while in r it is only 232 130 mm median 4 3 limitations of this study groundwater plays a vital role in crop growth in shallow groundwater regions du et al 2015 it has been shown that the capillary upward movement provides 41 of evapotranspiration when the groundwater depth is 1 m and when it is 2 m the influence of groundwater is only 6 gao et al 2017 from 1996 2012 the groundwater level of hid gradually decreased from 1 59 m to 1 94 m and the multi year average of groundwater depth was 2 34 m studies have shown that in hid the irrigation water required for wheat at 1 8 m underground water depth is twice that at 1 5 m gao et al 2008 like the simulated irrigation water amount lhe usually uses more irrigation water than wlt because the wlt is in a low lying area of the hid downstream of the overall irrigation drainage system and immediately adjacent to wuliangsu lake these environmental conditions result in shallow groundwater supporting the shallow sm of the wlt reducing the irrigation water demand during the crop growing season bos et al 2008 du et al 2015 for these reasons the ulat irrigation district has the least amount of water transfer from the yellow river compared with other irrigation districts in hid but it has the greatest degree of groundwater extraction significantly reducing the groundwater level in the area recent years although this study did not carefully consider the groundwater process in the model the simulation results still reflect the impact of groundwater levels at different sites the analysis in sections 3 1 and 3 2 shows that the relative sm of wlt is always higher than that of lhe especially in second and third layers of the noah mp lsm fig 3 even the sm of wlt in dry years is much greater than that of lhe in wet years fig 4c as shown in fig 9a and b the monthly irrigation amount of lhe and wlt during the crop growing season may august is negatively correlated with monthly precipitation the fitting relationships between monthly precipitation and monthly irrigation for lhe and wlt are irr 1 052pre 150 69 r 2 0 621 and irr 0 808pre 123 98 r 2 0 533 respectively it can be seen that the negative correlation between irrigation and precipitation is higher in lhe than in wlt which can be attributed to the groundwater contribution in wlt in addition to irrigation water in hid flood and basin irrigation methods are usually used for spring irrigation before planting and autumn irrigation after harvest under this condition much irrigation water is lost through deep percolation xu et al 2010 this percolation not only reduces water use efficiency but also results in a large amount of nutrition losses for example nitrogen loss at the same time the spring and autumn irrigation of hid may also change the shallow groundwater level which in turn affects the capillary rise from shallow groundwater and indirectly changes the irrigation water demand gao et al 2017 fig 10 notably this study does not accurately assess the irrigation water amount or crop yield in the hid which is challenging due to strong spatial variation and data scarcity according to the china agricultural database 2013 the average maize yield in the semi arid regions of northern and northwestern china is about 4900 7800 kg ha while the yield in lhe reaches 8000 kg ha xue and ren 2017 the n fertilizer application rates however were as high as 225 330 kg n ha 1 in farmers fields liu et al 2011 zhou et al 2012 much higher than the required range of n 97 141 kg ha 1 for maize hou et al 2012 in this study the maximum spring maize biomasses of lhe and wlt simulated by the noah mp crop model were 400 800 g m2 and the yield calculated using zhang s 2020 formula was about 3400 6800 kg ha compared with the observed yield of spring maize although the yield simulated by the noah mp crop model is small it is very close to the observation when only considering water in actual agricultural activities in arid areas although water is the main factor limiting maize yield the excellent maize varieties cultivated by genetic engineering suitable planting density and field fertilization have certain effects on yield barbieri et al 2012 li et al 2017 liu et al 2011 therefore this study explores the relationship between water use efficiency and crop yield under different irrigation scenarios and attempts to identify optimal irrigation strategies to maximize water use while not sacrificing crop yield although we acknowledge that this study only analyzed and discussed this relationship at two sites in hid the selected sites and the analyzed periods are typical and representative this study can assist local farmers and water resource agencies in striking a balance in irrigation management to enhance both agricultural production and water security this study like all research has limitations so there is potential for improvement including multiple model intercomparison studies and field scale validation once high quality data become available at the same time to further improve the availability of the noah mp model in hid a large number of parameter localization studies are needed for the parameters of the groundwater module the irrigation module and the crop module 5 conclusion as the warm dry trends in the yellow river basin increase the effective management of agricultural irrigation water in the hid will become more critical than ever this study has explored the wue in hid and provided an optimal irrigation strategy using the noah mp lsm coupled with irrigation and crop modules in the hid ten sets of sensitivity experiments for different triggering sm deficits were conducted the simulated responses of the irr tr r sm and grain were analyzed the water use efficiency of ten irrigation scenarios was evaluated for crop yield irrigation water and sm with efficient and water consuming irrigation in addition crop yields and irrigation water amounts at different crop growth stages with efficient and water consuming irrigation were analyzed the main findings of the study are as follows noah mp lsm simulation results show that the best iwue is generally obtained when sm reaches 0 24 0 27 m3 m3 cri 0 6 as irrigation intensity increases the marginal effect on crop yields diminishes significantly especially in humid areas with low soil water deficits although the optimized irrigation scenario cri 0 6 slightly reduces crop yield by 20 it could effectively save up to 95 of water loss to runoff compared to flood irrigation the most efficient irrigation water consumption in arid areas such as lhe is about 500 550 mm and it is about 200 450 mm in less arid areas represented by wlt water demand varies significantly in the different growth stages of crops with normal crop growth adequate water conditions can guarantee maize yield during the reproductive stage especially drought conditions our study demonstrates the tremendous water saving potential of efficient irrigation practices compared to the flood irrigation practices in hid it also indicates the importance to crop yields of irrigation management based on water requirements at different crop growth stages the study s findings provide scientific guidance for developing efficient water saving agricultural methods and improving irrigation water use efficiency in hid in the future regional hydrological and agricultural observations will be enhanced for better evaluation and calibration of

producing areas in china is facing the severe challenge of agricultural water shortages improving water use efficiency wue is the most appropriate way to achieve sustainable agricultural development and obtain high returns however farmers knew little about efficient irrigation strategies for flood irrigated fields in the hid in this study the noah mp land surface model lsm with dynamic crop and irrigation schemes is used to jointly simulate the maize yield and irrigation amount in the hid from 2003 to 2012 a sensitivity test for ten sets of irrigation setup with different soil moisture sm triggering thresholds cri 0 1 is conducted and the corresponding wue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue are evaluated and analyzed in addition irrigation at different crop growth stages affects total irrigation amounts and crop yield the results show that under rain fed conditions the severe sm deficit during the growing season significantly decreases the maize yield in the hid with almost no harvest in dry years with traditional flood irrigation the irrigation amount per unit area exceeds 1000 mm leading to low wue and iwue while more than 18 25 of irrigation water is wasted as runoff with the increase of irrigation intensity both wue and iwue show a significant diminishing marginal effect usually occurring when sm is greater than 0 24 0 27 m3 m3 the optimal wue is obtained near cri 0 6 while the worst wue is obtained at cri 1 in a normal year efficient irrigation amount is about 390 480 mm 53 63 less than that in flood irrigation in this scenario most irrigation water becomes sm and transpiration and less than 5 becomes runoff with effective irrigation in the reproductive stage only a small amount of irrigation is needed to promote yield formation fully considering the maize yield wue ecosystems and the available water resources in the hid the recommended irrigation amount is about 600 650 mm to achieve the optimal maize yield and wue keywords the hetao irrigation district water use efficiency irrigation water use efficiency irrigation amount crop growth stage 1 introduction water is critical for agricultural production and plays an important role in global food security according to the latest report from the world bank 2020 more than 20 of the global cultivated lands are under irrigation and contribute to 40 of the global total food production despite its arid and semi arid climate the hetao irrigation district hid is one of the important food producing areas in china thanks to irrigation liu et al 2015 the agricultural production in hid depends heavily on irrigation water use from the yellow river and is and will continue to be undoubtedly affected by global climate change and water security liu et al 2015 before 2000 the hid diverted about 5 billion m3 year of water from the yellow river every year more than 90 of this water was used for agricultural production irrigation and salt leaching ren et al 2016 long term extensive field flood irrigation and inappropriate canal drainage management tend to cause salt accumulation in the surface soil negatively affecting crop yields qadir et al 2009 zhao et al 2014 at the same time global warming is intensifying inevitably and extreme weather is occurring more frequently along with increases in industrial agricultural and residential water use as a result the yellow river basin runoff has substantially declined over the past 50 years fu et al 2004 shi et al 2017 moreover recent global and regional forecasts indicate that the warm dry trend of the upper reaches of the yellow river basin in the 21st century may continue to intensify further aggravating agricultural water shortages in the hid li et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 with changing climate and greater demand water scarcity became a global phenomenon and affecting every economic sector as the highest water consumer agricultural irrigation has a lower return per unit of water than other economic sectors according to the quota allocated by the watershed management agency the hid can divert 4 billion m3 year of water from the yellow river but the actual water diversion is always 25 higher than the allocated quota liu and zhang 2008 the water allocation for irrigation in the hid will be reduced according to a plan created by the yellow river water conservancy commission ye et al 2010 through this action the watershed management agency hopes to steer hid towards water saving agriculture improve water use efficiency for more crop per drop and curb excessive water use in irrigated areas the amount of water diverted from the yellow river to the hid in the future will be reduced by at least 20 from the previous 5 billion m3 year zhang et al 2017 when the water resources per unit of farmland decrease the water shortages may severely restrict the agricultural productivity of the hid demanding more effective water management in irrigated agriculture to sustain the food production in the region it is essential to adopt advanced water saving technologies and optimize irrigation scheduling this is more critical in semi arid and arid regions as water scarcity along with other associated problems poses the most critical abiotic constraint in food production minhas et al 2020 on the other hand the agricultural land in the hid has been divided into small farms due to the special farmland use rights i e household contract responsibility system tan et al 2006 this forms a small scale household based individual production resulting in a very complex planting structure in hid hid has mainly grown alimentary crops such as wheat and maize and economic crops such as sunflower sugar beet and tomato for a long time in the past ten years the planting area of wheat with high water consumption has decreased significantly while the sunflower with low water consumption has increased significantly among the alimentary crops wheat planted in hid has plummeted from 52 in 2000 to 9 in 2018 while maize has steadily increased from 15 in 2000 to 32 in 2018 gao et al 2021 liu et al 2017 ren et al 2016 furthermore maize is the most widely grown food crop not only globally but also in china and plays an important role in ensuring food security li et al 2017 in arid regions such as hid water is a major factor limiting crop yields therefore effective use of limited water in arid areas to increase maize yield per unit area is of great significance for alleviating food security problems traditional irrigation practices such as flood irrigation in the hid are not optimized for water usage efficiency due to the high ratio of potential evaporation to precipitation in the hid the irrigation water demand during the crop growing season is relatively high furthermore local farmers tend irrigate excessively to ensure maximum yield resulting in low wue and economic returns flood irrigation is usually carried out four to five times during the crop growing season and irrigation accounts for about two thirds of the water diversion from the yellow river after the crop harvest usually one third of the water diverted from the yellow river is also used for fall irrigation to flush the soil s accumulated salts feng et al 2005 zhang et al 2011 traditional flood irrigation usually causes copious deep leakage reducing irrigation water use efficiency and causing large nutrient losses feng et al 2005 liu et al 2017 xu et al 2010 therefore reducing water loss in irrigation and improving wue are critical to the sustainable development of hid agriculture various methods have been developed to improve crop water use efficiency and optimize irrigation in the hid water saving irrigation measures have been applied to corn planting including mulching drip irrigation and deficit irrigation in northern china drip irrigation and mulching are simultaneously used for corn and other crops saving water and increasing crop yields although efficient in water usage drip irrigation usually requires higher equipment installation and maintenance costs than do other irrigation measures zhang et al 2017 deficit irrigation is a lower cost water saving irrigation strategy for farmers allowing crops to suffer from only slight water stress which studies show can improve water use efficiency and improve specific quality indicators of crops zhang et al 2017 however water stress on crop yield varies with crop types soils and climatic conditions for example zhang et al 2017 found that tomatoes in the hid can obtain the maximum yield when deficit irrigation is performed according to 80 of crop evapotranspiration on the other hand liu et al 2017 found that water deficit irrigation of 20 30 can achieve the best wue but can also reduce the corn yield by 10 although the benefits of deficit irrigation have been verified in some crops in the hid and northwest china in general the effective management of deficit irrigation for spring maize in the hid area needs to be studied in depth although field experiments are the best way to determine optimal irrigation strategy long term field campaigns are not only costly but also highly susceptible to field conditions and climatic variation thus mathematical models can provide insight into various crop growth processes in space and time and play a key role in understanding the dynamic interactions between climate soil water and crop growth albano et al 2017 milly 2001 recent efforts have been dedicated to integrating crop growth dynamics and irrigation parameterizations into various host land surface models liu et al 2016 mcdermid et al 2017 nazemi and wheater 2015 pokhrel et al 2016 for example liu et al 2016 used noah mplsm coupled with a dynamic crop module to study corn and soybean yields in illinois and nebraska in the united states ozdogan et al 2010 used irrigated tile crop growing season and root zone sm availability sma to study the irrigation trigger mechanism the sm deficit approach is incorporated into noah mp lsm xu et al 2019 to dynamically represent the implementation of irrigation and to calculate irrigation water demand by subtracting the current root zone sm from the field capacity i e the sm deficit meanwhile the current modified version of the noah mp lsm improves surface energy balance enhances lai simulation and provides a more reasonable biomass estimate the improved and more complex dynamic irrigation scheme and crop model coupled with noah mp lsm is applied to study the localization of irrigation parameters and the long term effects on soybean and corn at both a farm scale and regional scale in the united states liu et al 2016 xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 at the same time various irrigation methods including flood irrigation drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation have been developed in lsm and coupled wrf model lawston et al 2017 valmassoi et al 2020 which can analyze the relationship between the amount of irrigation water and the crop yield under different irrigation modes due to the above advantages and the fact that it has never been used to study the effects of deficit irrigation on maize yield and wue in the hid the noah mp lsm will be applied in this study the main objectives of the study are as follows 1 to evaluate the performance of offline noah mp lsm coupled with irrigation and the crop module in the hid 2 to examine the relationship between crop yield and water use efficiency under different deficit irrigation schemes as well as the optimal irrigation amount and corresponding soil moisture of spring maize in the hid under different climatic conditions and 3 to explore the impact of different irrigation intensities at different crop growth stages on irrigation amounts and on crop yields section 2 introduces the noah mp lsm data and methodology section 3 presents model results of crop yield irrigation amounts and water use efficiency section 4 discusses the relationship among crop yield water use efficiency and soil moisture section 5 summarizes the important findings of this study the results will provide an essential scientific basis for further research on water saving irrigation in the hid 2 data model and methodology 2 1 data preparation surrounded by mountain ranges and deserts in western inner mongolia about 41 n 108e fig 1 the hid is one of the three major irrigation areas in china and featuring an arid climate and scarce precipitation fig 1 the multi year average precipitation in the hid area is about 150 mm of which about 60 are concentrated in july and august the spatial difference of precipitation in hid is large and precipitation gradually decreases from east to west the annual average temperature is about 7 and the potential evapotranspiration is about 2300 mm year wang et al 2020 the altitude of the hid is about 1000 1700 m with the terrain sloping down from the southwest to the northeast covered with mainly clay loam xue and ren 2017 spring maize is one of the main crops in the hid and from 2002 to 2012 its planting area steadily increased from 1 22 million mu 1 mu 1 15 hectare to 1 84 million mu the largest maize planting irrigation district in the central part of the hid is the yongji irrigation district accounting for about 30 of the maize planting area in the east of hid the ulat irrigation district accounts for about 12 of the total maize planting area in hid wuliangsu lake the eighth largest freshwater lake in china is also within the ulat irrigation district according to the bayan nur water resources bulletin statistics from 2002 to 2012 the hid irrigation area is about 8 47 million mu the total water diversion from the yellow river is about 4 5 billion m3 and the irrigation per unit area is about 800 mm year the hid generally performs four to five times of flood irrigations during the crop growing season additional high intensity flood irrigation is performed after the harvest in autumn commonly known as autumn irrigation accounting for about one third of the annual irrigation about 1 52 billion m3 due to the perennial water diversion from the yellow river to hid for irrigation the hid groundwater level is relatively shallow and annual variation of the groundwater level is between 1 17 and 2 3 m in this study the 10 day resolution relative sm of two agrometeorological stations in china s farmland crop growth and soil moisture dataset csmd were obtained from china s meteorological administration the csmd of spring maize is only available at agrometeorological stations in the ulat irrigation district wlt station and the yongji irrigation district lhe station from 2010 to 2012 the observed sm of wlt and lhe in csmd are used to evaluate the simulated sm of the noah mp lsm compared with lhe wlt has a more humid soil environment mainly because wlt is in a low lying area adjacent to wuliangsu lake and downstream of the hid main drainage canal resulting in shallower groundwater depth than in lhe the atmospheric forcing data are from the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 from january 2002 to december 2012 the gldas data provide rainfall snowfall wind speed temperature and humidity and radiation forcing at 0 25 grid spacing and 3 hourly intervals in this study the cn05 gao et al 2011 observation analysis data sets are used to evaluate the accuracy of precipitation and temperature from gldas the cn05 with a spatial and temporal resolution of 0 25 and with daily records is a grid dataset generated by china s meteorological administration using observation data of more than 2000 meteorological stations from 1961 to 2015 2 2 irrigation and crop model description the offline noah mp lsm under the high resolution land surface data assimilation system framework hrldas v3 9 chen et al 2007 is used for the numerical experiments in this study this section briefly introduces irrigation and crop modules in the noah mp lsm more detailed contents can be found in xu et al 2019 and zhang et al 2020 the variables needed in this study such as precipitation kg m 2 s 1 crop transpiration kg m 2 s 1 underground runoff mm surface runoff mm irrigation amount mm soil moisture m3 m 3 and mass of grain g m 2 can be obtained from noah mp lsm output as a reflection of the degree of water stress soil moisture availability sma in the root zone is the primary irrigation trigger in noah mp for irrigated farmland the root zone sma is defined as the ratio of the current available root zone sm to the non stress sm 1 sma sm sm wlt sm ref sm wlt where sm is soil moisture and sm fc and sm wp are field water capacity and wilting coefficient respectively the irrigation scheme is activated when sma is lower than the sm trigger threshold irr cri abbreviated as cri in addition the irrigation trigger in the study is limited to the crop growing season and can be adjusted according to the harvest date the noah mp crop model liu et al 2016 includes dynamic crop specific growth processes to allocate the carbohydrate product from photosynthesis into different crop parts during the growing season the dynamic crop growth model also calculates time varying leaf area index lai which directly impacts the surface radiation photosynthesis process soil moisture and surface energy fluxes to simulate the biomass of grain yield an important variable for the agricultural community noah mp crop uses carbohydrate flux instead of carbon flux in noah mp crop growth models are implemented in noah mp crop to simulate the seasonal evolution of various crop types of biomasses e g root mass leaf mass and grain mass current version of the noah mp crop model has relatively complete simulation capabilities for maize and soybean and has been extensively tested in other regions with good results liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 while other crop types such as wheat are still in the developmental testing phase the maize growth module has been established in liu et al 2016 and its parameters have been applied at a field site at bondville illinois and regionally in the u s corn belt in zhang et al 2020 the accumulated growing degree days gdd is adopted to determine crop plant growth stages pgs liu et al 2016 in the noah mp crop model in total eight pgs are defined before seeding emergence initial vegetative normal vegetative initial reproductive to maturity after maturity and after harvesting for different pgs the total carbohydrates calculated by the psn scheme are allocated to different parts of crop bodies such as leaves stems roots and grains depending on the stage function from 0 to 1 for example in the vegetable and reproductive stages the most assimilated carbon is allocated to the leaves and grains of the crop respectively in this study the crop growing season is mainly divided into two stages the vegetative stage v and the reproductive stage r this analysis reveals the irrigation impacts on different growing season periods and their corresponding crop yields 2 3 model setup and numerical experiments seventeen groups 1 17 of experiments are designed as seen in table 1 the simulation period is from 2002 to 2012 with the first year treated as spin up and the other ten years analyzed the analysis periods 2003 2012 can be separated into three groups based on their precipitation in the crop growing season according to cumulative distribution function cdf of precipitation observed at lhe and wlt during crop growing season may to september from 1961 to 2015 the years 2010 2011 and 2012 are selected as a normal year cdf 0 5 extremely dry year cdf 0 1 and extremely wet year cdf 0 9 respectively the first set of experiments listed in table 1 simulates crop yields and irrigation under rain fed conditions groups 2 11 are used to analyze the sensitivity of the irrigation amount and crop yield to root zone sma triggers the cri1 scenario is used to simulate a flood irrigation scenario the optimal irrigation is determined in the following analysis by the cri parameter to reveal the impact of irrigation at different crop growth stages six sets of experiments 12 17 are designed experiments 12 14 represent the optimal irrigation implemented only at v r and v r experiments 15 17 are similar to 12 14 but with flood irrigation spring corn in the hid is usually planted from late april to early may and harvested from mid to late september with slight variations depending on climatic and environmental conditions liu et al 2017 to facilitate data processing and modeling the planting 120 365 and harvest dates 270 365 of spring maize in the hid are uniformly set to the same value according to the csmd irrigation is only carried out during the crop growing season and ends 30 days before harvest with no autumn irrigation the dynamic crop module is enabled for all experiments listed in table 1 2 4 water use efficiency to evaluate the water use efficiency in hid agricultural crop water use efficiency wue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue are analyzed in this study wue is defined as the ratio of crop transpiration to agricultural crop available water wue can be expressed as 2 wue tr p irr sm where tr is the crop transpiration mm p is the local precipitation mm irr is irrigation depth mm sm is the soil moisture change mm p irr sm is the agricultural crop s total available water taw during the crop growing season iwue reflects the crop products that can be produced per unit of irrigation water consumption iwue is expressed as 3 iwue y irr where y is the grain yield g m 2 and irr is the corresponding irrigation depth during the crop growing season mm 3 results 3 1 forcing data and model performance high consistencies of temperature and precipitation from gldas and cn05 are shown in fig 2 suggesting that gldas can provide reliable climate forcing for this research for precipitation r2 of wlt and lhe is 0 85 and 0 92 and the resm is 7 78 mm and 7 55 mm respectively for temperature r2 of wlt and lhe is above 0 99 and resm is within 0 7 fig 2b for observation the root zone relative soil moisture rsm of wlt is higher than that of lhe especially in the surface soil rsm1 the observed three layer rsm of the wlt and lhe fluctuates between 75 and 99 during the crop growing season the sm and irrigation intensity during the crop growing season simulated in noah mp lsm are sensitive to and can be adjusted by the cri parameter under no irrigation ni red line the rsm of both wlt and lhe gradually decreases with soil depth and the average rsm of multi layered soil is usually less than 50 the rsm of wlt is higher than that of lhe especially in deep soil soil layers 2 3 in the noah mp lsm under the irrigation scenario the simulated rsm gradually approaches saturation as the cri cri 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 increases when cri 1 blue line considered as flood irrigation the simulated rsm during the crop growing season is close to the observed rsm the noah mp lsm provides reasonable estimations of irrigation amounts while huge uncertainties exist in the actual irrigation amount from official statistics according to zhou et al 2020 the irrigation amount in hid reaches 2000 mm year while according to official statistics it is about 800 mm including autumn irrigation this difference may be caused by the different statistical calibers of the two data sets in the irrigation area and the total irrigation water amount for example the official irrigation statistics consider only the water diverted from the yellow river considering the combined use of water diverted from the yellow river and groundwater the available irrigation water per unit area of the hid is 1100 1500 mm without considering water loss wang et al 2007 yang et al 2003 and in some areas it even reaches 1800 2000 mm zhang et al 2011 in the noah mp lsm simulation the irrigation amount under medium and high intensity cri 0 4 is about 400 1100 mm compared with the actual irrigation amount the simulated irrigation amount is within a reasonable range indicating that noah mp lsm can obtain simulations similar to the actual irrigation amount of hid by optimizing and adjusting the cri parameter 3 2 climate soil moisture and crop yield in simulation under different climatic conditions the difference in precipitation between wlt and lhe is significant especially in wet years but there is almost no difference in temperature wlt is slightly higher in fig 4a and b precipitation has large interannual variability and peak precipitation can occur late in the crop growing season when water demand is low e g in october in a normal year 2010 while precipitation peaks during the critical growth period from elongation to milking stages in july and august in typical years they are still too low to meet the high evapotranspiration demand only in extremely wet years can the precipitation in the crop growing season meet the needs of maize growth about 350 400 mm more than 70 of the precipitation in a typical year for lhe and wlt is concentrated within the crop growing season fig 4a in wet years the precipitation of lhe and wlt during the crop growing season is 280 mm and 404 mm respectively the peak precipitation appears in july and the corresponding peak precipitation is 116 mm and 80 mm respectively in dry years and normal years the precipitation of lhe and wlt during the crop growing season is less than 200 mm and the precipitation peak appears in august to september wlt has higher sm than lhe even when precipitation is equally scarce in dry years the sm of wlt simulated by noah mp lsm is usually between 0 1 m3 m3 and 0 2 m3 m3 while the sm of lhe is usually less than 0 1 m3 m3 fig 4c in the crop growing season the sm of a normal year dry year wet year and multi year averages in wlt are 0 16 0 133 0 189 and 0 183 m3 m3 respectively while in lhe they are 0 057 0 049 0 085 and 0 081 m3 m3 maize yields in lhe where precipitation is less and soils are drier are significantly lower than in wlt and lhe suffers almost a total loss in a dry year therefore it is difficult to obtain stable crop yields under rain fed conditions which can decimate the yields in dry years in typical years the biomass accumulation process is usually from early july to mid august compared with wlt lhe starts biomass accumulation ten days later but reaches maximum biomass ten days earlier in a dry normal and wet year maize yields in lhe are 1 6 and 64 g m2 respectively while in wlt they are 22 81 and 154 g m2 respectively fig 4d the wetter conditions of the wlt bring greater yields than those in the lhe only under rain fed conditions 3 3 impacts of irrigation on surface hydrometeorology and crop yield the differences in irrigation amount irr days of irrigation irrdn sm runoff r underground runoff plus surface runoff crop transpiration rate tr and crop yield grain are significant for irrigation under different cri triggered conditions compared to the rain fed condition fig 5 when cri 0 7 the irr and irrdn in lhe are higher than those in wlt while when cri 0 7 the irr and irrdn at both sites are almost the same fig 5a b these results may be because under low intensity irrigation compared with lhe wlt has a lower soil water deficit and more water sources such as deep soil water resulting in lower irr and irrdn however under high intensity irrigation irrigation water contribution to the available water resources of lhe and wlt increases reducing the difference between irr and irrdn at these two sites similarly with increasing intensity of deficit irrigation increasing cri the difference in sm between lhe and wlt gradually decreases fig 5c when cri exceeds a particular value r and tr and grain exhibit varying degrees of diminishing or increasing marginal effects when cri 0 7 r increases exponentially with increasing cri indicating that a large amount of irrigation is lost to runoff fig 5d irrigation can promote the tr of crops under appropriate irrigation intensity in fact when cri exceeds 0 5 0 6 all high intensity irrigation has a negative effect on tr fig 5e similarly for wlt only when the cri is less than 0 3 0 4 can irrigation promote tr fig 5e notably the tr of lhe is always greater than the tr of wlt regardless of whether the scenario is rain fed or irrigation even under suitable irrigation intensity the tr of wlt and lhe also show great differences which may be related to the slight difference in radiation and temperature between the two sites compared with wlt lhe has fewer precipitation events and drier soil likely implying more radiation and sunny days sacks et al 2009 compared with rain fed conditions irrigation greatly improves hid crop yields under rain fed conditions although the tr of lhe is much greater than that of wlt fig 5e the crop yield of lhe is much lower than that of wlt due to water scarcity during the crop growing season fig 5f after irrigation the crop yield of lhe significantly increases with the increase of irrigation intensity the difference in crop yield between wlt and lhe becomes more evident however as the cri increases especially when the cri 0 7 the diminishing marginal effects on grain in lhe is clear similarly the diminishing marginal effects on grain are found in wlt they also occur earlier and are more pronounced compared to those in lhe the diminishing marginal effects on grain are related to the inhibition of plant self regulation and control ability which can be reflected by the weakening of tr under high intensity irrigation fig 5e 3 4 impacts of irrigation on water use efficiency the wue of lhe and wlt varied considerably under different climatic conditions especially at low levels of total available water taw in dry and wet years with the increase of taw wue gradually decreases to its lowest level fig 6 the wue of lhe is always higher than that of wlt because even under the same taw the tr of lhe is always higher than that of wlt fig 6c f indicating that lhe has higher water use capacity compared with a dry year or a normal year tr is usually lower in a wet year which is evident in both lhe and wlt fig 6c f this result further demonstrates that rainy weather and moist soil may affect radiation and ground temperature which may negatively affect the wue of lhe and wlt at both lhe and wlt tr always reaches a maximum after taw and sm reach a certain level fig 6c f and then decreases with increasing taw the taws are at similar values when trs reach maxima for all years the main difference between taw for maximum tr at wlt and lhe is that the drier lhe needs higher taw to reach higher maximum tr compared to lhe when the tr reaches the maximum the sm of lhe and wlt in typical years is about 0 24 0 27 m3 m3 in addition to being affected by radiation sacks et al 2009 tr changes are also associated with waterlogging stress and hypoxia conditions steduto et al 2012 zhang et al 2021 although gldas forcing data were used in all experiments we speculate that increasing irrigation intensity may reduce net radiation thereby suppressing tr adegoke et al 2003 yang et al 2020 with increasing irrigation intensity simulated by noah mp soil temperature decreased and soil evaporation rate increased proving the influence of irrigation on surface energy flux maize may also suffer from waterlogging stress resulting in root hypoxia and weakened tr besides the above possible factors cooler air temperature and higher relative humidity due to irrigation activities may also reduce the driving force for transpiration sorooshian et al 2011 yang et al 2019 however further investigations and modeling studies are needed to confirm this finding which we will facilitate in future studies the wue vs taw plots in fig 6a and d reflect eq 2 where tr wue taw the wue of lhe and wlt changes in three main phases with the increase of taw or sm with a rapid decrease in the first phase a smooth change in the second phase and a slight decrease in the third phase fig 6 although the phase change of wue between wlt and lhe is slightly different it is evident that sm at around 0 26 m3 m3 is an inflection point of the second and third phases of wue the phase change characteristics between wue and taw can be observed but climate differences make it challenging to identify the inflection point of each phase change from the relationship between wue and taw in lhe and wlt however this point can be found in the relationship between wue and sm the first stage of wue for lhe and wlt is usually at sm 0 16 m3 m3 the second stage at 0 16 m3 m3 sm 0 26 m3 m3 and the third stage at sm 0 26 m3 m3 fig 6a b when sm gradually increases to saturated moisture the wue of lhe and wlt decrease to a minimum iwue can reflect the management level of agricultural irrigation water and the degree of water saving the level of iwue depends not only on crop yield but also on the irrigation amount under different climatic conditions humid climate conditions or soil environments generally have higher iwue fig 7a b d e the iwue of the two sites is the largest in wet years and the smallest in dry years because wet years usually have higher yields than dry years fig 7c f the maximum grain of wlt is usually around 400 g m2 while lhe is almost double wlt under the same medium and high intensity irrigation or soil wet conditions except for wet years the grain of wlt is usually much smaller than that of lhe which makes the iwue of lhe higher than wlt in most cases in a wet year due to the low degree of soil water deficit in wlt grain can reach about 150 g m2 even under rain fed conditions which leads to very high iwue under low intensity irrigation fig 7f for lhe there is almost no harvest under rain fed conditions even in wet years fig 7c iwue has clear characteristics of diminishing marginal effect on irr or sm although the changing trends of lhe and wlt are different the marginal effect usually decreases when sm exceeds 0 24 0 27 m3 m3 in lhe the changing trend of iwue has been divided into two stages the ascending stage and the descending stage fig 7a b under water scarcity conditions lhe s grain is almost impossible to harvest but irrigation can effectively increase its grain therefore when crop yields substantially increase with irr iwue shows an upward trend after the iwue of lhe reaches its peak the marginal effect on iwue decreases with the increase of irr in wet normal and dry years the irr of peak iwue in wet normal and dry years is 323 mm 480 mm and 535 mm respectively and the corresponding sm is mainly concentrated at 0 24 0 27 m3 m3 with the increase of irrigation intensity the marginal effect on grain diminishes and this decrease is increasingly clear which is consistent with the diminishing marginal effect on tr under high intensity irrigation the iwue of wlt has only a clear monotonous downward trend especially in wet years fig 7d e the most significant difference between wlt and lhe is that wlt s iwue lacks a prominent rising stage for example in the sensitivity test in the previous section compared with those of lhe wlt s tr and grain are not sensitive to irrigation especially under low intensity irrigation even though the two sites used almost equal irrigation amounts crop yields in wlt are not significantly improved by irrigation like in lhe this difference may be attributed to the different biogeochemical characteristics between the two stations in their wue as mentioned compared with wlt lhe has less precipitation and drier soil meaning more radiation and sunny days these conditions are more conducive for lhe crops to efficiently use light energy to assimilate carbon dioxide and water complete biomass accumulation and release more oxygen these processes may cause the iwue of wlt to show only a single trend especially in wet years note that the initial sm when the iwue of wlt starts to decline is around 0 24 m3 m3 which is close to the sm 0 24 m3 m3 to 0 27 m3 m3 corresponding to the inflection point of iwue in lhe fig 7b 4 discussion 4 1 optimum soil moisture and irrigation amount appropriate irrigation effectively increases crop yields and saves water resources at least to a certain extent in this study we found that the crop yield of spring maize is sensitive to the deficit irrigation triggered by different cri especially under rain fed and deficit irrigation scenarios the difference in maize yield is significant however the sensitivity of maize yield to cri decreases as the cri increases fig 5f in previous studies crops usually show significant yield increases with increasing irrigation and gradually reach a peak maximum potential yield for specific growth conditions zhang et al 2021 however crop yields tend to show diminishing marginal effects as irrigation increases which may be related to yield reduction due to over irrigation and root anoxia zhang et al 2021 the difference in wue and iwue between wlt and lhe reflects crop water use efficiency and irrigation water productivity under different climatic conditions and sm under the same soil biochemical environment and similar climatic conditions there must be an optimal sm environment for a particular crop the analysis in sections 3 3 and 3 4 shows that the marginal effect on crop yield appears with an obvious inflection point with the increase of irrigation the optimal wue and the best iwue can usually be obtained at the inflection point this particular inflection point can be determined using taw and irr in this study however due to the differences in the climate and environment in the two sites taw and irr vary significantly in typical years making it challenging to guide irrigation in actual production in this study the sm at the optimal wue and iwue range from 0 24 m3 m3 to 0 27 m3 m3 applying these sm values to determine the optimal irrigation amount is controllable and maneuverable in actual deficit irrigation management although the optimized irrigation scenario cri 0 6 slightly reduces crop yield by 20 it could effectively save up to 95 of water loss to runoff compared to flood irrigation which saves about 196 248 mm the irr in lhe with the most efficient irrigation cri 0 6 is typically at 480 mm normal year 53 less than irr with flood irrigation fig 8a b in wlt the irr of the most efficient irrigation cri 0 6 is usually 394 mm normal year 63 less than irr with flood irrigation in dry years and wet years the optimal irrigation amount for lhe and wlt is 496 535 mm and 213 417 mm respectively less than flood irrigation by 51 60 and 58 80 compared with efficient irrigation flood irrigation practices use 50 more water and lose 18 25 of irrigation water to runoff similarly water percolated from the 0 3 0 m soil occupied over 35 of irrigation for maize in the hid ren et al 2016 about 58 9 and 70 2 of irrigated water for wheat and maize recharged groundwater in an arid area of northwest china li 2020 deep percolation from the 0 1 2 m soil accounted for 32 3 and 42 9 of applied water for spring wheat and spring maize and that from the 0 2 0 m soil occupied 43 0 of irrigated water for spring wheat in the same region ji et al 2007 zhou and zhao 2019 differences in meteorology irrigation strategy specific cultivar soil properties and groundwater regime might explain the differences of the above studies additionally when deficit irrigation intensity is greater than the optimal irrigation amount a slight reduction in tr may not necessarily lead to a significant decrease in crop yields du et al 2015 liang et al 2002 for example with the cri 0 8 irrigation scheme the crop yield is only reduced by less than 10 compared with flood irrigation which is reduced by 19 46 g m2 but the irr can be reduced by 36 48 and the r can be reduced by 87 92 economically the most efficient irrigation intensity lies between the most water efficient cri 0 6 and the most water consuming flood irrigation strategy that maximizes crop yields while still saving substantial irrigation water and reducing losses to runoff from the perspective of farmers benefits determining the appropriate cri value also requires economic analysis of the relationship between crop yield benefits and water consumption expenditures zhang et al 2021 in similar studies zhang et al 2017 found that the optimal irrigation amount for spring maize in arid areas of northwest china under drip irrigation is about 540 mm tang et al 2014 found that compared with furrow irrigation with an average irrigation level of 900 mm drip irrigation under plastic film mulching 600 mm irrigation can increase corn yields by 47 3 under the 300 450 mm drip irrigation level irrigation water can be saved by 50 66 7 liu et al 2017 conducted field experiments in two crop growing seasons from 2013 to 2014 and calculated the optimal deficit irrigation amount for hid maize to be about 400 mm based on actual crop evapotranspiration these studies usually obtained the best irrigation amount for maize fields in arid areas based on short term experiments but lacked irrigation schemes for reference in typical years moreover other limitations related to crop growth may prevent these field experiments from obtaining maximum crop yields in addition to the optimal water conditions these limitations affect the evaluation of the optimal wue or iwue leading to deviations in the optimal irrigation amount 4 2 effects of irrigation at stages on yield to improve crop yields and water use efficiency it is essential to allocate irrigation water reasonably according to the water needs at different crop growth stages especially during a drought maize is well known to be susceptible to drought at different production stages from sprouting to maturity aslam et al 2015 uwizeyimana et al 2018 drought stress affects cell division and proliferation in the growth stages of maize and affects tassels embryos endosperm development ears pollination and fertilization grail filling reducing crop yields aslam et al 2015 farmers irrigate fields over the long term primarily based on the amount of water currently available rather than on crops water needs during the growth stage heavy irrigation during the crop growth stage with low water requirements does not mean high yields and high water use efficiency compared with the vegetation stage mid may to mid july about 65 days full irrigation in the reproductive stage late july to early september about 45 days can obtain higher crop yields and significantly improve irrigation water use efficiency fig 9a and b show the difference in irrigation amounts between lhe and wlt at three different growth stages v r and v r there is no doubt that the v r stage has the highest irrigation amount followed by the vegetative stage and the reproductive stage there are many reasons for the large differences in irrigation amounts at different growth stages in the noah mp crop model the vegetation stage lasts about 20 days longer than the reproductive stage resulting in more irrigation events occurring under the same irrigation trigger mechanism for example with efficient irrigation irrdn of the two sites in the v and r stages are about 34 days and 16 days respectively while with flood irrigation irrigation events occur almost daily in the v and r stages in addition higher tr and sm deficits lead to more irrigation amounts in v than in r based on the deficit irrigation mechanism for crops high yields can be obtained with both efficient irrigation and flood irrigation in the v r in lhe and wlt however irrigation in the vegetative stage only whether by the most efficient or flood irrigation significantly reduces crop yields in lhe and wlt higher crop yields and water use efficiency are obtained by irrigating during the reproductive stage rather than at the vegetative stage with efficient irrigation cri 0 6 the crop yield of r is almost equal to that of v r while with flood irrigation cri 1 the crop yield of r directly exceeds that of v r the yield differences resulting from irrigation at different growth stages are mainly due to the fact that the vegetative stages of maize are the least sensitive stages to water stress while the productive stages tasseling silking and pollination are the opposite vegetative stage comes earlier than productive stage and is cooler and wetter than productive stage compared with the productive stage corn plants in the vegetable stage have smaller leaf area and root zone resulting in lower water requirements in tasseling stage the root zone and leaf area of maize have been fully developed and the water requirement for maize growth begins to increase water stress during silking can have the greatest impact on yield potential due to desiccation of the silks and pollen grains which will result in poor pollination although flood irrigation and efficient irrigation can be used for productive stage efficient irrigation will make maize face water stress which will lead to yield reduction therefore water stress should be avoided during the reproductive stage and ensure adequate water supply to the crop during the stage under flood irrigation the irrigation amount of lhe wlt at v r reaches 903 962 mm median while at r the amount is only 441 366 mm median with efficient irrigation the irrigation amount of lhe wlt in v r reaches 405 318 mm median while in r it is only 232 130 mm median 4 3 limitations of this study groundwater plays a vital role in crop growth in shallow groundwater regions du et al 2015 it has been shown that the capillary upward movement provides 41 of evapotranspiration when the groundwater depth is 1 m and when it is 2 m the influence of groundwater is only 6 gao et al 2017 from 1996 2012 the groundwater level of hid gradually decreased from 1 59 m to 1 94 m and the multi year average of groundwater depth was 2 34 m studies have shown that in hid the irrigation water required for wheat at 1 8 m underground water depth is twice that at 1 5 m gao et al 2008 like the simulated irrigation water amount lhe usually uses more irrigation water than wlt because the wlt is in a low lying area of the hid downstream of the overall irrigation drainage system and immediately adjacent to wuliangsu lake these environmental conditions result in shallow groundwater supporting the shallow sm of the wlt reducing the irrigation water demand during the crop growing season bos et al 2008 du et al 2015 for these reasons the ulat irrigation district has the least amount of water transfer from the yellow river compared with other irrigation districts in hid but it has the greatest degree of groundwater extraction significantly reducing the groundwater level in the area recent years although this study did not carefully consider the groundwater process in the model the simulation results still reflect the impact of groundwater levels at different sites the analysis in sections 3 1 and 3 2 shows that the relative sm of wlt is always higher than that of lhe especially in second and third layers of the noah mp lsm fig 3 even the sm of wlt in dry years is much greater than that of lhe in wet years fig 4c as shown in fig 9a and b the monthly irrigation amount of lhe and wlt during the crop growing season may august is negatively correlated with monthly precipitation the fitting relationships between monthly precipitation and monthly irrigation for lhe and wlt are irr 1 052pre 150 69 r 2 0 621 and irr 0 808pre 123 98 r 2 0 533 respectively it can be seen that the negative correlation between irrigation and precipitation is higher in lhe than in wlt which can be attributed to the groundwater contribution in wlt in addition to irrigation water in hid flood and basin irrigation methods are usually used for spring irrigation before planting and autumn irrigation after harvest under this condition much irrigation water is lost through deep percolation xu et al 2010 this percolation not only reduces water use efficiency but also results in a large amount of nutrition losses for example nitrogen loss at the same time the spring and autumn irrigation of hid may also change the shallow groundwater level which in turn affects the capillary rise from shallow groundwater and indirectly changes the irrigation water demand gao et al 2017 fig 10 notably this study does not accurately assess the irrigation water amount or crop yield in the hid which is challenging due to strong spatial variation and data scarcity according to the china agricultural database 2013 the average maize yield in the semi arid regions of northern and northwestern china is about 4900 7800 kg ha while the yield in lhe reaches 8000 kg ha xue and ren 2017 the n fertilizer application rates however were as high as 225 330 kg n ha 1 in farmers fields liu et al 2011 zhou et al 2012 much higher than the required range of n 97 141 kg ha 1 for maize hou et al 2012 in this study the maximum spring maize biomasses of lhe and wlt simulated by the noah mp crop model were 400 800 g m2 and the yield calculated using zhang s 2020 formula was about 3400 6800 kg ha compared with the observed yield of spring maize although the yield simulated by the noah mp crop model is small it is very close to the observation when only considering water in actual agricultural activities in arid areas although water is the main factor limiting maize yield the excellent maize varieties cultivated by genetic engineering suitable planting density and field fertilization have certain effects on yield barbieri et al 2012 li et al 2017 liu et al 2011 therefore this study explores the relationship between water use efficiency and crop yield under different irrigation scenarios and attempts to identify optimal irrigation strategies to maximize water use while not sacrificing crop yield although we acknowledge that this study only analyzed and discussed this relationship at two sites in hid the selected sites and the analyzed periods are typical and representative this study can assist local farmers and water resource agencies in striking a balance in irrigation management to enhance both agricultural production and water security this study like all research has limitations so there is potential for improvement including multiple model intercomparison studies and field scale validation once high quality data become available at the same time to further improve the availability of the noah mp model in hid a large number of parameter localization studies are needed for the parameters of the groundwater module the irrigation module and the crop module 5 conclusion as the warm dry trends in the yellow river basin increase the effective management of agricultural irrigation water in the hid will become more critical than ever this study has explored the wue in hid and provided an optimal irrigation strategy using the noah mp lsm coupled with irrigation and crop modules in the hid ten sets of sensitivity experiments for different triggering sm deficits were conducted the simulated responses of the irr tr r sm and grain were analyzed the water use efficiency of ten irrigation scenarios was evaluated for crop yield irrigation water and sm with efficient and water consuming irrigation in addition crop yields and irrigation water amounts at different crop growth stages with efficient and water consuming irrigation were analyzed the main findings of the study are as follows noah mp lsm simulation results show that the best iwue is generally obtained when sm reaches 0 24 0 27 m3 m3 cri 0 6 as irrigation intensity increases the marginal effect on crop yields diminishes significantly especially in humid areas with low soil water deficits although the optimized irrigation scenario cri 0 6 slightly reduces crop yield by 20 it could effectively save up to 95 of water loss to runoff compared to flood irrigation the most efficient irrigation water consumption in arid areas such as lhe is about 500 550 mm and it is about 200 450 mm in less arid areas represented by wlt water demand varies significantly in the different growth stages of crops with normal crop growth adequate water conditions can guarantee maize yield during the reproductive stage especially drought conditions our study demonstrates the tremendous water saving potential of efficient irrigation practices compared to the flood irrigation practices in hid it also indicates the importance to crop yields of irrigation management based on water requirements at different crop growth stages the study s findings provide scientific guidance for developing efficient water saving agricultural methods and improving irrigation water use efficiency in hid in the future regional hydrological and agricultural observations will be enhanced for better evaluation and calibration of

positive correlation with the amount of photosynthetic n pn at anthesis with an increase in the n accumulation in shoots at anthesis naa the amount of pn increased first and then remained stable

supplemental irrigation at jointing stage significantly increased the amount of naa and pre anthesis n redistributed to grains and its contribution to grains while the highest grain yield nute and

help ensure national food security cao et al 2018 the north china plain is the main wheat producing area in china contributing approximately 70 to winter wheat production hu et al 2010 however precipitation during the winter wheat growing season can only meet 25 40 of the crop water demand because of insufficient amounts and uneven seasonal distribution xiao et al 2020 irrigation is an effective agricultural management measure to ensure the stable production of winter wheat groundwater is the main source of irrigation in this region but traditional irrigation practices caused overdraft and a serious drop in groundwater level in recent decades chen et al 2019 qiu et al 2018 to solve the contradiction we have developed a method to determine the amount of supplemental irrigation si that is required for wheat to achieve high grain yield and crop water productivity wp wang et al 2013 the amount of required si is based on the soil water content before irrigation which reflects both precipitation and the water consumed by wheat moderate si can reduce actual crop evapotranspiration etc act by more than 30 increase wp by 19 7 and achieve a high nitrogen utilization efficiency nute from 38 5 to 39 3 kg kg 1 feng et al 2017 li et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 however the mechanism to explain this response needs to be explored balancing crop nitrogen n accumulation and assimilation in biomass is beneficial to increase grain yield and nute raun and johnson 1999 canopy photosynthetic capacity is significantly affected by the n nutrition status of the winter wheat which is directly related to grain yield bertheloot et al 2008 li et al 2008 the n nutrition index nni is determined by the actual n percentage of the aboveground crop and the critical n concentration and can be used to quantify the n nutrition status of crop wang et al 2019 yin et al 2018 the nni at anthesis is positively correlated to the chlorophyll content and photosynthesis rate when n was a limiting factor and is a suitable predictor of grain yield and protein content ata ul karim et al 2014 debaeke et al 2006 the distribution of n also greatly influences the nute of crops fitzgerald et al 2010 as n accumulation in upper leaves and reproductive organs nears saturation the n distributed in lower leaves and stems begins to increase barraclough et al 2014 duan et al 2019 the n accumulation in the lower leaves and stems contributes little to crop photosynthetic production but it can be transferred to grain to meet the n required for the synthesis of grain protein during the grain filling stage dreccer et al 2000 lemaire and gastal 1997 partitioned the n accumulated in shoots into three pools photosynthetic n pn structural n sn and reserve n rn assimilated n used to build the photosynthetic tissues containing large quantities of photosynthetic proteins are considered as pn those n used to build the structural proteins in supporting tissues and vascular connections of the shoot system are considered as sn any n not allocated to pn or sn are considered in the pool of rn the pn contributes greatly to photosynthetic production and grain yield and is redistributed to grain in the post anthesis period whilst the sn remains in the straw components at harvest pons and percy 1994 excess n is stored as rn primarily in the stem at anthesis and although it has no direct effect on photosynthetic production it has a functional role via maintaining canopy function and delaying the transport of pn after anthesis which may increase grain yield dier et al 2019 n fertilizer is the most direct way to improve the n nutrition status of crops karam et al 2009 sun et al 2020 although the relation between nni and n application rates varies with cultivars and years the nni typically increases with increasing n application rates guo et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 therefore the nni can provide guidance to optimize the timing and rates of n application guo et al 2019 lemaire et al 2008 the amounts of storage rn and accumulation rn in crop increase with increasing n application rates pask et al 2012 under a high fertilizer rate much of the accumulation rn remains in the stem at harvest indicating excessive n absorption by wheat yin et al 2018 appropriate water supply generally can increase grain yield and nute in winter wheat by improving wheat n assimilation and distribution wang et al 2015 although many studies have explored the effect of n application rate on n nutrition status of cereal crops information about how irrigation increases grain yield and nute by improving the n status of wheat plants is limited based on this this study investigated the regulation effect of si on the n nutrition status and n allocation in different functional pools at anthesis in winter wheat we hypothesized that i si could improve grain yield wp and nute by improving the n nutrition status in winter wheat ii the n nutrition index could be optimized under si treatment by regulating wheat n assimilation and n allocation in different functional pools at anthesis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were conducted during the 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 winter wheat growing seasons in xuanzhuang village 36 12 n 116 54 e taian shandong province china at the experimental site the average annual temperature is 13 0 13 6 c the average annual precipitation is 621 688 mm the depth of groundwater table is 15 25 m the soil is classified as loam the previous crop was maize the detailed soil chemical properties in the topsoil before sowing are shown in table 1 the soil bulk density field capability and volumetric soil water content in the 0 200 cm soil layers at sowing are shown in table 2 fig 1 shows the monthly precipitation and mean temperature during the two growing seasons 2 2 experimental design two commercial winter wheat cultivars widely grown on the north china plain were used in the study the large spike type cultivar shannong23 sn23 and the multispike type cultivar shannong29 sn29 the experimental design used a randomized block design with three replications with an area of 46 m2 length 23 m width 2 m for each plot three si treatments were applied at jointing j0 no si j20 bring volumetric soil water content in the 0 20 cm profile to 100 field capacity and j40 bring volumetric soil water content in the 0 40 cm profile to 100 field capacity irrigation was based on the growth stage of winter wheat and was carried out when the young spike differentiates into the pharmacophore formation stage the amount of irrigation in the j20 and j40 treatments was calculated using the following equation wang et al 2013 i 10 h fc bd vswc where i mm is the amount of irrigation bd g cm 3 is the soil bulk density h cm is the depth of the soil layer to be wetted fc is the field capacity and vswc cm3 cm 3 is the volumetric soil water content before irrigation to ensure the same crop growth conditions except the treatment period the water management at sowing pre winter and anthesis was consistent in all si treatments the irrigation amounts at the sowing and pre winter stages were determined by the on demand irrigation method which was based on the mathematical model that calculates the difference between water requirement of winter wheat for high grain yield and high wp and nature water supply including soil water storage and precipitation wang 2017 when winter wheat reached the specific standard for a predetermined growth stage the model calculation would be used to determine whether si is required at this growth stage if si was needed irrigation would be implemented immediately based on the results calculated by the model in 2017 2018 there was no irrigation at sowing because volumetric soil water content in the 0 20 cm soil layer exceeded 70 field capacity at pre winter when the average temperature was below 3 c for three consecutive days 35 6 mm was added in irrigation because the water supply from sowing to pre winter was below 326 8 mm in 2018 2019 the irrigation was 39 6 mm at sowing because volumetric soil water content in the 0 20 cm soil layer was below 70 field capacity at pre winter there was no irrigation because the water supply from sowing to pre winter exceeded 326 8 mm irrigation at the anthesis stage was carried out when 100 of the ears of wheat flowering to bring volumetric soil water content in the 0 20 cm profile to 100 field capacity the irrigation amounts in all si treatments during the two growing seasons are shown in table 3 irrigation water was sprayed uniformly on each plot using micro sprinkling hoses man et al 2017 valves fitted on the hoses controlled the release of water and the amount of irrigation in each plot was measured using water meters installed on the hoses there was a 2 m gap between each plot to prevent lateral water movement 2 3 crop management the tillering ability of multi spike cultivars is better than that of large spike cultivars xu et al 2017 in order to coordinate the yield components of the two types of wheat and achieve high grain yield the planting densities of sn23 and sn29 were 3 106 plants ha 1 and 1 8 106 plants ha 1 respectively compound fertilizers 15 0 n 6 6 p 12 5 k were used as base fertilizer at sowing and the application rates of n p and k were 135 kg ha 1 59 kg ha 1 and 113 kg ha 1 respectively granular urea 46 n was applied as top dressing at the jointing stage and the application rate of n was 75 kg ha 1 winter wheat was sown on 8 october 2017 and 18 october 2018 and harvested on 7 june 2018 and 12 june 2019 respectively 2 4 measurements 2 4 1 sampling and measurement at jointing anthesis grain filling and maturity stages 30 plants from each plot were collected to determine aboveground dry matter and n content the enzymes in wheat plants were deactivated at 105 and then the plants were dried at 70 c dried samples were ground in a sample grinder and passed through a 1 mm

oven dried undisturbed cores as the mass per volume of oven dried soil osunbitan et al 2005 volumetric soil water content was measured using the oven drying method yang et al 2021 at the sowing on the

cultivars at anthesis fig 2 averaging across the two years the nni at anthesis was 1 04 for sn23 and 1 03 for sn29 as the irrigation amount at jointing increased the nni of sn23 at anthesis increased from 0 90 j0 to 1 02 in j20 and to 1 10 in j40 the change of sn29 s nni was similar increasing from 0 91 in j0 to 1 00 in j20 and to 1 07 in j40 overall the nni in j0 was less than 1 at anthesis whereas in j40 it was greater than 1 the nni in j20 was close to 1 those results indicated moderate si achieved the optimal n nutrition condition at anthesis for both the large spike type sn23 and the multispike type sn29 cultivars 3 2 nitrogen allocation the different si treatments at jointing significantly affected p 0 01 the amounts of pn sn and rn at anthesis table 4 averaging across the two

significantly higher p 0 05 in sn29 than that in sn23 under the same si treatment in the two growing seasons table 5 the contribution of pre anthesis n remobilization to grain was lower in sn29 than that in sn23 in j20 and j40 in both years 3 4 grain yield nitrogen uptake efficiency nitrogen utilization efficiency and water productivity in 2017 2018 the n accumulation in shoots at maturity nam was significantly higher p 0 01 in sn29 than that in sn23 in all treatments but grain yield was not significantly different p 0 05 between si treatments for either cultivar table 6 however in 2018 2019 the grain yield and nam were both lower in sn29 than those in sn23 the nute of sn29 was lower than that of sn23 in all treatments in the two growing seasons in the two growing seasons the grain yields of both sn23 and sn29 in j20 and j40 increased significantly p 0 05 compared with those in j0 but there was no significant difference p 0 05 between yields in j20 and j40 table 6 the nupe of

cultivars the nute was significantly p 0 05 lower in j40 than that in j20 the wp of both sn23 and sn29 increased first and then decreased with the increase in irrigation amount at the jointing stage with the highest value in j20 3 5 regression analysis regression analysis showed a significant positive correlation between the amount of naa and the amount of rn at anthesis p 0 01 fig 3a there was a significant negative relation between the amount of rn and the amount of n assimilation after anthesis p 0 01 fig 3b the grain yield was significantly positively related to the amount of pn at anthesis p 0 01 fig 3c and the wp was significantly positively related to the amount of naa at anthesis p 0 01 fig 3d 4 discussion the n nutrition status of winter wheat at anthesis is important for photosynthetic production and yield formation and the nni is a widely used tool to diagnose crop n nutrition status in the vegetative growth stage fabbri et al 2020 hoogmoed et al 2018 the n fertilizer is the most effective way to improve the nni of crop the nni on each growth stage has a positively correlation with n rate ata ul karim et al 2014 debaeke et al 2006 zhao et al 2016 in our study as the irrigation amount at jointing increased the value of nni at anthesis increased from 0 86 to 1 11 fig 2 si at jointing improved the crop n nutrition status at anthesis and high si resulted in luxury consumption of n nutrition like excessive n application previous studies had confirmed that n nutrient status has a linear plateau relation with grain yield lemaire et al 2008 ziadi et al 2008 when the value of nni is in the range of 0 4 1 0 the grain yield increases with the increase of nni but when nni 1 0 grain yield is not affected ziadi et al 2010 based on this relationship between nni and grain yield the nni is used to determining the effectiveness of n application on grain yield guo et al 2019 the results of this study are consistent with those of previous studies ziadi et al 2010 compared with no si j0 at jointing moderate si j20 at jointing significantly increased the nni at anthesis fig 2 and the grain yield table 6 however with high si j40 at jointing although the nni at anthesis increased further the grain yield was not significantly affected these results indicated that the nni at anthesis could be an important indicator in determining the effectiveness of irrigation regulation on grain yield the increase of nupe usually has a positive effect on biomass and grain yield but the highest grain yield does not always appear with the highest nitrogen uptake li et al 2021 qi et al 2020 in most previous experiments high n uptake usually resulted in declines in crop nute and n harvest index cousins et al 2020 compared with no si the moderate si significantly increased the nupe nute and grain yield table 6 high si further increased the nupe of winter wheat but had no benefit on grain yield which resulted in a significant decrease in nute such conclusions are confirmed in studies about wp the etc act of winter wheat increases with an increase in the water supply but the wp increases with etc act to a certain level and then declines wang 2017 wang et al 2018 an irrigation amount between 144 and 186 mm maintains grain yield and wp at relatively high levels and further increasing the amount has no benefit to increasing grain yields abdelkhalek et al 2015 kumar jha et al 2019 yu et al 2020 moderate si significantly increased the etc act wp and grain yield compared with no si table 6 however with high si to wet the deeper layer etc act of winter wheat increased significantly but grain yield did not increase which resulted in a significant decrease in wp table 6 the changes of wp and nupe were related to the n nutrition status at anthesis when the nni at anthesis was less than 1 the increase in nupe and etc act significantly increased the nute and wp but when the nni at anthesis was greater than 1 the increase in nute and etc act significantly decreased the nute and wp fig 2 table 6 in order to explain the regulation mechanism of nni on nute and wp we referred the research of pask et al 2012 and partitioned the naa into three pools sn pn and rn pask et al 2012 plants need to allocate more n to photosynthetic nitrogenous compounds to maximize the productivity of per unit n absorbed duan et al 2018 hikosaka 2004 in this study the grain yield was significantly positively related to the amount of pn at anthesis fig 3c the amount of pn at anthesis increased with the increase of nni and reached to peaks when the value of nni was close to 1 under moderate si table 4 as the n content exceeds the n requirement in canopy scales the excess n is stored in vegetative organs as rn which is transported after anthesis to meet the needs of grain filling arduini et al 2006 cruz aguado et al 2000 the rn at anthesis has no direct effect on photosynthetic production but inadequate rn at anthesis accelerates pn decomposition resulting in a significant decrease in grain yield tahir and nakata 2005 in this study the amount of rn was positively related to the amount of naa at anthesis fig 3a compared with no si moderate si increased the naa and obtained moderate rn and pn simultaneously table 6 high si further increased the naa but most of those increased n absorption was allocated to the storage rn and accumulated rn pools instead of the pn pool table 4 which explained the decrease in nute and wp when nni is higher than 1 compared with the multispike type cultivar sn29 the large spike type cultivar sn23 had significantly higher pre anthesis n remobilization to grain and its contribution rate to grain and the amount of naa or nam only in 2018 2019 growing season but sn23 obtained higher nute in both years tables 5 and 6 genotypes with high nute generally have higher photosynthetic rates and longer duration of photosynthetic function distelfeld et al 2014 which are primarily associated with pre anthesis n accumulation and n translocation after anthesis liu et al 2020 tian et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 in this experiment the large spike type cultivar sn23 tended to allocate more n to pn and storage rn and less to sn and accumulation rn compared with the multispike type cultivar sn29 table 4 which explained why sn23 had higher nute than sn29 excessive levels of nni and rn at anthesis indicated excessive n nutrition in shoots and post anthesis n assimilation was found to be negatively related to the amount of rn fig 3b however we noticed that treatments with no si and moderate si had a high n assimilation under moderate water supply after anthesis table 5 which indicated that n uptake was also required after anthesis for these reasons the function and distribution of n assimilation after anthesis need further study in addition low soil moisture conditions after anthesis were not considered in this work and whether rn storage helps winter wheat to resist the water stress after anthesis will be studied in further research 5 conclusions in the present experiments the si largely improved the n nutrition status of winter wheat at anthesis grain yield and the amount of pn at anthesis were significantly positively correlated with moderate si at the jointing stage the nni of winter wheat was close to 1 the pn at anthesis increased to peaks and the highest grain yield nute and wp were obtained with high si the nni at anthesis increased higher than 1 the naa and rn at anthesis increased further but the amounts of pn and grain yield were not affected which explained the reduction in nute and wp besides the large spike type cultivar sn23 tended to allocate more n to pn and storage rn and less to sn and accumulation rn at anthesis and had higher nute than the multispike type cultivar sn29 these cultivar novel results of this study suggested that the nni at anthesis can be an important indicator in determining the effectiveness of irrigation

positive correlation with the amount of photosynthetic n pn at anthesis with an increase in the n accumulation in shoots at anthesis naa the amount of pn increased first and then remained stable whereas the amount of reserve n rn increased continuously compared with sn29 sn23 allocated more n to pn and storage rn and less to structural n sn and accumulation rn at anthesis and had higher nute supplemental irrigation at jointing stage significantly increased the amount of naa and pre anthesis n redistributed to grains and its contribution to grains while the highest grain yield nute and water productivity wp were reached in j20 and not j40 wp was positively related to the amount of naa and was also affected by the n nutrition index nni at anthesis the nni of winter wheat under j20

help ensure national food security cao et al 2018 the north china plain is the main wheat producing area in china contributing approximately 70 to winter wheat production hu et al 2010 however precipitation during the winter wheat growing season can only meet 25 40 of the crop water demand because of insufficient amounts and uneven seasonal distribution xiao et al 2020 irrigation is an effective agricultural management measure to ensure the stable production of winter wheat groundwater is the main source of irrigation in this region but traditional irrigation practices caused overdraft and a serious drop in groundwater level in recent decades chen et al 2019 qiu et al 2018 to solve the contradiction we have developed a method to determine the amount of supplemental irrigation si that is required for wheat to achieve high grain yield and crop water productivity wp wang et al 2013 the amount of required si is based on the soil water content before irrigation which reflects both precipitation and the water consumed by wheat moderate si can reduce actual crop evapotranspiration etc act by more than 30 increase wp by 19 7 and achieve a high nitrogen utilization efficiency nute from 38 5 to 39 3 kg kg 1 feng et al 2017 li et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 however the mechanism to explain this response needs to be explored balancing crop nitrogen n accumulation and assimilation in biomass is beneficial to increase grain yield and nute raun and johnson 1999 canopy photosynthetic capacity is significantly affected by the n nutrition status of the winter wheat which is directly related to grain yield bertheloot et al 2008 li et al 2008 the n nutrition index nni is determined by the actual n percentage of the aboveground crop and the critical n concentration and can be used to quantify the n nutrition status of crop wang et al 2019 yin et al 2018 the nni at anthesis is positively correlated to the chlorophyll content and photosynthesis rate when n was a limiting factor and is a suitable predictor of grain yield and protein content ata ul karim et al 2014 debaeke et al 2006 the distribution of n also greatly influences the nute of crops fitzgerald et al 2010 as n accumulation in upper leaves and reproductive organs nears saturation the n distributed in lower leaves and stems begins to increase barraclough et al 2014 duan et al 2019 the n accumulation in the lower leaves and stems contributes little to crop photosynthetic production but it can be transferred to grain to meet the n required for the synthesis of grain protein during the grain filling stage dreccer et al 2000 lemaire and gastal 1997 partitioned the n accumulated in shoots into three pools photosynthetic n pn structural n sn and reserve n rn assimilated n used to build the photosynthetic tissues containing large quantities of photosynthetic proteins are considered as pn those n used to build the structural proteins in supporting tissues and vascular connections of the shoot system are considered as sn any n not allocated to pn or sn are considered in the pool of rn the pn contributes greatly to photosynthetic production and grain yield and is redistributed to grain in the post anthesis period whilst the sn remains in the straw components at harvest pons and percy 1994 excess n is stored as rn primarily in the stem at anthesis and although it has no direct effect on photosynthetic production it has a functional role via maintaining canopy function and delaying the transport of pn after anthesis which may increase grain yield dier et al 2019 n fertilizer is the most direct way to improve the n nutrition status of crops karam et al 2009 sun et al 2020 although the relation between nni and n application rates varies with cultivars and years the nni typically increases with increasing n application rates guo et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 therefore the nni can provide guidance to optimize the timing and rates of n application guo et al 2019 lemaire et al 2008 the amounts of storage rn and accumulation rn in crop increase with increasing n application rates pask et al 2012 under a high fertilizer rate much of the accumulation rn remains in the stem at harvest indicating excessive n absorption by wheat yin et al 2018 appropriate water supply generally can increase grain yield and nute in winter wheat by improving wheat n assimilation and distribution wang et al 2015 although many studies have explored the effect of n application rate on n nutrition status of cereal crops information about how irrigation increases grain yield and nute by improving the n status of wheat plants is limited based on this this study investigated the regulation effect of si on the n nutrition status and n allocation in different functional pools at anthesis in winter wheat we hypothesized that i si could improve grain yield wp and nute by improving the n nutrition status in winter wheat ii the n nutrition index could be optimized under si treatment by regulating wheat n assimilation and n allocation in different functional pools at anthesis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were conducted during the 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 winter wheat growing seasons in xuanzhuang village 36 12 n 116 54 e taian shandong province china at the experimental site the average annual temperature is 13 0 13 6 c the average annual precipitation is 621 688 mm the depth of groundwater table is 15 25 m the soil is classified as loam the previous crop was maize the detailed soil chemical properties in the topsoil before sowing are shown in table 1 the soil bulk density field capability and volumetric soil water content in the 0 200 cm soil layers at sowing are shown in table 2 fig 1 shows the monthly precipitation and mean temperature during the two growing seasons 2 2 experimental design two commercial winter wheat cultivars widely grown on the north china plain were used in the study the large spike type cultivar shannong23 sn23 and the multispike type cultivar shannong29 sn29 the experimental design used a randomized block design with three replications with an area of 46 m2 length 23 m width 2 m for each plot three si treatments were applied at jointing j0 no si j20 bring volumetric soil water content in the 0 20 cm profile to 100 field capacity and j40 bring volumetric soil water content in the 0 40 cm profile to 100 field capacity irrigation was based on the growth stage of winter wheat and was carried out when the young spike differentiates into the pharmacophore formation stage the amount of irrigation in the j20 and j40 treatments was calculated using the following equation wang et al 2013 i 10 h fc bd vswc where i mm is the amount of irrigation bd g cm 3 is the soil bulk density h cm is the depth of the soil layer to be wetted fc is the field capacity and vswc cm3 cm 3 is the volumetric soil water content before irrigation to ensure the same crop growth conditions except the treatment period the water management at sowing pre winter and anthesis was consistent in all si treatments the irrigation amounts at the sowing and pre winter stages were determined by the on demand irrigation method which was based on the mathematical model that calculates the difference between water requirement of winter wheat for high grain yield and high wp and nature water supply including soil water storage and precipitation wang 2017 when winter wheat reached the specific standard for a predetermined growth stage the model calculation would be used to determine whether si is required at this growth stage if si was needed irrigation would be implemented immediately based on the results calculated by the model in 2017 2018 there was no irrigation at sowing because volumetric soil water content in the 0 20 cm soil layer exceeded 70 field capacity at pre winter when the average temperature was below 3 c for three consecutive days 35 6 mm was added in irrigation because the water supply from sowing to pre winter was below 326 8 mm in 2018 2019 the irrigation was 39 6 mm at sowing because volumetric soil water content in the 0 20 cm soil layer was below 70 field capacity at pre winter there was no irrigation because the water supply from sowing to pre winter exceeded 326 8 mm irrigation at the anthesis stage was carried out when 100 of the ears of wheat flowering to bring volumetric soil water content in the 0 20 cm profile to 100 field capacity the irrigation amounts in all si treatments during the two growing seasons are shown in table 3 irrigation water was sprayed uniformly on each plot using micro sprinkling hoses man et al 2017 valves fitted on the hoses controlled the release of water and the amount of irrigation in each plot was measured using water meters installed on the hoses there was a 2 m gap between each plot to prevent lateral water movement 2 3 crop management the tillering ability of multi spike cultivars is better than that of large spike cultivars xu et al 2017 in order to coordinate the yield components of the two types of wheat and achieve high grain yield the planting densities of sn23 and sn29 were 3 106 plants ha 1 and 1 8 106 plants ha 1 respectively compound fertilizers 15 0 n 6 6 p 12 5 k were used as base fertilizer at sowing and the application rates of n p and k were 135 kg ha 1 59 kg ha 1 and 113 kg ha 1 respectively granular urea 46 n was applied as top dressing at the jointing stage and the application rate of n was 75 kg ha 1 winter wheat was sown on 8 october 2017 and 18 october 2018 and harvested on 7 june 2018 and 12 june 2019 respectively 2 4 measurements 2 4 1 sampling and measurement at jointing anthesis grain filling and maturity stages 30 plants from each plot were collected to determine aboveground dry matter and n content the enzymes in wheat plants were deactivated at 105 and then the plants were dried at 70 c dried samples were ground in a sample grinder and passed through a 1 mm sieve the n content was determined using the dumas combustion method with a rapid n exceed 24 7 analysis elementar langenselbold germany beljkaš et al 2010 2 4 2 nitrogen nutrition index the nni was determined by the ratio of the actual n concentration na to the critical n concentration nc justes et al 1994 the na was calculated using the following equation na na 10dm where na kg n ha 1 is the n accumulation in shoot dm is the shoot dry matter t ha 1 the nc was calculated using the following equation yin et al 2018 nc ac dm b where dm is the shoot dry matter t ha 1 and ac and b are 5 35 and 0 442 respectively the nni was then calculated as follows justes et al 1994 nni na nc if nni 1 the n nutrition status is considered optimal if nni 1 the n nutrition status is considered excessive and if nni 1 the n nutrition status is considered insufficient zhao et al 2016 2 4 3 nitrogen allocation the n accumulation in shoots at anthesis naa was partitioned into three pools structural n sn photosynthetic n pn and reserve n rn lemaire and gastal 1997 the sum of sn and pn is termed functional n fn the amount of n in each pool was calculated according to pask et al 2012 the amount of fn kg n ha 1 was determined by assuming it was the breakpoint in the bi linear relation between the naa kg n ha 1 at anthesis and the radiation use efficiency kg mj 1 the radiation use efficiency was calculated over the period from jointing to anthesis as the ratio of the aboveground dry matter increment kg m 2 between samplings to the photosynthetically active radiation interception mj m 2 according to pradhan et al 2018 photosynthetically active radiation interception was measured at the jointing and anthesis using a sunfleck ceptometer delta t devices cambridge uk sn was assumed to remain constant from anthesis to harvest the amount of sn kg n ha 1 was the sum of the amount of sn in respective crop components which calculated as follows snc dm nc min where snc kg n ha 1 was the amount of sn in each crop components dm kg ha 1 was the dry matter in relevant crop components at maturity and the nc min was the minimum n content of relevant crop component observed in any plot of each cultivar at maturity for sn23 the nc min of the leaf blade stem and leaf sheath and spike axis and glume at maturity were 0 52 0 25 and 0 36 respectively for sn29 the nc min of the leaf blade stem and leaf sheath and spike axis and glume at maturity were 0 50 0 27 and 0 38 respectively the amount of pn kg n ha 1 was determined as the difference between fn and sn naa not allocated to fn pool was considered to be in the rn pool the amount of rn kg n ha 1 was determined as the difference between naa and fn the rn is the combination of accumulation rn and storage rn pask et al 2012 the storage rn is those rn remobilized between anthesis and harvest and the accumulation rn is those rn not remobilized between anthesis and harvest it is assumed that the rn was remobilized first in preference to pn the amount of storage rn kg n ha 1 was calculated as the difference between naa and the n accumulation in the vegetative organs kg n ha 1 at the mid grain filling stage yin et al 2018 the amount of accumulation rn kg n ha 1 was determined as the difference between rn and storage rn 2 4 4 determination of nitrogen uptake efficiency and nitrogen utilization efficiency nitrogen uptake efficiency nupe and nute kg kg 1 were calculated according to moll et al 1982 nupe nam ns nute gy nam where nam kg n ha 1 was the n accumulation in shoots at maturity the ns kg n ha 1 is the total n available in soil the gy kg ha 1 is the grain yield 2 4 5 field capacity volumetric soil water content and actual crop evapotranspiration the undisturbed soil samples were collected with cutting ring at 20 cm intervals to a depth of 200 cm before sowing the field capacity was measured using the wilcox method wang et al 2017 a laboratory measurement method with undisturbed and saturated soil samples placed on air dried and sieved soil samples after reaching equilibrium the water content of the undisturbed soil was considered the field capacity the soil bulk density was determined from oven dried undisturbed cores as the mass per volume of oven dried soil osunbitan et al 2005 volumetric soil water content was measured using the oven drying method yang et al 2021 at the sowing on the day the winter wheat was sowed pre winter when the average temperature was below 3 c for three consecutive days jointing when the young spike differentiates into the pharmacophore formation stage anthesis when 100 of the ears of wheat flowering and maturity stage soil samples were collected every 10 cm from 0 to 200 cm volumetric soil water content was calculated by the following equation vswc ms ds ds bd where vswc cm3 cm 3 is the volumetric soil water content ms g is the mass of moist soil ds g is the mass of oven dried soil bd g cm 3 is the soil bulk density actual crop evapotranspiration etc act mm was calculated by the following equation chattaraj et al 2013 etc act i p δw k r d where i mm is the irrigation amount p mm is the precipitation amount δw mm is the soil water storage changes in the 0 200 cm soil profile from sowing to maturity k is the increment of groundwater r is the surface runoff and d is the drainage beneath root zone groundwater depth at the

grain yield and crop water productivity at the maturity stage 2 m2 quadrat wheat plants at the center of each plot were harvested randomly by hand to measure grain yield n 3 per treatment and then reported on a 12 5 wet basis the wp of winter wheat was calculated according to sun et al 2017 wp gy 10etc act where wp kg m 3 is the crop water productivity gy kg ha 1 is the grain yield and etc act mm is the seasonal actual crop evapotranspiration the factor 10 is meant to convert etc act in mm into water volumes per land surface in m3 ha 1 2 5 statistical analyses the spss v21 ibm inc chicago il usa was used to perform anova and regression analysis anova was used to identify significant differences between treatments at p 0 05 the significant differences between treatment means were determined using the least significant difference lsd method at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 nitrogen nutrition index the si at jointing significantly increased p 0 05 the nni of the two winter wheat cultivars at anthesis fig 2 averaging across the two years the nni at anthesis was 1 04 for sn23 and 1 03 for sn29 as the irrigation amount at jointing increased the nni of sn23 at anthesis increased from 0 90 j0 to 1 02 in j20 and to 1 10 in j40 the change of sn29 s nni was similar increasing from 0 91 in j0 to 1 00 in j20 and to 1 07 in j40 overall the nni in j0 was less than 1 at anthesis whereas in j40 it was greater than 1 the nni in j20 was close to 1 those results indicated moderate si achieved the optimal n nutrition condition at anthesis for both the large spike type sn23 and the multispike type sn29 cultivars 3 2 nitrogen allocation the different si treatments at jointing significantly affected p 0 01 the amounts of pn sn and rn at anthesis table 4 averaging across the two years and cultivars under j20 treatment and the amount of pn and sn increased by 24 2 31 3 and 19 7 24 9 respectively and the amount of rn increased by 28 7 32 6 compared with j0 treatment compared with amounts in both cultivars in both years in j20 the amounts of pn and sn in j40 did not change significantly p 0 05 but the amount of rn increased significantly p 0 05 by 32 5 32 8 averaged across two years in the comparisons of j20 and j40 with j0 the increases in pn 34 8 38 1 and storage rn 86 6 175 7 in sn23 were larger than those in sn29 pn 25 6 26 8 rn 50 4 107 4 however the increases of

amount at jointing the amount of n redistributed from vegetative organs to grain increased but the amount of n assimilation after anthesis and its contribution to grain decreased table 5 averaging across two years and cultivars compared with j0 the pre anthesis n redistributed to grain increased by 35 8 55 1 in j20 and by 47 7 66 3 in j40 and its contribution to grain increased by 15 5 22 2 in j20 and by 21 4 38 4 in j40 compared with j0 the amount of n assimilation after anthesis decreased by 22 2 38 1 in j20 and by 38 4 57 5 in j40 the amount of n assimilation after anthesis was significantly higher p 0 05 in sn29 than that in sn23 under the same si treatment in the two growing seasons table 5 the contribution of pre anthesis n remobilization to grain was lower in sn29 than that in sn23 in j20 and j40 in both years 3 4 grain yield nitrogen uptake efficiency nitrogen utilization efficiency and water productivity in 2017 2018 the n accumulation in shoots at maturity nam was significantly higher p 0 01 in sn29 than that in sn23 in all treatments but grain yield was not significantly different p 0 05 between si treatments for either cultivar table 6 however in 2018 2019 the grain yield and nam were both lower in sn29 than those in sn23 the nute of sn29 was lower than that of sn23 in all treatments in the two growing seasons in the two growing seasons the grain yields of both sn23 and sn29 in j20 and j40 increased significantly p 0 05 compared with those in j0 but there was no significant difference p 0 05 between yields in j20 and j40 table 6 the nupe of both sn23 and sn29 increased with the increase in irrigation amount at the jointing stage the nute of both sn23 and sn29 in j20 and j40 was significantly higher p 0 05 than that in j0 and for both cultivars the nute was significantly p 0 05 lower in j40 than that in j20 the wp of both sn23 and sn29 increased first and then decreased with the increase in irrigation amount at the jointing stage with the highest value in j20 3 5 regression analysis regression analysis showed a significant positive correlation between the amount of naa and the amount of rn at anthesis p 0 01 fig 3a there was a significant negative relation between the amount of rn and the amount of n assimilation after anthesis p 0 01 fig 3b the grain yield was significantly positively related to the amount of pn at anthesis p 0 01 fig 3c and the wp was significantly positively related to the amount of naa at anthesis p 0 01 fig 3d 4 discussion the n nutrition status of winter wheat at anthesis is important for photosynthetic production and yield formation and the nni is a widely used tool to diagnose crop n nutrition status in the vegetative growth stage fabbri et al 2020 hoogmoed et al 2018 the n fertilizer is the most effective way to improve the nni of crop the nni on each growth stage has a positively correlation with n rate ata ul karim et al 2014 debaeke et al 2006 zhao et al 2016 in our study as the irrigation amount at jointing increased the value of nni at anthesis increased from 0 86 to 1 11 fig 2 si at jointing improved the crop n nutrition status at anthesis and high si resulted in luxury consumption of n nutrition like excessive n application previous studies had confirmed that n nutrient status has a linear plateau relation with grain yield lemaire et al 2008 ziadi et al 2008 when the value of nni is in the range of 0 4 1 0 the grain yield increases with the increase of nni but when nni 1 0 grain yield is not affected ziadi et al 2010 based on this relationship between nni and grain yield the nni is used to determining the effectiveness of n application on grain yield guo et al 2019 the results of this study are consistent with those of previous studies ziadi et al 2010 compared with no si j0 at jointing moderate si j20 at jointing significantly increased the nni at anthesis fig 2 and the grain yield table 6 however with high si j40 at jointing although the nni at anthesis increased further the grain yield was not significantly affected these results indicated that the nni at anthesis could be an important indicator in determining the effectiveness of irrigation regulation on grain yield the increase of nupe usually has a positive effect on biomass and grain yield but the highest grain yield does not always appear with the highest nitrogen uptake li et al 2021 qi et al 2020 in most previous experiments high n uptake usually resulted in declines in crop nute and n harvest index cousins et al 2020 compared with no si the moderate si significantly increased the nupe nute and grain yield table 6 high si further increased the nupe of winter wheat but had no benefit on grain yield which resulted in a significant decrease in nute such conclusions are confirmed in studies about wp the etc act of winter wheat increases with an increase in the water supply but the wp increases with etc act to a certain level and then declines wang 2017 wang et al 2018 an irrigation amount between 144 and 186 mm maintains grain yield and wp at relatively high levels and further increasing the amount has no benefit to increasing grain yields abdelkhalek et al 2015 kumar jha et al 2019 yu et al 2020 moderate si significantly increased the etc act wp and grain yield compared with no si table 6 however with high si to wet the deeper layer etc act of winter wheat increased significantly but grain yield did not increase which resulted in a significant decrease in wp table 6 the changes of wp and nupe were related to the n nutrition status at anthesis when the nni at anthesis was less than 1 the increase in nupe and etc act significantly increased the nute and wp but when the nni at anthesis was greater than 1 the increase in nute and etc act significantly decreased the nute and wp fig 2 table 6 in order to explain the regulation mechanism of nni on nute and wp we referred the research of pask et al 2012 and partitioned the naa into three pools sn pn and rn pask et al 2012 plants need to allocate more n to photosynthetic nitrogenous compounds to maximize the productivity of per unit n absorbed duan et al 2018 hikosaka 2004 in this study the grain yield was significantly positively related to the amount of pn at anthesis fig 3c the amount of pn at anthesis increased with the increase of nni and reached to peaks when the value of nni was close to 1 under moderate si table 4 as the n content exceeds the n requirement in canopy scales the excess n is stored in vegetative organs as rn which is transported after anthesis to meet the needs of grain filling arduini et al 2006 cruz aguado et al 2000 the rn at anthesis has no direct effect on photosynthetic production but inadequate rn at anthesis accelerates pn decomposition resulting in a significant decrease in grain yield tahir and nakata 2005 in this study the amount of rn was positively related to the amount of naa at anthesis fig 3a compared with no si moderate si increased the naa and obtained moderate rn and pn simultaneously table 6 high si further increased the naa but most of those increased n absorption was allocated to the storage rn and accumulated rn pools instead of the pn pool table 4 which explained the decrease in nute and wp when nni is higher than 1 compared with the multispike type cultivar sn29 the large spike type cultivar sn23 had significantly higher pre anthesis n remobilization to grain and its contribution rate to grain and the amount of naa or nam only in 2018 2019 growing season but sn23 obtained higher nute in both years tables 5 and 6 genotypes with high nute generally have higher photosynthetic rates and longer duration of photosynthetic function distelfeld et al 2014 which are primarily associated with pre anthesis n accumulation and n translocation after anthesis liu et al 2020 tian et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 in this experiment the large spike type cultivar sn23 tended to allocate more n to pn and storage rn and less to sn and accumulation rn compared with the multispike type cultivar sn29 table 4 which explained why sn23 had higher nute than sn29 excessive levels of nni and rn at anthesis indicated excessive n nutrition in shoots and post anthesis n assimilation was found to be negatively related to the amount of rn fig 3b however we noticed that treatments with no si and moderate si had a high n assimilation under moderate water supply after anthesis table 5 which indicated that n uptake was also required after anthesis for these reasons the function and distribution of n assimilation after anthesis need further study in addition low soil moisture conditions after anthesis were not considered in this work and whether rn storage helps winter wheat to resist the water stress after anthesis will be studied in further research 5 conclusions in the present experiments the si largely improved the n nutrition status of winter wheat at anthesis grain yield and the amount of pn at anthesis were significantly positively correlated with moderate si at the jointing stage the nni of winter wheat was close to 1 the pn at anthesis increased to peaks and the highest grain yield nute and wp were obtained with high si the nni at anthesis increased higher than 1 the naa and rn at anthesis increased further but the amounts of pn and grain yield were not affected which explained the reduction in nute and wp besides the large spike type cultivar sn23 tended to allocate more n to pn and storage rn and less to sn and accumulation rn at anthesis and had higher nute than the multispike type cultivar sn29 these cultivar novel results of this study suggested that the nni at anthesis can be an important indicator in determining the effectiveness of irrigation

9614,new rice for africa nerica was reported to have higher exudation and transpiration rates above ground dry matter at heading than japanese cultivars information on the expression of their gas exchange attributes and water balance under repeated cycles of water deficit at reproductive stage is unknown this investigation tested the hypothesis that variation in leaf gas exchange and energy attributes of nerica rice under repeated cycles of water deficit at reproductive stage would affect their performance under field conditions repeated cycles of water regimes irrigation and water deficit at reproductive stage were imposed on eight nerica rice nerica 1 8 and checks cg14 wab56 104 and ir64 water regimes were assigned to main plots and rice cultivars to sub plots using randomised complete block design with three replicates drought tolerant nerica 4 and 7 had significantly higher relative water content stomatal conductance leaf photosynthetic rates with the least canopy temperature than others a converse pattern was observed in the drought susceptible ir 64 grain yield of nerica 4 and 7 was significantly higher than that of ir 64 these results suggested that improved water and energy status observed in nerica 4 and 7 could have been responsible for its better performance than ir 64 keywords drought leaf relative water content new rice for africa stomatal conductance upland ecology 1 introduction rice occupies a strategic position in ensuring food security in most parts of the world it is a source of energy especially in the sub sahara africa and is part of cultural identity of ghana and madagascar chauhan et al 2017 zenna et al 2017 reported that growth rate of rice production was 1 76 1991 2001 to 3 96 2002 2013 furthermore there was 1 per annum increase in global rice consumption which was higher in the middle east and africa than the rest of the world water deficit a condition where the demand of water by the plant is greater than its supply remains topical in the face of global climate change scenario variation in rainfall pattern and increasing temperature could predispose cultivated plants to water deficit availability of water remains a major production constraint in the cultivation of rice this is more pertinent considering the fact that rice as a semi aquatic crop toorchi et al 2002 it is generally considered shallow rooted yoshida and hasegawa 1982 especially lowland rice compared with upland rice with negative implications on the uptake of water especially when its supply is limiting the yield loss of 20 in rice due to drought had been reported in the literature ndjiondjop et al 2012 serraj and atlin 2009 when compared with the rest of the other ecologies the yield of the upland rice is the lowest with actual yield of 1 2 2 5 t ha 1 diagne et al 2013 however considering competing demands for fresh water there is the need to explore the upland agroecology in the rice production the production area of upland rice in africa was reported as 30 diagne et al 2013 diagne et al 2013 reported that upland rice production area in africa is in the order cote d ivoire 615 325 ha nigeria 557 256 ha guinea 532 329 ha the severity of water deficit on the performance of cultivated crop is dependent on the time of occurrence duration and intensity of water deficit bray 2004 the adaptive responses exhibited by crops have been associated with the level of their dehydration blum and tuberosa 2018 maintenance of leaf gas and energy exchange would determine the degree of adaptive response of crops to water and energy balance and subsequently their performance under water deficit new rice for africa nerica rice is an interspecific rice hybrid it is a cross between oryza sativa and oryza glaberrima they have been reported to be adapted to adverse environmental conditions especially water deficit and nutrient deficiency commonly observed in most sub sahara african countries jones et al 1997 under optimum water supply it was reported that compared to the japanese rice cultivars nerica displayed higher transpiration and exudation rates matsunami et al 2010 it was suggested in that work that sustained water uptake through high transpiration and exudation rates in nerica could be linked with their reproductive success matsunami et al 2010 these contrasting properties between nerica and japanese cultivars could serve as a basis for comparison with regards to the implication of transpiration and exudation rate on the reproductive success of nerica under water deficit at the reproductive growth stage considering the leaf gas exchange properties of nerica rice under optimum water supply there is the need to investigate if this property is sustainable under water deficit at the reproductive growth stage furthermore since the adaptive responses to water deficit is dependent on the level of cellular dehydration information is required on the effect of varietal variation on this property and its implications on leaf gas exchange properties of nerica rice when subjected to repeated cycles of water deficit at the reproductive growth stage this investigation would further explicate the implication of variations on the leaf gas exchange properties caused by water deficit at the reproductive growth stage on the grain yield and yield components of upland nerica rice in a derived savanna of nigeria this information is pertinent considering the hierarchy of plasticity of reproductive structures under stress sadras and slafer 2012 this investigation aimed to determine leaf gas exchange properties yield and its component responses to water deficit at the reproductive growth stage in upland nerica rice in a derived savanna agroecology of nigeria 2 materials and methods 2 1

score ir 64 at ibadan 43 2 and 19 1 of the variation observed in upland rice sown under optimal water regime was explained by pc 1 and pc 2 respectively fig 3c unlike ikenne positive association observed between number tillers and number of panicles per hill was observed in ir 64 similar pattern was observed under sub optimal water regime at the same location leaf relative water content and stomatal conductance were observed to be positively correlated under optimal water regime at ibadan similar pattern was observed between 1000 grain mass and leaf photosynthetic rate nerica 1 when sown under sub optimal water regime at the reproductive growth stage 48 5 and 20 0 variations observed were explained by pc 1 and pc 2 respectively fig 3d there was a positive association among grain yield leaf photosynthetic rate and percentage fertility in nerica 4 and 7 while 1000 grain mass and stomatal conductance were positively correlated in nerica 1 under this condition similar association was established between spad and plant height 4 discussion upland rice encounter the problem of water deficit especially under rainfed condition this is even more pronounced when it occurs at the reproductive growth stage than other growth stages water deficit at the reproductive growth stage is more severe than any other growth stage in crops zhang et al 2018 upland rice inclusive dehydration is the strain response to water deficit blum and tuberosa 2018 the maintenance of significantly higher relative water content observed in nerica 4 and 7 than ir 64 suggested dehydration avoidance guided by the maintenance of water status as reflected in their leaf water potential the observed lrwc of nerica 4 and 7 under repeated cycles of water deficit was 50 which could have suggested early response to dehydration farrant and ruelland 2015 it could be inferred that there is the possibility of osmotic adjustment in these upland rice with repeated cycles of water deficit at the reproductive growth stage babu et al 1999 reported that in rice onset of osmotic adjustment commences when the lrwc is approximately at 70 the lrwc of ir 64 was 25 08 which could have suggested a late response to dehydration farrant and ruelland 2015 farrant and ruelland 2015 reported that late response to dehydration led to folding of leaves adaxially and the increasing accumulation of anthocyanin this could have explained the observed leaf rolling pattern of ir 64 at both locations the increased leaf rolling of ir 64 with increasing cycles of water deficit at reproductive growth stage could have been a mechanism to ensure energy balance despite the positive response of ir 64 towards energy balance it displayed as reduced leaf photosynthetic rate this was associated with reduced stomatal conductance under this condition roohi et al 2015 observed similar pattern in some cereals when subjected to water deficit it was reported that wheat yield progress was associated with higher stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate in cooler canopies ashraf and harris 2013 drawing on another line of evidence kato et al 2008 inferred that sustained water uptake and transpiration is important for reproductive success this evidence could have informed blum 2009 to conclude that effective rather than efficient use of water was what is required under water deficit condition similarly araus et al 2002 fischer et al 1998 observed that high yield rice cotton and wheat have high stomatal conductance under drought stress or well watered condition it could be inferred that the observed maintenance of stomatal conductance in nerica 4 and 7 under repeated cycles of water deficit at reproductive growth stage could have facilitated water uptake and ensure its reproductive success as evidenced in its grain yield compared to ir 64 it had been reported that ir 64 and cg 14 possess low stomatal sizes ouyang et al 2017 this could have explained the observed low stomatal conductance under water deficit however it must be observed that warren 2008 opined that upland and aerobic rice show more dependence on mesophyll conductance than stomatal conductance high transpiration efficiency and gross photosynthetic rates are more associated with mesophyll conductance the variations in the leaf gas exchange properties could be associated not only with incidence and severity of water deficit at reproductive growth stage of upland rice but probably associated with variation in intra and interspecific variations in leaf anatomical structure and mesophyll structures ouyang et al 2017 matsunami et al 2010 reported that compared to japanese cultivars nerica displayed higher exudation and transpiration rates they also reported that this was translated to higher above ground dry matter at heading they inferred that the aforementioned attributes resulted in high n absorption rates and water uptake the reduced spad reading in ir 64 under this condition could be associated with its canopy temperature though not observed in this study however roohi et al 2013 observed that in some cereals canopy temperature is negatively associated with spad reading taken at the grain filling stage variation in the canopy temperature was observed in nerica 4 and 7 at both locations this variation could be ascribed to differences in their weather conditions rainfall at ikenne was higher than that of ibadan well distributed during the cropping season by implication one could infer more relative humidity with reduced vapour pressure deficit and evapotranspiration these could have predisposed the canopy temperature of nerica 4 and 7 to be lower at ikenne than that of ibadan reynolds 2002 reported that canopy temperature under water deficit could also be associated negatively with metabolic activities with reduced vascular system reduced vascular system could compromise c assimilation through reduced water potential schurr et al 2000 posited that the observed increase in spad reading in some drought tolerant varieties under drought could be explained by the reduction in their leaf area resulting in increased n content in the leaf alternative explanation of the observed significantly higher spad reading of nerica 4 and 7 than ir64 could be associated with high n absorption and water uptake at heading in nerica rice compared to the japanese cultivars as posited by matsunami et al 2010 ir 64 experienced delayed flowering under repeated cycles of water deficit at reproductive growth stage this could suggested its possibility of been susceptible to shortage of water supply ndjiondjop et al 2012 reported that field grown rice when subjected to water deficit flowered earlier than those grown under irrigated condition the underlying mechanism in the later could have been that of escape mechanism to forestall terminal drought the case of ir 64 could have predisposed it to terminal water deficit if there are no other mechanism to reduce water loss or increase its supply its high canopy temperature could have predisposed it towards increased water loss compared to nerica 4 and 7 however its morphological increased leaf rolling and physiological responses reduced stomatal conductance could not maintain its water balance as evidenced in reduced leaf water potential which eventually compromised its productivity leaf photosynthesis and grain yield the observed reduced grain yield in ir64 under this condition could also be explained by its reduced percentage fertility the observed low grain yield per hectare in all the upland rice genotypes when subjected to water deficit at the reproductive growth stage could have been associated with the intensity of water deficit with recycles of its imposition zhang et al 2018 reported that water deficit at vegetative growth stage of rice reduced its yield by 21 58 6 while at flowering yield loss was in the range of 42 83 7 however at the whole reproductive growth stage when rice was subjected to water deficit moderate to severe it was observed that yield loss in rice was in the range of 51 90 6 these results suggested that severity of water deficit at the reproductive growth stage is more pronounced than that of the vegetative growth stage it was reported that the impact of water deficit at the reproductive growth stage in rice is due to minimal recovery daryanto et al 2017 increased intensity of water deficit at the reproductive growth stage could exacerbate increased yield loss in rice irrespective of the growth stage increased intensity of water deficit have been observed to increase oxidative damage to assimilate machinery farooq et al 2009 reduce the cell division of the tillers panicle and grain ultimately affecting negatively gross photosynthesis in rice pantuwan et al 2002 sarvestani et al 2008 zhang et al 2018 observed that under severe water deficit there was a 64 decrease in net photosynthesis in rice this magnitude of damage under severe water deficit could be associated with irreversibility and recoverability of the process under this condition zhang et al 2018 percentage grain yield reduction in rice when drought was imposed at grain filling stage was similar to that of vegetative growth stage it could be inferred from the biplot that nerica 4 and 7 established under water deficit both locations were able to maintain water balance with improved leaf photosynthetic rate grain yield and high percentage fertility conversely the susceptible cultivar ir64 at ikenne maintained energy balance through leaf rolling with reduced phenology days to 50 flowering similar pattern was observed at ibadan with penalty on leaf water potential spad metre reading and plant height as expressed in nerica 3 varietal differences displayed among the upland rice cultivars could be explained by the sink strength of nerica 4 and 7 both varieties had the highest 1000 grain weight huber et al 2012 had earlier observed that direction of plasticity differs between biomass allocation and yield components this could have been explained by the trade off observed among the vegetative and reproductive organs depending on the environment and the genotype in question considering that the aforementioned component contributes mostly to the grain yield of rice this could also have an implication on the adaptive capabilities of both nerica 4 and 7 this confirms the observation of dolferus et al 2011 where he observed that seed number is more plastic than the seed size the high canopy temperature observed in ir 64 compared to other upland rice cultivars could have been associated with the observed high leaf rolling score reduced assimilatory surface through increased leaf rolling score will reduce loss of water through transpiration into the atmosphere this reduced transpiration could preclude evaporative cooling that would have reduced canopy temperature high canopy temperature observed in ir 64 could affect canopy photosynthesis through reduced assimilatory surface occasioned by high leaf rolling score or through increased photoinhibition other implications could be increased abortion of the pollens and reduced fertility of the panicle despite the high number of tillers and panicle per hill in ir 64 compared to other upland rice cultivars in this study these evidences could have explained the observed reduced 1000 grain weight in ir 64 rice cultivar compared to others furthermore the low hi in ir 64 in this investigation compared to others could be associated with its low 1000 grain weight and high number of tillers and panicle per hill despite its shorter canopy architecture compared to others conclusively it could be inferred that tolerance of nerica 4 and 7 to repeated cycles of water deficit at reproductive growth stage could be attributed to the maintenance of water status this was displayed through significantly higher relative water content and leaf water potential these could have suggested the maintenance of leaf photosynthetic activity through the functionality of light absorbing pigment under this condition increased grain yield could have been associated with improved percentage fertility susceptibility of ir 64 under this condition could be attributed to the disruption of water balance with the negative effect on leaf photosynthetic rate and grain yield

9614,new rice for africa nerica was reported to have higher exudation and transpiration rates above ground dry matter at heading than japanese cultivars information on the expression of their gas exchange attributes and water balance under repeated cycles of water deficit at reproductive stage is unknown this investigation tested the hypothesis that variation in leaf gas exchange and energy attributes of nerica rice under repeated cycles of water deficit at reproductive stage would affect their performance under field conditions repeated cycles of water regimes irrigation and water deficit at reproductive stage were imposed on eight nerica rice nerica 1 8 and checks cg14 wab56 104 and ir64 water regimes were assigned to main plots and rice cultivars to sub plots using randomised complete block design with three replicates drought tolerant nerica 4 and 7 had significantly higher relative water content stomatal conductance leaf photosynthetic rates with the least canopy temperature than others a converse pattern was observed in the drought susceptible ir 64 grain yield of nerica 4 and 7 was significantly higher than that of ir 64 these results suggested that improved water and energy status observed in nerica 4 and 7 could have been responsible for its better performance than ir 64 keywords drought leaf relative water content new rice for africa stomatal conductance upland ecology 1 introduction rice occupies a strategic position in ensuring food security in most parts of the world it is a source of energy especially in the sub sahara africa and is part of cultural identity of ghana and madagascar chauhan et al 2017 zenna et al 2017 reported that growth rate of rice production was 1 76 1991 2001 to 3 96 2002 2013 furthermore there was 1 per annum increase in global rice consumption which was higher in the middle east and africa than the rest of the world water deficit a condition where the demand of water by the plant is greater than its supply remains topical in the face of global climate change scenario variation in rainfall pattern and increasing temperature could predispose cultivated plants to water deficit availability of water remains a major production constraint in the cultivation of rice this is more pertinent considering the fact that rice as a semi aquatic crop toorchi et al 2002 it is generally considered shallow rooted yoshida and hasegawa 1982 especially lowland rice compared with upland rice with negative implications on the uptake of water especially when its supply is limiting the yield loss of 20 in rice due to drought had been reported in the literature ndjiondjop et al 2012 serraj and atlin 2009 when compared with the rest of the other ecologies the yield of the upland rice is the lowest with actual yield of 1 2 2 5 t ha 1 diagne et al 2013 however considering competing demands for fresh water there is the need to explore the upland agroecology in the rice production the production area of upland rice in africa was reported as 30 diagne et al 2013 diagne et al 2013 reported that upland rice production area in africa is in the order cote d ivoire 615 325 ha nigeria 557 256 ha guinea 532 329 ha the severity of water deficit on the performance of cultivated crop is dependent on the time of occurrence duration and intensity of water deficit bray 2004 the adaptive responses exhibited by crops have been associated with the level of their dehydration blum and tuberosa 2018 maintenance of leaf gas and energy exchange would determine the degree of adaptive response of crops to water and energy balance and subsequently their performance under water deficit new rice for africa nerica rice is an interspecific rice hybrid it is a cross between oryza sativa and oryza glaberrima they have been reported to be adapted to adverse environmental conditions especially water deficit and nutrient deficiency commonly observed in most sub sahara african countries jones et al 1997 under optimum water supply it was reported that compared to the japanese rice cultivars nerica displayed higher transpiration and exudation rates matsunami et al 2010 it was suggested in that work that sustained water uptake through high transpiration and exudation rates in nerica could be linked with their reproductive success matsunami et al 2010 these contrasting properties between nerica and japanese cultivars could serve as a basis for comparison with regards to the implication of transpiration and exudation rate on the reproductive success of nerica under water deficit at the reproductive growth stage considering the leaf gas exchange properties of nerica rice under optimum water supply there is the need to investigate if this property is sustainable under water deficit at the reproductive growth stage furthermore since the adaptive responses to water deficit is dependent on the level of cellular dehydration information is required on the effect of varietal variation on this property and its implications on leaf gas exchange properties of nerica rice when subjected to repeated cycles of water deficit at the reproductive growth stage this investigation would further explicate the implication of variations on the leaf gas exchange properties caused by water deficit at the reproductive growth stage on the grain yield and yield components of upland nerica rice in a derived savanna of nigeria this information is pertinent considering the hierarchy of plasticity of reproductive structures under stress sadras and slafer 2012 this investigation aimed to determine leaf gas exchange properties yield and its component responses to water deficit at the reproductive growth stage in upland nerica rice in a derived savanna agroecology of nigeria 2 materials and methods 2 1

loss or increase its supply its high canopy temperature could have predisposed it towards increased water loss compared to nerica 4 and 7 however its morphological increased leaf rolling and physiological responses reduced stomatal conductance could not maintain its water balance as evidenced in reduced leaf water potential which eventually compromised its productivity leaf photosynthesis and grain yield the observed reduced grain yield in ir64 under this condition could also be explained by its reduced percentage fertility the observed low grain yield per hectare in all the upland rice genotypes when subjected to water deficit at the reproductive growth stage could have been associated with the intensity of water deficit with recycles of its imposition zhang et al 2018 reported that water deficit at vegetative growth stage of rice reduced its yield by 21 58 6 while at flowering yield loss was in the range of 42 83 7 however at the whole reproductive growth stage when rice was subjected to water deficit moderate to severe it was observed that yield loss in rice was in the range of 51 90 6 these results suggested that severity of water deficit at the reproductive growth stage is more pronounced than that of the vegetative growth stage it was reported that the impact of water deficit at the reproductive growth stage in rice is due to minimal recovery daryanto et al 2017 increased intensity of water deficit at the reproductive growth stage could exacerbate increased yield loss in rice irrespective of the growth stage increased intensity of water deficit have been observed to increase oxidative damage to assimilate machinery farooq et al 2009 reduce the cell division of the tillers panicle and grain ultimately affecting negatively gross photosynthesis in rice pantuwan et al 2002 sarvestani et al 2008 zhang et al 2018 observed that under severe water deficit there was a 64 decrease in net photosynthesis in rice this magnitude of damage under severe water deficit could be associated with irreversibility and recoverability of the process under this condition zhang et al 2018 percentage grain yield reduction in rice when drought was imposed at grain filling stage was similar to that of vegetative growth stage it could be inferred from the biplot that nerica 4 and 7 established under water deficit both locations were able to maintain water balance with improved leaf photosynthetic rate grain yield and high percentage fertility conversely the susceptible cultivar ir64 at ikenne maintained energy balance through leaf rolling with reduced phenology days to 50 flowering similar pattern was observed at ibadan with penalty on leaf water potential spad metre reading and plant height as expressed in nerica 3 varietal differences displayed among the upland rice cultivars could be explained by the sink strength of nerica 4 and 7 both varieties had the highest 1000 grain weight huber et al 2012 had earlier observed that direction of plasticity differs between biomass allocation and yield components this could have been explained by the trade off observed among the vegetative and reproductive organs depending on the environment and the genotype in question considering that the aforementioned component contributes mostly to the grain yield of rice this could also have an implication on the adaptive capabilities of both nerica 4 and 7 this confirms the observation of dolferus et al 2011 where he observed that seed number is more plastic than the seed size the high canopy temperature observed in ir 64 compared to other upland rice cultivars could have been associated with the observed high leaf rolling score reduced assimilatory surface through increased leaf rolling score will reduce loss of water through transpiration into the atmosphere this reduced transpiration could preclude evaporative cooling that would have reduced canopy temperature high canopy temperature observed in ir 64 could affect canopy photosynthesis through reduced assimilatory surface occasioned by high leaf rolling score or through increased photoinhibition other implications could be increased abortion of the pollens and reduced fertility of the panicle despite the high number of tillers and panicle per hill in ir 64 compared to other upland rice cultivars in this study these evidences could have explained the observed reduced 1000 grain weight in ir 64 rice cultivar compared to others furthermore the low hi in ir 64 in this investigation compared to others could be associated with its low 1000 grain weight and high number of tillers and panicle per hill despite its shorter canopy architecture compared to others conclusively it could be inferred that tolerance of nerica 4 and 7 to repeated cycles of water deficit at reproductive growth stage could be attributed to the maintenance of water status this was displayed through significantly higher relative water content and leaf water potential these could have suggested the maintenance of leaf photosynthetic activity through the functionality of light absorbing pigment under this condition increased grain yield could have been associated with improved percentage fertility susceptibility of ir 64 under this condition could be attributed to the disruption of water balance with the negative effect on leaf photosynthetic rate and grain yield
