3890,in 2020 summer excessive rainfall pushed rivers and lakes to record high levels over the yangtze river basin yrb but the five flood peaks were absorbed by the three gorges reservoir tgr mass migration in hydrological processes usually causes the earth s gravity response wherefore the 2020 flood events provide a good opportunity to assess the capabilities of gravity measurements in capturing the water mass changes at different scales in this study we presents two common gravity measurements i e the satellite mission grace fo and the ground gphone used to characterize the evolution of regional floods at a basin and local scale which can be attributed to east asian rainy season commonly called plum rain event i e extreme climate induced effects of the regional water balance and floodwater absorbed by the reservoir i e the man made three gorges dam tgd intercepting flood peaks the terrestrial water storage tws estimated by grace fo shows a significant positive anomaly e g 370 mm in july and august in around the tgr the gphone measured gravity residual of 10 20 µgal between may and september the results further suggest that grace observation does not have obvious advantages in small scale tws monitoring but gphone records is difficult to detect the source of the tws mass change 50 km away in particular gphone recorded the high frequency gravity disturbance directly related to the high outflow i e 31 000 m3 s of tgd flood discharge which is likely used as precursor or co seismic signal to further study the activity of surface landslide and underground faults induced by the vibration or noise source of the water body this study shows that the combination of multiscale gravity solutions can potentially detect a wide range of extreme climate events triggered by atmospheric circulation patterns like el niño southern oscillation and indian ocean basin warming accompanied by sea surface temperature sst and wind anomalies keywords space grace mission ground gphone gravimeter 2020 china floods tws anomalies gravity response 1 introduction floods are the most frequent natural disaster cred unisdr 2020 these extreme weather related hydrological events are usually caused by heavy rainfall rapid snowmelt or a storm surge reager et al 2014 the intensity and frequency of floods are increasing dottori et al 2018 due to the impact of human activities e g changes in land use and waterway courses and environmental issues e g climate change and sea level rise gao et al 2018 jongman et al 2018 china has been frequently plagued by destructive deluges with several large floods triggered by the east asian rainy season commonly called plum rain causing damage to human life and infrastructure in the past three decades kundzewicz et al 2020 therefore the evolution and prediction of flood events are crucial to understand the extreme climate cycle and the monitoring of this hydrological process based on multidimensional data has become one of the most important methods of the water resources management and dispatch in china ding et al 2020 liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b in early june 2020 a record breaking plum rain events occurred in the middle lower reaches of the yangtze river yr leading to severe floods that affected large areas of southern china including the yangtze river basin yrb and its tributaries liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b the rains and floods extended to central and eastern china between july and august and have been described as the worst flood since 1998 wei et al 2020 previous studies have noted a limitation e g real time monitoring of water migration in a large area to conventional observations for all hydrological parameters associated with regional floods reager et al 2014 famiglietti and rodell 2013 chen et al 2010 including precipitation p evapotranspiration e and surface runoff r or the related mass of water storage on the land surface and in the subsurface i e soil moisture snow and ice groundwater water stored in the vegetation rivers lakes and reservoirs flood events represent a typical short term abnormal hydrological process which means these flowing water cause significant regional mass redistribution and then causing changes in the gravity field gravity variations from space to the ground measured by gravity recovery and climate experiment and its follow on grace grace fo satellites and continuous in situ gravimeters can be used to determine terrestrial water storage tws at different scales wahr et al 1998 previous studies have confirmed that grace based estimates of tws anomalies can be used to characterize large scale flood potential getirana et al 2017 molodtsova et al 2016 reager and famiglietti 2009 crowley et al 2006 but coarse temporal monthly and spatial 300 km resolutions of grace data make it unsuitable for monitoring local high intensity events such as changes in reservoir capacity and flood peaks the construction of dams is not only for the purpose of flood control and the mitigation of flood risks in downstream communities and ecosystems but also for water storage or power generation lempérière 2017 the three gorges dam tgd the biggest and most important large scale water conservancy project on the yr fig 1 a was crucial in the response to the catastrophic 2020 flooding wei et al 2020 generally the water level of three gorges reservoir tgr behind the tgd is perennially operating in periodic fluctuation fig 1b between 145 m and 175 m to ensure there is sufficient storage capacity to control floods and for meeting the power generation requirements wang et al 2014a wang et al 2014b during the summer of 2020 the water level in front of the dam fluctuated by 160 m and the maximum flood level exceeded the average water level of the previous five summer seasons by nearly 10 m fig 1b the tgd withstood five upstream floods within six weeks see inflow of tgr in fig 1c in this case the accumulation and release of the tgr water mass will inevitably cause a significant local gravity response wang et al 2014a wang et al 2014b this study aims to investigate tws anomalies caused by the 2020 china floods that occur in the yr and the surrounding areas using satellite based and ground based gravity measurements it is a focus of hydrological research for an important reason in order to infer hydrological processes or land water mass migration from gravity measurements we must decompose observed gravity effects into their water mass and other types of surface load components one of the key problems of modelling the gravity response to changing water mass is characterizing these loading fields with sufficient resolution in space and in time grace and its follow on have had a revolutionary impact on the study of environmental mass fluxes but it provides a band limited representation of near surface mass changes this is particularly problematic when studying mass changes in rivers or lakes because these mass changes tend to be concentrated in fairly narrow or small disc areas but in situ gravity measurements are appropriate for investigating local hydrological effects in this case we provide a good opportunity to analyze the gravimetry data at different scales tws change in the yrb from may to september will be estimated based on grace fo solutions and regional downscaling factors that consider the tgr water model driven by human changes in surface gphone gravity located near the tgd fig 1a will be identified to determine the extent and intensity in the short term i e high frequency disturbance from second to hour scale and long term i e low frequency response from days to month scale period of the 2020 floodwater intercepted by the artificial dam and the possible climate drivers behind this abnormal flood season will also be discussed e g the relationship between the 2020 flood in the yrb and climate variability induced by sea surface temperature sst and wind anomalies in the pacific and indian oceans etc 2 materials 2 1 study area the yangtze known as chang jiang means long river in china is the longest river i e 6380 km in the world that flows entirely through a country the yrb plays an important role in the history culture and economy of china because of its large area 20 of the land area of china in addition the yrb is greatly influenced by human activities and climate for example nearly 53 of large artificial reservoirs in china have been established in the yrb since 2000 wang et al 2020 which means that previous works concentrated on studying the terrestrial water balance of the entire river basin and how climate and anthropogenic activities affected this balance lv et al 2017 the tgr located in the middle and upper reaches of the yrb is one of the largest hydroelectric reservoirs in the world the tgd is a gravity dam that spans the yr near the town of sandouping yichang in hubei province the total storage capacity of the tgr reaches 39 3 km3 and the flood prevention storage capacity is 22 15 km3 which can reduce peak flood flow by 27 000 m3 s 33 000 m3 s when water is stored the water level in the tgr can reach 175 m the reservoir s function to effectively control floods in the upper reaches of the yr make it the most significant water conservancy project in the world 2 2 grace grace fo and gphone the grace grace fo rl06 spherical harmonic sh coefficients stokes coefficients used in this study were provided by the center for space research university of texas austin usa these stokes maximum degree order 96 i e lmax 96 devaraju sneeuw 2015 were processed and then converted to the grids based on general post processing steps e g replacement of c20 coefficients cheng et al 2013 and degree 1 coefficient swenson et al 2008 corrected glacial isostatic adjustment a et al 2013 destriping p4m6 filter and gaussian filtering with a radius of 500 km we also used jpl rl06 version 2 mascon solutions wiese et al 2016 with jpl m sf downscaled to 0 5 degree grid cells and without a scaling factor jpl m 3 degree equal area caps to compare the results of sh data and highlight their ability to recognize climate and human driven tws changes all selected data were anomalies relative to the 2004 0 2009 999 time mean baseline note that the processing of sh and mascon is the same except that filtering is used in sh data but mascon approach applies constraints or regularization during processing to improve all parameters in the final products scanlon et al 2016 the continuous surface gravity data in this study were collected by a gphone spring gravimeter gphone 101 micro g lacoste inc in co usa with a resolution of 0 1 µgal and accuracy of 1 µgal which was installed at a station see fig 1a approximately 4 km from the tgd since 2015 the post processing steps of gphone 101 raw data are as follows the details for processing strategies and geophysical correction methods see supplementary information 1 resampling i e from seconds to minutes or a wider sampling interval and manual correction i e clear up spikes small gaps steps and earthquake induced large amplitudes 2 geophysical corrections e g solid and ocean tides atmospheric pressure and polar motion etc 3 instrument drift modelling and correction using piecewise fitting based on first order polynomial 4 gravity residual selection from may 2020 to september 2020 it is worth noting that the gphone 101 used in this study had been continuously observed for more than five years and its drift basically reached a stable linear change during the 2020 flood period for gphone 101 data preprocessing and correction results fig 2 the final gravity residual gres after removed drift fitting result is decomposed into high frequency gravity disturbances gres 1 with minute sampling and the low frequency gravity changes gres 2 with hour sampling 2 3 hydrometeorological forcing in this study four types of hydrometeorological data sets see appendix table a1 for the data sources were collected to determine flood characteristics tws anomalies and climate driven mechanisms first the monthly gridded p data rainfall amount during january 1961 to october 2020 was used to evaluate tws anomalies and its spatio temporal evolution in the yrb this data set is based on the latest p data of 2472 stations on the ground in china and used the thin plate spline method to perform spatial interpolation to generate monthly 0 5 degree grids but it cannot reflect the short term i e a few days rainfall changes in local areas i e dozens of kilometers here the daily p and e data of three weather stations around the tgr area the locations shown in fig 1a were selected to check the gravity response of tws changes during the 2020 flood period besides the monthly 0 25 degree gridded and daily snow depth in tibet plateau tp the birthplace of the yr were used to assess the relationship between the 2020 flood and the previous winter s snow cover on upstream second the hydrological information fig 1b and 1c of the tgr during 2013 to 2020 including water level inflow and outflow was used to analyze hydrological phenomena and to simulate gravity effects due to tgr storage capacity change here we also used the gf 1 satellite images and the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem data to characterize the contours of the tgr model due to water level changes the details can be found in ma et al 2020 and not described again in this study third the land surface models global land data assimilation system noah version gldas noah data sources in appendix table a1 were used to assist gravity solutions in monitoring an extreme flood event here the updated gldas in a timely manner was used to generate optimal fields of land surface states rodell et al 2004 and selected gldas noah 2 1 output including 1 degree resolution and 1948 present simulations of tws e g soil moisture and snow can be used to evaluate grace fo s potential to monitor 2020 floods finally important climate phenomena were investigated i e enso and irregular periodic variations in winds and sea surface temperatures sst over the tropical indian and pacific oceans mcphaden et al 2006 in this case the oceanic niño index oni was used a measure of the enso that tracks sst in the niño 3 4 region of the east central tropical pacific kundzewicz et al 2020 to evaluate the impact of ocean atmosphere system fluctuation in the yrb region a remarkable indian ocean basin warming iobw can be detected over the indian ocean io similar to the conventional io sst response to el niño events or el niño transition to a la niña like zhang et al 2021 2 4 tgr model and its gravitational effect simulation the tgr model constructed in this study mainly considers the main channel and its tributary of the yr based on tgr boundary controlled by gf 1 images and water height determined by strm elevation the water body load distribution is discretized to water boundaries 31 in total from 145 m to 175 m at different impounding water levels see covered area in fig 2 this model with the resolution of 8 m and 1 m in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively is an intuitive way to describe the dynamic characteristics of water mass changes in the impounding and releasing water process regulated by tgd in 2020 flood season red dotted in fig 2 next we simulated tgr water loads induced gravitational effects on gphone 101 site based on the high resolution forward modeling of discretized dynamic water model i e considering changes of water covered area and water level at 8 m and 1 m scale in general the gravitational effects of tgr water storage are mainly affected by the distance of the reservoir bank and the relative elevation difference between the calculation points and water level surface this case leads to a tendency for high gravitational effects to appear near the tgr compared with the simulation results of the previous simple model e g gravitational effects on ground and on space shown in fig 2 from wang et al 2016 for gphone 101 location 4 km away from the tgd its modeled gravitational effect of 30 meter tgr water mass changes i e from 145 m to 175 m can reach nearly 20 μgal and the maximum gravity change in the 2020 flood season can up to about 15 μgal which is recognized by gphone within the accuracy range of the instrument 2 5 downscaled grace grace fo to estimate catchment scale water many previous applications using grace data require estimates of mass changes for specific regions or even an area smaller than the grace resolution 300 km e g ice regions river basins and catchment areas etc these cases can be better addressed by constructing specific averaging functions velicogna wahr 2006a 2006b or restore the signal loss methods e g the scaling factor method by landerer and swenson 2012 forward modeling by chen et al 2015 the data driven approach by vishwakarma et al 2017 optimized for those regions recently the jpl mascon set of 0 5 degree gain factors similar to landerer and swenson 2012 derived by a least squares fit to the clm hydrology model and the grace original data can be applied to the data over land but these grid scales are not reliable at man made tgr area because of climate induced hydrology model can not reflect tws changes affected by human factors scanlon et al 2019 other downscaling methods depending on model assumptions and size of the study area are difficult to effectively solve signal leakage in narrow and slender rivers such as yb or tgr this is the method we used to model the tgr signal present in the grace data to explain attenuated surface mass variations due to sampling and post processing used in sh data and also to consider the impacts of human factors such as tgr water storage changes at small spatial scales the downscaled results were calculated as the restored grace estimated tws anomalies the downscaling process is as follows 1 we computed the sh stokes coefficients caused by a 1 m water in tgr height based on 8 m grids of constructed tgr model which spanned the entire length of the reservoir 2 we truncated those stokes coefficients to maximum degree and order 360 that represents a 1 m water increase in tgr at 0 5 degree scale 3 then we processed this original data with the same post processing as the grace data e g truncated to lmax 96 and applied destriping p4m6 filter and gaussian filtering with a 500 km radius 4 then the gain factors 0 5 degree grids were calculated by the least squares fit between 1 spatial domain grids lmax 360 and 3 spatial domain grids lmax 96 finally the sh based tws grid cell is multiplied by scale factors from step 4 and then the rescaled mass change for all grid cells is spatially averaged to obtain the total tgr mass change for a detailed comparison of these scale factors from this study and from clm model please see fig 4 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal variability of tws anomalies estimated by grace fo solutions the grace derived signals with significant spatio temporal characteristics are related to water storage variability in the yrb fig 5 shows monthly tws anomalies estimated by four grace fo solutions from may 2020 to september 2020 overall these results consistently display the process of tws migration caused by heavy rainfall in the 2020 flood season since june the equivalent water height ewh in mm unit in the middle and lower reaches of the yrb has been significantly higher than in previous years especially between july and september the water mass is mainly concentrated around the mainstream of the yr reflecting the evolution of rainfall distribution and surface water pooling during this season the tws amplitudes estimated from sh solution is slightly smaller than the other three solutions fig 5 for july 2020 as an example sh solution derived tws anomalies fig 5a appear smooth and divergent due to filtering and the result of level 3 sh grids fig 5b shows that tws is relatively more gathered on the yb there was clearly good agreement between csr mascon and jpl mascon over the entire basin fig 5c and 5d and both solutions show the larger tws change in amplitude covers almost the entire area of the middle and lower reaches of the yrb this example indicates that the application of regularization parameter to compute tws in csr mascon and of clm derived scaling factors to jpl mascon looks like result in larger ewh and spatial differences relative to sh solution at large basin scale however the time series results since 2008 i e the experimental third stage with the highest water level of tgd at 175 m show that the sh result has an advantage over other three solutions in identifying the tgr water storage process for example in fig 6 grace and grace fo based tws changes in the yrb show a slight long term positive trend fig 6a due to the increase in tgr water storage and other aquifer reserves wang et al 2011 this is clearly different from the negative tws loss in the whole of the north china plain the blue area in fig 5 because of groundwater depletion due to over exploitation by human activities feng et al 2013 the time series except sh red dotted line in fig 6a does not well identify the water mass change caused by the maximum 175 m water level in periodic tgr impoundment during september to december shaded in green in fig 6a and green line in fig 6b in those retaining periods sh based results show a clear peak which was not well reflected in the other three solutions this means that mascon solutions have the potential to reveal gravity signals in areas larger than 3 degree grids from mass sources of tws anomalies but they perform poorer than sh solutions with a decorrelation filter in some smaller specific regions such as narrow tgr zhang et al 2019 the residual results of grace sh after minus the effects of tgr orange dotted line in fig 6b eliminated the long term trend and show a good agreement with phase of gldas noah and seasonal rainfall in this region the large peak to peak in sh result after removed tgr modeling is also verified that the grace derived total tws includes not only the contribution of soil moisture in all layers and artificial lakes i e tgr but also other surface and underground hydrological components e g tributaries and groundwater 3 2 climate driven and human controlled flood evolution in southern china the seasonal variation of tws such as yrb is mainly controlled by atmospheric circulation characterized by a warm rainy summer monsoon from may to september and a cold dry winter monsoon from november to february during the 2020 summer monsoon yrb s p experienced a rapid increase and showed irregular features of frequent processes high intensity long duration and a high overlap of rain areas for example in may the total rainfall in the yrb was approximately 112 mm and the rainfall area greater than 300 mm was mainly located in the two sub basins dongting lake and poyang lake but the abnormal p relative to the average 2000 2019 in the entire basin and sub regions was approximately 10 less than in previous years 13 2 mm in fig 7 a from june to july an extremely heavy plum rain event occurred in the middle lower reaches of the yrb the monthly accumulated p exceeded 200 mm which was 20 to 50 higher than the historical average for the same period 52 8 mm for june 2020 and 104 9 mm for july 2020 shown in fig 7a and the highest recorded since 1961 liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b afterwards the cumulative rainfall in august and september reached 150 mm and both months exceeded the average of the previous two decades 11 3 mm for august 2020 and 61 5 mm for september 2020 shown in fig 7a the results show the anomalous rainfall in august was mainly distributed in the upper reaches of the yrb and extended to north china and then the rain belt moves back to south china in september indicating the ending of the summer monsoon the gldas noah outputs and scaled grace fo sh measurements both showed an increase of tws change since june but there was a significant difference in the intensity of spatio temporal variability of tws anomalies between them the gldas runs its land surface models on generated soil moisture layer total canopy water storage and snow water equivalent fig 7b using observation based and model reanalysis data products therefore it cannot reflect hydrological processes such as surface water and groundwater components directly related to flood changes by contrast as shown in fig 7c measuring gravity anomalies from scaled grace fo sh data 0 5 degree grids showed an abrupt change of total mass in tws across yrb that starts in june and reaches the maximum in july the tws positive anomalies estimated by grace fo and gldas noah indicate that increased heavy rainfall near the yr in the plum rain season caused dozens of rivers and lakes to swell to record levels additionally the scaled sh results based on scaling factors driven by tgr water model reflects the gravity effect caused by the change of this man made lake water mass fig 7 in particular the water mass of the tgr and its surrounding areas the black dotted box in fig 7c has increased significantly due to the combined effects of extreme weather events and the tgd intercepting the flood peak the scaled sh estimated ewh red histogram in fig 7c increased from 43 6 mm in may to 96 3 mm in june and reached its highest value of 373 8 mm in july and remained above 250 mm in august and september by contrast the tgr simulated slightly small ewh red histogram in fig 7d which increased from 47 7 mm in may to 29 8 mm in june and reached its highest value of 158 5 mm in july and then fell to 126 8 mm in august and final decreased to 16 7 in september note that both gldas noah and grace derived tws anomalies are the accumulated values of the total water mass change after removed time mean baseline this indicates that the spatial distribution of tws during the 2020 flood period also showed a trend effect relative to the average values from 2004 to 2010 in summary the tgr plays an important role in affecting tws redistribution in yrb e g tws changes derived from grace measurement are controlled by both seasonal climate driven rainfall and dams retaining and releasing water in the tgr area for the 2020 floods the tgd also gives a positive effect in easing downstream flood risks e g dams block the flow of sediment and reduce the ability of downstream flood plains and wetlands to absorb floodwaters 3 3 two different gravity sensors response to tws changes this study provides a good opportunity to analyze the gravimetry data at different scales for detecting the 2020 extreme rainfall events in china it is very interesting in a comparison between the two selected sensors which means a local gravimetry data was employed in this case and it could be used to validate the ability of grace to detect extreme localized events or to understand various downscaling approaches for grace here we give the gravity response of the 2020 flood events at different types and scales shown in fig 8 including that in situ continuous gravity measured by gphone 101 monthly gravity changes on gphone 101 site measured by grace at satellite altitude and the gravity effects on this location from forward calculated by gldas noah model and tgr water model the comparison result fig 8a display that the ups and downs of the gravity residual signal observed by gphone 101 is very close to the tgr simulation result on the whole season several larger gravity peaks reflect the rapid increase in tgr water mass caused by the interception of the 2020 flood peaks by tgd the grace fo derived and gldas noah modelled gravity changes mainly show smaller step changes it is difficult to identify short term flood peaks due to the limitation of space time resolution 0 5 degree girds and monthly scale but it can be clearly found that the incremental process of gravity signal observed by grace fo during the flood season for short term gravity signals shown in fig 8b the dashed box in fig 8a the sensitivity of the two gravity sensors to regional tws changes is very different during the 40 days heavy rainfall process in this period the maximum gravity difference observed by grace fo was 6 μgal and the gravity difference observed by gphone 101 could reach 16 μgal which can be simply regarded as the superimposed effect of tgr water storage e g 11 μgal of gravity difference shown in green line and the climate induce gldas outputs e g 2 μgal of gravity difference shown in blue line in the surrounding area of gphone station this result shows that ground gravity observation can better reflect local and regional hydrological processes while satellite gravity observation does not have obvious advantages in small scale tws monitoring 3 4 high frequency gravity disturbance of flood discharge in fig 2 gphone 101 has observed strong high frequency gravity disturbance or noise for nearly two months which is several times higher than the background noise in other periods here we show the detailed disturbance characteristic and its relevance driving factors the results indicate that the sudden increase in gravity disturbance is directly related to the opening of tgd for flood discharge fig 9 a and tgd outflow is greater than 31 000 m3 s which can be used as a flood discharge standard i e open multiple dam holes this case lead to the background noise energy sensed by the gphone 101 to be much higher than the quiet non flood season fig 9b and c fig 9d visually shows the relationship between the high frequency gravity disturbance i e upper amplitude envelope and the outflow in the entire 2020 flood season the absolute value of the gravity noise fluctuations is concentrated in the range of 0 7 5 μgal during the quiet period and there is no significant corresponding relationship with the outflow under 31 000 m3 s but there will be an obvious linear relationship between the gravity changes and the outflow greater than 31 000 m3 s which shows that the huge amount of water is discharged through a height difference of nearly 100 m i e fall from 160 m before dam to 60 m after dam during the flood discharge process that causes significant vibration of the water surface and even the bottom of the river in the surrounding area of tgd fluctuations of the local gravitational field as a result of seismic atmospheric displacements and oscillating point masses are typically considered as signals that carry information about processes such as fault ruptures and mass density perturbations harms 2019 previous studies have shown that high frequency disturbances of gravity can be used as an effective precursor signal or co seismic signal when an earthquake occurs lan et al 2011 nawa et al 2009 the gravity fluctuations caused by flood release found in this study intuitively reflect the co seismic gravity fluctuations excited by the vibration of the water body this phenomenon is worthy of further exploration to study the activity of surface landslide and underground faults induced by dam discharge 4 discussions 4 1 regional heavy rainfall and tgd intercepts floods ground gravity measurements were used to monitor the continuous variation of the gravity field due to time varying total hydrogeological effects at a small scale within 100 km van camp et al 2017 the gphone 101 time series removed the geophysics effects and drift revealing the local tws change in the 2020 summer monsoon the results show that the gravity residuals are significantly related to flood events or regional hydrological processes during the flooding season from june to august fig 10 a a gravity time series caused by tgr water level changes based on a high resolution dynamic water storage model was simulated ma et al 2020 the ground based and predicted results fig 8b indicate that the gravity signal in the gphone station clearly reflects the abrupt changes of tgr water capacity caused by the five tgd controlled floods in july and august the peak to peak value of gravity effects reached approximately 15 μgal during floods events one to three and approximately 10 μgal during the fourth and fifth floods in addition the fluctuation amplitude of gphone 101 residuals is slightly greater than the simulated result only when considering the contribution from tgr model this difference reflects the fact that gphone 101 observed data covering other hydrological contributions except for man made engineering due to the heavy rainfall during the flood season for example the gphone 101 residuals g2 minus the tgr derived predictions g1 displayed an increasing trend correlated to the continuous rain beginning in june and then it eased at the end of july and increased again in mid august fig 9b the remaining gravity change g3 is highly consistent with a climate driven water balance from the total value of effective p ptot in fig 10c i e the g3 in response to ptot increases rapidly during rainfall and decreases linearly after rainfall as observed and predicted in previous studies kazama okubo 2009 harnisch harnisch 2006 therefore the relationship between flood peaks and rainfall shows that the heavy rainfall process in the upstream caused the formation of flood peaks for example the response of the tgd block flood peaks to rainfall is gradual representing a time lag 2 3 days between upstream rainfall e g yrb daily rainfall upstream of tgd in fig 9a daily rainfall observed at wanzhou and fengjie in fig 9b and rivers recharge e g flood numbers two and three these hydrological disturbances were recorded by gphone 101 observations 4 2 tws mass loading sensitivity at ground and satellite gravity scales the above analysis demonstrates that ground based gphone and satellite based grace measurements of gravity changes are sensitive to local and reginal tws mass loading at different scales it is very necessary to further quantify spatial resolution of in situ and space measurements based on the elastic loading theory described by farrell 1972 in this case the green s functions are formed for the surface mass load boundary value problem the gravity accelerations at the earth s surface caused by static water load can be obtained by evaluating a convolution integral over the loaded region here we evaluate the difference upper degree limit i e lmax vs lmax 60 of the loading green s function for gphone 101 stations to illustrate how sensitive the ground based gravity measurement is to the mass loading at different spatial resolution then we calculate the gravity response caused by the mass loading signal corresponding to a 1 meter water thickness spread over 1000 km2 the results of gphone 101 points are shown in fig 11 a and 11b the elastic gravity changes at local scales i e exact upper limit lmax and at regional scales i e upper limit lmax 60 indicate that gphone and grace estimates are in different sensitivity they provide a weighted average of the mass loss across a load area in different sensitivity ranges where the weighting is determined by the load green s function and is not uniform across the drainage basin wahr et al 2013 the magenta solid curve in fig 11a and b represents gravity response of profile pp passing through the center of anomaly i e gphone 101 location which means that the grace sensitivity kernel upper limit lmax 60 is wider than the gphone kernel upper limit lmax these results confirmed that the resolution of the ground based gravity data cannot detect the source of the tws mass change 50 km away fig 11a by contrast the grace solution estimated concentrated loads are significantly smoothed and attenuated within a few hundred kilometers fig 11b which makes it very difficult to identify local tws mass changes especially in tgr area the difference between the grace and gphone observed gravity effects caused by tws change depend on location of the gphone station because the gphone based gravity changes are primarily related to the change of tgr storage capacity which is mainly controlled by man made tgd for example the modelled gravitational effects increased nearly a few hundred microgals around tgr bank with the rising water level from 145 m to 175 m fig 11c and d show that the gravitational effects of tgr water storage are affected by bank distance and height difference between water level and calculation point e g the gravitational effects on the profile aa indicate that high gravity change appear near the tgr and signal intensity decay rapidly with distance from the reservoir bank increasing by several kilometers results show that the small sensitivity kernels of ground based gravity measurements are primarily affected by local contributions from catchment areas reservoirs lakes and groundwater rather than by changes in water mass in areas dozens of kilometers away 4 3 multiple climate drivers of 2020 flood on yrb for mechanisms of climate variability modes on flood events in china especially in the yrb most previous studies have focused on the links between enso indices e g oni and water abundance indices e g heavy p and high river discharge some researchers have tried to investigate the variability of floods triggered by other climate variability indices such as pacific decadal oscillation pdo north atlantic oscillation arctic oscillation nao ao indian ocean dipole iod and atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo a review of these can be found in kundzewicz et al 2020 this summary of the literature identified enso as the leading driver of large individual flood events in yrb the existing study shows that nao was responsible for the unexpected extreme plum rain event in 2020 because neither a significant enso nor a super el niño event occurred in this year liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b the nao is a hemispheric meridional oscillation in atmospheric mass with centers near iceland and over the subtropical atlantic visbeck et al 2001 the low frequency climate oscillations are usually coupled with ocean atmosphere phenomenon like enso zhang et al 2019 another finding is that tropical indo pacific large scale thermal condition i e indian ocean basin warming iobw provided favorable conditions for rainfall surpluses over the plum rain belt via the western north pacific anticyclone zhang et al 2021 also roles of tp vortices in the record plum rain are revealed local major rainfall triggers for influencing the rainfall in yangtze huaihe river basin li et al 2021 in this study we tried to analyze the possible driving factors of this 2020 flood from multiple climate indicators including that sst i e oni and iobw and wind anomalies in the indian and pacific oceans and the condition of snow cover in the previous winter on the tp at the source of the yrb fig 12 since november 2019 the central and eastern pacific has entered and maintained a weak el niño event has formally formed at the same time the abnormally warmer sst in the north indian ocean this year has further strengthened the subtropical high in the western pacific fig 12a and c this anomalous sst rise is conducive to the transmission of more water vapor from the ocean to the land via the wind evaporation sst feedback wang et al 2000 resulting in a much higher snowfall in the winter of 2019 than in previous years fig 12a and d in 2020 summer the negative la niña and the positive iobw are produced at the same time accelerating the speed of the atmospheric circulation fig 12b and c the south china sea summer monsoon occurred earlier and the ridgeline of the subtropical high in june was shifted to the north leading to the early arrival of the plum rain in the middle and lower reaches of yrb in addition the western pacific subtropical high has been significantly stronger and maintained stably the meridional circulation in mid high latitudes in asia has developed and the short wave troughs in the westerly belt are frequent which eventually led to the higher precipitation during the plum rain period fig 12b and e moreover fig 12c shows the relationship between the inter annual variation in oni values and the io sst anomalies between 2010 and 2020 a rapid shift of niño 3 4 sst iobw sst mature phases between positive el niño iobw and negative la niña iobw episodes are often associated with higher peaks of the annual p e g the peaks in 2016 and 2020 this transition period of an sst anomalies event from the mature stage to the decaying stage which is consistent with the abnormal annual rainfall cycle fig 12e it is also interesting to note that flood seasons are usually at the midline neutral phase of these rapidly changing years from the warming phase to the cooling phase with one year fig 4c indeed the positive phase before the 2020 summer monsoon is not as high as the previous flood event years but it has been at a positive value for one to two years the mechanism of climate variability effects on the 2020 flood in yrb can be explained by the conversion process of the walker circulation lau yang 2003 for example during the high speed transition of el niño conditions to la niña in the enso cycle a decreasing sst in the tropical west pacific and decreasing convection around the philippines results in the west pacific subtropical high moving southward the rising moist air from southeast asia and the south china sea resulting from the asian summer monsoon merges with moisture from the tropical west pacific and the westerlies yihui chan 2005 turner annamalai 2012 these factors will eventually lead to severe and long lasting rainfall in the yrb coupled with the melting of a large amount of snow in the tp in the previous year triggering flooding in the yrb 5 conclusions determining the solid earth s gravity response to changes in water mass and other types of surface load is considerable interest recently because of the information it provides about modern climate cycles and climate change few previous studies have assessed the capabilities of two sources of gravity measurements in capturing the rapid spatiotemporal water mass changes especially those related to floods this study presents multiscale gravity measurements to characterize flood events and their spatio temporal evolution both in the yrb and the tgr hydrological forcing data e g in situ weather records satellite remote sensing based tgr model and tgd water level and flow records were used successfully to calculate the scaling factors to downscale grace grace fo monthly solutions and to simulate gravity effect due to the migration of surface water mass which includes details of regional tws changes due to climate cycles and human activities the scaled grace fo based total tws information allows an assessment of the water abundance indices e g heavy p and high river discharge and severe floods during summer monsoon the gphone 101 time series that removed the geophysics effects and drift combined with prediction results of based on the tgr model demonstrates that local scale estimates of water storage derived from ground based gravity observations can be used to identify regional flood processes such as magnitude peaks and trends the gphone 101 has identified high frequency and high amplitude gravitational disturbances induced by fluctuations in water releasing caused by tgd flood discharge applying sst anomalies data known as oni and iobw in the niño 3 4 and io region this study shows the relationships between the rapid shift of enso iobw phases and flood events in yrb the results indicated that 2020 floods in the southern china especially the floods in the middle and lower reaches of the yr are the result of the combined effects of the west pacific subtropical high the westerly zone snow cover on the tp and global climate anomalies the climate oscillation patterns that trigger the water abundance index or flood events are often non single complex and interrelated therefore it is difficult to build a general recognized association that can explain a single flood event kundzewicz et al 2020 this study can benefit a wide range of hydrological applications of gravity measurements with the latest grace fo satellite mission and the high spatio temporal resolution and high precision surface gravity the combination of these two gravity solutions will provide greater insights into measuring extreme climate events at small scale region for example it will be very interesting in a comparison between the two selected sensors in future work that is a local gravimetry data could be used to validate the ability of grace to detect extreme localized events or to understand various downscaling approaches for grace credit

3890,in 2020 summer excessive rainfall pushed rivers and lakes to record high levels over the yangtze river basin yrb but the five flood peaks were absorbed by the three gorges reservoir tgr mass migration in hydrological processes usually causes the earth s gravity response wherefore the 2020 flood events provide a good opportunity to assess the capabilities of gravity measurements in capturing the water mass changes at different scales in this study we presents two common gravity measurements i e the satellite mission grace fo and the ground gphone used to characterize the evolution of regional floods at a basin and local scale which can be attributed to east asian rainy season commonly called plum rain event i e extreme climate induced effects of the regional water balance and floodwater absorbed by the reservoir i e the man made three gorges dam tgd intercepting flood peaks the terrestrial water storage tws estimated by grace fo shows a significant positive anomaly e g 370 mm in july and august in around the tgr the gphone measured gravity residual of 10 20 µgal between may and september the results further suggest that grace observation does not have obvious advantages in small scale tws monitoring but gphone records is difficult to detect the source of the tws mass change 50 km away in particular gphone recorded the high frequency gravity disturbance directly related to the high outflow i e 31 000 m3 s of tgd flood discharge which is likely used as precursor or co seismic signal to further study the activity of surface landslide and underground faults induced by the vibration or noise source of the water body this study shows that the combination of multiscale gravity solutions can potentially detect a wide range of extreme climate events triggered by atmospheric circulation patterns like el niño southern oscillation and indian ocean basin warming accompanied by sea surface temperature sst and wind anomalies keywords space grace mission ground gphone gravimeter 2020 china floods tws anomalies gravity response 1 introduction floods are the most frequent natural disaster cred unisdr 2020 these extreme weather related hydrological events are usually caused by heavy rainfall rapid snowmelt or a storm surge reager et al 2014 the intensity and frequency of floods are increasing dottori et al 2018 due to the impact of human activities e g changes in land use and waterway courses and environmental issues e g climate change and sea level rise gao et al 2018 jongman et al 2018 china has been frequently plagued by destructive deluges with several large floods triggered by the east asian rainy season commonly called plum rain causing damage to human life and infrastructure in the past three decades kundzewicz et al 2020 therefore the evolution and prediction of flood events are crucial to understand the extreme climate cycle and the monitoring of this hydrological process based on multidimensional data has become one of the most important methods of the water resources management and dispatch in china ding et al 2020 liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b in early june 2020 a record breaking plum rain events occurred in the middle lower reaches of the yangtze river yr leading to severe floods that affected large areas of southern china including the yangtze river basin yrb and its tributaries liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b the rains and floods extended to central and eastern china between july and august and have been described as the worst flood since 1998 wei et al 2020 previous studies have noted a limitation e g real time monitoring of water migration in a large area to conventional observations for all hydrological parameters associated with regional floods reager et al 2014 famiglietti and rodell 2013 chen et al 2010 including precipitation p evapotranspiration e and surface runoff r or the related mass of water storage on the land surface and in the subsurface i e soil moisture snow and ice groundwater water stored in the vegetation rivers lakes and reservoirs flood events represent a typical short term abnormal hydrological process which means these flowing water cause significant regional mass redistribution and then causing changes in the gravity field gravity variations from space to the ground measured by gravity recovery and climate experiment and its follow on grace grace fo satellites and continuous in situ gravimeters can be used to determine terrestrial water storage tws at different scales wahr et al 1998 previous studies have confirmed that grace based estimates of tws anomalies can be used to characterize large scale flood potential getirana et al 2017 molodtsova et al 2016 reager and famiglietti 2009 crowley et al 2006 but coarse temporal monthly and spatial 300 km resolutions of grace data make it unsuitable for monitoring local high intensity events such as changes in reservoir capacity and flood peaks the construction of dams is not only for the purpose of flood control and the mitigation of flood risks in downstream communities and ecosystems but also for water storage or power generation lempérière 2017 the three gorges dam tgd the biggest and most important large scale water conservancy project on the yr fig 1 a was crucial in the response to the catastrophic 2020 flooding wei et al 2020 generally the water level of three gorges reservoir tgr behind the tgd is perennially operating in periodic fluctuation fig 1b between 145 m and 175 m to ensure there is sufficient storage capacity to control floods and for meeting the power generation requirements wang et al 2014a wang et al 2014b during the summer of 2020 the water level in front of the dam fluctuated by 160 m and the maximum flood level exceeded the average water level of the previous five summer seasons by nearly 10 m fig 1b the tgd withstood five upstream floods within six weeks see inflow of tgr in fig 1c in this case the accumulation and release of the tgr water mass will inevitably cause a significant local gravity response wang et al 2014a wang et al 2014b this study aims to investigate tws anomalies caused by the 2020 china floods that occur in the yr and the surrounding areas using satellite based and ground based gravity measurements it is a focus of hydrological research for an important reason in order to infer hydrological processes or land water mass migration from gravity measurements we must decompose observed gravity effects into their water mass and other types of surface load components one of the key problems of modelling the gravity response to changing water mass is characterizing these loading fields with sufficient resolution in space and in time grace and its follow on have had a revolutionary impact on the study of environmental mass fluxes but it provides a band limited representation of near surface mass changes this is particularly problematic when studying mass changes in rivers or lakes because these mass changes tend to be concentrated in fairly narrow or small disc areas but in situ gravity measurements are appropriate for investigating local hydrological effects in this case we provide a good opportunity to analyze the gravimetry data at different scales tws change in the yrb from may to september will be estimated based on grace fo solutions and regional downscaling factors that consider the tgr water model driven by human changes in surface gphone gravity located near the tgd fig 1a will be identified to determine the extent and intensity in the short term i e high frequency disturbance from second to hour scale and long term i e low frequency response from days to month scale period of the 2020 floodwater intercepted by the artificial dam and the possible climate drivers behind this abnormal flood season will also be discussed e g the relationship between the 2020 flood in the yrb and climate variability induced by sea surface temperature sst and wind anomalies in the pacific and indian oceans etc 2 materials 2 1 study area the yangtze known as chang jiang means long river in china is the longest river i e 6380 km in the world that flows entirely through a country the yrb plays an important role in the history culture and economy of china because of its large area 20 of the land area of china in addition the yrb is greatly influenced by human activities and climate for example nearly 53 of large artificial reservoirs in china have been established in the yrb since 2000 wang et al 2020 which means that previous works concentrated on studying the terrestrial water balance of the entire river basin and how climate and anthropogenic activities affected this balance lv et al 2017 the tgr located in the middle and upper reaches of the yrb is one of the largest hydroelectric reservoirs in the world the tgd is a gravity dam that spans the yr near the town of sandouping yichang in hubei province the total storage capacity of the tgr reaches 39 3 km3 and the flood prevention storage capacity is 22 15 km3 which can reduce peak flood flow by 27 000 m3 s 33 000 m3 s when water is stored the water level in the tgr can reach 175 m the reservoir s function to effectively control floods in the upper reaches of the yr make it the most significant water conservancy project in the world 2 2 grace grace fo and gphone the grace grace fo rl06 spherical harmonic sh coefficients stokes coefficients used in this study were provided by the center for space research university of texas austin usa these stokes maximum degree order 96 i e lmax 96 devaraju sneeuw 2015 were processed and then converted to the grids based on general post processing steps e g replacement of c20 coefficients cheng et al 2013 and degree 1 coefficient swenson et al 2008 corrected glacial isostatic adjustment a et al 2013 destriping p4m6 filter and gaussian filtering with a radius of 500 km we also used jpl rl06 version 2 mascon solutions wiese et al 2016 with jpl m sf downscaled to 0 5 degree grid cells and without a scaling factor jpl m 3 degree equal area caps to compare the results of sh data and highlight their ability to recognize climate and human driven tws changes all selected data were anomalies relative to the 2004 0 2009 999 time mean baseline note that the processing of sh and mascon is the same except that filtering is used in sh data but mascon approach applies constraints or regularization during processing to improve all parameters in the final products scanlon et al 2016 the continuous surface gravity data in this study were collected by a gphone spring gravimeter gphone 101 micro g lacoste inc in co usa with a resolution of 0 1 µgal and accuracy of 1 µgal which was installed at a station see fig 1a approximately 4 km from the tgd since 2015 the post processing steps of gphone 101 raw data are as follows the details for processing strategies and geophysical correction methods see supplementary information 1 resampling i e from seconds to minutes or a wider sampling interval and manual correction i e clear up spikes small gaps steps and earthquake induced large amplitudes 2 geophysical corrections e g solid and ocean tides atmospheric pressure and polar motion etc 3 instrument drift modelling and correction using piecewise fitting based on first order polynomial 4 gravity residual selection from may 2020 to september 2020 it is worth noting that the gphone 101 used in this study had been continuously observed for more than five years and its drift basically reached a stable linear change during the 2020 flood period for gphone 101 data preprocessing and correction results fig 2 the final gravity residual gres after removed drift fitting result is decomposed into high frequency gravity disturbances gres 1 with minute sampling and the low frequency gravity changes gres 2 with hour sampling 2 3 hydrometeorological forcing in this study four types of hydrometeorological data sets see appendix table a1 for the data sources were collected to determine flood characteristics tws anomalies and climate driven mechanisms first the monthly gridded p data rainfall amount during january 1961 to october 2020 was used to evaluate tws anomalies and its spatio temporal evolution in the yrb this data set is based on the latest p data of 2472 stations on the ground in china and used the thin plate spline method to perform spatial interpolation to generate monthly 0 5 degree grids but it cannot reflect the short term i e a few days rainfall changes in local areas i e dozens of kilometers here the daily p and e data of three weather stations around the tgr area the locations shown in fig 1a were selected to check the gravity response of tws changes during the 2020 flood period besides the monthly 0 25 degree gridded and daily snow depth in tibet plateau tp the birthplace of the yr were used to assess the relationship between the 2020 flood and the previous winter s snow cover on upstream second the hydrological information fig 1b and 1c of the tgr during 2013 to 2020 including water level inflow and outflow was used to analyze hydrological phenomena and to simulate gravity effects due to tgr storage capacity change here we also used the gf 1 satellite images and the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem data to characterize the contours of the tgr model due to water level changes the details can be found in ma et al 2020 and not described again in this study third the land surface models global land data assimilation system noah version gldas noah data sources in appendix table a1 were used to assist gravity solutions in monitoring an extreme flood event here the updated gldas in a timely manner was used to generate optimal fields of land surface states rodell et al 2004 and selected gldas noah 2 1 output including 1 degree resolution and 1948 present simulations of tws e g soil moisture and snow can be used to evaluate grace fo s potential to monitor 2020 floods finally important climate phenomena were investigated i e enso and irregular periodic variations in winds and sea surface temperatures sst over the tropical indian and pacific oceans mcphaden et al 2006 in this case the oceanic niño index oni was used a measure of the enso that tracks sst in the niño 3 4 region of the east central tropical pacific kundzewicz et al 2020 to evaluate the impact of ocean atmosphere system fluctuation in the yrb region a remarkable indian ocean basin warming iobw can be detected over the indian ocean io similar to the conventional io sst response to el niño events or el niño transition to a la niña like zhang et al 2021 2 4 tgr model and its gravitational effect simulation the tgr model constructed in this study mainly considers the main channel and its tributary of the yr based on tgr boundary controlled by gf 1 images and water height determined by strm elevation the water body load distribution is discretized to water boundaries 31 in total from 145 m to 175 m at different impounding water levels see covered area in fig 2 this model with the resolution of 8 m and 1 m in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively is an intuitive way to describe the dynamic characteristics of water mass changes in the impounding and releasing water process regulated by tgd in 2020 flood season red dotted in fig 2 next we simulated tgr water loads induced gravitational effects on gphone 101 site based on the high resolution forward modeling of discretized dynamic water model i e considering changes of water covered area and water level at 8 m and 1 m scale in general the gravitational effects of tgr water storage are mainly affected by the distance of the reservoir bank and the relative elevation difference between the calculation points and water level surface this case leads to a tendency for high gravitational effects to appear near the tgr compared with the simulation results of the previous simple model e g gravitational effects on ground and on space shown in fig 2 from wang et al 2016 for gphone 101 location 4 km away from the tgd its modeled gravitational effect of 30 meter tgr water mass changes i e from 145 m to 175 m can reach nearly 20 μgal and the maximum gravity change in the 2020 flood season can up to about 15 μgal which is recognized by gphone within the accuracy range of the instrument 2 5 downscaled grace grace fo to estimate catchment scale water many previous applications using grace data require estimates of mass changes for specific regions or even an area smaller than the grace resolution 300 km e g ice regions river basins and catchment areas etc these cases can be better addressed by constructing specific averaging functions velicogna wahr 2006a 2006b or restore the signal loss methods e g the scaling factor method by landerer and swenson 2012 forward modeling by chen et al 2015 the data driven approach by vishwakarma et al 2017 optimized for those regions recently the jpl mascon set of 0 5 degree gain factors similar to landerer and swenson 2012 derived by a least squares fit to the clm hydrology model and the grace original data can be applied to the data over land but these grid scales are not reliable at man made tgr area because of climate induced hydrology model can not reflect tws changes affected by human factors scanlon et al 2019 other downscaling methods depending on model assumptions and size of the study area are difficult to effectively solve signal leakage in narrow and slender rivers such as yb or tgr this is the method we used to model the tgr signal present in the grace data to explain attenuated surface mass variations due to sampling and post processing used in sh data and also to consider the impacts of human factors such as tgr water storage changes at small spatial scales the downscaled results were calculated as the restored grace estimated tws anomalies the downscaling process is as follows 1 we computed the sh stokes coefficients caused by a 1 m water in tgr height based on 8 m grids of constructed tgr model which spanned the entire length of the reservoir 2 we truncated those stokes coefficients to maximum degree and order 360 that represents a 1 m water increase in tgr at 0 5 degree scale 3 then we processed this original data with the same post processing as the grace data e g truncated to lmax 96 and applied destriping p4m6 filter and gaussian filtering with a 500 km radius 4 then the gain factors 0 5 degree grids were calculated by the least squares fit between 1 spatial domain grids lmax 360 and 3 spatial domain grids lmax 96 finally the sh based tws grid cell is multiplied by scale factors from step 4 and then the rescaled mass change for all grid cells is spatially averaged to obtain the total tgr mass change for a detailed comparison of these scale factors from this study and from clm model please see fig 4 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal variability of tws anomalies estimated by grace fo solutions the grace derived signals with significant spatio temporal characteristics are related to water storage variability in the yrb fig 5 shows monthly tws anomalies estimated by four grace fo solutions from may 2020 to september 2020 overall these results consistently display the process of tws migration caused by heavy rainfall in the 2020 flood season since june the equivalent water height ewh in mm unit in the middle and lower reaches of the yrb has been significantly higher than in previous years especially between july and september the water mass is mainly concentrated around the mainstream of the yr reflecting the evolution of rainfall distribution and surface water pooling during this season the tws amplitudes estimated from sh solution is slightly smaller than the other three solutions fig 5 for july 2020 as an example sh solution derived tws anomalies fig 5a appear smooth and divergent due to filtering and the result of level 3 sh grids fig 5b shows that tws is relatively more gathered on the yb there was clearly good agreement between csr mascon and jpl mascon over the entire basin fig 5c and 5d and both solutions show the larger tws change in amplitude covers almost the entire area of the middle and lower reaches of the yrb this example indicates that the application of regularization parameter to compute tws in csr mascon and of clm derived scaling factors to jpl mascon looks like result in larger ewh and spatial differences relative to sh solution at large basin scale however the time series results since 2008 i e the experimental third stage with the highest water level of tgd at 175 m show that the sh result has an advantage over other three solutions in identifying the tgr water storage process for example in fig 6 grace and grace fo based tws changes in the yrb show a slight long term positive trend fig 6a due to the increase in tgr water storage and other aquifer reserves wang et al 2011 this is clearly different from the negative tws loss in the whole of the north china plain the blue area in fig 5 because of groundwater depletion due to over exploitation by human activities feng et al 2013 the time series except sh red dotted line in fig 6a does not well identify the water mass change caused by the maximum 175 m water level in periodic tgr impoundment during september to december shaded in green in fig 6a and green line in fig 6b in those retaining periods sh based results show a clear peak which was not well reflected in the other three solutions this means that mascon solutions have the potential to reveal gravity signals in areas larger than 3 degree grids from mass sources of tws anomalies but they perform poorer than sh solutions with a decorrelation filter in some smaller specific regions such as narrow tgr zhang et al 2019 the residual results of grace sh after minus the effects of tgr orange dotted line in fig 6b eliminated the long term trend and show a good agreement with phase of gldas noah and seasonal rainfall in this region the large peak to peak in sh result after removed tgr modeling is also verified that the grace derived total tws includes not only the contribution of soil moisture in all layers and artificial lakes i e tgr but also other surface and underground hydrological components e g tributaries and groundwater 3 2 climate driven and human controlled flood evolution in southern china the seasonal variation of tws such as yrb is mainly controlled by atmospheric circulation characterized by a warm rainy summer monsoon from may to september and a cold dry winter monsoon from november to february during the 2020 summer monsoon yrb s p experienced a rapid increase and showed irregular features of frequent processes high intensity long duration and a high overlap of rain areas for example in may the total rainfall in the yrb was approximately 112 mm and the rainfall area greater than 300 mm was mainly located in the two sub basins dongting lake and poyang lake but the abnormal p relative to the average 2000 2019 in the entire basin and sub regions was approximately 10 less than in previous years 13 2 mm in fig 7 a from june to july an extremely heavy plum rain event occurred in the middle lower reaches of the yrb the monthly accumulated p exceeded 200 mm which was 20 to 50 higher than the historical average for the same period 52 8 mm for june 2020 and 104 9 mm for july 2020 shown in fig 7a and the highest recorded since 1961 liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b afterwards the cumulative rainfall in august and september reached 150 mm and both months exceeded the average of the previous two decades 11 3 mm for august 2020 and 61 5 mm for september 2020 shown in fig 7a the results show the anomalous rainfall in august was mainly distributed in the upper reaches of the yrb and extended to north china and then the rain belt moves back to south china in september indicating the ending of the summer monsoon the gldas noah outputs and scaled grace fo sh measurements both showed an increase of tws change since june but there was a significant difference in the intensity of spatio temporal variability of tws anomalies between them the gldas runs its land surface models on generated soil moisture layer total canopy water storage and snow water equivalent fig 7b using observation based and model reanalysis data products therefore it cannot reflect hydrological processes such as surface water and groundwater components directly related to flood changes by contrast as shown in fig 7c measuring gravity anomalies from scaled grace fo sh data 0 5 degree grids showed an abrupt change of total mass in tws across yrb that starts in june and reaches the maximum in july the tws positive anomalies estimated by grace fo and gldas noah indicate that increased heavy rainfall near the yr in the plum rain season caused dozens of rivers and lakes to swell to record levels additionally the scaled sh results based on scaling factors driven by tgr water model reflects the gravity effect caused by the change of this man made lake water mass fig 7 in particular the water mass of the tgr and its surrounding areas the black dotted box in fig 7c has increased significantly due to the combined effects of extreme weather events and the tgd intercepting the flood peak the scaled sh estimated ewh red histogram in fig 7c increased from 43 6 mm in may to 96 3 mm in june and reached its highest value of 373 8 mm in july and remained above 250 mm in august and september by contrast the tgr simulated slightly small ewh red histogram in fig 7d which increased from 47 7 mm in may to 29 8 mm in june and reached its highest value of 158 5 mm in july and then fell to 126 8 mm in august and final decreased to 16 7 in september note that both gldas noah and grace derived tws anomalies are the accumulated values of the total water mass change after removed time mean baseline this indicates that the spatial distribution of tws during the 2020 flood period also showed a trend effect relative to the average values from 2004 to 2010 in summary the tgr plays an important role in affecting tws redistribution in yrb e g tws changes derived from grace measurement are controlled by both seasonal climate driven rainfall and dams retaining and releasing water in the tgr area for the 2020 floods the tgd also gives a positive effect in easing downstream flood risks e g dams block the flow of sediment and reduce the ability of downstream flood plains and wetlands to absorb floodwaters 3 3 two different gravity sensors response to tws changes this study provides a good opportunity to analyze the gravimetry data at different scales for detecting the 2020 extreme rainfall events in china it is very interesting in a comparison between the two selected sensors which means a local gravimetry data was employed in this case and it could be used to validate the ability of grace to detect extreme localized events or to understand various downscaling approaches for grace here we give the gravity response of the 2020 flood events at different types and scales shown in fig 8 including that in situ continuous gravity measured by gphone 101 monthly gravity changes on gphone 101 site measured by grace at satellite altitude and the gravity effects on this location from forward calculated by gldas noah model and tgr water model the comparison result fig 8a display that the ups and downs of the gravity residual signal observed by gphone 101 is very close to the tgr simulation result on the whole season several larger gravity peaks reflect the rapid increase in tgr water mass caused by the interception of the 2020 flood peaks by tgd the grace fo derived and gldas noah modelled gravity changes mainly show smaller step changes it is difficult to identify short term flood peaks due to the limitation of space time resolution 0 5 degree girds and monthly scale but it can be clearly found that the incremental process of gravity signal observed by grace fo during the flood season for short term gravity signals shown in fig 8b the dashed box in fig 8a the sensitivity of the two gravity sensors to regional tws changes is very different during the 40 days heavy rainfall process in this period the maximum gravity difference observed by grace fo was 6 μgal and the gravity difference observed by gphone 101 could reach 16 μgal which can be simply regarded as the superimposed effect of tgr water storage e g 11 μgal of gravity difference shown in green line and the climate induce gldas outputs e g 2 μgal of gravity difference shown in blue line in the surrounding area of gphone station this result shows that ground gravity observation can better reflect local and regional hydrological processes while satellite gravity observation does not have obvious advantages in small scale tws monitoring 3 4 high frequency gravity disturbance of flood discharge in fig 2 gphone 101 has observed strong high frequency gravity disturbance or noise for nearly two months which is several times higher than the background noise in other periods here we show the detailed disturbance characteristic and its relevance driving factors the results indicate that the sudden increase in gravity disturbance is directly related to the opening of tgd for flood discharge fig 9 a and tgd outflow is greater than 31 000 m3 s which can be used as a flood discharge standard i e open multiple dam holes this case lead to the background noise energy sensed by the gphone 101 to be much higher than the quiet non flood season fig 9b and c fig 9d visually shows the relationship between the high frequency gravity disturbance i e upper amplitude envelope and the outflow in the entire 2020 flood season the absolute value of the gravity noise fluctuations is concentrated in the range of 0 7 5 μgal during the quiet period and there is no significant corresponding relationship with the outflow under 31 000 m3 s but there will be an obvious linear relationship between the gravity changes and the outflow greater than 31 000 m3 s which shows that the huge amount of water is discharged through a height difference of nearly 100 m i e fall from 160 m before dam to 60 m after dam during the flood discharge process that causes significant vibration of the water surface and even the bottom of the river in the surrounding area of tgd fluctuations of the local gravitational field as a result of seismic atmospheric displacements and oscillating point masses are typically considered as signals that carry information about processes such as fault ruptures and mass density perturbations harms 2019 previous studies have shown that high frequency disturbances of gravity can be used as an effective precursor signal or co seismic signal when an earthquake occurs lan et al 2011 nawa et al 2009 the gravity fluctuations caused by flood release found in this study intuitively reflect the co seismic gravity fluctuations excited by the vibration of the water body this phenomenon is worthy of further exploration to study the activity of surface landslide and underground faults induced by dam discharge 4 discussions 4 1 regional heavy rainfall and tgd intercepts floods ground gravity measurements were used to monitor the continuous variation of the gravity field due to time varying total hydrogeological effects at a small scale within 100 km van camp et al 2017 the gphone 101 time series removed the geophysics effects and drift revealing the local tws change in the 2020 summer monsoon the results show that the gravity residuals are significantly related to flood events or regional hydrological processes during the flooding season from june to august fig 10 a a gravity time series caused by tgr water level changes based on a high resolution dynamic water storage model was simulated ma et al 2020 the ground based and predicted results fig 8b indicate that the gravity signal in the gphone station clearly reflects the abrupt changes of tgr water capacity caused by the five tgd controlled floods in july and august the peak to peak value of gravity effects reached approximately 15 μgal during floods events one to three and approximately 10 μgal during the fourth and fifth floods in addition the fluctuation amplitude of gphone 101 residuals is slightly greater than the simulated result only when considering the contribution from tgr model this difference reflects the fact that gphone 101 observed data covering other hydrological contributions except for man made engineering due to the heavy rainfall during the flood season for example the gphone 101 residuals g2 minus the tgr derived predictions g1 displayed an increasing trend correlated to the continuous rain beginning in june and then it eased at the end of july and increased again in mid august fig 9b the remaining gravity change g3 is highly consistent with a climate driven water balance from the total value of effective p ptot in fig 10c i e the g3 in response to ptot increases rapidly during rainfall and decreases linearly after rainfall as observed and predicted in previous studies kazama okubo 2009 harnisch harnisch 2006 therefore the relationship between flood peaks and rainfall shows that the heavy rainfall process in the upstream caused the formation of flood peaks for example the response of the tgd block flood peaks to rainfall is gradual representing a time lag 2 3 days between upstream rainfall e g yrb daily rainfall upstream of tgd in fig 9a daily rainfall observed at wanzhou and fengjie in fig 9b and rivers recharge e g flood numbers two and three these hydrological disturbances were recorded by gphone 101 observations 4 2 tws mass loading sensitivity at ground and satellite gravity scales the above analysis demonstrates that ground based gphone and satellite based grace measurements of gravity changes are sensitive to local and reginal tws mass loading at different scales it is very necessary to further quantify spatial resolution of in situ and space measurements based on the elastic loading theory described by farrell 1972 in this case the green s functions are formed for the surface mass load boundary value problem the gravity accelerations at the earth s surface caused by static water load can be obtained by evaluating a convolution integral over the loaded region here we evaluate the difference upper degree limit i e lmax vs lmax 60 of the loading green s function for gphone 101 stations to illustrate how sensitive the ground based gravity measurement is to the mass loading at different spatial resolution then we calculate the gravity response caused by the mass loading signal corresponding to a 1 meter water thickness spread over 1000 km2 the results of gphone 101 points are shown in fig 11 a and 11b the elastic gravity changes at local scales i e exact upper limit lmax and at regional scales i e upper limit lmax 60 indicate that gphone and grace estimates are in different sensitivity they provide a weighted average of the mass loss across a load area in different sensitivity ranges where the weighting is determined by the load green s function and is not uniform across the drainage basin wahr et al 2013 the magenta solid curve in fig 11a and b represents gravity response of profile pp passing through the center of anomaly i e gphone 101 location which means that the grace sensitivity kernel upper limit lmax 60 is wider than the gphone kernel upper limit lmax these results confirmed that the resolution of the ground based gravity data cannot detect the source of the tws mass change 50 km away fig 11a by contrast the grace solution estimated concentrated loads are significantly smoothed and attenuated within a few hundred kilometers fig 11b which makes it very difficult to identify local tws mass changes especially in tgr area the difference between the grace and gphone observed gravity effects caused by tws change depend on location of the gphone station because the gphone based gravity changes are primarily related to the change of tgr storage capacity which is mainly controlled by man made tgd for example the modelled gravitational effects increased nearly a few hundred microgals around tgr bank with the rising water level from 145 m to 175 m fig 11c and d show that the gravitational effects of tgr water storage are affected by bank distance and height difference between water level and calculation point e g the gravitational effects on the profile aa indicate that high gravity change appear near the tgr and signal intensity decay rapidly with distance from the reservoir bank increasing by several kilometers results show that the small sensitivity kernels of ground based gravity measurements are primarily affected by local contributions from catchment areas reservoirs lakes and groundwater rather than by changes in water mass in areas dozens of kilometers away 4 3 multiple climate drivers of 2020 flood on yrb for mechanisms of climate variability modes on flood events in china especially in the yrb most previous studies have focused on the links between enso indices e g oni and water abundance indices e g heavy p and high river discharge some researchers have tried to investigate the variability of floods triggered by other climate variability indices such as pacific decadal oscillation pdo north atlantic oscillation arctic oscillation nao ao indian ocean dipole iod and atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo a review of these can be found in kundzewicz et al 2020 this summary of the literature identified enso as the leading driver of large individual flood events in yrb the existing study shows that nao was responsible for the unexpected extreme plum rain event in 2020 because neither a significant enso nor a super el niño event occurred in this year liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b the nao is a hemispheric meridional oscillation in atmospheric mass with centers near iceland and over the subtropical atlantic visbeck et al 2001 the low frequency climate oscillations are usually coupled with ocean atmosphere phenomenon like enso zhang et al 2019 another finding is that tropical indo pacific large scale thermal condition i e indian ocean basin warming iobw provided favorable conditions for rainfall surpluses over the plum rain belt via the western north pacific anticyclone zhang et al 2021 also roles of tp vortices in the record plum rain are revealed local major rainfall triggers for influencing the rainfall in yangtze huaihe river basin li et al 2021 in this study we tried to analyze the possible driving factors of this 2020 flood from multiple climate indicators including that sst i e oni and iobw and wind anomalies in the indian and pacific oceans and the condition of snow cover in the previous winter on the tp at the source of the yrb fig 12 since november 2019 the central and eastern pacific has entered and maintained a weak el niño event has formally formed at the same time the abnormally warmer sst in the north indian ocean this year has further strengthened the subtropical high in the western pacific fig 12a and c this anomalous sst rise is conducive to the transmission of more water vapor from the ocean to the land via the wind evaporation sst feedback wang et al 2000 resulting in a much higher snowfall in the winter of 2019 than in previous years fig 12a and d in 2020 summer the negative la niña and the positive iobw are produced at the same time accelerating the speed of the atmospheric circulation fig 12b and c the south china sea summer monsoon occurred earlier and the ridgeline of the subtropical high in june was shifted to the north leading to the early arrival of the plum rain in the middle and lower reaches of yrb in addition the western pacific subtropical high has been significantly stronger and maintained stably the meridional circulation in mid high latitudes in asia has developed and the short wave troughs in the westerly belt are frequent which eventually led to the higher precipitation during the plum rain period fig 12b and e moreover fig 12c shows the relationship between the inter annual variation in oni values and the io sst anomalies between 2010 and 2020 a rapid shift of niño 3 4 sst iobw sst mature phases between positive el niño iobw and negative la niña iobw episodes are often associated with higher peaks of the annual p e g the peaks in 2016 and 2020 this transition period of an sst anomalies event from the mature stage to the decaying stage which is consistent with the abnormal annual rainfall cycle fig 12e it is also interesting to note that flood seasons are usually at the midline neutral phase of these rapidly changing years from the warming phase to the cooling phase with one year fig 4c indeed the positive phase before the 2020 summer monsoon is not as high as the previous flood event years but it has been at a positive value for one to two years the mechanism of climate variability effects on the 2020 flood in yrb can be explained by the conversion process of the walker circulation lau yang 2003 for example during the high speed transition of el niño conditions to la niña in the enso cycle a decreasing sst in the tropical west pacific and decreasing convection around the philippines results in the west pacific subtropical high moving southward the rising moist air from southeast asia and the south china sea resulting from the asian summer monsoon merges with moisture from the tropical west pacific and the westerlies yihui chan 2005 turner annamalai 2012 these factors will eventually lead to severe and long lasting rainfall in the yrb coupled with the melting of a large amount of snow in the tp in the previous year triggering flooding in the yrb 5 conclusions determining the solid earth s gravity response to changes in water mass and other types of surface load is considerable interest recently because of the information it provides about modern climate cycles and climate change few previous studies have assessed the capabilities of two sources of gravity measurements in capturing the rapid spatiotemporal water mass changes especially those related to floods this study presents multiscale gravity measurements to characterize flood events and their spatio temporal evolution both in the yrb and the tgr hydrological forcing data e g in situ weather records satellite remote sensing based tgr model and tgd water level and flow records were used successfully to calculate the scaling factors to downscale grace grace fo monthly solutions and to simulate gravity effect due to the migration of surface water mass which includes details of regional tws changes due to climate cycles and human activities the scaled grace fo based total tws information allows an assessment of the water abundance indices e g heavy p and high river discharge and severe floods during summer monsoon the gphone 101 time series that removed the geophysics effects and drift combined with prediction results of based on the tgr model demonstrates that local scale estimates of water storage derived from ground based gravity observations can be used to identify regional flood processes such as magnitude peaks and trends the gphone 101 has identified high frequency and high amplitude gravitational disturbances induced by fluctuations in water releasing caused by tgd flood discharge applying sst anomalies data known as oni and iobw in the niño 3 4 and io region this study shows the relationships between the rapid shift of enso iobw phases and flood events in yrb the results indicated that 2020 floods in the southern china especially the floods in the middle and lower reaches of the yr are the result of the combined effects of the west pacific subtropical high the westerly zone snow cover on the tp and global climate anomalies the climate oscillation patterns that trigger the water abundance index or flood events are often non single complex and interrelated therefore it is difficult to build a general recognized association that can explain a single flood event kundzewicz et al 2020 this study can benefit a wide range of hydrological applications of gravity measurements with the latest grace fo satellite mission and the high spatio temporal resolution and high precision surface gravity the combination of these two gravity solutions will provide greater insights into measuring extreme climate events at small scale region for example it will be very interesting in a comparison between the two selected sensors in future work that is a local gravimetry data could be used to validate the ability of grace to detect extreme localized events or to understand various downscaling approaches for grace credit

terrestrial ecosystems heat and drought stress occur more frequently in conditions of higher temperatures and more extreme hydrological cycles our research focuses on the joint analysis of both energy partitioning and temperature and evaporative fraction ef le le h anomalies to reveal the responses of carbon and water fluxes to climate anomalies in terrestrial ecosystems with different plant functional types pfts and in different climate zones in china in this study eddy covariance ec data were used to evaluate differences in bowen ratio β h le values and energy partitioning h rn and le

of carbon and water fluxes in ecosystems in china to anomalies in temperature and water availability a series of heat and drought sensitivity indices based on the daily temperature and evaporation fraction were developed the responses of gross primary productivity gpp and evapotranspiration et in different pfts to temperature and ef anomalies were quantified the results suggest that in terrestrial ecosystems in china carbon and water fluxes are more sensitive to drought than to heat our study recommends that validated sensitivity indicators should play a vital role in quantifying the response of ecosystem carbon and water fluxes to climate anomalies keywords eddy covariance energy partitioning evaporative fraction carbon and water fluxes sensitivity 1 introduction carbon water and energy exchanges between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere play an important role in regulating the local regional and global climate baldocchi et al 2001 quantifying the energy partitioning within these exchanges is fundamental for achieving a better understanding of ecosystems and climatic factors involved in the energy balance cui and chui 2019 wilson et al 2002b energy carbon and water fluxes exchange processes between ecosystems and the atmosphere are mainly affected by the interaction of complex interannual variations in climate variables e g vapor pressure

et al 2015 ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2016b any changes in climate variables significantly disturb ecosystem fluxes and contribute to the large interannual variability in atmospheric exchange aubinet et al 2018 the effects of heat and drought stress on carbon and water fluxes may increase or decrease due to seasonal changes in climate variables as well as long term changes that occur through natural ecosystem succession and global warming el madany et al 2020 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 therefore even though carbon and water cycle processes may appear differently at the decadal and centennial scales a better understanding of the relationship between climate and terrestrial carbon and water fluxes at interannual scales is also important for predicting future climate carbon feedbacks climatic variables may cause varying degrees of changes in the energy carbon and water fluxes of terrestrial ecosystems changes in climate variables will induce different responses in terms of flux partitioning the bowen ratio β the ratio of sensible heat flux h to latent flux le is strongly affected by ecosystem micrometeorological variables and hydrological cycles at both regional and global scales gu et al 2006 paschalis et al 2015 in addition β can also reflect their effects on the extent of energy available to terrestrial ecosystems ping et al 2018 the energy partitioning of le rn net radiation and h rn in terrestrial ecosystems presents considerable seasonal interannual and regional variability in previous studies eichelmann et al 2016 lei and yang 2010 a better understanding of changes in climate zones and pfts in energy and water vapor exchange and their control mechanisms are essential for accurately predicting the energy and hydrological cycles in ecosystems and addressing the consequences of management decisions in terrestrial ecosystems meier et al 2017 regan et al 2017 climate anomalies and pfts strongly influence the sensitivity of terrestrial carbon and water fluxes to substantial seasonal variations in climate factors angert et al 2005 eck et al 2020 von buttlar et al 2018 the responses of the carbon and water fluxes to heat and drought stress vary tremendously among pfts or even within species which is likely linked to various physiological traits and the interactive roles of bioclimatic status for forest ecosystem it shows a stronger capacity to avoid excessive water loss by increasing the carbon allocation to root growth rather than stems and leaves regulating stomatal conductance and maintaining productivity wolf et al 2013 in contrast grass ecosystem has a simpler structure and low productivity and the aboveground parts are easy to wither during drought and heat stress stampfli et al 2018 compared with forest and grass shrub ecosystem has a more complex structure and functions than grass and demands less water carbohydrate and nutrient for growth than forest in contrast to that of the above natural vegetation types the effects of heat and drought stress on crops are strongly related to human managements such as irrigation and cultivation thiery et al 2017 to compare the responses of different pfts to climate stresses sensitivity indices at time scale finer than the yearly scale are urgently needed to quantify and express the sensitivity of carbon and water fluxes to temperature and water condition anomalies jongen et al 2011 studies have shown that high temperatures in early spring have a positive influence on carbon and water sequestration vermeire et al 2008 walker et al 2015 it is because higher temperatures prolong the period of plant growth however the high temperatures in summer will have a negative effect on plant growth in ecosystems these negative effects are mainly induced by water stress which may lead to earlier leaf senescence in autumn and decreased leaf area in the following year seyednasrollah et al 2020 wolf et al 2016 xie et al 2018 the evaporative

availability temperature and biophysical processes i e photosynthesis and transpiration schwal et al 2010 su et al 2020 xu et al 2020 a number of researchers have investigated the sensitivity of carbon fluxes to ef and their results indicated that drought can inhibit vegetation productivity accelerate plant mortality affect the regional carbon cycle reduce agricultural productivity and lead to ecosystem degradation li et al 2020 piao et al 2019 xiao et al 2004 zhu et al 2020 quantifying the spatiotemporal changes in gross primary productivity gpp and evapotranspiration et caused by climate change on a regional scale will help with ecosystem service assessments and provide knowledge about terrestrial carbon and water cycles remote sensing techniques mu et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 and upscaling methods jung et al 2010 li et al 2018b are used to obtain regional or global scales carbon and water fluxes based on these methods global carbon and water fluxes can be estimated and the spatiotemporal variation in carbon and water fluxes and the responses to climate change can be analyzed however for carbon and water fluxes from remote sensing data or upscaling methods these products often have difficulty satisfying the simultaneous fine spatial and temporal resolution with higher precision due to algorithm restrictions and sparse station distribution the eddy covariance ec technique is currently a reliable method of obtaining carbon water and energy flux measurements in various terrestrial ecosystems baldocchi et al 2001 baldocchi 2020 majozi et al 2017 the establishment of the fluxnet network beginning in the late 1990 s provided a platform for establishing an ec system for measuring and sharing data on the fluxes and micrometeorological variables in ecosystems of different pfts the main goal of the fluxnet networks is to collect long time series flux data to fully assess the interannual variations in gross primary productivity evapotranspiration latent heat flux sensible heat flux net radiation and micrometeorological variables caused by biophysical factors wilson et al 2002a to date the continuous operation of the many networks within fluxnet has provided us with observations over a decade the continuous gpp and et data obtained with the ec system provide opportunities to analyze the seasonal and annual changes in water use efficiency wue at the ecosystem scale bonan et al 2014 cao et al 2020 niu et al 2011 to compare the impacts of climate stresses at different pfts sensitivity indices at time scale finer are needed to quantify the sensitivity of carbon and water fluxes the controlling variables of these sensitivity indices also need to be thoroughly examined unfortunately reliable evidence regarding how carbon and water fluxes of ecosystems across china respond to heat and drought stress remains unclear an and zuo 2021 hao et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 thus it is necessary to pay more attention to explore the responses of different ecosystems across china to heat and drought stress in the context of climate change this study focuses on the evaluation of the energy partitioning and the sensitivity of gpp and et to climate anomalies among 18 sites 7 pfts and 7 climate zones in china the goals of this study therefore to address 1 explaining the characteristics of energy partitioning across terrestrial ecosystems in china 2 evaluating the sensitivity of carbon and water fluxes in chinese ecosystems to temperature and drought anomalies change at the daily time scale and 3 further quantifying the effects of temperature and drought stress among different pfts in chinese ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources 2 1 1 sites description this study investigated 18 sites over 7 pfts and 7 climate zones to assess flux exchanges across terrestrial ecosystems in china see table 1 and fig 1 these study sites encompass 5 major ecosystem types i e 4 forest sites 7 grassland sites 3 cropland

shandong province hebei province and gansu province respectively the shrubland sh sites sdq and hzz are located in the semi arid zone in inner mongolia and gansu the wetland wet of cn ha2 and zysd located in qinghai and gansu more details about the characteristics of each site can be found in the references provided in table 1 2 1 2 data description ec towers provide direct measurements of

mainly consists of infrared gas co2 h2o analyzer li cor usa and three dimensional ultrasonic anemometer thermometer csat 3a campbell inc the measurement is made with a frequency of 10 hz and integrated as a half hour average in the data logger in this study the carbon and water fluxes and meteorology data come from the fluxnet dataset https fluxnet org data fluxnet2015 dataset chinaflux http www china flux org enn index aspx and the national tibetan plateau data center ntpdc https data tpdc ac cn zh hans all flux data are processed through quality assurance quality control qa qc gap filling methods reichstein et al 2005 and carbon partitioning algorithms lasslop et al 2010 then data were stored after correction spike filtration u filtration and subsequent gap filling in situ measurement data of carbon water energy fluxes and micrometeorological variables were collected in the study area the le and h data with energy balance closure correction e g le corr and h corr in the fluxnet dataset were used to calculate the energy partitioning in this study the meteorological data i e air temperature precipitation vapor pressure deficit and net radiation were obtained from the ec systems in fluxnet dataset and chinaflux dataset and automatic weather stations awss in ntpd dataset the aws provides continuously recorded meteorological data and all aws data were collected every 10 s and then synthetized at 10 min intervals for the data to coincide with the ec observations it was necessary to aggregate the 10 min meteorological variable data to have the same time step half hourly intervals as ec data at each study site then the half hourly data were aggregated into daily and monthly time scales in this study gap filled hourly data were utilized to calculate sensitivity indices the daily evaporative fraction ef le le h is widely used as a drought stress index to represent the available water the ef ranges from 0 fully dry to 1 fully wet the higher the value is the wetter the ecosystems seasonal differences in the ef can reflect the potential energy limitations during different seasons and in different ecosystems xu et al 2020 the köppen climate classification system was applied in this study to explore the characteristics of energy partitioning and carbon and water fluxes in different climate regions across various land cover types this system considers the daily mean temperature and daily evaporative fraction simultaneously to establish a simple framework for describing climate variability in an integrated way the distribution of the 18 sites across 7 land cover types and 7 climate zones is shown in table 1 and fig 1 2 2 methods 2 2 1 energy partitioning a simplified land surface energy partitioning is calculated in this study the bowen ratio β which corresponds to the same measurement periods as h and le was expressed as the ratio of h to le based on daily data 1 β h l e in this study the energy partitioning items also include le rn and h rn the daily h le and rn are the mean values of hourly energy fluxes data during the day the surface hourly et mm h 1 was calculated as follows 2 et l e λ ρ ω where λ is the latent heat of vaporization of water 2 45 kj g 1 ρ ω is the water density 1 g cm 3 the daily et is the sum of hourly et during the day when the hourly et is a negative value it will be set to zero 2 2 2 detrended anomalies of climate variables and fluxes in this study we focused on carbon and water flux sensitivity by considering temperature and ef anomalies the data normalization step helps to distinguish periodic effects during the study period thus the daily time steps of carbon and water fluxes gpp and et and environmental variables e g temperature and evaporative fraction at all sites were detrended first for each site the linear regression line of each variable was computed then the detrended variables were calculated by subtracting the linear line from the original climate time step to eliminate the influence of climate variable changes and the type of terrestrial ecosystem second the processes of anomalies estimation anomalies can be expressed as the difference between a specific value on a given day and the corresponding multiday average value to use the variations in climate factors and fluxes on each day to identify anomalies in this study due to the lack of data sharing across ecosystems in china and the different time periods of the data the multiday 15 day moving average of the daily data was used to calculate the multiday mean value for each day then the value of the corresponding data on each day was subtracted from the moving average to estimate anomalies 2 2 3 sensitivity index after detrended anomaly analysis the daily anomalies of environmental variables and carbon and water fluxes from multiple years were pooled together for every 15 days periods for the 18 sites 7 pfts and 7 climate zones to carry out the sensitivity analysis for ecosystems in china the correlations between each pair of climate variables i e temperature and ef and carbon and water fluxes within each of the 15 day moving windows were analyzed by using the partial least square pls regression method in this study the pls method was developed using the r package pls mevik and wehren 2007 which was obtained from https cran r project org web packages pls index html pls performs well for multivariate analysis compared with other regression methods especially when there is autocorrelation between independent variables here the detrend anomalies carbon and water fluxes of the pfts are the response variables and the detrend anomalies temperature and ef of the pfts are independent variables the coefficients of the regressions between carbon and water flux detrend anomalies and between temperature and ef detrend anomalies were used as a series of daily indices describing sensitivity to heat and drought the units of sensitivity indices of carbon flux to air temperature and ef are g c m 2 day 1 1 and g c m 2 day 1 respectively the units of sensitivity indices of water flux to air temperature and ef are mm day 1 1 and mm day 1 respectively heat stress was indicated by increasing tair values and drought stress was indicated by decreasing ef values in other words the negative values for tair sensitivity and positive values for ef sensitivity indicate that heat and drought stress significantly decreased the carbon and water fluxes 3 results 3 1 characteristics of energy partitioning across ecosystems the bowen ratios le rn and h rn values for the 18 sites are shown in table 2 the ratios of h to le ranged from 0 20 to 2 13 with a mean value of 0 98 at the 18 sites the xsbn site had the minimum value 0 20 and the hzz site had the maximum value 2 13 for the different pfts the bowen ratios ranged from 0 30 to 1 89 the pft of the evergreen broadleaf forest ebf had the minimum value 0 30 and the shrubland sh had the maximum value 1 89 with a mean value of 0 88 for the climate zones the maximum bowen ratio was 1 24 in bwk the minimum value was 0 23 in cwa and the mean value was 0 91 given these three bowen ratios the results show that forest ecosystems in humid climate zones have low bowen ratios and that sh ecosystem in dry climate zones have high bowen ratios this phenomenon could be due to low precipitation low soil water availability sparse canopies and smaller lai in gra and sh ecosystems across bsk and bwk climate zones there were large differences in h rn and le rn among the different pfts and climate zones le accounts for a large proportion of the total energy with daily mean values of le rn equal to 0 42 0 45 and 0 43 for the sites pfts and climate zones respectively at the 18 different sites the values of le rn ranged from 0 21 to 0 76 with an average value of 0 42 the maximum value occurred at the zysd site and the minimum value occurred at the hzz site among the pfts the maximum value was 0 61 wet the minimum value was 0 26 sh and the mean value was 0 45 in different climate zones the maximum value was 0 59 in the cfa zone the minimum value was 0 32 in the bsk zone with a mean value of 0 43 higher le rn values occurred in wet ebf and enf the cro ecosystem exhibited higher le rn but lower β this phenomenon may be due to the human activity of irrigation the climate zones in the humid type of cwa and cfa also present larger values of le rn the proportion of h in the total energy was lower than the proportion of le in the total energy the daily mean values of h rn were equal to 0 32 0 29 and 0 31 for the sites pfts and climate zones respectively table 2 among the different sites the maximum h rn value was 0 59 at the cn ha2 site and the minimum value was 0 02 at the yk site for the pfts the maximum value of h rn was 0 41 in the grassland gra ecosystem and the minimum value was 0 13 in the ebf the results show that the minimum values occurred in forest ecosystems whether the energy was partitioned by site or by plant type among the different climate zones the maximum value was 0 52 in the dwc zone and the minimum was 0 09 in the cwa zone higher h rn values occurred in ecosystem of gra it shown that gra ecosystem was dominated by sensible heat this phenomenon was attributed to the effect of low rainfall and high temperature in the bsk climate zone 3 2 patterns in the temperature and drought sensitivities of ecosystem carbon and water fluxes in different pfts the sensitivities of gpp to temperature anomalies showed different trends as shown in fig 2 the sensitivities of gpp to temperature anomalies increased with increasing daily mean temperature in all pfts i e there was a positive correlation between gpp sensitivities to daily mean temperature anomalies throughout the study period this result indicates that gpp is less sensitive to heat stress in all ecosystems under warmer conditions during the study period the gpp of the different ecosystems exhibited different levels of tair sensitivity with the highest negative values as shown in fig 2 in five pfts of cro ebf enf gra and mf the maximum tair at which the sensitivity of gpp to heat stress more negative gpp sensitivity was approximately 22 c however in the wet ecosystem the greatest heat stress appeared at approximately 7 c and the greatest heat stress appeared at approximately 26 c in the sh fig 3 shows and displays that in the different pfts the sensitivities of gpp to ef anomalies showed different trends the sensitivities of gpp to ef anomalies decreased obviously with increasing daily mean ef in enf gra sh and wet but not in cro ebf or mf this result indicates that gpp under drought conditions is more sensitive to drought stress in the cro ebf and mf ecosystems in china and that there is less drought stress in the other four pfts i e enf gra sh and wet a higher positive sensitivity of gpp to drought stress at low ef indicates that under drought conditions gpp will decrease in the wet sh and enf the sensitivities of gpp to ef anomalies showed a negative correlation in terrestrial ecosystems in china the largest positive ef sensitivity values drought stress appeared at approximately 0 79 in pfts of ebf enf and gra for cro and mf the largest positive ef sensitivity values appeared at approximately 0 82 in sh and wet the largest positive ef sensitivity values appeared at approximately 0 71 and 0 14 respectively in different pfts the sensitivities of et to tair anomalies showed different trends as shown in fig 4 the sensitivities of et to tair anomalies increased with increasing daily mean temperature in all pfts this result indicates that et under colder conditions is more sensitive to heat stress than et under warmer conditions across all pfts in chinese ecosystems higher sensitivities of et to temperature changes varied cro exhibited the highest sensitivity of et to tair anomalies at nearly 28 c the maximum heat stress occurred at temperatures of approximately 22 c 26 c 21 c 19 c 25 c and 12 c in ebf enf gra mf sh and wet respectively fig 5 shows the sensitivities of et to ef anomalies in the different pfts the sensitivities of et to ef anomalies decreased with increasing daily mean ef in all pfts except for the pfts of cro and ebf this result indicates that pfts i e enf gra sh and wet under drought conditions are more sensitive to drought stress than other pfts in chinese ecosystems a higher positive sensitivity of et to heat stress at low ef which occurred in the wet ecosystem enf ecosystem sh ecosystem and mf ecosystem indicated that under drought conditions et would decrease in cro and ebf the sensitivities of et to ef anomalies increased as ef increased indicating that those two ecosystems were affected by drought stress 3 3 patterns of heat and drought sensitivities in ecosystems the daily patterns of tair and ef sensitivity in the different pfts are shown in fig 6 negative sensitivity values to tair anomalies represent heat stress and the positive sensitivity values to ef anomalies represent drought stress as shown in fig 6a the gpp of cro exhibited high positive sensitivity to temperature anomalies during the summer period indicating that gpp in the cro ecosystem is relatively less sensitive to summer heat stress than gpp in other ecosystems however in spring the mean sensitivity of gpp to tair was less than 0 in cro suggesting that spring heat stress occurred in the cro ecosystem in the forest ecosystems the mean sensitivity of gpp to temperature anomalies exhibited similar trends in the ebf the sensitivity values were positive throughout the year in the mf the values were negative i e less than 0 in spring and autumn indicating that the strongest heat stress in the mf occurred in spring and autumn however in the enf during the summer the sensitivities of gpp to temperature anomalies presented a decreasing trend in late june and august and then increased around july and september this phenomenon indicated that heat stress had occurred for the gra gpp to temperature anomalies had low values throughout the year and negative values in the winter for the sh heat stress the negative sensitivity values occurred in late spring and autumn for the wet the trend was similar to that in the cro ecosystem and negative values occurred in winter in the summer around day of year doy 200 most of the pfts showed increasing gpp with tair anomalies except for enf in which the sensitivity of gpp to tair anomalies was less than 0 in addition a negative value also occurred in autumn in enf the average tair sensitivity of gpp was 0 12 0 20 0 09 0 03 0 05 0 00 and 0 09 in the 7 ecosystems cro ebf enf gra mf sh and wet respectively fig 6a the sensitivities of et to temperature anomalies fig 6b showed a trend similar to that of gpp sensitivity to temperature anomalies the mean values of tair sensitivity of et were 0 38 1 69 1 35 0 69 0 57 0 21 and 0 81 in the 7 ecosystems cro ebf enf gra mf sh and wet respectively during the summer the sensitivity values were nearly all positive in all ecosystems this result indicates that et values were higher at higher temperatures for the cro negative sensitivity values occurred in late spring and winter this suggests that the cro experienced drought stress the gra experienced heat stress during the winter as shown in fig 6c the values of the gpp to ef sensitivity were nearly all negative except in the cro ecosystem the maximum positive values occurred during the spring summer and autumn and the minimum negative value appeared in late summer with a mean value of 0 18 the sh also had the lowest sensitivity values for the whole year with a mean value of 0 37 the forest ecosystems enf ebf and mf had similar trends with mean values of 5 72 1 78 and 1 05 respectively however during the summer in the ebf the maximum positive value appeared earlier than those in the other two forest ecosystems enf and mf but its value was lower in the sh the minimum negative value appeared on doy of 200 and the mean value of the sensitivity of gpp to ef was 0 37 fig 6d shows the sensitivities of et to ef anomalies in the cro and sh the values were almost positive and the peak values of cro and sh appeared in spring for the gra negative values occurred in the growing season may to august among the forest ecosystems enf exhibited almost negative values throughout almost the whole year except for a few days in winter and summer for the mf positive values occurred in early spring autumn and winter and the minimum negative value occurred in early summer compared with that of mf the sensitivity trend of ebf was similar but the drought stress in summer was lower and the drought stress in winter was higher the mean values of the sensitivity of et to ef anomalies were 11 83 7 54 22 94 1 72 3 86 12 79 and 23 39 in the 7 ecosystems cro ebf enf gra mf sh wet respectively these results suggested that the cro ebf mf and sh ecosystems in china experience drought stress and that the sh ecosystems are more sensitive to drought stress than the three other ecosystems 3 4 climate control of temperature and drought sensitivities observations of both gpp and et were used to analyze their sensitivity to temperature anomalies and ef anomalies for the flux of gpp fig 7 a shows that the gpp to temperature anomalies was positive in all months and the maximum value occurred in august 0 19 in seasonal patterns this result indicates that the gpp in terrestrial ecosystems in china is not affected by heat stress throughout the year and the gpp increased with increasing temperature throughout the year fig 7b shows that the sensitivities of gpp to ef anomalies were negative in all months and the lowest negative value occurred in august 3 85 these results indicate that gpp in terrestrial ecosystems in china is not affected by drought stress throughout the year for et the mean values for tair sensitivities were all positive except in october 0 03 and november 0 05 suggesting that ecosystems in china were affected by heat stress in october and november fig 7c the sensitivities of et to ef varied among the different months fig 7d there were five negative values in may 1 18 june 9 07 july 11 07 august 10 78 and september 2 22 and the values were positive during the rest of the year these results indicate that the ecosystems in china were not affected by drought stress from may to september but that drought stress occurred in the other seven months the highest positive value occurred in march 11 67 it is indicated that the greatest sensitivities to drought stress in terrestrial ecosystems in china occurred in spring 4 discussion this study examines how energy flux partitioning and sensitivity to heat and drought anomalies in carbon and water fluxes vary in terrestrial ecosystems in china using fluxes data from ec systems a series of daily indices of chinese ecosystem energy partitioning and carbon and water fluxes sensitivity to heat and drought stress were developed in this study we utilized the daily patterns of gpp and et to determine the sensitivity of gpp and et to temperature anomalies and ef anomalies in 7 different pfts in chinese ecosystems the results for these indices show that different ecosystems in china exhibit different energy partitioning patterns and levels of sensitivity to heat and drought stresses to analyze the water vapor and energy exchange between ecosystems and the atmosphere it is necessary to analyze the characteristics of energy flux partitioning different pfts and different climate zones exhibited different energy partitioning values table 2 the results suggest that energy partitioning of the ecosystems is slightly dominated by latent heat table 2 vegetation affects the surface energy exchange by altering lai and other physical parameters such as albedo soil temperature and soil water that determine the absorption and dissipation of energy at the land surface the findings of this study show that the β of cwa the pfts are cro and enf and cfa the pfts are ebf and enf is lower than the bwk the pfts are sh wet and cro and bsk the pfts are gra and cro table 2 the different pfts in climate zone is more likely a cause however for the yk site the pfts is gra the β is significantly lower than other sites of the same pfts e g cn dan ar cn ham cn du2 cn cng and cn sw2 this phenomenon may be caused by high altitude the yk site at an elevation of 4148 m previous studies have shown that in higher altitude areas the snow cover and freezing and thawing processes have a significant impact on energy partitioning wang et al 2015 under the influence of high albedo of snow cover the net radiation is decreased and the sensible heat flux showed a negative value in addition the le during the melting period of summer snow is larger so le is greater than h at the yk site for the cn ha2 site the pfts is wet the β is significantly higher than that of zysd site with the same pfts the effect of livestock grazing in grazed wetland is more likely a cause at the cn ha2 site the vegetation of the wetland is dominated by cares pamirensis clarke with a coverage of 63 4 in the flat field several other species including carex alrofusca schkuhr hippuris vulgaris l triglochin palustre l and heleocharis spp yu et al 2013 the wetland is grazed by sheep yak and dairy cattle year round and it also a watering place for the livestock hirota et al 2005 grazing leads to the destruction of vegetation remove parts of leaf blades and decrease transpiration accordingly eldridge et al 2016 this study indicates that ebf and enf have lower h rn and higher le rn the higher le rn in ebf and enf might be attributed to the higher lai evapotranspiration generally increases with lai when the soil water is not limited in addition h rn exceeding le rn table 2 have been reported in sh and gra ecosystems where low precipitation dry soils and a sparse canopy constrain le aires et al 2008 you et al 2017 reported that a low vegetation fraction resulted in increases in h and heating of the lower atmosphere in grassland however the cro ecosystems exhibited lower β but higher le rn as shown in fig 6c a peak value of ef sensitivity less drought stress appears at approximately doy of 200 between the two valleys drought stress these phenomena may be caused by irrigation during the growing season farmers irrigate crops to meet the demand for water from growing crops due to the shortage of precipitation therefore the energy partitioning of the ecosystem is strongly affected by human activities of irrigation or groundwater recharges liu et al 2010 wang et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 furthermore it is unknown whether the plants in forests in this study the pfts of enf ebf and mf can obtain deep soil water or groundwater and whether this water can be used to allow plants to survive periods of excessive dryness feng et al 2016 xiao et al 2005 therefore further studies on these topics are needed climate variables such as the mean daily temperature and ef have a moderate impact on the sensitivity of carbon and water fluxes to climate anomalies this study utilized in situ observations to reveal heat and drought stress phenomena in 7 chinese pfts at the daily time scale under the influence of various environmental factors the influence of climate on terrestrial carbon and water fluxes varies with time and space when studying the effects of climate extremes it is necessary to analyze the sensitivity of ecosystem carbon and water fluxes to interannual temperature and ef changes by using observed flux data this study has developed a series of daily indices to express ecosystem sensitivity to heat and drought anomalies the results of this study suggest that the sensitivity of ecosystems to heat and drought stress was not consistent throughout the study period the sensitivities of carbon and water fluxes to temperature and ef showed complicated daily patterns fig 6 as well as seasonal patterns fig 7 the mean values of sensitivity of gpp to tair anomalies and ef anomalies at the daily time scale indicated that the flux of gpp did not suffer heat stress in any pfts but suffered drought stress in cro with mean value is 0 18 the flux of et did not suffer heat stress in any pfts but suffered drought stress except in gra enf and wet and had more positive sensitivity values to ef anomalies of et fig 6d in several pfts in sh cro mf and ebf with means of 12 79 11 83 7 54 and 3 86 respectively this phenomenon suggests that ecosystems are more sensitive to drought stress the results of this study did not reveal any obvious signs of heat stress in gpp and et in 7 pfts in seasonal patterns however the fluxes of carbon and water in chinese ecosystems suffered obvious drought stress fig 7 other studies have shown that the ability of ecosystems to resist extreme climates depends on their species composition and stand density giuggiola et al 2013 hirano et al 2017 launiainen 2010 the sensitivity of the carbon and water fluxes depends not only on the seasonal timing of the stress but also on other site level variables i e plant age pfts management and productivity conditions desai et al 2005 thomas et al 2009 studies have shown that the sensitivity of carbon and water fluxes to climate anomalies also changes with plant age and younger forests appear to be more sensitive to heat and drought stress jung et al 2019 xu et al 2020 the results of a study comparing old trees with young trees in ponderosa pine forests indicated that stomatal resistance increased water potential decreased and soil respiration decreased in young forests under drought stress irvine and law 2002 law et al 2001 during the process of plant growth the volume and depth of the plant root systems will increase inducing an increase in demand for soil moisture and improving the resistance to heat and drought stress kolb et al 2013 schwarz et al 2004 actually the effects of heat and drought stress are mainly dominated by induced water stress which depends on the availability of soil moisture low soil volumetric water content also leads to reduced soil water evaporation the indices of carbon and water fluxes sensitivity to heat and drought stress have been successfully used to express the ecosystem response to climate variables although our analysis helped to quantify the short term 15 days time frame impact of extreme conditions nonetheless this study has limitations the rapid increase in the number of flux sites make it possible to examine the characteristics of carbon and water fluxes at scales from individual site to multiple sites across china there are still challenges for synthesis studies in the region of china because of the constraints on data sharing paw u 2006 for enf the gpp did not suffer drought stress but et suffered drought stress in early spring winter and around doy of 200 the possible reason for these results is that the ec data do not provide a very long time series 1 6 years in this study therefore the long term lag effects of climate extremes on the daily sensitivity indices cannot be considered tei and sugimoto 2018 wu et al 2015 xie et al 2016 in fact the duration of the impact of extreme climate events on carbon and water fluxes can vary from a few days to a few months therefore more long term data are required to further quantify the lag effect of climate extremes quantify the sensitivity of carbon and water fluxes to heat and drought stress and further quantitatively examine how climate extremes in different seasons determine the annual carbon balance in terrestrial ecosystems anomalies in different plant functional indicators were observed during the study period in china the findings of this study also suggested that drought had a greater impact on gpp and le than heat in ecosystems in china during the study period fig 7 this result means that the water deficits during the growing season may hinder ecosystem development resulting in lower leaf area index lai values and stomatal conductance eichelmann et al 2016 huang et al 2015 unkovich et al 2018 stomatal conductance is an important limiting factor for photosynthesis and evapotranspiration and is the primary pathway for controlling carbon and water fluxes between vegetation and the atmosphere bonan et al 2014 in addition to plant stomatal conductance other plant physiological regulators such as leaf water potential and mitochondrial and chloroplast structure also affect carbon water and energy exchange atkin and macherel 2009 miyashita et al 2005 what s more the daily sensitivity indices of heat and drought stress we generated based on ec still have some limitations previous studies have indicated that the effects of heat and drought stress on carbon and water fluxes are tightly correlated zhang et al 2017 zscheischler et al 2014 thermodynamic arguments indicate that increased heating might indeed amplify droughts via increased atmospheric water demand trenberth et al 2014 considering the complexity of the effect of heat and drought stress on ecosystem carbon water and energy fluxes more in depth studies are still required compared with time series studies the substantial differences between different locations in this study may weaken the impact of the specific age effects on the sensitivity of ecosystems to climate pressure amiro et al 2010 there is still great uncertainty in the analysis of the response of plants especially old growth plants to extreme climate conditions in other words plant age is the main factor influencing flux exchanges between the ecosystem and atmosphere 5 conclusions the ultimate motivation of this study is to explain the energy partitioning and the sensitivity of carbon and water fluxes to heat and drought stress in terrestrial ecosystems in china the results obtained using the daily fluxes and meteorological data from 18 sites in 7 pfts and 7 climate zones in china implied that the energy partitioning varied among the different ecosystems and in different climate zones latent heat slightly dominates the energy partitioning of chinese ecosystems the ecosystems in china were shown to experience heat and drought stress however drought stress had a stronger effect than heat stress on carbon and water fluxes this study further deepens our understanding of the potential relationship between carbon and water fluxes and climate anomalies which may help to promote the modeling and prediction of plant biophysical processes related to energy water and carbon fluxes at the ecosystem level further

3891,climate variables such as heat and drought are generally regarded as the main factors regulating carbon water and energy fluxes i e net radiation rn latent flux le and sensible heat fluxes h in terrestrial ecosystems heat and drought stress occur more frequently in conditions of higher temperatures and more extreme hydrological cycles our research focuses on the joint analysis of both energy partitioning and temperature and evaporative fraction ef le le h anomalies to reveal the responses of carbon and water fluxes to climate anomalies in terrestrial ecosystems with different plant functional types pfts and in different climate zones in china in this study eddy covariance ec data were used to evaluate differences in bowen ratio β h le values and energy partitioning h rn and le rn among different sites pfts and climate zones energy exchange in the studied ecosystems was characterized by high values of β mean values of 0 98 0 88 and 0 91 among the different sites pfts and climate zones respectively high le rn ratios mean values of 0 42 0 45 and 0 43 respectively and low h rn ratios mean values of 0 32 0 29 and 0 31 respectively furthermore to evaluate the sensitivity of carbon and water fluxes in ecosystems in china to anomalies in temperature and water availability a series of heat and drought sensitivity indices based on the daily temperature and evaporation fraction were developed the responses of gross primary productivity gpp and evapotranspiration et in different pfts to temperature and ef anomalies were quantified the results suggest that in terrestrial ecosystems in china carbon and water fluxes are more sensitive to drought than to heat our study recommends that validated sensitivity indicators should play a vital role in quantifying the response of ecosystem carbon and water fluxes to climate anomalies keywords eddy covariance energy partitioning evaporative fraction carbon and water fluxes sensitivity 1 introduction carbon water and energy exchanges between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere play an important role in regulating the local regional and global climate baldocchi et al 2001 quantifying the energy partitioning within these exchanges is fundamental for achieving a better understanding of ecosystems and climatic factors involved in the energy balance cui and chui 2019 wilson et al 2002b energy carbon and water fluxes exchange processes between ecosystems and the atmosphere are mainly affected by the interaction of complex interannual variations in climate variables e g vapor pressure deficit vpd air temperature tair and precipitation delpierre et al 2012 lei et al 2018 zhang et al 2016a and biological factors e g plant functional types pfts and plant maturity jia et al 2016 kang et al 2015 ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2016b any changes in climate variables significantly disturb ecosystem fluxes and contribute to the large interannual variability in atmospheric exchange aubinet et al 2018 the effects of heat and drought stress on carbon and water fluxes may increase or decrease due to seasonal changes in climate variables as well as long term changes that occur through natural ecosystem succession and global warming el madany et al 2020 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 therefore even though carbon and water cycle processes may appear differently at the decadal and centennial scales a better understanding of the relationship between climate and terrestrial carbon and water fluxes at interannual scales is also important for predicting future climate carbon feedbacks climatic variables may cause varying degrees of changes in the energy carbon and water fluxes of terrestrial ecosystems changes in climate variables will induce different responses in terms of flux partitioning the bowen ratio β the ratio of sensible heat flux h to latent flux le is strongly affected by ecosystem micrometeorological variables and hydrological cycles at both regional and global scales gu et al 2006 paschalis et al 2015 in addition β can also reflect their effects on the extent of energy available to terrestrial ecosystems ping et al 2018 the energy partitioning of le rn net radiation and h rn in terrestrial ecosystems presents considerable seasonal interannual and regional variability in previous studies eichelmann et al 2016 lei and yang 2010 a better understanding of changes in climate zones and pfts in energy and water vapor exchange and their control mechanisms are essential for accurately predicting the energy and hydrological cycles in ecosystems and addressing the consequences of management decisions in terrestrial ecosystems meier et al 2017 regan et al 2017 climate anomalies and pfts strongly influence the sensitivity of terrestrial carbon and water fluxes to substantial seasonal variations in climate factors angert et al 2005 eck et al 2020 von buttlar et al 2018 the responses of the carbon and water fluxes to heat and drought stress vary tremendously among pfts or even within species which is likely linked to various physiological traits and the interactive roles of bioclimatic status for forest ecosystem it shows a stronger capacity to avoid excessive water loss by increasing the carbon allocation to root growth rather than stems and leaves regulating stomatal conductance and maintaining productivity wolf et al 2013 in contrast grass ecosystem has a simpler structure and low productivity and the aboveground parts are easy to wither during drought and heat stress stampfli et al 2018 compared with forest and grass shrub ecosystem has a more complex structure and functions than grass and demands less water carbohydrate and nutrient for growth than forest in contrast to that of the above natural vegetation types the effects of heat and drought stress on crops are strongly related to human managements such as irrigation and cultivation thiery et al 2017 to compare the responses of different pfts to climate stresses sensitivity indices at time scale finer than the yearly scale are urgently needed to quantify and express the sensitivity of carbon and water fluxes to temperature and water condition anomalies jongen et al 2011 studies have shown that high temperatures in early spring have a positive influence on carbon and water sequestration vermeire et al 2008 walker et al 2015 it is because higher temperatures prolong the period of plant growth however the high temperatures in summer will have a negative effect on plant growth in ecosystems these negative effects are mainly induced by water stress which may lead to earlier leaf senescence in autumn and decreased leaf area in the following year seyednasrollah et al 2020 wolf et al 2016 xie et al 2018 the evaporative fraction ef the fraction of the latent heat flux divided by the sum of the latent and sensible heat fluxes is a comprehensive drought index that reflects variations in precipitation soil water availability temperature and biophysical processes i e photosynthesis and transpiration schwal et al 2010 su et al 2020 xu et al 2020 a number of researchers have investigated the sensitivity of carbon fluxes to ef and their results indicated that drought can inhibit vegetation productivity accelerate plant mortality affect the regional carbon cycle reduce agricultural productivity and lead to ecosystem degradation li et al 2020 piao et al 2019 xiao et al 2004 zhu et al 2020 quantifying the spatiotemporal changes in gross primary productivity gpp and evapotranspiration et caused by climate change on a regional scale will help with ecosystem service assessments and provide knowledge about terrestrial carbon and water cycles remote sensing techniques mu et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 and upscaling methods jung et al 2010 li et al 2018b are used to obtain regional or global scales carbon and water fluxes based on these methods global carbon and water fluxes can be estimated and the spatiotemporal variation in carbon and water fluxes and the responses to climate change can be analyzed however for carbon and water fluxes from remote sensing data or upscaling methods these products often have difficulty satisfying the simultaneous fine spatial and temporal resolution with higher precision due to algorithm restrictions and sparse station distribution the eddy covariance ec technique is currently a reliable method of obtaining carbon water and energy flux measurements in various terrestrial ecosystems baldocchi et al 2001 baldocchi 2020 majozi et al 2017 the establishment of the fluxnet network beginning in the late 1990 s provided a platform for establishing an ec system for measuring and sharing data on the fluxes and micrometeorological variables in ecosystems of different pfts the main goal of the fluxnet networks is to collect long time series flux data to fully assess the interannual variations in gross primary productivity evapotranspiration latent heat flux sensible heat flux net radiation and micrometeorological variables caused by biophysical factors wilson et al 2002a to date the continuous operation of the many networks within fluxnet has provided us with observations over a decade the continuous gpp and et data obtained with the ec system provide opportunities to analyze the seasonal and annual changes in water use efficiency wue at the ecosystem scale bonan et al 2014 cao et al 2020 niu et al 2011 to compare the impacts of climate stresses at different pfts sensitivity indices at time scale finer are needed to quantify the sensitivity of carbon and water fluxes the controlling variables of these sensitivity indices also need to be thoroughly examined unfortunately reliable evidence regarding how carbon and water fluxes of ecosystems across china respond to heat and drought stress remains unclear an and zuo 2021 hao et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 thus it is necessary to pay more attention to explore the responses of different ecosystems across china to heat and drought stress in the context of climate change this study focuses on the evaluation of the energy partitioning and the sensitivity of gpp and et to climate anomalies among 18 sites 7 pfts and 7 climate zones in china the goals of this study therefore to address 1 explaining the characteristics of energy partitioning across terrestrial ecosystems in china 2 evaluating the sensitivity of carbon and water fluxes in chinese ecosystems to temperature and drought anomalies change at the daily time scale and 3 further quantifying the effects of temperature and drought stress among different pfts in chinese ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources 2 1 1 sites description this study investigated 18 sites over 7 pfts and 7

integrated as a half hour average in the data logger in this study the carbon and water fluxes and meteorology data come from the fluxnet dataset https fluxnet org data fluxnet2015 dataset chinaflux

filling methods reichstein et al 2005 and carbon partitioning algorithms lasslop et al 2010 then data were stored after correction spike filtration u filtration and subsequent gap filling in situ measurement data of carbon water energy fluxes and micrometeorological variables were collected in the study area the le and h data with energy balance closure correction e g le corr and h corr in the fluxnet dataset were used to calculate the energy partitioning in this study the meteorological data i e air temperature precipitation vapor pressure deficit and net radiation were obtained from the ec systems in fluxnet dataset and chinaflux dataset and automatic weather stations awss in ntpd dataset the aws provides continuously recorded meteorological data and all aws data were collected every 10 s and then synthetized at 10 min intervals for the data to coincide with the ec observations it was necessary to aggregate the 10 min meteorological variable data to have the same time step half hourly intervals as ec data at each study site then the half hourly data were aggregated into daily and monthly time scales in this study gap filled hourly data were utilized to calculate sensitivity indices the daily evaporative fraction ef le le h is widely used as a drought stress index to represent the available water the ef ranges from 0 fully dry to 1 fully wet the higher the value is the wetter the ecosystems seasonal differences in the ef can reflect the potential energy limitations during different seasons and in different ecosystems xu et al 2020 the köppen climate classification system was applied in this study to explore the characteristics of energy partitioning and carbon and water fluxes in different climate regions across various land cover types this system considers the daily mean temperature and daily evaporative fraction simultaneously to establish a simple framework for describing climate variability in an integrated way the distribution of the 18 sites across 7 land cover types and 7 climate zones is shown in table 1 and fig 1 2 2 methods 2 2 1 energy partitioning a simplified land surface energy partitioning is calculated in this study the bowen ratio β which corresponds to the same measurement periods as h and le was expressed as the ratio of h to le based on daily data 1 β h l e in this study the energy partitioning items also include le rn and h rn the daily h le and rn are the mean values of hourly energy fluxes data during the day the surface hourly et mm h 1 was calculated as follows 2 et l e λ ρ ω where λ is the latent heat of vaporization of water 2 45 kj g 1 ρ ω is the water density 1 g cm 3 the daily et is the sum of hourly et during the day when the hourly et is a negative value it will be set to zero 2 2 2 detrended anomalies of climate variables and fluxes in this study we focused on carbon and water flux sensitivity by considering temperature and ef anomalies the data normalization step helps to distinguish periodic effects during the study period thus the daily time steps of carbon and water fluxes gpp and et and environmental variables e g temperature and evaporative fraction at all sites were detrended first for each site the linear regression line of each variable was computed then the detrended variables were calculated by subtracting the linear line from the original climate time step to eliminate the influence of climate variable changes and the type of terrestrial ecosystem second the processes of anomalies estimation anomalies can be expressed as the difference between a specific value on a given day and the corresponding multiday average value to use the variations in climate factors and fluxes on each day to identify anomalies in this study due to the lack of data sharing across ecosystems in china and the different time periods of the data the multiday 15 day moving average of the daily data was used to calculate the multiday mean value for each day then the value of the corresponding data on each day was subtracted from the moving average to estimate anomalies 2 2 3 sensitivity index after detrended anomaly analysis the daily anomalies of environmental variables and carbon and water fluxes from multiple years were pooled together for every 15 days periods for the 18 sites 7 pfts and 7 climate zones to carry out the sensitivity analysis for ecosystems in china the correlations between each pair of climate variables i e temperature and ef and carbon and water fluxes within each of the 15 day moving windows were analyzed by using the partial least square pls regression method in this study the pls method was developed using the r package pls mevik and wehren 2007 which was obtained from https cran r project org web packages pls index html pls performs well for multivariate analysis compared with other regression methods especially when there is autocorrelation between independent variables here the detrend anomalies carbon and water fluxes of the pfts are the response variables and the detrend anomalies temperature and ef of the pfts are independent variables the coefficients of the regressions between carbon and water flux detrend anomalies and between temperature and ef detrend anomalies were used as a series of daily indices describing sensitivity to heat and drought the units of sensitivity indices of carbon flux to air temperature and ef are g c m 2 day 1 1 and g c m 2 day 1 respectively the units of sensitivity indices of water flux to air temperature and ef are mm day 1 1 and mm day 1 respectively heat stress was indicated by increasing tair values and drought stress was indicated by decreasing ef values in other words the negative values for tair sensitivity and positive values for ef sensitivity indicate that heat and drought stress significantly decreased the carbon and water fluxes 3 results 3 1 characteristics of energy partitioning across ecosystems the bowen ratios le rn and h rn values for the 18 sites are shown in table 2 the ratios of h to le ranged from 0 20 to 2 13 with a mean value of 0 98 at the 18 sites the xsbn site had the minimum value 0 20 and the hzz site had the maximum value 2 13 for the different pfts the bowen ratios ranged from 0 30 to 1 89 the pft of the evergreen broadleaf forest ebf had the minimum value 0 30 and the shrubland sh had the maximum value 1 89 with a mean value of 0 88 for the climate zones the maximum bowen ratio was 1 24 in bwk the minimum value was 0 23 in cwa and the mean value was 0 91 given these three bowen ratios the results show that forest ecosystems in humid climate zones have low bowen ratios and that sh ecosystem in dry climate zones have high bowen ratios this phenomenon could be due to low precipitation low soil water availability sparse canopies and smaller lai in gra and sh ecosystems across bsk and bwk climate zones there were large differences in h rn and le rn among the different pfts and climate zones le accounts for a large proportion of the total energy with daily mean values of le rn equal to 0 42 0 45 and 0 43 for the sites pfts and climate zones respectively at the 18 different sites the values of le rn ranged from 0 21 to 0 76 with an average value of 0 42 the maximum value occurred at the zysd site and the minimum value occurred at the hzz site among the pfts the maximum value was 0 61 wet the minimum value was 0 26 sh and the mean value was 0 45 in different climate zones the maximum value was 0 59 in the cfa zone the minimum value was 0 32 in the bsk zone with a mean value of 0 43 higher le rn values occurred in wet ebf and enf the cro ecosystem exhibited higher le rn but lower β this phenomenon may be due to the human activity of irrigation the climate zones in the humid type of cwa and cfa also present larger values of le rn the proportion of h in the total energy was lower than the proportion of le in the total energy the daily mean values of h rn were equal to 0 32 0 29 and 0 31 for the sites pfts and climate zones respectively table 2 among the different sites the maximum h rn value was 0 59 at the cn ha2 site and the minimum value was 0 02 at the yk site for the pfts the maximum value of h rn was 0 41 in the grassland gra ecosystem and the minimum value was 0 13 in the ebf the results show that the minimum values occurred in forest ecosystems whether the energy was partitioned by site or by plant type among the different climate zones the maximum value was 0 52 in the dwc zone and the minimum was 0 09 in the cwa zone higher h rn values occurred in ecosystem of gra it shown that gra ecosystem was dominated by sensible heat this phenomenon was attributed to the effect of low rainfall and high temperature in the bsk climate zone 3 2 patterns in the temperature and drought sensitivities of ecosystem carbon and water fluxes in different pfts the sensitivities of gpp to temperature anomalies showed different trends as shown in fig 2 the sensitivities of gpp to temperature anomalies increased with increasing daily mean temperature in all pfts i e there was a positive correlation between gpp sensitivities to daily mean temperature anomalies throughout the study period this result indicates that gpp is less sensitive to heat stress in all ecosystems under warmer conditions during the study period the gpp of the different ecosystems exhibited different levels of tair sensitivity with the highest negative values as shown in fig 2 in five pfts of cro ebf enf gra and mf the maximum tair at which the sensitivity of gpp to heat stress more negative gpp sensitivity was approximately 22 c however in the wet ecosystem the greatest heat stress appeared at approximately 7 c and the greatest heat stress appeared at approximately 26 c in the sh fig 3 shows and displays that in the different pfts the sensitivities of gpp to ef anomalies showed different trends the sensitivities of gpp to ef anomalies decreased obviously with increasing daily mean ef in enf gra sh and wet but not in cro ebf or mf this result indicates that gpp under drought conditions is more sensitive to drought stress in the cro ebf and mf ecosystems in china and that there is less drought stress in the other four pfts i e enf gra sh and wet a higher positive sensitivity of gpp to drought stress at low ef indicates that under drought conditions gpp will decrease in the wet sh and enf the sensitivities of gpp to ef anomalies showed a negative correlation in terrestrial ecosystems in china the largest positive ef sensitivity values drought stress appeared at approximately 0 79 in pfts of ebf enf and gra for cro and mf the largest positive ef sensitivity values appeared at approximately 0 82 in sh and wet the largest positive ef sensitivity values appeared at approximately 0 71 and 0 14 respectively in different pfts the sensitivities of et to tair anomalies showed different trends as shown in fig 4 the sensitivities of et to tair anomalies increased with increasing daily mean temperature in all pfts this result indicates that et under colder conditions is more sensitive to heat stress than et under warmer conditions across all pfts in chinese ecosystems higher sensitivities of et to temperature changes varied cro exhibited the highest sensitivity of et to tair anomalies at nearly 28 c the maximum heat stress occurred at temperatures of approximately 22 c 26 c 21 c 19 c 25 c and 12 c in ebf enf gra mf sh and wet respectively fig 5 shows the sensitivities of et to ef anomalies in the different pfts the sensitivities of et to ef anomalies decreased with increasing daily mean ef in all pfts except for the pfts of cro and ebf this result indicates that pfts i e enf gra sh and wet under drought conditions are more sensitive to drought stress than other pfts in chinese ecosystems a higher positive sensitivity of et to heat stress at low ef which occurred in the wet ecosystem enf ecosystem sh ecosystem and mf ecosystem indicated that under drought conditions et would decrease in cro and ebf the sensitivities of et to ef anomalies increased as ef increased indicating that those two ecosystems were affected by drought stress 3 3 patterns of heat and drought sensitivities in ecosystems the daily patterns of tair and ef sensitivity in the different pfts are shown in fig 6 negative sensitivity values to tair anomalies represent heat stress and the positive sensitivity values to ef anomalies represent drought stress as shown in fig 6a the gpp of cro exhibited high positive sensitivity to temperature anomalies during the summer period indicating that gpp in the cro ecosystem is relatively less sensitive to summer heat stress than gpp in other ecosystems however in spring the mean sensitivity of gpp to tair was less than 0 in cro suggesting that spring heat stress occurred in the cro ecosystem in the forest ecosystems the mean sensitivity of gpp to temperature anomalies exhibited similar trends in the ebf the sensitivity values were positive throughout the year in the mf the values were negative i e less than 0 in spring and autumn indicating that the strongest heat stress in the mf occurred in spring and autumn however in the enf during the summer the sensitivities of gpp to temperature anomalies presented a decreasing trend in late june and august and then increased around july and september this phenomenon indicated that heat stress had occurred for the gra gpp to temperature anomalies had low values throughout the year and negative values in the winter for the sh heat stress the negative sensitivity values occurred in late spring and autumn for the wet the trend was similar to that in the cro ecosystem and negative values occurred in winter in the summer around day of year doy 200 most of the pfts showed increasing gpp with tair anomalies except for enf in which the sensitivity of gpp to tair anomalies was less than 0 in addition a negative value also occurred in autumn in enf the average tair sensitivity of gpp was 0 12 0 20 0 09 0 03 0 05 0 00 and 0 09 in the 7 ecosystems cro ebf enf gra mf sh and wet respectively fig 6a the sensitivities of et to temperature anomalies fig 6b showed a trend similar to that of gpp sensitivity to temperature anomalies the mean values of tair sensitivity of et were 0 38 1 69 1 35 0 69 0 57 0 21 and 0 81 in the 7 ecosystems cro ebf enf gra mf sh and wet respectively during the summer the sensitivity values were nearly all positive in all ecosystems this result indicates that et values were higher at higher temperatures for the cro negative sensitivity values occurred in late spring and winter this suggests that the cro experienced drought stress the gra experienced heat stress during the winter as shown in fig 6c the values of the gpp to ef sensitivity were nearly all negative except in the cro ecosystem the maximum positive values occurred during the spring summer and autumn and the minimum negative value appeared in late summer with a mean value of 0 18 the sh also had the lowest sensitivity values for the whole year with a mean value of 0 37 the forest ecosystems enf ebf and mf had similar trends with mean values of 5 72 1 78 and 1 05 respectively however during the summer in the ebf the maximum positive value appeared earlier than those in the other two forest ecosystems enf and mf but its value was lower in the sh the minimum negative value appeared on doy of 200 and the mean value of the sensitivity of gpp to ef was 0 37 fig 6d shows the sensitivities of et to ef anomalies in the cro and sh the values were almost positive and the peak values of cro and sh appeared in spring for the gra negative values occurred in the growing season may to august among the forest ecosystems enf exhibited almost negative values throughout almost the whole year except for a few days in winter and summer for the mf positive values occurred in early spring autumn and winter and the minimum negative value occurred in early summer compared with that of mf the sensitivity trend of ebf was similar but the drought stress in summer was lower and the drought stress in winter was higher the mean values of the sensitivity of et to ef anomalies were 11 83 7 54 22 94 1 72 3 86 12 79 and 23 39 in the 7 ecosystems cro ebf enf gra mf sh wet respectively these results suggested that the cro ebf mf and sh ecosystems in china experience drought stress and that the sh ecosystems are more sensitive to drought stress than the three other ecosystems 3 4 climate control of temperature and drought sensitivities observations of both gpp and et were used to analyze their sensitivity to temperature anomalies and ef anomalies for the flux of gpp fig 7 a shows that the gpp to temperature anomalies was positive in all months and the maximum value occurred in august 0 19 in seasonal patterns this result indicates that the gpp in terrestrial ecosystems in china is not affected by heat stress throughout the year and the gpp increased with increasing temperature throughout the year fig 7b shows that the sensitivities of gpp to ef anomalies were negative in all months and the lowest negative value occurred in august 3 85 these results indicate that gpp in terrestrial ecosystems in china is not affected by drought stress throughout the year for et the mean values for tair sensitivities were all positive except in october 0 03 and november 0 05 suggesting that ecosystems in china were affected by heat stress in october and november fig 7c the sensitivities of et to ef varied among the different months fig 7d there were five negative values in may 1 18 june 9 07 july 11 07 august 10 78 and september 2 22 and the values were positive during the rest of the year these results indicate that the ecosystems in china were not affected by drought stress from may to september but that drought stress occurred in the other seven months the highest positive value occurred in march 11 67 it is indicated that the greatest sensitivities to drought stress in terrestrial ecosystems in china occurred in spring 4 discussion this study examines how energy flux partitioning and sensitivity to heat and drought anomalies in carbon and water fluxes vary in terrestrial ecosystems in china using fluxes data from ec systems a series of daily indices of chinese ecosystem energy partitioning and carbon and water fluxes sensitivity to heat and drought stress were developed in this study we utilized the daily patterns of gpp and et to determine the sensitivity of gpp and et to temperature anomalies and ef anomalies in 7 different pfts in chinese ecosystems the results for these indices show that different ecosystems in china exhibit different energy partitioning patterns and levels of sensitivity to heat and drought stresses to analyze the water vapor and energy exchange between ecosystems and the atmosphere it is necessary to analyze the characteristics of energy flux partitioning different pfts and different climate zones exhibited different energy partitioning values table 2 the results suggest that energy partitioning of the ecosystems is slightly dominated by latent heat table 2 vegetation affects the surface energy exchange by altering lai and other physical parameters such as albedo soil temperature and soil water that determine the absorption and dissipation of energy at the land surface the findings of this study show that the β of cwa the pfts are cro and enf and cfa the pfts are ebf and enf is lower than the bwk the pfts are sh wet and cro and bsk the pfts are gra and cro table 2 the different pfts in climate zone is more likely a cause however for the yk site the pfts is gra the β is significantly lower than other sites of the same pfts e g cn dan ar cn ham cn du2 cn cng and cn sw2 this phenomenon may be caused by high altitude the yk site at an elevation of 4148 m previous studies have shown that in higher altitude areas the snow cover and freezing and thawing processes have a significant impact on energy partitioning wang et al 2015 under the influence of high albedo of snow cover the net radiation is decreased and the sensible heat flux showed a negative value in addition the le during the melting period of summer snow is larger so le is greater than h at the yk site for the cn ha2 site the pfts is wet the β is significantly higher than that of zysd site with the same pfts the effect of livestock grazing in grazed wetland is more likely a cause at the cn ha2 site the vegetation of the wetland is dominated by cares pamirensis clarke with a coverage of 63 4 in the flat field several other species including carex alrofusca schkuhr hippuris vulgaris l triglochin palustre l and heleocharis spp yu et al 2013 the wetland is grazed by sheep yak and dairy cattle year round and it also a watering place for the livestock hirota et al 2005 grazing leads to the destruction of vegetation remove parts of leaf blades and decrease transpiration accordingly eldridge et al 2016 this study indicates that ebf and enf have lower h rn and higher le rn the higher le rn in ebf and enf might be attributed to the higher lai evapotranspiration generally increases with lai when the soil water is not limited in addition h rn exceeding le rn table 2 have been reported in sh and gra ecosystems where low precipitation dry soils and a sparse canopy constrain le aires et al 2008 you et al 2017 reported that a low vegetation fraction resulted in increases in h and heating of the lower atmosphere in grassland however the cro ecosystems exhibited lower β but higher le rn as shown in fig 6c a peak value of ef sensitivity less drought stress appears at approximately doy of 200 between the two valleys drought stress these phenomena may be caused by irrigation during the growing season farmers irrigate crops to meet the demand for water from growing crops due to the shortage of precipitation therefore the energy partitioning of the ecosystem is strongly affected by human activities of irrigation or groundwater recharges liu et al 2010 wang et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 furthermore it is unknown whether the plants in forests in this study the pfts of enf ebf and mf can obtain deep soil water or groundwater and whether this water can be used to allow plants to survive periods of excessive dryness feng et al 2016 xiao et al 2005 therefore further studies on these topics are needed climate variables such as the mean daily temperature and ef have a moderate impact on the sensitivity of carbon and water fluxes to climate anomalies this study utilized in situ observations to reveal heat and drought stress phenomena in 7 chinese pfts at the daily time scale under the influence of various environmental factors the influence of climate on terrestrial carbon and water fluxes varies with time and space when studying the effects of climate extremes it is necessary to analyze the sensitivity of ecosystem carbon and water fluxes to interannual temperature and ef changes by using observed flux data this study has developed a series of daily indices to express ecosystem sensitivity to heat and drought anomalies the results of this study suggest that the sensitivity of ecosystems to heat and drought stress was not consistent throughout the study period the sensitivities of carbon and water fluxes to temperature and ef showed complicated daily patterns fig 6 as well as seasonal patterns fig 7 the mean values of sensitivity of gpp to tair anomalies and ef anomalies at the daily time scale indicated that the flux of gpp did not suffer heat stress in any pfts but suffered drought stress in cro with mean value is 0 18 the flux of et did not suffer heat stress in any pfts but suffered drought stress except in gra enf and wet and had more positive sensitivity values to ef anomalies of et fig 6d in several pfts in sh cro mf and ebf with means of 12 79 11 83 7 54 and 3 86 respectively this phenomenon suggests that ecosystems are more sensitive to drought stress the results of this study did not reveal any obvious signs of heat stress in gpp and et in 7 pfts in seasonal patterns however the fluxes of carbon and water in chinese ecosystems suffered obvious drought stress fig 7 other studies have shown that the ability of ecosystems to resist extreme climates depends on their species composition and stand density giuggiola et al 2013 hirano et al 2017 launiainen 2010 the sensitivity of the carbon and water fluxes depends not only on the seasonal timing of the stress but also on other site level variables i e plant age pfts management and productivity conditions desai et al 2005 thomas et al 2009 studies have shown that the sensitivity of carbon and water fluxes to climate anomalies also changes with plant age and younger forests appear to be more sensitive to heat and drought stress jung et al 2019 xu et al 2020 the results of a study comparing old trees with young trees in ponderosa pine forests indicated that stomatal resistance increased water potential decreased and soil respiration decreased in young forests under drought stress irvine and law 2002 law et al 2001 during the process of plant growth the volume and depth of the plant root systems will increase inducing an increase in demand for soil moisture and improving the resistance to heat and drought stress kolb et al 2013 schwarz et al 2004 actually the effects of heat and drought stress are mainly dominated by induced water stress which depends on the availability of soil moisture low soil volumetric water content also leads to reduced soil water evaporation the indices of carbon and water fluxes sensitivity to heat and drought stress have been successfully used to express the ecosystem response to climate variables although our analysis helped to quantify the short term 15 days time frame impact of extreme conditions nonetheless this study has limitations the rapid increase in the number of flux sites make it possible to examine the characteristics of carbon and water fluxes at scales from individual site to multiple sites across china there are still challenges for synthesis studies in the region of china because of the constraints on data sharing paw u 2006 for enf the gpp did not suffer drought stress but et suffered drought stress in early spring winter and around doy of 200 the possible reason for these results is that the ec data do not provide a very long time series 1 6 years in this study therefore the long term lag effects of climate extremes on the daily sensitivity indices cannot be considered tei and sugimoto 2018 wu et al 2015 xie et al 2016 in fact the duration of the impact of extreme climate events on carbon and water fluxes can vary from a few days to a few months therefore more long term data are required to further quantify the lag effect of climate extremes quantify the sensitivity of carbon and water fluxes to heat and drought stress and further quantitatively examine how climate extremes in different seasons determine the annual carbon balance in terrestrial ecosystems anomalies in different plant functional indicators were observed during the study period in china the findings of this study also suggested that drought had a greater impact on gpp and le than heat in ecosystems in china during the study period fig 7 this result means that the water deficits during the growing season may hinder ecosystem development resulting in lower leaf area index lai values and stomatal conductance eichelmann et al 2016 huang et al 2015 unkovich et al 2018 stomatal conductance is an important limiting factor for photosynthesis and evapotranspiration and is the primary pathway for controlling carbon and water fluxes between vegetation and the atmosphere bonan et al 2014 in addition to plant stomatal conductance other plant physiological regulators such as leaf water potential and mitochondrial and chloroplast structure also affect carbon water and energy exchange atkin and macherel 2009 miyashita et al 2005 what s more the daily sensitivity indices of heat and drought stress we generated based on ec still have some limitations previous studies have indicated that the effects of heat and drought stress on carbon and water fluxes are tightly correlated zhang et al 2017 zscheischler et al 2014 thermodynamic arguments indicate that increased heating might indeed amplify droughts via increased atmospheric water demand trenberth et al 2014 considering the complexity of the effect of heat and drought stress on ecosystem carbon water and energy fluxes more in depth studies are still required compared with time series studies the substantial differences between different locations in this study may weaken the impact of the specific age effects on the sensitivity of ecosystems to climate pressure amiro et al 2010 there is still great uncertainty in the analysis of the response of plants especially old growth plants to extreme climate conditions in other words plant age is the main factor influencing flux exchanges between the ecosystem and atmosphere 5 conclusions the ultimate motivation of this study is to explain the energy partitioning and the sensitivity of carbon and water fluxes to heat and drought stress in terrestrial ecosystems in china the results obtained using the daily fluxes and meteorological data from 18 sites in 7 pfts and 7 climate zones in china implied that the energy partitioning varied among the different ecosystems and in different climate zones latent heat slightly dominates the energy partitioning of chinese ecosystems the ecosystems in china were shown to experience heat and drought stress however drought stress had a stronger effect than heat stress on carbon and water fluxes this study further deepens our understanding of the potential relationship between carbon and water fluxes and climate anomalies which may help to promote the modeling and prediction of plant biophysical processes related to energy water and carbon fluxes at the ecosystem level further

3892,evapotranspiration et plays an indispensable role in water carbon energy exchange between the land surface and atmosphere biophysical constraints like the canopy conductance lie the key to accurate prediction of plant transpiration t and soil evaporation e in et models given the lack of comprehensive evaluation for resistances network in conductance based two source energy balance model tseb three scenarios gc tsebo gc tsebosm and gc tsebswc were assessed on the frame of gc tseb one relying on jarvis canopy conductance other on optimal stomatal behavior and other on soil moisture content with forcing data from modis datasets and in situ fluxnet sites over six biome types the et simulated by the model combined with the optimal stomatal behavior and the complementary concept had higher values of r2 and taylor skill scores lower values of rmse and bias than the other two scenarios particularly over cropland sites and arid semi arid sites where the other two failed the sensitivity analysis for gc tseb resistances elucidated that the effect of canopy conductance is more noticeable on et simulation than the other resistances when effective biophysical constraints on the canopy are lacking a large deviation exists in et partitioning mainly due to the systematic error of soil evaporation through the partitioning algorithm for soil and plant fluxes we assessed the performance of calibration from modis land surface temperature lst instead of flux data the lst calibrated model performed better in croplands and grasslands compared to forest sites which opens a good perspective to advance the model for operational applications in agriculture and herbaceous vegetation keywords evapotranspiration gc tseb optimal stomatal model complementary concept modis lst 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a crucial element of water and energy exchange in the soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat continuum monteith 1965 olioso et al 1999 half of the solar radiation reaching the land surface is converted to latent heat flux le driving the water back to the atmosphere as vapor trenberth et al 2009 et makes up the second largest water flux in the water cycle and ranks behind only precipitation accounting for about 65 of precipitation oki and kanae 2006 et consists mainly of canopy transpiration t and soil evaporation e the former coupled with plant photosynthesis the latter regarded as a physical process stoy et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 the ratio of transpiration and evapotranspiration t et on the ecosystems reflects the impact and feedback of vegetation physiological processes on climate change and energy balance gan et al 2021 jasechko et al 2013 lian et al 2018 stoy et al 2019 the t and e can be measured directly by some techniques such as plant level sap flow sakuratani 1981 radio isotopic jasechko et al 2013 and so on but with the high cost and low stability alternatively some et partitioning methods were developed using eddy covariance ec observations usually relied on water use efficiency wue zhou et al 2016 optimality theory assumption berkelhammer et al 2016 and ecosystem conductance li et al 2019b however these methods were derived from the tight relationship between t and half hourly ec gross primary productivity gpp and thus limited by the spatial and temporal scale of in situ measurements lian et al 2018 based on global measurements of e t et and leaf area index lai wang et al 2014 confirmed t et positively related to lai over agricultural and natural vegetations and built an exponential regression between them subsequently wei et al 2017 retrieved the regression parameters to six ecosystems using abundant observations and the ratio of t to et was mapped globally using remote sensing lai datasets and the fraction of land cover classes though lai is a good and simple indicator of t et the uncertainty existed in the performance of the regression approach over various biomes with the coefficient of determination r2 varying from 0 43 to 0 87 wei et al 2017 lai and vegetation indexes vis are short of powerful enough explanations to t when responding to environmental stresses li et al 2019a li et al 2015 compared to lai and vis the stomatal activities of vegetation directly impact the transpiration rate shan et al 2019 stoy et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 which is hard to be captured by satellites two source et models can simulate the processes of terrestrial water exchange and heat transfer and offer an effective way to estimate t and e spatially and temporally chen and liu 2020 li et al 2009 three types of remote sensing et models have been applied successfully to et partitioning 1 surface energy balance models kustas and norman 1999 norman et al 1995 2 penman monteith pm or priestley taylor pt formulas combined with remote sensing data fisher et al 2008 garcía et al 2013 hu et al 2009 mu et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 3 vegetation index radiative surface temperature models long and singh 2012 pm type and pt type models combine the surface energy balance and mass transfer and give the explicit expression to et driven by atmospheric forcing and vegetation indexes the optimization of key parameters to constrain t and e mainly relies on ec measurements mu et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 however the sparse distribution of flux sites and limitation of observations restrict the capabilities of models to the applications at the regional level land surface temperature lst obtained from thermal infrared remote sensing can provide global coverage and instantaneous observations guillevic et al 2014 ridler et al 2014 tomlinson et al 2011 which can match the spatiotemporal scale of the et model simulation energy balance models take remote sensing lst as model input to achieve surface energy closure and then obtain et as the residual of available surface energy and sensible heat fluxes bastiaanssen et al 1998 thus avoiding parameters calibration the two source energy balance model tseb kustas and norman 1999 was developed from the n95 model norman et al 1995 which divides available energy into canopy and soil layers and establishes separate energy balance for the two systems the sensible heat flux of canopy and soil can be estimated based on canopy temperature t c and soil temperature t s respectively while latent heat fluxes of canopy le c and soil le s as the residual of two energy balance morillas et al 2013 the initial t c is derived from le c calculated by pt formula and the α pt can be adjusted if the case e 0 in the daytime appears during the iteration procedure colaizzi et al 2012b morillas et al 2013 song et al 2016b however the first condition α pt 1 3 for iterations is unable to satisfy some specific situations such as full irrigation and strongly advection anderson et al 2011 kustas and norman 1999 song et al 2016b to solve this shortcoming colaizzi et al 2012b used penman monteith approximation instead of pt formula for initial t c morillas et al 2013 and song et al 2016b applied segregated temperatures from proximal sensors and aster tir data respectively as model input avoiding the iteration error from the calculation of initial canopy temperature nevertheless there still exist drawbacks in et estimation and partitioning during the dry and water deficient seasons or under advective conditions hssaine et al 2018 to describe more precisely the vegetation transpiration the canopy conductance g c aggregating leaf stomatal conductance to water flux has been applied to et estimation particularly in pm based models cleugh et al 2007 li et al 2019a li et al 2015 mu et al 2007 yebra et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 the g c is usually predicted by empirical semi empirical or phenomenological models i e jarvis model jarvis 1976 and ball berry leuning bbl model ball et al 1987 leuning et al 1995 gan and gao 2015 coupled a canopy conductance model leuning et al 2008 and mass transfer equation for canopy in the tseb instead of the pt model to estimate the le c the updated conductance based tseb model was named gc tseb comparing to the pt canopy module it is promising to use the gc tseb model to adjust the parameters controlling stomatal conductance flexibly and improve prediction of et and t gan et al 2019 another aspect is that the le and h estimated through radiometric temperature based tseb are instantaneous values at the time of lst observation it s challenging to upscaling the et snapshots to values for daily or longer timescale particularly under cloudy skies colaizzi et al 2014 colaizzi et al 2012a morillas et al 2014 given the explicit form of et gc tseb can produce daily or instantaneous et consistent with continuous meteorological forcing similar to pm models as lst is one of the model outputs rather than input the model parameters can also be calibrated by remote sensing lst in every pixel instead of scarce ec observations gan and gao 2015 whereas the leuning et al 2008 s g c model is an empirical jarvis type model only considering the effect of water vapor pressure deficit vpd and absorbed shortwave radiation while ignoring the carbon exchange of the plant canopy under the framework of optimal stomatal behavior theory cowan and farquhar 1977 a new class of g c model called optimal stomatal conductance model osm was successively proposed arneth et al 2002 katul et al 2009 medlyn et al 2011 wang et al 2017 the osm follows the principle that plants can fix maximum carbon photosynthesis while losing minimum water transpiration at a specific time by stomatal regulation and assumes the marginal wue for plants is a constant lin et al 2015 lu et al 2020 medlyn et al 2011 compared to the jarvis or bbl model the osm put more emphasis on carbon water exchange within plants thus has been applied in the land surface models de kauwe et al 2015 and hydrological models launiainen et al 2019 despite the strong relationship between canopy carbon assimilation and transpiration there is a lack of studies on the comprehensive evaluation of optimality based g c model embedded in the tseb anderson et al 2008 zhan and kustas 2001 kustas et al 2003 li et al 2006 and li et al 2019c suggested the parameterizations for vegetation and soil in flux estimations are worth of attention considering the inaccessibility of global soil moisture at fine temporal spatial resolution ahlmer et al 2018 and the decoupling between the water content in the upper and deeper soil layers capehart and carlson 1997 carranza et al 2018 gan et al 2019 revised the gc tseb to derive soil evaporation relying on the complementary concept and surface dryness index sdi gao et al 2016 instead of the original tseb scheme requiring soil moisture content as model input kustas et al 1998 the difference in the result of model simulations for the combination of the new biophysical constraints and the two soil evaporation schemes can tell us something about vegetation functions and model capabilities of et estimation and partitioning in this study three scenarios one relying on jarvis canopy conductance other on optimal stomatal behavior and other on soil moisture content on the framework of the gc tseb model were set for predictions of le c and le s based on observations from 15 fluxnet sites over six vegetation biomes the questions to be answered are as follows 1 which kind of parameterization has the best performance over different ecosystems and under specific climatic conditions such as drought 2 do the biophysical constraints have a positive effect on the model simulation if so how does it improve the energy distribution et partitioning and lst prediction in conductance based tseb 3 compared with the calibration against ec measurements what is the applicability of the gc tseb model calibrated by remote sensed lst 2 methods and data 2 1 model description the input of net radiation r n w m2 for the gc tseb model is highlighted as

gc tsebosm gc tsebswc were set up to calculate the heat flux of canopy and soil fig 1 1 gc tsebo in gc tsebo the following calculation procedures and resistance network are consistent with the gc tseb model revised by gan et al 2019 the energy distribution of the canopy can be estimated as 4 h c le c r nc 5 h c ρ c p t c t a r a r b 6 le c ρ c p γ e s t c e a r a r c where h c and le c are the sensible heat flux and latent heat flux of canopy w m2 t a and t c are the air and canopy temperature k respectively e a and e s t c are the vapor pressure kpa at atmosphere and canopy respectively ρ

and d 50 need to be calibrated for each site and the boundaries of all model parameters are shown in table 1 similarly the net radiation of soil can be resolved into sensible heat flux h s w m2 latent heat flux le s w m2 and soil heat flux g w m2 8 h s le s g r ns 9 h s ρ c p t s t a r a r s 10 g α g r ns where t s is the soil temperature k r s is the under canopy resistance s m see appendix b α g is the ratio of soil heat flux over net radiation of soil and needs to be calibrated in gc tseb the latent heat flux of the soil layer is calculated based on the complementary concept expressed as the product of potential evaporation le s p m w m2 and relative evaporative fraction f p gan et al 2019 gao et al 2016 instead of mass transfer and soil moisture kustas et al 1998 11 le s le s p m f p le

soil layer kpa respectively a pm and b pm are the empirical parameter of relative evaporation fraction and need to be calibrated 2 gc tsebosm the resistance network of gc tsebosm is in agreement with that of gc tsebo the heat flux of canopy and soil can be derived from eq 4 6 and eq 8 14 respectively to consider the effect of carbon uptake in simulations we use the osm g s mol m2 s 1 mol m2 s 41 03 m s proposed by medlyn et al 2011 to replace leuning s conductance model 15 g s g 0 1 6 1 g 1 d s a n c s where a n is the net assimilation rate μ mol m2 s c s is the co2 concentration at leaf surface μ mol mol d s is the vapor pressure deficit at leaf surface kpa the g s is related to the exchange of carbon in leaf scale and vapor pressure deficit g 0 represents the minimum stomatal conductance at nighttime mol m2 s and can be ignored as the value is far less than g s de kauwe et al 2015 launiainen et al 2019 the stomatal slope g 1 kpa0 5 is closely linked to the marginal water cost of carbon and the co2 compensation point to scale from leaf to canopy g s can be calculated by integrating leaf level l from the canopy top as a function of lai within the canopy profile blonquist et al 2009a 16 gc 0 lai g s d l following hu et al 2018 gpp can be divided into lai and gpp leaf μ mol m2 s the latter equivalent to leaf scale a n 17 gpp gpp leaf l a i combining eq 15 17 the canopy conductance model can be approximated as follows 18 g c 1 6 1 g 1 d a gpp c a where d s and c s was replaced by the vapor pressure deficit d a and co2 concentration in the atmosphere c a above the canopy at the ecosystem level respectively in this study g 1 need to be calibrated for each site 3 gc tsebswc the setting of gc tsebswc is mainly based on the work of kustas et al 1998 and gan and gao 2015 unlike gc tsebo or gc tsebosm the soil latent heat flux in gc tsebswc was calculated as kustas et al 1998 li et al 2006 19 le s ρ c p γ h r e s t s e a r a r s r ss the calculation of the relative air humidity at the surface of soil layer h r is shown in appendix b the soil resistance r ss s m can be expressed as a function of soil moisture w and saturated soil moisture w sat sellers et al 1992 20 r ss e x p a 0 a 1 w w sat where a 0 and a 1 are the empirical parameter of r ss and need to be calibrated the comparison of resistances network for gc tsebo gc tsebosm and gc tsebswc is shown in fig 1 the procedure of gc tseb is detailed in gan and gao 2015 which is only briefly introduced here first the initial lst in eq 1 is set as air temperature second the t c can be determined from eq 4 6 through the newton raphson iteration approach and t s can be derived from eq 8 14 or eq 8 10 and 19 20 in gc tsebswc then substitute the t c and t s in eq 21 norman et al 1995 and lst new can be obtained the iterative procedures will be repeated with the updated lst new until the estimated lst satisfies the condition lst new l s t 0 1 k finally h c and h s can be derived from eq 5 and 9 while le c and le s are obtained from eq 6 and 11 or eq 19 in gc tsebswc 21 lst new f c t c 1 f c t s 4 1 4 22 f c 1 e x p 0 5 l a i where f c is the vegetation fraction 2 2 data 2 2 1 fluxnet2015 datasets eddy covariance ec flux measurements from the fluxnet2015 datasets http fluxnet fluxdata org data fluxnet2015 dataset were used in model evaluation in this study the flux towers were selected mainly based on the following criteria 1 all required data of model input for three scenarios should be available 2 to ensure the land cover is homogeneous within the footprint of flux tower the proportion of major land cover type around the radius of 1 km determined by globeland30 30 m resolution land cover datasets www globallandcover com should exceed 50 li et al 2019a 3 the flux towers were chosen to be distributed across various climate zones the selected 15 representative sites over six different vegetation types namely croplands cro deciduous broadleaf forests dbf evergreen broadleaf forests ebf evergreen needleleaf forests ebf grasslands gra and woody savannas wsa are shown in fig 2 and table s1 the cropping patterns of two croplands sites us ne2 and us ne3 were corn c4 and wheat c3 rotation the former planting in odd years and the latter planting in even years verma et al 2005 the model was run respectively at these two sites according to the cropping time of the two kinds of crops among the study sites the us var gra us wkg gra us srm wsa present arid semi arid climates different from us wkg and us srm where more than half of the precipitation occurs in hot summer scott 2010 scott et al 2009 the us var is located in the mediterranean climate region with dry hot summer and wet cool winter ma et al 2007 the meteorological data including the air temperature vapor pressure deficit incident shortwave and longwave radiation wind speed air pressure and observed le and h were used here besides the simulation of canopy conductance in gc tsebosm requires the input of gpp while shallow soil moisture content is necessary for gc tsebswc see table s2 systematic energy imbalances in ec measurements that the sum of observed le and h usually less than surface available energy rn g are widespread barr et al 2006 twine et al 2000 to minimize the impact of the imbalance the le and h modified by the bowen ratio forced closure method liu et al 2011 xu et al 2013 that assumes the bowen ratio h le obtained from the eddy covariance system is accurate were used to calibrate and validate the model in the fluxnet2015 datasets gpp was estimated as the difference between net ecosystem exchange nee and ecosystem respiration reco by two partition methods the first method assesses reco with temperature from nighttime nee observations while the second one with light response curves of daytime nee to the environmental factors bai et al 2018 the appropriate gpp product was selected for each site according to the research by yang et al 2020 making sure the water use efficiency wue estimated by fluxnet data has minimum deviation with the wue estimated by modis data see table s1 2 2 2 modis data the lai albedo and lst used in this study come from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis version 6 the mcd15a3h is a 4 day lai and fpar product http daac ornl gov with a resolution of 500 m produced from the pixel of the highest quality among terra and aqua modis data within a 4 day timespan timesat 3 3 jönsson and eklundh 2004 was applied in data interpolation and smoothing to minimize the influence of noise and retain the original characteristics of the time series the asymmetric gaussians filter jonsson and eklundh 2002 was selected for forests and grasslands while the savitzky golay filter savitzky and golay 1964 for croplands cheng et al 2019 the mcd43a3 is a daily albedo dataset with 500 m pixel size based on the satellite acquisitions of 16 day the savitzky golay filter was used in data smoothing the mod11 l2 and myd11 l2 are near instantaneous lst and emissivity datasets produced by the split window algorithm and have a resolution of 1 km modis lst in this study was used to calibrate model parameters 2 3 model calibration and validation to avoid the effects of winter snows the study was carried out in the growing season mostly from mid april to mid october which was determined based on lai l a i 0 2 l a i m a x and latitude of each site the time when le h r s and gpp less than 0 in the dataset were excluded we applied two strategies to calibrate the model parameters in this study one relied on ec measured le and h while the other using modis lst as target gan and gao 2015 the calibration datasets for each site were constructed firstly flux data lst data and model input variables were all selected from the time when the modis lst data had high quality with both q u a l i t y c o n t r o l 0 and v i e w a n g l e 45 gan and gao 2015 the overpass time of terra and aqua satellites are around 10 30 am and 1 30 pm local time wan et al 2004 in calibration datasets the quality flags of data from fluxnet2015 data must equal 0 gan et al 2019 the value of the rmse between observations and simulations for either heat fluxes and lst was minimized at each site based on the annealing algorithm dekkers and aarts 1991 kirkpatrick et al 1983 with optimized values of parameters the model with different scenarios was run at all sites during the entire study period and the results were applied for model evaluation the flowchart of model calibration is shown in fig 3 and the ranges of model parameters can be found in table 1 considering that one calibration may lead contingency to the results of the model the above calibration steps were repeated ten times at each site and the one that worked best was selected as the final result 2 4 evaluation of model performance under different scenarios four statistical indicators r2 rmse bias and taylor skill scores s taylor 2001 yao et al 2017 were used in the model evaluation as follows 23 r i 1 n sim i sim obs i obs i 1 n sim i sim 2 i 1 n obs i obs 2 24 rmse i 1 n sim i obs i 2 n 25 bias i 1 n sim i obs i n 26 s 4 1 r 4 δ 1 δ 2 1 r max where sim and obs mean simulated and observed value respectively and n is the number of samples r max is the maximum of r set as 1 δ is the standard deviation of observations from 0 to 1 the larger the value of s the more skill the model is 2 5 sensitivity analysis to resistances the resistance networks r a r b r c r s and r ss in the three scenarios fig 1 is mainly modified from the framework of gc tseb gan et al 2019 to quantify the influence of different resistances on model simulation particularly the le the sensitivity analysis test was carried out first the values of the resistances were extracted from the simulation output under the three scenarios of each site second set the changes of every resistance at 50 40 30 20 10 0 10 20 30 40 and 50 third the model was run 11 times for each resistance term with the unchanged input and changed values of target resistance then repeat the above steps for each resistance the rmse of simulated and measured le in every group was recorded finally plot the results in the boxplot the larger the width of the box the higher the sensitivity of this parameter 2 6 et partitioning validation to examine the reliability of et partitioning under three scenarios two t et estimates with and without ec measurements were taken as benchmarks the first one is the exponential curve of t et and lai derived from wang et al 2014 and wei et al 2017 27 t et a lai b where a and b are fitting parameters based on large observations for each biome the 15 sites were grouped into four categories crop us arm us ne1 us ne2 us ne3 board leaf forests de hai us mms us wcr au tum needle leaf forests ca qfo fi hyy and grasses and shrubs at neu it mbo us var us wkg us srm the second one is based on the concept of underlying water use efficiency uwue eq 28 zhou et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 argued that t et can be expressed as the ratio of apparent uwue uwue a and potential uwue uwue p with the former the upper bound of the relationship between hourly or half hourly gpp and vpd0 5 determined by 95th percentile quantile regression the latter the slope of the linear regression between gpp and vpd0 5 under specific time scale daily in this study 28 uwue gpp vpd et 29 t et uwue a uwue p 2 7 gc estimation by inverting the pm model two types of g c model put forward by leuning et al 2008 and medlyn et al 2011 respectively were applied in this study to validate the abilities of different models to predict et the g c estimations and observations were compared it is hard to observe the g c directly usually g c can be estimated from ec le measurements li et al 2019a medlyn et al 2017 shan et al 2019 rearranging the pm model eq 12 g c is calculated as follows 30 g c γ l e δ r n g r a δ γ l e r a ρ c p d a 3 results 3 1 overall model evaluation for different scenarios for the half hourly or hourly le table 2 during the entire study periods the r2 under gc tsebo ranged from 0 37 to 0 82 with an average of 0 61 the rmse was 81 5 19 0 w m2 accounting for 47 4 of the observed le 172 w m2 the average of absolute bias was 9 80 s ranged from 0 28 to 0 82 with an average of 0 55 the r2 under gc tsebosm ranged from 0 49 to 0 84 with an average of 0 71 the rmse was 68 2 13 8 w m2 accounting for 39 7 of the observed le the average of absolute bias was 7 79 s ranged from 0 48 to 0 84 with an average of 0 68 the r2 under gc tsebswc ranged from 0 01 to 0 87 with an average of 0 45 the rmse was 105 4 35 5 w m2 accounting for 61 3 of the observed le the average of absolute bias was 21 31 s ranged from 0 06 to 0 87 with an average of 0 47 it can be found from the scatterplots fig 4 that the simulated le for gc tsebo and gc tsebswc was overestimated when the measured data was relatively small less than 200 w m2 particularly over croplands grasslands and woody savannas the model performances from ten calibrations in each scenario are shown in fig 5 overall the model performed well at most sites in gc tsebosm the average r2 for le and h over croplands forests dbf ebf and enf and woody savannas was greater than 0 6 there were certain differences between the four grasslands sites at neu it mbo us var and us wkg the simulation was best at at neu average r2 0 82 while worst at us wkg average r2 0 45 the average rmse for le and h under gc tsebosm was less than 90 and 80 w m2 respectively the performance of the model for gc tsebo and gc tsebswc varied over the different ecosystems at the forest sites the difference between the three scenarios was not obvious but there existed a highly significant distinction at four cropland sites us arm us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 the simulation of le and h under gc tsebosm was far superior to that under gc tsebo and gc tsebswc the model performance of three scenarios at semiarid sites us var and us wkg were closer to the croplands sites and the results from us srm wsa were also similar the most challenging site seemed to be for the mediterranean climatic semiarid steppe us var with better performance for gc tsebosm in terms of r2 and rmse at daytime scales the gc tsebosm r2 0 83 rmse 0 64 mm and bias 4 62 also clearly outperformed gc tsebo r2 0 68 rmse 0 87 mm and bias 4 76 and gc tsebswc r2 0 43 rmse 1 23 mm and bias 5 01 fig 6 besides the slope of the linear fitting curve in gc tsebosm 0 83 was closer to 1 than that in gc tsebo 0 70 and gc tsebswc 0 60 the taylor diagrams of daytime et fig 7 illustrate that gc tsebosm had good performances at most sites comparing to gc tsebosm gc tsebo performed well at all six forest sites and two grasslands sites at neu and it mbo but poorly at all four cropland sites and semiarid sites where g c had a critical role us wkg gra and us srm wsa gc tsebswc produced simulations of low quality results in most cases 3 2 evaluation of seasonal h and le simulations for three scenarios to understand the power of the model in the vegetation growing stage seasonal simulations in le are illustrated in fig 8 and s1 the results of h can be found in supplement materials fig s2 the phenology of le and h simulations was in good agreement with the ec measurements at all six forest sites and the two grasslands sites located at temperate climates at neu and it mbo but for croplands the results showed a striking difference between the three scenarios taking us ne1 as an example measured le formed a bell shaped curve while measured h formed a u shaped curve during the growing season gc tsebosm well captured the dynamic changes of le and h at different stages along with the growth of crops however the simulations of gc tsebo and gc tsebswc were not satisfactory the growing rate and senescence of le in gc tsebo and gc tsebswc was relatively smooth and there were some overestimation and underestimation in the early and middle stages of the growing period respectively more worrying the phenology of h in the two scenarios showed a bell shape similar to the le phenology with a pattern peaking in the middle growing stage but opposite to the measured phenology for gc tsebo and gc tsebosm the same deviations also existed for other cropland sites us ne2 us ne3 and us arm at the semiarid sites us var gra us wkg gra and us srm wsa gc tsebosm also worked better than gc tsebo and gc tsebswc because the latter two failed to capture the rapid changes at the early and mid of growth stage 3 3 model sensitivity to resistances there were five resistances r a r b r c r s and r ss in gc tsebswc with the largest width of the box in the rmse boxplots the r c was the key parameter at most sites in contrast the influence of r b on the simulation was the smallest fig 9 and s3 the sensitivity of other resistances varied among different biome types the sensitivity of r s and r a was worthy of attention particularly at grasslands sites us var it mbo and at neu for croplands the r ss also played an important role in le simulations second only to r c the results of sensitivity analysis under gc tsebo and gc tsebosm were more complex although there were just four resistances r a r b r c and r s the r c showed the highest sensitivity than other resistances especially at most forest and cropland sites which agreed with the performance of gc tsebswc however though the sensitivity level of r c at grasslands us var us wkg it mbo and at neu and croplands us ne1 and us ne2 c4 was similar to that in gc tsebswc the roles of r a and r s were larger as a whole the r c that is the canopy resistance was the key element in the resistance network of gc tseb over most plant types and scenarios 3 4 t et variations with lai and season fig 10 illustrates the comparisons of t et across four main biomes for each scenario and the exponential curve by wei et al 2017 varies with modis lai compared with wei s curve there were obvious differences between the t et patterns of three scenarios the t et of gc tsebosm revealed a general trend of increase with lai particularly in crops and forests the t et patterns of gc tsebswc varied widely among biomes that is increased with lai for crops as well as grasses and shrubs while fluctuated violently in forests however the t et for gc tsebo always approached 1 and does not vary significantly with lai overall though a little overestimated in forests the t et produced by gc tsebosm was the closest match to wei s results across the biomes than the other two scenarios the daily t et time series of nine representative sites with significant seasonal variation were also compared taking the results by uwue method zhou et al 2016 as reference as shown in fig 11 the estimated t et under gc tsebosm changed with lai during the vegetation growth period which was closer to uwue curves especially in the croplands there were significant overestimations of t et in gc tsebswc although it had some seasonal variation moreover t et was often greater than 1 at the peak of the growing season it is remarkable that t et of gc tsebo had gross deviations in more than half of the sites basically constant at 1 4 discussion 4 1 capacity of different models for g c estimation the determination of resistances especially the surface resistance is more significant even than the intrinsic model structure for example the widely used pm model ershadi et al 2015 similarly different types of resistances also control the heat and mass transfer between soil canopy and atmosphere in the tseb model as described in section 3 3 canopy conductance played the most important role in le simulation fig 9 and s3 two types of conductance models were applied in our study leuning s conductance model rlm and the upscaled optimal stomatal conductance model osm the intercomparison of the two conductance models at the daily at nine representative sites is illustrated in fig 12 and the rest in fig s4 the intercomparison at sub daily scales can be found in fig s5 daily g c calculated by the inverted pm equation represented as g c p m is also shown in fig 12 and s4 the change of daily averaged g c tended to follow the growth state that is it increased with the vegetation growing until reaching a peak in the middle of the growing season and then gradually dropped fig 12 and s4 the g c calculated by osm had a larger fluctuation with the evolution of the growth period which was close to zero in the low lai phases but a little higher than the value of rlm when vegetation growing vigorously in this case the gap between the valley value and the peak value was larger while the variation of the g c sequence by rlm was relatively gentle looking at diurnal variation fig s5 both rlm and osm showed a bell shape with time the difference was that the canopy conductance calculated by rlm reached its maximum during a day around 7 a m while that of osm was from 9 a m to noon although the estimated g c of both models followed the phenology of lai the g c estimated by osm more agreed with g c p m fig 12 and s4 during the growing seasons especially at cropland us ne1 us ne2 us ne3 and us arm and semiarid sites us var us wkg and us srm moreover the simulated values of g c by osm were closer to the peaking time 10 a m to 2 p m reported in observations blonquist et al 2009b köstner et al 1992 yamori et al 2020 for diurnal variation than those of rlm previous studies bai et al 2019 li et al 2019a li et al 2015 shan et al 2019 stoy et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 have substantiated that providing an exact calculation of g c is essential to estimate et and reduce the uncertainty for et partition in this research osm had advanced performances in g c estimation than rlm correspondingly though gc tsebo and gc tsebosm had the same mass and energy transfer algorithm for canopy and soil layer the accuracy for le and h simulations was improved with g c estimated through osm gc tsebosm the osm estimated g c taking the account of vapor pressure deficit co2 concentration and gpp being the latter is a key factor to characterize vegetation physiological status however the simulation of g c by rlm was mainly based on meteorological variables such as solar radiation water vapor deficit but didn t consider the vegetation growth process according to eq 7 the g c derived by rlm was proportional to the visible radiation and inversely proportional to the vapor pressure deficit the two environmental factors both increased with time in the morning which led g c to peaking very early before 9 a m rather than midday li et al 2019a reported that the gpp outperformed lai and vis ndvi and evi in predicting g c and et during vegetation growing seasons since the gpp are more informative about the plant physiological status and the tight coupling between carbon and water exchange further the g c models that rely only on meteorological controls like rlm failed to account for environmental stresses derived from soil water scarcity on g c modeling under low lai or dry conditions particularly in arid and semiarid regions li et al 2015 research about oasis forest ecosystems bai et al 2017 showed that in the early and late days of the phenology cycle even though the temperature and leaf to air vapor pressure deficit were relatively high at noon when solar radiation is strong the cumulation of stomatal conductance from leaves to the canopy scale tended to still show a low level the g c computed by rlm obviously overestimated the canopy conductance of this period especially under croplands before day 136 and after day 270 at us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 further resulting in the high le of gc tsebo and gc tsebswc fig 8 and s1 similar circumstances existed at us var us wkg and us srm sites situated in arid and semiarid regions for us var after day 163 in 2010 this happened because of the decoupling between water supply and energy provision in the mediterranean semiarid ecosystem and the biophysical constraints on et simulation are especially significant garcía et al 2013 furthermore some studies colaizzi et al 2012b semmens et al 2016 reported the thermal based tseb may also overestimate the le at the phases of crop sowing and harvest the overestimation can be corrected by adjusting the α pt and greenness index in the pt formula according to the soil water availability hssaine et al 2018 and the prior field measurements zhang et al 2021 in this study the introduction of reliable canopy conductance into tseb provided a new way to address this deficiency in general the sensitivity of the r c in the osm was equal or small than that of the rlm indicating the robustness of the method fig 9 and s3 additionally in the osm g 1 is a key model parameter that contains the specific information of different biomes the higher the g 1 the lower the water use efficiency of the species medlyn et al 2011 the calibrated g 1 of seven biomes is shown in the fig s6 and the average values were rated the following gra wsa cro c3 ebf dbf cro c4 enf in short the g 1 under grasslands and croplands was larger than that under forests and the g 1 of c3 crop was greater than that of c4 crop which parallels to the relevant researches by lin et al 2015 de kauwe et al 2015 and medlyn et al 2017 although the determination of g 1 was based on model calibration rather than environmental factors such as temperature de kauwe et al 2015 lin et al 2015 precipitation franks et al 2018 and soil moisture de kauwe et al 2015 lin et al 2015 reasonable values were obtained in this study indicating the robustness of the gc tseb model 4 2 et partition and soil evaporation deviation for three scenarios as shown in section 3 4 the t et variation under the three scenarios was quite different overall gc tsebosm had the best performance than gc tsebo and gc tsebswc particularly in grasses shrubs and crops which can be proved by wei s fig 10 and uwue methods fig 11 respectively taking the us ne3 as an example t et of gc tsebosm was around 0 1 0 2 at the early or end growth stage and over 0 9 in summer with an average of 0 60 c3 and 0 61 c4 the values were quite closest to 0 67 estimated by zhou et al 2016 and 0 65 for croplands at the same latitude 38 6 n lian et al 2018 besides canopy transpiration for c4 crops increased rapidly after the beginning of growth and reached its peak faster than c3 crops zhou et al 2016 which was also captured by gc tsebosm however the t et of gc tsebo was basically constant at 1 which means the evapotranspiration is almost equal to the canopy transpiration all the time while negligible soil evaporation the deviations in gc tsebswc mostly occurred when lai was relatively high for each site during these periods estimated t was greater than et that is soil evaporation was negative hence the systematic error in soil evaporation should be responsible for the inaccuracy of t et in both gc tsebo and gc tsebswc according to the previous studies song et al 2016a song et al 2016b the key element of et partition for tseb is the accuracy of the temperature segregation though lst is not the model input in the gc tseb the calculation of le c and le s depends on t c and t s obtained by the iterative operation the lst t c and t s for three scenarios over four sites us ne3 c3 cro de hai dbf ca qfo enf and us var gra were compared in this section as shown in fig s7 estimated lst among the three scenarios was largely consistent indicating that there was little distinction in r n eq 1 but the t c as well as the t s were varied among different scenarios at the early or end growth stage of croplands us ne3 c3 the t c of gc tsebosm was higher than gc tsebo and gc tsebswc leading to the larger h and lower le a similar phenomenon can be found during the dry period of the semiarid grassland site us var correspondingly gc tsebosm outperformed better in fluxes estimation fig 8 s1 and s2 and t et figs 10 and 11 during these periods besides the t s of gc tsebswc was significantly higher than that of the other scenarios in the peak growth period particularly at us ne3 and ca qfo from eq b4 the high t s can cause a very small value of h r thereby the h r e s t s may be less than the e a eq 19 this unreasonable circumstance made le s negative and t et greater than 1 for gc tsebswc at some moments hence for conductance based tseb in this research biophysical constraints improved the accuracy of the temperature segregation and further isolated canopy transpiration and soil evaporation correctly from total et worth noting the estimated le s between gc tsebo and gc tsebosm were very different though the algorithm of soil energy fluxes was the same as mentioned above the estimation of le s in gc tsebo and gc tsebosm was based on complementary theory and sdi eq 11 14 to avoid the error caused by the decoupling of soil moisture and soil evaporation soil temperature was incorporated into the calculation of sdi gao et al 2016 however the relationship between soil evaporation and soil temperature is nonlinear which may easily lead to instability in the numerical solution still take us ne3 as an example it is found from table s4 and s5 that the a pm and b pm for c3 c4 crop in gc tsebo were 0 04 0 02 and 14 27 9 88 respectively while the two parameters in gc tsebosm were 0 01 0 01 and 6 57 6 54 the high values of two calibrated parameters a pm and b pm can lead to a low value of f p eq 13 further resulting in underestimation for soil evaporation as discussed in section 4 1 g c by rlm was overestimated under low lai or dry conditions fig 12 and s4 leading to the overestimation of le c to realize the energy balance and make the total le close to the ec observations the value of f p was minimized under gc tsebo to reduce the le s gan et al 2019 suggested that a pm and b pm should be adjusted for seasonal variations and constrained by prior knowledge that is when f c 2 a pm and b pm are set to 0 05 and 8 0 respectively while set to 0 01 and 7 2 respectively when f c greater than 2 however this constraint on parameters may be not necessarily applicable to all underlying surfaces for different characters of mass and energy transfer which limits the application of the model even though the values of a pm and b pm for gc tsebo and gc tsebosm were relatively close at some sites such as us ne1 and us wkg the partition for canopy transpiration and soil evaporation of gc tsebosm seemed still better in terms of dynamics and magnitude than that of gc tsebo good performance for gc tsebosm offered a solution in such a case under the premise of the same parameter scope and strategy for calibration when vegetation physiological control was added to the mass transfer of canopy the systematic error of soil evaporation in gc tseb can be corrected to a great extent simultaneously 4 3 estimated lst assessment for the flux calibrated and lst calibrated model as the sparse distribution of flux sites the general practice in upscaling the et models from single points to regional level is to set fixed parameters for common biomes or plant functional types pft mu et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 this approach may lead to some uncertainty in et estimation when keeping the biophysical parameters fixed in various climatic zones mu et al 2011 the efficiency of lst on gc tseb calibration has been verified in prior studies gan and gao 2015 gan et al 2019 in this section the model calibration based on modis lst was also implemented under gc tsebosm the best scheme under flux calibration to eliminate the potential for deviation the specific range of g 1 in osm for each biome was determined referring to the research by medlyn et al 2017 and the calibration results against ec observations see table s7 the daily et simulation in the lst calibration version is provided in table 3 the daily estimated lst was also compared with lst derived from longwave net radiation burchard levine et al 2020 at 13 sites table 4 but there weren t data available at us wcr and fi hyy lst calibrated model had good performances at most sites with average r2 0 82 average rmse 0 69 mm average bias 4 90 and average s 0 79 the most satisfactory results were obtained over croplands and grasslands as shown in fig 8 and s1 the simulations had high daily concordance with both ec measurements and the simulations calibrated using observed flux besides the results of et partitioning were quite similar in two calibrations fig 10 gc tseb presented excellent performances for lst simulation under both flux and lst calibrations with rmse and bias less than 5 of mean values k at most sites remarkably relatively higher bias greater than 15 in et estimation was found over forests ca qfo fi hyy de hai and us mms or woodland savanna us srm though the lst estimated by lst calibrated model was even better than that by flux calibrated model at these biomes to explore the reasons behind the different lst calibrated model performance over various biomes estimated lst of calibration groups for flux calibration the three scenarios and lst calibration gc tsebosm were compared at modis overpass time with modis lst see fig 13 and s8 and table s9 for croplands data points mainly scatter around the 1 1 straight line besides the estimated lst for the two calibration versions is consistent similar to the results of et estimation gc tsebosm flux calibrated and lst calibrated outperforms the other two scenarios which confirmed that the important role of biophysical constraints in water flux and lst simulation for croplands at forest ecosystems the lst is a little overestimated by flux calibrated models compared to flux calibration the rmse and bias of estimated lst for lst calibration were decreased remarkably at the daily scale table 4 and modis overpass time table s9 however the et simulation was not improved it seems that the connection between the simulation accuracy of lst and et by gc tseb was not close for forest sites that means there are some drawbacks in flux decomposition or lst combination when the tseb is applied in forest ecosystems also reported in cui et al 2021 lst is regarded as a complex mixture of soil temperature and canopy temperature whose spatio temporal variation is very susceptible to the soil texture vegetation coverage and topography li et al 2013 wang et al 2020 the hierarchical canopy structure and undergrowth in the forests may produce profound influences on lst and r n in gc tseb the r n decomposition into canopy and soil layer followed exponential attenuation determined by lai zenith angle and dissipation coefficient eq 2 3 the lst combination from t c and t s was just relied on vegetation fraction eq 21 thus to further improve the applicability of the model in forest ecosystem it is vital to take the impact of canopy structure on flux and lst into account in modeling though both flux calibrated and lst calibrated gc tsebosm achieved ideal results in et estimation over grassland sites table 3 lst estimation was inferior to that over forests and croplands fig 13 different from the forest sites the lst estimated by the lst calibrated model agreed well with that by the flux calibrated model over grasslands fig 13 and s8 which means the deviation for lst is not caused by the poor application of the lst combination algorithm to explore the real reasons for lst overestimation at grasslands it is necessary to analyze the simulated energy fluxes and the iterative operation process of the model as shown in fig 11 the t et for the grassland sites us var and us wkg was overestimated to some extent particularly in gc tsebo and gc tsebosm however there was no significant large positive bias in total le for all three scenarios except the us wkg in gc tsebswc table 2 indicating that the underestimation for le s and overestimation for le c le c overestimation can be confirmed by the overestimation of g c fig 12 and s4 and high values of stomatal slope g 1 gc tsebosm fig s6 and table s5 at all grassland sites because the le c is proportionate to the g c eq 6 on the other hand to realize the energy balance for soil layer the t s was also amplified to increase h s eq 9 ultimately leading to the overestimation for lst in the final analysis there exists systematic negative deviation in le s over grassland sites one possible reason for the underestimation of le s is the overestimation of r s research conducted by morillas et al 2013 found the residual estimation of le in the thermal based tseb is overestimated while h is underestimated at mediterranean semiarid grasslands then kustas et al 2016 confirmed the conclusion of morillas et al 2013 and pointed the deviation for fluxes is caused by r s overestimation and the aerodynamic properties of semiarid grasslands vegetation villagarcía et al 2007 different from the original scheme for tseb r s formula eq b3 put forward by zeng et al 2005 was applied in the gc tseb but the formula and the fixed parameters seemed to be not fit for grasslands ecosystems for the high sensitivity for r s to le at us var us wkg fig 9 at neu and it mbo fig s3 for gc tsebo and gc tsebosm the r s and r a played a role not only in mass and energy transfer equations of soil but also in the formulation of potential evaporation and relative evaporative fraction eq 12 and 14 thus the negative impact for the deviation of r s on le s was amplified recently li et al 2019c presented an r s formula based on near surface turbulence around arid vegetation structural properties for tseb and proved robust of the new model without coefficients adjustment over the semiarid and arid grasslands which may provide a solution to correct le s underestimation in the gc tseb to sum up optimizing the model parameters by remote sensing lst is more suitable for applications in land surfaces with low vegetation and simple canopy structure such as croplands and grasslands care should be taken in applications over the forests for the possible rather large bias 4 4 uncertainties and future developments calibrated by limited flux data modis overpass time three types of gc tseb with different parameterizations were applied in six biomes gan and gao 2015 proved the accessibility of leuning s g c model to constrain the le c as alternatives of pt formulation kustas et al 1998 in tseb model in this study gc tsebosm showed clear advantages for et estimation and partitioning than the original gc tseb gc tsebo gan et al 2019 and gc tsebswc with soil moisture constraints gan and gao 2015 kustas et al 1998 which demonstrates the important role of effective biophysical constraints on the tseb model modis lst calibrated gc tsebosm also obtained similar results like flux calibrated model and had great potential for regional applications though gc tsebswc had good performances at some sites such as at neu and it mbo the simulations were barely satisfactory at croplands and drylands when the soil moisture is very low soil moisture and soil resistance became very little simultaneously eq 19 and 20 led to the large bias of soil evaporation moreover soil surface energy is controlled by surface soil moisture conditions around millimeters under surface which is not equivalent to the swc usually measured at a depth of 2 cm or more below the ground gao et al 2016 though global surface soil moisture can be estimated from microwave based satellites and land surface models kim et al 2020 i e ascat 12 5 km smos 35 50 km smap 9 km gldas 0 25 and gleam 0 25 there is a lack of fine pixel scale 1km soil moisture to constraint et models the algorithm based on sdi and the potential evaporation worked very well at most sites especially under gc tsebosm which proved the power of soil temperature in indicating the surface dryness and estimating soil evaporation though gc tsebosm performed well at six ecosystems there are some shortcomings to be noted first the radiation partitioning was mainly based on lai in this study this method has poor applicability in sparse vegetation regions where the soil temperature is relatively high morillas et al 2013 besides the amount of sunlit and shaded leaves also have an unavoidable influence on radiation transfer through complex canopies chen et al 1999 the errors from energy decomposing may finally lead to the deviation in et partitioning second interception evaporation i from canopy was ignored in et modeling which accounts for a certain proportion of the total et in forests wei et al 2017 this explains the overestimation of t et at forest sites and t et predicted by gc tseb is approximate to t i et gan et al 2019 third gc tsebosm required gpp estimated from ec measurements as model input instead of gpp measurements some gpp submodels such as the light use efficiency lue model hu et al 2013 and rectangular hyperbola function model zhang et al 2019 were introduced into the et models to predict et moreover solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif was proved to correlate well to canopy conductance shan et al 2019 and transpiration lu et al 2018 maes et al 2020 remote sensed sif from field to regional scales may become a new proxy for predicting the water and energy fluxes 5 conclusions in this study the three scenarios were set up to evaluate the resistances network and parameterization of a conductance based tseb model gc tseb based on the observation of 15 fluxnet sites over six ecosystems the three scenarios were assessed from different perspectives the main conclusions are as follows 1 overall the model combined with osm and the complementary concept gc tsebosm performed well in all biomes the version incorporating rlm and the complementary concept gc tsebo runs a close second while the model gc tsebswc taking the soil moisture into account comes a poor third moreover the diurnal variation of daytime energy exchange for gc tsebosm is closest to ec measurements 2 the canopy conductance canopy resistance is the most sensitive for et simulations at most sites compared with rlm osm can better capture the dynamic change of canopy conductance especially in the low lai stage 3 the seasonal variation of t et for gc tsebosm is roughly consistent with results based on wei s and uwue methods in particular over the croplands and grasslands the inaccuracy of t et for two other scenarios is largely due to the systematic error of soil evaporation 4 the performance of the model calibrated by lst agreed with that of the model calibrated by flux data in croplands and grasslands since the estimated lst of two calibration versions is consistent whereas high bias was observed at some forest sites credit authorship contribution statement jingyi bu methodology software writing original draft writing review

3892,evapotranspiration et plays an indispensable role in water carbon energy exchange between the land surface and atmosphere biophysical constraints like the canopy conductance lie the key to accurate prediction of plant transpiration t and soil evaporation e in et models given the lack of comprehensive evaluation for resistances network in conductance based two source energy balance model tseb three scenarios gc tsebo gc tsebosm and gc tsebswc were assessed on the frame of gc tseb one relying on jarvis canopy conductance other on optimal stomatal behavior and other on soil moisture content with forcing data from modis datasets and in situ fluxnet sites over six biome types the et simulated by the model combined with the optimal stomatal behavior and the complementary concept had higher values of r2 and taylor skill scores lower values of rmse and bias than the other two scenarios particularly over cropland sites and arid semi arid sites where the other two failed the sensitivity analysis for gc tseb resistances elucidated that the effect of canopy conductance is more noticeable on et simulation than the other resistances when effective biophysical constraints on the canopy are lacking a large deviation exists in et partitioning mainly due to the systematic error of soil evaporation through the partitioning algorithm for soil and plant fluxes we assessed the performance of calibration from modis land surface temperature lst instead of flux data the lst calibrated model performed better in croplands and grasslands compared to forest sites which opens a good perspective to advance the model for operational applications in agriculture and herbaceous vegetation keywords evapotranspiration gc tseb optimal stomatal model complementary concept modis lst 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a crucial element of water and energy exchange in the soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat continuum monteith 1965 olioso et al 1999 half of the solar radiation reaching the land surface is converted to latent heat flux le driving the water back to the atmosphere as vapor trenberth et al 2009 et makes up the second largest water flux in the water cycle and ranks behind only precipitation accounting for about 65 of precipitation oki and kanae 2006 et consists mainly of canopy transpiration t and soil evaporation e the former coupled with plant photosynthesis the latter regarded as a physical process stoy et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 the ratio of transpiration and evapotranspiration t et on the ecosystems reflects the impact and feedback of vegetation physiological processes on climate change and energy balance gan et al 2021 jasechko et al 2013 lian et al 2018 stoy et al 2019 the t and e can be measured directly by some techniques such as plant level sap flow sakuratani 1981 radio isotopic jasechko et al 2013 and so on but with the high cost and low stability alternatively some et partitioning methods were developed using eddy covariance ec observations usually relied on water use efficiency wue zhou et al 2016 optimality theory assumption berkelhammer et al 2016 and ecosystem conductance li et al 2019b however these methods were derived from the tight relationship between t and half hourly ec gross primary productivity gpp and thus limited by the spatial and temporal scale of in situ measurements lian et al 2018 based on global measurements of e t et and leaf area index lai wang et al 2014 confirmed t et positively related to lai over agricultural and natural vegetations and built an exponential regression between them subsequently wei et al 2017 retrieved the regression parameters to six ecosystems using abundant observations and the ratio of t to et was mapped globally using remote sensing lai datasets and the fraction of land cover classes though lai is a good and simple indicator of t et the uncertainty existed in the performance of the regression approach over various biomes with the coefficient of determination r2 varying from 0 43 to 0 87 wei et al 2017 lai and vegetation indexes vis are short of powerful enough explanations to t when responding to environmental stresses li et al 2019a li et al 2015 compared to lai and vis the stomatal activities of vegetation directly impact the transpiration rate shan et al 2019 stoy et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 which is hard to be captured by satellites two source et models can simulate the processes of terrestrial water exchange and heat transfer and offer an effective way to estimate t and e spatially and temporally chen and liu 2020 li et al 2009 three types of remote sensing et models have been applied successfully to et partitioning 1 surface energy balance models kustas and norman 1999 norman et al 1995 2 penman monteith pm or priestley taylor pt formulas combined with remote sensing data fisher et al 2008 garcía et al 2013 hu et al 2009 mu et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 3 vegetation index radiative surface temperature models long and singh 2012 pm type and pt type models combine the surface energy balance and mass transfer and give the explicit expression to et driven by atmospheric forcing and vegetation indexes the optimization of key parameters to constrain t and e mainly relies on ec measurements mu et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 however the sparse distribution of flux sites and limitation of observations restrict the capabilities of models to the applications at the regional level land surface temperature lst obtained from thermal infrared remote sensing can provide global coverage and instantaneous observations guillevic et al 2014 ridler et al 2014 tomlinson et al 2011 which can match the spatiotemporal scale of the et model simulation energy balance models take remote sensing lst as model input to achieve surface energy closure and then obtain et as the residual of available surface energy and sensible heat fluxes bastiaanssen et al 1998 thus avoiding parameters calibration the two source energy balance model tseb kustas and norman 1999 was developed from the n95 model norman et al 1995 which divides available energy into canopy and soil layers and establishes separate energy balance for the two systems the sensible heat flux of canopy and soil can be estimated based on canopy temperature t c and soil temperature t s respectively while latent heat fluxes of canopy le c and soil le s as the residual of two energy balance morillas et al 2013 the initial t c is derived from le c calculated by pt formula and the α pt can be adjusted if the case e 0 in the daytime appears during the iteration procedure colaizzi et al 2012b morillas et al 2013 song et al 2016b however the first condition α pt 1 3 for iterations is unable to satisfy some specific situations such as full irrigation and strongly advection anderson et al 2011 kustas and norman 1999 song et al 2016b to solve this shortcoming colaizzi et al 2012b used penman monteith approximation instead of pt formula for initial t c morillas et al 2013 and song et al 2016b applied segregated temperatures from proximal sensors and aster tir data respectively as model input avoiding the iteration error from the calculation of initial canopy temperature nevertheless there still exist drawbacks in et estimation and partitioning during the dry and water deficient seasons or under advective conditions hssaine et al 2018 to describe more precisely the vegetation transpiration the canopy conductance g c aggregating leaf stomatal conductance to water flux has been applied to et estimation particularly in pm based models cleugh et al 2007 li et al 2019a li et al 2015 mu et al 2007 yebra et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 the g c is usually predicted by empirical semi empirical or phenomenological models i e jarvis model jarvis 1976 and ball berry leuning bbl model ball et al 1987 leuning et al 1995 gan and gao 2015 coupled a canopy conductance model leuning et al 2008 and mass transfer equation for canopy in the tseb instead of the pt model to estimate the le c the updated conductance based tseb model was named gc tseb comparing to the pt canopy module it is promising to use the gc tseb model to adjust the parameters controlling stomatal conductance flexibly and improve prediction of et and t gan et al 2019 another aspect is that the le and h estimated through radiometric temperature based tseb are instantaneous values at the time of lst observation it s challenging to upscaling the et snapshots to values for daily or longer timescale particularly under cloudy skies colaizzi et al 2014 colaizzi et al 2012a morillas et al 2014 given the explicit form of et gc tseb can produce daily or instantaneous et consistent with continuous meteorological forcing similar to pm models as lst is one of the model outputs rather than input the model parameters can also be calibrated by remote sensing lst in every pixel instead of scarce ec observations gan and gao 2015 whereas the leuning et al 2008 s g c model is an empirical jarvis type model only considering the effect of water vapor pressure deficit vpd and absorbed shortwave radiation while ignoring the carbon exchange of the plant canopy under the framework of optimal stomatal behavior theory cowan and farquhar 1977 a new class of g c model called optimal stomatal conductance model osm was successively proposed arneth et al 2002 katul et al 2009 medlyn et al 2011 wang et al 2017 the osm follows the principle that plants can fix maximum carbon photosynthesis while losing minimum water transpiration at a specific time by stomatal regulation and assumes the marginal wue for plants is a constant lin et al 2015 lu et al 2020 medlyn et al 2011 compared to the jarvis or bbl model the osm put more emphasis on carbon water exchange within plants thus has been applied in the land surface models de kauwe et al 2015 and hydrological models launiainen et al 2019 despite the strong relationship between canopy carbon assimilation and transpiration there is a lack of studies on the comprehensive evaluation of optimality based g c model embedded in the tseb anderson et al 2008 zhan and kustas 2001 kustas et al 2003 li et al 2006 and li et al 2019c suggested the parameterizations for vegetation and soil in flux estimations are worth of attention considering the inaccessibility of global soil moisture at fine temporal spatial resolution ahlmer et al 2018 and the decoupling between the water content in the upper and deeper soil layers capehart and carlson 1997 carranza et al 2018 gan et al 2019 revised the gc tseb to derive soil evaporation relying on the complementary concept and surface dryness index sdi gao et al 2016 instead of the original tseb scheme requiring soil moisture content as model input kustas et al 1998 the difference in the result of model simulations for the combination of the new biophysical constraints and the two soil evaporation schemes can tell us something about vegetation functions and model capabilities of et estimation and partitioning in this study three scenarios one relying on jarvis canopy conductance other on optimal stomatal behavior and other on soil moisture content on the framework of the gc tseb model were set for predictions of le c and le s based on observations from 15 fluxnet sites over six vegetation biomes the questions to be answered are as follows 1 which kind of parameterization has the best performance over different ecosystems and under specific climatic conditions such as drought 2 do the biophysical constraints have a positive effect on the model simulation if so how does it improve the energy distribution et partitioning and lst prediction in conductance based tseb 3 compared with the calibration against ec measurements what is the applicability of the gc tseb model calibrated by remote sensed lst 2 methods and data 2 1 model description the input of net radiation r n w m2 for the gc tseb model is highlighted as

model revised by gan et al 2019 the energy distribution of the canopy can be estimated as 4 h c le c r nc 5 h c ρ c p t c t a r a r b 6 le c ρ c p γ e s t c e a r a r c where h c and le c are the sensible heat flux and latent heat flux of canopy w m2 t a and t c are the air and canopy temperature k respectively e a and e s t c are the vapor pressure kpa at atmosphere and canopy respectively ρ

and d 50 need to be calibrated for each site and the boundaries of all model parameters are shown in table 1 similarly the net radiation of soil can be resolved into sensible heat flux h s w m2 latent

soil layer kpa respectively a pm and b pm are the empirical parameter of relative evaporation fraction and need to be calibrated 2 gc tsebosm the resistance network of gc tsebosm is in agreement with that of gc tsebo the heat flux of canopy and soil can be derived from eq 4 6 and eq 8 14 respectively to consider the effect of carbon uptake in simulations we use the osm g s mol m2 s 1 mol m2 s 41 03 m s proposed by medlyn et al 2011 to replace leuning s conductance model 15 g s g 0 1 6 1 g 1 d s a n c s where a n is the net assimilation rate μ mol m2 s c s is the co2 concentration at leaf surface μ mol mol d s is the vapor pressure deficit at leaf surface kpa the g s is related to the exchange of carbon in leaf scale and vapor pressure deficit g 0 represents the minimum stomatal conductance at nighttime mol m2 s and can be ignored as the value is far less than g s de kauwe et al 2015 launiainen et al 2019 the stomatal slope g 1 kpa0 5 is closely linked to the marginal water cost of carbon and the co2 compensation point to scale from leaf to canopy g s can be calculated by integrating leaf level l from the canopy top as a function of lai within the canopy profile blonquist et al 2009a 16 gc 0 lai g s d l following hu et al 2018 gpp can be divided into lai and gpp leaf μ mol m2 s the latter equivalent to leaf scale a n 17 gpp gpp leaf l a i combining eq 15 17 the canopy conductance model can be approximated as follows 18 g c 1 6 1 g 1 d a gpp c a where d s and c s was replaced by the vapor pressure deficit d a and co2 concentration in the atmosphere c a above the canopy at the ecosystem level respectively in this study g 1 need to be calibrated for each site 3 gc tsebswc the setting of gc tsebswc is mainly based on the work of kustas et al 1998 and gan and gao 2015 unlike gc tsebo or gc tsebosm the soil latent heat flux in gc tsebswc was calculated as kustas et al 1998 li et al 2006 19 le s ρ c p γ h r e s t s e a r a r s r ss the calculation of the relative air humidity at the surface of soil layer h r is shown in appendix b the soil resistance r ss s m can be expressed as a function of soil moisture w and saturated soil moisture w sat sellers et al 1992 20 r ss e x p a 0 a 1 w w sat where a 0 and a 1 are the empirical parameter of r ss and need to be calibrated the comparison of resistances network for gc tsebo gc tsebosm and gc tsebswc is shown in fig 1 the procedure of gc tseb is detailed in gan and gao 2015 which is only briefly introduced here first the initial lst in eq 1 is set as air temperature second the t c can be determined from eq 4 6 through the newton raphson iteration approach and t s can be derived from eq 8 14 or eq 8 10 and 19 20 in gc tsebswc then substitute the t c and t s in eq 21 norman et al 1995 and lst new can be obtained the iterative procedures will be repeated with the updated lst new until the estimated lst satisfies the condition lst new l s t 0 1 k finally h c and h s can be derived from eq 5 and 9 while le c and le s are obtained from eq 6 and 11 or eq 19 in gc tsebswc 21 lst new f c t c 1 f c t s 4 1 4 22 f c 1 e x p 0 5 l a i where f c is the vegetation fraction 2 2 data 2 2 1 fluxnet2015 datasets eddy covariance ec flux measurements from the fluxnet2015 datasets http fluxnet fluxdata org data fluxnet2015 dataset were used in model evaluation in this study the flux towers were selected mainly based on the following criteria 1 all required data of model input for three scenarios should be available 2 to ensure the land cover is homogeneous within the footprint of flux tower the proportion of major land cover type around the radius of 1 km determined by globeland30 30 m resolution land cover datasets www globallandcover com should exceed 50 li et al 2019a 3 the flux towers were chosen to be distributed across various climate zones the selected 15 representative sites over six different vegetation types namely croplands cro deciduous broadleaf forests dbf evergreen broadleaf forests ebf evergreen needleleaf forests ebf grasslands gra and woody savannas wsa are shown in fig 2 and table s1 the cropping patterns of two croplands sites us ne2 and us ne3 were corn c4 and wheat c3 rotation the former planting in odd years and the latter planting in even years verma et al 2005 the model was run respectively at these two sites according to the cropping time of the two kinds of crops among the study sites the us var gra us wkg gra us srm wsa present arid semi arid climates different from us wkg and us srm where more than half of the precipitation occurs in hot summer scott 2010 scott et al 2009 the us var is located in the mediterranean climate region with dry hot summer and wet cool winter ma et al 2007 the meteorological data including the air temperature vapor pressure deficit incident shortwave and longwave radiation wind speed air pressure and observed le and h were used here besides the simulation of canopy conductance in gc tsebosm requires the input of gpp while shallow soil moisture content is necessary for gc tsebswc see table s2 systematic energy imbalances in ec measurements that the sum of observed le and h usually less than surface available energy rn g are widespread barr et al 2006 twine et al 2000 to minimize the impact of the imbalance the le and h modified by the bowen ratio forced closure method liu et al 2011 xu et al 2013 that assumes the bowen ratio h le obtained from the eddy covariance system is accurate were used to calibrate and validate the model in the fluxnet2015 datasets gpp was estimated as the difference between net ecosystem exchange nee and ecosystem respiration reco by two partition methods the first method assesses reco with temperature from nighttime nee observations while the second one with light response curves of daytime nee to the environmental factors bai et al 2018 the appropriate gpp product was selected for each site according to the research by yang et al 2020 making sure the water use efficiency wue estimated by fluxnet data has minimum deviation with the wue estimated by modis data see table s1 2 2 2 modis data the lai albedo and lst used in this study come from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis version 6 the mcd15a3h is a 4 day lai and fpar product http daac ornl gov with a resolution of 500 m produced from the pixel of the highest quality among terra and aqua modis data within a 4 day timespan timesat 3 3 jönsson and eklundh 2004 was applied in data interpolation and smoothing to minimize the influence of noise and retain the original characteristics of the time series the asymmetric gaussians filter jonsson and eklundh 2002 was selected for forests and grasslands while the savitzky golay filter savitzky and golay 1964 for croplands cheng et al 2019 the mcd43a3 is a daily albedo dataset with 500 m pixel size based on the satellite acquisitions of 16 day the savitzky golay filter was used in data smoothing the mod11 l2 and myd11 l2 are near instantaneous lst and emissivity datasets produced by the split window algorithm and have a resolution of 1 km modis lst in this study was used to calibrate model parameters 2 3 model calibration and validation to avoid the effects of winter snows the study was carried out in the growing season mostly from mid april to mid october which was determined based on lai l a i 0 2 l a i m a x and latitude of each site the time when le h r s and gpp less than 0 in the dataset were excluded we applied two strategies to calibrate the model parameters in this study one relied on ec measured le and h while the other using modis lst as target gan and gao 2015 the calibration datasets for each site were constructed firstly flux data lst data and model input variables were all selected from the time when the modis lst data had high quality with both q u a l i t y c o n t r o l 0 and v i e w a n g l e 45 gan and gao 2015 the overpass time of terra and aqua satellites are around 10 30 am and 1 30 pm local time wan et al 2004 in calibration datasets the quality flags of data from fluxnet2015 data must equal 0 gan et al 2019 the value of the rmse between observations and simulations for either heat fluxes and lst was minimized at each site based on the annealing algorithm dekkers and aarts 1991 kirkpatrick et al 1983 with optimized values of parameters the model with different scenarios was run at all sites during the entire study period and the results were applied for model evaluation the flowchart of model calibration is shown in fig 3 and the ranges of model parameters can be found in table 1 considering that one calibration may lead contingency to the results of the model the above calibration steps were repeated ten times at each site and the one that worked best was selected as the final result 2 4 evaluation of model performance under different scenarios four statistical indicators r2 rmse bias and taylor skill scores s taylor 2001 yao et al 2017 were used in the model evaluation as follows 23 r i 1 n sim i sim obs i obs i 1 n sim i sim 2 i 1 n obs i obs 2 24 rmse i 1 n sim i obs i 2 n 25 bias i 1 n sim i obs i n 26 s 4 1 r 4 δ 1 δ 2 1 r max where sim and obs mean simulated and observed value respectively and n is the number of samples r max is the maximum of r set as 1 δ is the standard deviation of observations from 0 to 1 the larger the value of s the more skill the model is 2 5 sensitivity analysis to resistances the resistance networks r a r b r c r s and r ss in the three scenarios fig 1 is mainly modified from the framework of gc tseb gan et al 2019 to quantify the influence of different resistances on model simulation particularly the le the sensitivity analysis test was carried out first the values of the resistances were extracted from the simulation output under the three scenarios of each site second set the changes of every resistance at 50 40 30 20 10 0 10 20 30 40 and 50 third the model was run 11 times for each resistance term with the unchanged input and changed values of target resistance then repeat the above steps for each resistance the rmse of simulated and measured le in every group was recorded finally plot the results in the boxplot the larger the width of the box the higher the sensitivity of this parameter 2 6 et partitioning validation to examine the reliability of et partitioning under three scenarios two t et estimates with and without ec measurements were taken as benchmarks the first one is the exponential curve of t et and lai derived from wang et al 2014 and wei et al 2017 27 t et a lai b where a and b are fitting parameters based on large observations for each biome the 15 sites were grouped into four categories crop us arm us ne1 us ne2 us ne3 board leaf forests de hai us mms us wcr au tum needle leaf forests ca qfo fi hyy and grasses and shrubs at neu it mbo us var us wkg us srm the second one is based on the concept of underlying water use efficiency uwue eq 28 zhou et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 argued that t et can be expressed as the ratio of apparent uwue uwue a and potential uwue uwue p with the former the upper bound of the relationship between hourly or half hourly gpp and vpd0 5 determined by 95th percentile quantile regression the latter the slope of the linear regression between gpp and vpd0 5 under specific time scale daily in this study 28 uwue gpp vpd et 29 t et uwue a uwue p 2 7 gc estimation by inverting the pm model two types of g c model put forward by leuning et al 2008 and medlyn et al 2011 respectively were applied in this study to validate the abilities of different models to predict et the g c estimations and observations were compared it is hard to observe the g c directly usually g c can be estimated from ec le measurements li et al 2019a medlyn et al 2017 shan et al 2019 rearranging the pm model eq 12 g c is calculated as follows 30 g c γ l e δ r n g r a δ γ l e r a ρ c p d a 3 results 3 1 overall model evaluation for different scenarios for the half hourly or hourly le table 2 during the entire study periods the r2 under gc tsebo ranged from 0 37 to 0 82 with an average of 0 61 the rmse was 81 5 19 0 w m2 accounting for 47 4 of the observed le 172 w m2 the average of absolute bias was 9 80 s ranged from 0 28 to 0 82 with an average of 0 55 the r2 under gc tsebosm ranged from 0 49 to 0 84 with an average of 0 71 the rmse was 68 2 13 8 w m2 accounting for 39 7 of the observed le the average of absolute bias was 7 79 s ranged from 0 48 to 0 84 with an average of 0 68 the r2 under gc tsebswc ranged from 0 01 to 0 87 with an average of 0 45 the rmse was 105 4 35 5 w m2 accounting for 61 3 of the observed le the average of absolute bias was 21 31 s ranged from 0 06 to 0 87 with an average of 0 47 it can be found from the scatterplots fig 4 that the simulated le for gc tsebo and gc tsebswc was overestimated when the measured data was relatively small less than 200 w m2 particularly over croplands grasslands and woody savannas the model performances from ten calibrations in each scenario are shown in fig 5 overall the model performed well at most sites in gc tsebosm the average r2 for le and h over croplands forests dbf ebf and enf and woody savannas was greater than 0 6 there were certain differences between the four grasslands sites at neu it mbo us var and us wkg the simulation was best at at neu average r2 0 82 while worst at us wkg average r2 0 45 the average rmse for le and h under gc tsebosm was less than 90 and 80 w m2 respectively the performance of the model for gc tsebo and gc tsebswc varied over the different ecosystems at the forest sites the difference between the three scenarios was not obvious but there existed a highly significant distinction at four cropland sites us arm us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 the simulation of le and h under gc tsebosm was far superior to that under gc tsebo and gc tsebswc the model performance of three scenarios at semiarid sites us var and us wkg were closer to the croplands sites and the results from us srm wsa were also similar the most challenging site seemed to be for the mediterranean climatic semiarid steppe us var with better performance for gc tsebosm in terms of r2 and rmse at daytime scales the gc tsebosm r2 0 83 rmse 0 64 mm and bias 4 62 also clearly outperformed gc tsebo r2 0 68 rmse 0 87 mm and bias 4 76 and gc tsebswc r2 0 43 rmse 1 23 mm and bias 5 01 fig 6 besides the slope of the linear fitting curve in gc tsebosm 0 83 was closer to 1 than that in gc tsebo 0 70 and gc tsebswc 0 60 the taylor diagrams of daytime et fig 7 illustrate that gc tsebosm had good performances at most sites comparing to gc tsebosm gc tsebo performed well at all six forest sites and two grasslands sites at neu and it mbo but poorly at all four cropland sites and semiarid sites where g c had a critical role us wkg gra and us srm wsa gc tsebswc produced simulations of low quality results in most cases 3 2 evaluation of seasonal h and le simulations for three scenarios to understand the power of the model in the vegetation growing stage seasonal simulations in le are illustrated in fig 8 and s1 the results of h can be found in supplement materials fig s2 the phenology of le and h simulations was in good agreement with the ec measurements at all six forest sites and the two grasslands sites located at temperate climates at neu and it mbo but for croplands the results showed a striking difference between the three scenarios taking us ne1 as an example measured le formed a bell shaped curve while measured h formed a u shaped curve during the growing season gc tsebosm well captured the dynamic changes of le and h at different stages along with the growth of crops however the simulations of gc tsebo and gc tsebswc were not satisfactory the growing rate and senescence of le in gc tsebo and gc tsebswc was relatively smooth and there were some overestimation and underestimation in the early and middle stages of the growing period respectively more worrying the phenology of h in the two scenarios showed a bell shape similar to the le phenology with a pattern peaking in the middle growing stage but opposite to the measured phenology for gc tsebo and gc tsebosm the same deviations also existed for other cropland sites us ne2 us ne3 and us arm at the semiarid sites us var gra us wkg gra and us srm wsa gc tsebosm also worked better than gc tsebo and gc tsebswc because the latter two failed to capture the rapid changes at the early and mid of growth stage 3 3 model sensitivity to resistances there were five resistances r a r b r c r s and r ss in gc tsebswc with the largest width of the box in the rmse boxplots the r c was the key parameter at most sites in contrast the influence of r b on the simulation was the smallest fig 9 and s3 the sensitivity of other resistances varied among different biome types the sensitivity of r s and r a was worthy of attention particularly at grasslands sites us var it mbo and at neu for croplands the r ss also played an important role in le simulations second only to r c the results of sensitivity analysis under gc tsebo and gc tsebosm were more complex although there were just four resistances r a r b r c and r s the r c showed the highest sensitivity than other resistances especially at most forest and cropland sites which agreed with the performance of gc tsebswc however though the sensitivity level of r c at grasslands us var us wkg it mbo and at neu and croplands us ne1 and us ne2 c4 was similar to that in gc tsebswc the roles of r a and r s were larger as a whole the r c that is the canopy resistance was the key element in the resistance network of gc tseb over most plant types and scenarios 3 4 t et variations with lai and season fig 10 illustrates the comparisons of t et across four main biomes for each scenario and the exponential curve by wei et al 2017 varies with modis lai compared with wei s curve there were obvious differences between the t et patterns of three scenarios the t et of gc tsebosm revealed a general trend of increase with lai particularly in crops and forests the t et patterns of gc tsebswc varied widely among biomes that is increased with lai for crops as well as grasses and shrubs while fluctuated violently in forests however the t et for gc tsebo always approached 1 and does not vary significantly with lai overall though a little overestimated in forests the t et produced by gc tsebosm was the closest match to wei s results across the biomes than the other two scenarios the daily t et time series of nine representative sites with significant seasonal variation were also compared taking the results by uwue method zhou et al 2016 as reference as shown in fig 11 the estimated t et under gc tsebosm changed with lai during the vegetation growth period which was closer to uwue curves especially in the croplands there were significant overestimations of t et in gc tsebswc although it had some seasonal variation moreover t et was often greater than 1 at the peak of the growing season it is remarkable that t et of gc tsebo had gross deviations in more than half of the sites basically constant at 1 4 discussion 4 1 capacity of different models for g c estimation the determination of resistances especially the surface resistance is more significant even than the intrinsic model structure for example the widely used pm model ershadi et al 2015 similarly different types of resistances also control the heat and mass transfer between soil canopy and atmosphere in the tseb model as described in section 3 3 canopy conductance played the most important role in le simulation fig 9 and s3 two types of conductance models were applied in our study leuning s conductance model rlm and the upscaled optimal stomatal conductance model osm the intercomparison of the two conductance models at the daily at nine representative sites is illustrated in fig 12 and the rest in fig s4 the intercomparison at sub daily scales can be found in fig s5 daily g c calculated by the inverted pm equation represented as g c p m is also shown in fig 12 and s4 the change of daily averaged g c tended to follow the growth state that is it increased with the vegetation growing until reaching a peak in the middle of the growing season and then gradually dropped fig 12 and s4 the g c calculated by osm had a larger fluctuation with the evolution of the growth period which was close to zero in the low lai phases but a little higher than the value of rlm when vegetation growing vigorously in this case the gap between the valley value and the peak value was larger while the variation of the g c sequence by rlm was relatively gentle looking at diurnal variation fig s5 both rlm and osm showed a bell shape with time the difference was that the canopy conductance calculated by rlm reached its maximum during a day around 7 a m while that of osm was from 9 a m to noon although the estimated g c of both models followed the phenology of lai the g c estimated by osm more agreed with g c p m fig 12 and s4 during the growing seasons especially at cropland us ne1 us ne2 us ne3 and us arm and semiarid sites us var us wkg and us srm moreover the simulated values of g c by osm were closer to the peaking time 10 a m to 2 p m reported in observations blonquist et al 2009b köstner et al 1992 yamori et al 2020 for diurnal variation than those of rlm previous studies bai et al 2019 li et al 2019a li et al 2015 shan et al 2019 stoy et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 have substantiated that providing an exact calculation of g c is essential to estimate et and reduce the uncertainty for et partition in this research osm had advanced performances in g c estimation than rlm correspondingly though gc tsebo and gc tsebosm had the same mass and energy transfer algorithm for canopy and soil layer the accuracy for le and h simulations was improved with g c estimated through osm gc tsebosm the osm estimated g c taking the account of vapor pressure deficit co2 concentration and gpp being the latter is a key factor to characterize vegetation physiological status however the simulation of g c by rlm was mainly based on meteorological variables such as solar radiation water vapor deficit but didn t consider the vegetation growth process according to eq 7 the g c derived by rlm was proportional to the visible radiation and inversely proportional to the vapor pressure deficit the two environmental factors both increased with time in the morning which led g c to peaking very early before 9 a m rather than midday li et al 2019a reported that the gpp outperformed lai and vis ndvi and evi in predicting g c and et during vegetation growing seasons since the gpp are more informative about the plant physiological status and the tight coupling between carbon and water exchange further the g c models that rely only on meteorological controls like rlm failed to account for environmental stresses derived from soil water scarcity on g c modeling under low lai or dry conditions particularly in arid and semiarid regions li et al 2015 research about oasis forest ecosystems bai et al 2017 showed that in the early and late days of the phenology cycle even though the temperature and leaf to air vapor pressure deficit were relatively high at noon when solar radiation is strong the cumulation of stomatal conductance from leaves to the canopy scale tended to still show a low level the g c computed by rlm obviously overestimated the canopy conductance of this period especially under croplands before day 136 and after day 270 at us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 further resulting in the high le of gc tsebo and gc tsebswc fig 8 and s1 similar circumstances existed at us var us wkg and us srm sites situated in arid and semiarid regions for us var after day 163 in 2010 this happened because of the decoupling between water supply and energy provision in the mediterranean semiarid ecosystem and the biophysical constraints on et simulation are especially significant garcía et al 2013 furthermore some studies colaizzi et al 2012b semmens et al 2016 reported the thermal based tseb may also overestimate the le at the phases of crop sowing and harvest the overestimation can be corrected by adjusting the α pt and greenness index in the pt formula according to the soil water availability hssaine et al 2018 and the prior field measurements zhang et al 2021 in this study the introduction of reliable canopy conductance into tseb provided a new way to address this deficiency in general the sensitivity of the r c in the osm was equal or small than that of the rlm indicating the robustness of the method fig 9 and s3 additionally in the osm g 1 is a key model parameter that contains the specific information of different biomes the higher the g 1 the lower the water use efficiency of the species medlyn et al 2011 the calibrated g 1 of seven biomes is shown in the fig s6 and the average values were rated the following gra wsa cro c3 ebf dbf cro c4 enf in short the g 1 under grasslands and croplands was larger than that under forests and the g 1 of c3 crop was greater than that of c4 crop which parallels to the relevant researches by lin et al 2015 de kauwe et al 2015 and medlyn et al 2017 although the determination of g 1 was based on model calibration rather than environmental factors such as temperature de kauwe et al 2015 lin et al 2015 precipitation franks et al 2018 and soil moisture de kauwe et al 2015 lin et al 2015 reasonable values were obtained in this study indicating the robustness of the gc tseb model 4 2 et partition and soil evaporation deviation for three scenarios as shown in section 3 4 the t et variation under the three scenarios was quite different overall gc tsebosm had the best performance than gc tsebo and gc tsebswc particularly in grasses shrubs and crops which can be proved by wei s fig 10 and uwue methods fig 11 respectively taking the us ne3 as an example t et of gc tsebosm was around 0 1 0 2 at the early or end growth stage and over 0 9 in summer with an average of 0 60 c3 and 0 61 c4 the values were quite closest to 0 67 estimated by zhou et al 2016 and 0 65 for croplands at the same latitude 38 6 n lian et al 2018 besides canopy transpiration for c4 crops increased rapidly after the beginning of growth and reached its peak faster than c3 crops zhou et al 2016 which was also captured by gc tsebosm however the t et of gc tsebo was basically constant at 1 which means the evapotranspiration is almost equal to the canopy transpiration all the time while negligible soil evaporation the deviations in gc tsebswc mostly occurred when lai was relatively high for each site during these periods estimated t was greater than et that is soil evaporation was negative hence the systematic error in soil evaporation should be responsible for the inaccuracy of t et in both gc tsebo and gc tsebswc according to the previous studies song et al 2016a song et al 2016b the key element of et partition for tseb is the accuracy of the temperature segregation though lst is not the model input in the gc tseb the calculation of le c and le s depends on t c and t s obtained by the iterative operation the lst t c and t s for three scenarios over four sites us ne3 c3 cro de hai dbf ca qfo enf and us var gra were compared in this section as shown in fig s7 estimated lst among the three scenarios was largely consistent indicating that there was little distinction in r n eq 1 but the t c as well as the t s were varied among different scenarios at the early or end growth stage of croplands us ne3 c3 the t c of gc tsebosm was higher than gc tsebo and gc tsebswc leading to the larger h and lower le a similar phenomenon can be found during the dry period of the semiarid grassland site us var correspondingly gc tsebosm outperformed better in fluxes estimation fig 8 s1 and s2 and t et figs 10 and 11 during these periods besides the t s of gc tsebswc was significantly higher than that of the other scenarios in the peak growth period particularly at us ne3 and ca qfo from eq b4 the high t s can cause a very small value of h r thereby the h r e s t s may be less than the e a eq 19 this unreasonable circumstance made le s negative and t et greater than 1 for gc tsebswc at some moments hence for conductance based tseb in this research biophysical constraints improved the accuracy of the temperature segregation and further isolated canopy transpiration and soil evaporation correctly from total et worth noting the estimated le s between gc tsebo and gc tsebosm were very different though the algorithm of soil energy fluxes was the same as mentioned above the estimation of le s in gc tsebo and gc tsebosm was based on complementary theory and sdi eq 11 14 to avoid the error caused by the decoupling of soil moisture and soil evaporation soil temperature was incorporated into the calculation of sdi gao et al 2016 however the relationship between soil evaporation and soil temperature is nonlinear which may easily lead to instability in the numerical solution still take us ne3 as an example it is found from table s4 and s5 that the a pm and b pm for c3 c4 crop in gc tsebo were 0 04 0 02 and 14 27 9 88 respectively while the two parameters in gc tsebosm were 0 01 0 01 and 6 57 6 54 the high values of two calibrated parameters a pm and b pm can lead to a low value of f p eq 13 further resulting in underestimation for soil evaporation as discussed in section 4 1 g c by rlm was overestimated under low lai or dry conditions fig 12 and s4 leading to the overestimation of le c to realize the energy balance and make the total le close to the ec observations the value of f p was minimized under gc tsebo to reduce the le s gan et al 2019 suggested that a pm and b pm should be adjusted for seasonal variations and constrained by prior knowledge that is when f c 2 a pm and b pm are set to 0 05 and 8 0 respectively while set to 0 01 and 7 2 respectively when f c greater than 2 however this constraint on parameters may be not necessarily applicable to all underlying surfaces for different characters of mass and energy transfer which limits the application of the model even though the values of a pm and b pm for gc tsebo and gc tsebosm were relatively close at some sites such as us ne1 and us wkg the partition for canopy transpiration and soil evaporation of gc tsebosm seemed still better in terms of dynamics and magnitude than that of gc tsebo good performance for gc tsebosm offered a solution in such a case under the premise of the same parameter scope and strategy for calibration when vegetation physiological control was added to the mass transfer of canopy the systematic error of soil evaporation in gc tseb can be corrected to a great extent simultaneously 4 3 estimated lst assessment for the flux calibrated and lst calibrated model as the sparse distribution of flux sites the general practice in upscaling the et models from single points to regional level is to set fixed parameters for common biomes or plant functional types pft mu et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 this approach may lead to some uncertainty in et estimation when keeping the biophysical parameters fixed in various climatic zones mu et al 2011 the efficiency of lst on gc tseb calibration has been verified in prior studies gan and gao 2015 gan et al 2019 in this section the model calibration based on modis lst was also implemented under gc tsebosm the best scheme under flux calibration to eliminate the potential for deviation the specific range of g 1 in osm for each biome was determined referring to the research by medlyn et al 2017 and the calibration results against ec observations see table s7 the daily et simulation in the lst calibration version is provided in table 3 the daily estimated lst was also compared with lst derived from longwave net radiation burchard levine et al 2020 at 13 sites table 4 but there weren t data available at us wcr and fi hyy lst calibrated model had good performances at most sites with average r2 0 82 average rmse 0 69 mm average bias 4 90 and average s 0 79 the most satisfactory results were obtained over croplands and grasslands as shown in fig 8 and s1 the simulations had high daily concordance with both ec measurements and the simulations calibrated using observed flux besides the results of et partitioning were quite similar in two calibrations fig 10 gc tseb presented excellent performances for lst simulation under both flux and lst calibrations with rmse and bias less than 5 of mean values k at most sites remarkably relatively higher bias greater than 15 in et estimation was found over forests ca qfo fi hyy de hai and us mms or woodland savanna us srm though the lst estimated by lst calibrated model was even better than that by flux calibrated model at these biomes to explore the reasons behind the different lst calibrated model performance over various biomes estimated lst of calibration groups for flux calibration the three scenarios and lst calibration gc tsebosm were compared at modis overpass time with modis lst see fig 13 and s8 and table s9 for croplands data points mainly scatter around the 1 1 straight line besides the estimated lst for the two calibration versions is consistent similar to the results of et estimation gc tsebosm flux calibrated and lst calibrated outperforms the other two scenarios which confirmed that the important role of biophysical constraints in water flux and lst simulation for croplands at forest ecosystems the lst is a little overestimated by flux calibrated models compared to flux calibration the rmse and bias of estimated lst for lst calibration were decreased remarkably at the daily scale table 4 and modis overpass time table s9 however the et simulation was not improved it seems that the connection between the simulation accuracy of lst and et by gc tseb was not close for forest sites that means there are some drawbacks in flux decomposition or lst combination when the tseb is applied in forest ecosystems also reported in cui et al 2021 lst is regarded as a complex mixture of soil temperature and canopy temperature whose spatio temporal variation is very susceptible to the soil texture vegetation coverage and topography li et al 2013 wang et al 2020 the hierarchical canopy structure and undergrowth in the forests may produce profound influences on lst and r n in gc tseb the r n decomposition into canopy and soil layer followed exponential attenuation determined by lai zenith angle and dissipation coefficient eq 2 3 the lst combination from t c and t s was just relied on vegetation fraction eq 21 thus to further improve the applicability of the model in forest ecosystem it is vital to take the impact of canopy structure on flux and lst into account in modeling though both flux calibrated and lst calibrated gc tsebosm achieved ideal results in et estimation over grassland sites table 3 lst estimation was inferior to that over forests and croplands fig 13 different from the forest sites the lst estimated by the lst calibrated model agreed well with that by the flux calibrated model over grasslands fig 13 and s8 which means the deviation for lst is not caused by the poor application of the lst combination algorithm to explore the real reasons for lst overestimation at grasslands it is necessary to analyze the simulated energy fluxes and the iterative operation process of the model as shown in fig 11 the t et for the grassland sites us var and us wkg was overestimated to some extent particularly in gc tsebo and gc tsebosm however there was no significant large positive bias in total le for all three scenarios except the us wkg in gc tsebswc table 2 indicating that the underestimation for le s and overestimation for le c le c overestimation can be confirmed by the overestimation of g c fig 12 and s4 and high values of stomatal slope g 1 gc tsebosm fig s6 and table s5 at all grassland sites because the le c is proportionate to the g c eq 6 on the other hand to realize the energy balance for soil layer the t s was also amplified to increase h s eq 9 ultimately leading to the overestimation for lst in the final analysis there exists systematic negative deviation in le s over grassland sites one possible reason for the underestimation of le s is the overestimation of r s research conducted by morillas et al 2013 found the residual estimation of le in the thermal based tseb is overestimated while h is underestimated at mediterranean semiarid grasslands then kustas et al 2016 confirmed the conclusion of morillas et al 2013 and pointed the deviation for fluxes is caused by r s overestimation and the aerodynamic properties of semiarid grasslands vegetation villagarcía et al 2007 different from the original scheme for tseb r s formula eq b3 put forward by zeng et al 2005 was applied in the gc tseb but the formula and the fixed parameters seemed to be not fit for grasslands ecosystems for the high sensitivity for r s to le at us var us wkg fig 9 at neu and it mbo fig s3 for gc tsebo and gc tsebosm the r s and r a played a role not only in mass and energy transfer equations of soil but also in the formulation of potential evaporation and relative evaporative fraction eq 12 and 14 thus the negative impact for the deviation of r s on le s was amplified recently li et al 2019c presented an r s formula based on near surface turbulence around arid vegetation structural properties for tseb and proved robust of the new model without coefficients adjustment over the semiarid and arid grasslands which may provide a solution to correct le s underestimation in the gc tseb to sum up optimizing the model parameters by remote sensing lst is more suitable for applications in land surfaces with low vegetation and simple canopy structure such as croplands and grasslands care should be taken in applications over the forests for the possible rather large bias 4 4 uncertainties and future developments calibrated by limited flux data modis overpass time three types of gc tseb with different parameterizations were applied in six biomes gan and gao 2015 proved the accessibility of leuning s g c model to constrain the le c as alternatives of pt formulation kustas et al 1998 in tseb model in this study gc tsebosm showed clear advantages for et estimation and partitioning than the original gc tseb gc tsebo gan et al 2019 and gc tsebswc with soil moisture constraints gan and gao 2015 kustas et al 1998 which demonstrates the important role of effective biophysical constraints on the tseb model modis lst calibrated gc tsebosm also obtained similar results like flux calibrated model and had great potential for regional applications though gc tsebswc had good performances at some sites such as at neu and it mbo the simulations were barely satisfactory at croplands and drylands when the soil moisture is very low soil moisture and soil resistance became very little simultaneously eq 19 and 20 led to the large bias of soil evaporation moreover soil surface energy is controlled by surface soil moisture conditions around millimeters under surface which is not equivalent to the swc usually measured at a depth of 2 cm or more below the ground gao et al 2016 though global surface soil moisture can be estimated from microwave based satellites and land surface models kim et al 2020 i e ascat 12 5 km smos 35 50 km smap 9 km gldas 0 25 and gleam 0 25 there is a lack of fine pixel scale 1km soil moisture to constraint et models the algorithm based on sdi and the potential evaporation worked very well at most sites especially under gc tsebosm which proved the power of soil temperature in indicating the surface dryness and estimating soil evaporation though gc tsebosm performed well at six ecosystems there are some shortcomings to be noted first the radiation partitioning was mainly based on lai in this study this method has poor applicability in sparse vegetation regions where the soil temperature is relatively high morillas et al 2013 besides the amount of sunlit and shaded leaves also have an unavoidable influence on radiation transfer through complex canopies chen et al 1999 the errors from energy decomposing may finally lead to the deviation in et partitioning second interception evaporation i from canopy was ignored in et modeling which accounts for a certain proportion of the total et in forests wei et al 2017 this explains the overestimation of t et at forest sites and t et predicted by gc tseb is approximate to t i et gan et al 2019 third gc tsebosm required gpp estimated from ec measurements as model input instead of gpp measurements some gpp submodels such as the light use efficiency lue model hu et al 2013 and rectangular hyperbola function model zhang et al 2019 were introduced into the et models to predict et moreover solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif was proved to correlate well to canopy conductance shan et al 2019 and transpiration lu et al 2018 maes et al 2020 remote sensed sif from field to regional scales may become a new proxy for predicting the water and energy fluxes 5 conclusions in this study the three scenarios were set up to evaluate the resistances network and parameterization of a conductance based tseb model gc tseb based on the observation of 15 fluxnet sites over six ecosystems the three scenarios were assessed from different perspectives the main conclusions are as follows 1 overall the model combined with osm and the complementary concept gc tsebosm performed well in all biomes the version incorporating rlm and the complementary concept gc tsebo runs a close second while the model gc tsebswc taking the soil moisture into account comes a poor third moreover the diurnal variation of daytime energy exchange for gc tsebosm is closest to ec measurements 2 the canopy conductance canopy resistance is the most sensitive for et simulations at most sites compared with rlm osm can better capture the dynamic change of canopy conductance especially in the low lai stage 3 the seasonal variation of t et for gc tsebosm is roughly consistent with results based on wei s and uwue methods in particular over the croplands and grasslands the inaccuracy of t et for two other scenarios is largely due to the systematic error of soil evaporation 4 the performance of the model calibrated by lst agreed with that of the model calibrated by flux data in croplands and grasslands since the estimated lst of two calibration versions is consistent whereas high bias was observed at some forest sites credit authorship contribution statement jingyi bu methodology software writing original draft writing review

3893,lakes play an important role in terrestrial ecosystems and have a significant impact on human production and life remote sensing techniques have been widely used to monitor changes in lakes several studies have been conducted pertaining to extraction of lake bodies using optical remote sensing images however owing to the influence of ice and snow in the lake and other parameters such as noise the accuracy and stability of lake extraction still need to be improved this study designed a new method by combing k means clustering and the flood fill method kcffm to improve the accuracy and stability of extraction results from complex backgrounds using landsat 8 operational land imager oli data for five lakes in central asia the accuracy and stability of kcffm in summer and winter were evaluated and compared with those of five other methods kcffm showed the highest accuracy and stability among all the methods especially during the lake ice period for kcffm the kappa coefficient was greater than 0 97 and 0 92 and the overall accuracy was greater than 99 and 98 in summer and winter respectively the area error rate of kcffm was less than 3 except for lake alakol less than 10 in addition kcffm significantly decreased the area error rate compared to other methods 1 to 15 in summer and 10 to 50 in winter the proposed method optimized the time continuity accuracy and stability of lake body extraction thus kcffm can provide valuable basic data for monitoring lake water bodies keywords lake landsat k means clustering water index 1 introduction as an important part of surface water resources lakes especially lake areas and lake ice are deeply affected by anthropogenic activities and global climate change guan et al 2020 jiang et al 2017 ma et al 2010 schindler 2009 song et al 2013 song et al 2014 zhang et al 2020b han et al 2019 kouraev et al 2007 yang et al 2020 the rapid accurate and automatic extraction of lake water bodies is of great significance for lake research and monitoring feng et al 2019 xu 2020 filed survey of lakes requires a significant amount of manpower material and financial resources and it is often difficult to obtain long term and stable data huang et al 2018a huang et al 2018b huang et al 2019 huang et al 2020 li et al 2019 satellite imagery especially landsat imagery has been widely used for the extraction of lake water bodies owing to its wide coverage short revisit time and multispectral band characteristics palmer et al 2015 xu 2020 several researchers have conducted various studies on the extraction of lake water bodies by formulating water indices to distinguish water from the background based on its spectral characteristics table 1 lists the water indices that have been commonly used for the extraction of lake water bodies in the past crist 1985 obtained the brightness greenness and humidity through the tasseled cap transformation of the reflectance pertaining to the landsat 5 thematic mapper tm image and pioneered the application of landsat imagery in the extraction of water bodies mcfeeters 1996 constructed the normalized difference water index ndwi using the near infrared and green bands to enhance the water spectrum characteristics xu 2007 modified ndwi to modified normalized difference water index mndwi by replacing the near infrared band with the short wave infrared of tm images mndwi was better than ndwi for the extraction of water bodies in urban areas nevertheless the extraction accuracy of these dual band water indices from complex backgrounds still needs to be improved especially in shadows and dark areas many researchers have used multiple band data of tm or landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper etm images to build models such as the water index wi2006 danaher and collett 2006 furthermore fisher et al 2016 based on wi2006 used surface reflectance instead of top of atmosphere toa reflectance to build another water index named wi2015 which improved the extraction accuracy of water bodies in addition feyisa et al 2014 used the blue green near infrared and mid infrared bands to create an automatic water extraction index awei which includes two cases for unshaded areas and shadowed areas respectively experiments revealed improved accuracy in extraction of water bodies from shadows and dark surfaces to amplify the spectral difference between water and non water surfaces wang et al 2018 based on pure pixel analysis developed a new multi band water index mbwi by selecting several bands with large differences in the spectral characteristics of surface objects the experiment revealed an improved performance for 29 sites in china in addition to these widely used dual band and multi band water indices fuzzy clustering yang et al 2015 machine learning wang et al 2020 wei et al 2018 spectrum matching based on discrete particle swarm optimization jia et al 2018 and other methods are gradually used for the extraction of water bodies although these methods have been widely used in water extraction ogilvie et al 2018 yao et al 2019 xu 2018 the accuracy of extracting lake water bodies from complex backgrounds still requires improvement several lake mapping products liao et al 2014 sheng et al 2016 verpoorter et al 2014 have been presented however few studies have focused on accurately extracting lake water bodies when the lake surface is covered by ice and snow the widely used water indices have relatively higher total errors in winter compared with those in other seasons wang et al 2018 several researchers have ignored datasets pertaining to regions that are covered by ice and snow yuan et al 2018 and the results extracted proved to be discontinuous other researchers implemented manual visual interpretation and several other manual techniques after the extraction of lake water bodies zhang et al 2020a this proved to be time consuming and labor intensive in case of processing a large number of remote sensing images to resolve the above mentioned problems in this study a novel method that combines k means clustering method kcm and a flood fill ff algorithm to extract lake water bodies has been proposed after assessment and comparison with other methods for five lakes located in central asia using the landsat 8 operational land imager oli images in summer and winter our proposed method can be used to improve the accuracy of lake water extraction from complex backgrounds including lake ice cover 2 study area and dataset 2 1 study area central asia is located in the center of the eurasian continent and mainly covers kazakhstan kyrgyzstan and the xinjiang region of china in central asia more than 60 lakes are larger than 100 km2 jun li et al 2013 this area is controlled by an arid and semi arid climate abuduwaili et al 2019 with hot and dry weather in summer and cold weather in winter this region witness uneven distribution of water resources and severe droughts in addition lakes and reservoirs are the most important water resources found in this region che et al 2019 klein et al 2014 five lakes in central asia were selected lake balkhash lake issykkul lake alakol kapchagayskoye reservoir and lake sayram fig 1 the selection was based on the following criteria 1 size super large lakes larger than10 000 km2 large lakes larger than 1000 km2 and small and medium sized lakes 2 type natural lakes and reservoirs and 3 background surface features mountain lakes and plain lakes information regarding the five selected lakes is presented in table 2 2 2 dataset the data used in this study include landsat 8 oli images shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem data and sentinel 2 images landsat 8 oli the latest landsat 8 satellite launched by the earth resources satellite has been in service since february 2013 the satellite carries a new oli including all the bands of the etm sensor to avoid atmospheric absorption characteristics oli reconfigured the bands and included nine bands in total with a spatial resolution of 30 m the landsat 8 oli images used in this study were all derived from the landsat 8 surface reflectance sr dataset from the google earth engine gee platform which acquires the image collection from the united states geological survey usgs landsat 8 sr dataset https code earthengine google com dataset landsat lc08 c01 t1 sr this study incorporated landsat 8 images from december 2016 to february 2017 winter and june 2017 to august 2017 summer dem data the dem data used in this study were derived from srtm this mission was a collaborative effort by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the national geospatial intelligence agency nga and the participation of the german and italian space agencies in the year 2000 the srtm v3 product used in this study with a resolution of 30 m was acquired from the gee platform https developers google com earth engine datasets catalog usgs srtm gl1 003 sentinel 2 image to verify the accuracy of the extraction results of our method the sentinel 2 high resolution image was used as the reference verification data sentinel 2 is a part of the copernicus program released by the european space agency esa which mostly provides high resolution optical images sentinel 2a and 2b products with a spatial resolution of 10 m the sentinel 2 images used in this study are also from the sentinel 2 dataset on the gee platform and selected at a similar time to landsat 8 images https developers google com earth engine datasets catalog copernicus s2 sr 3 methodology the method used in this study includes five steps fig 2 1 preprocessing of landsat 8 oli images 2 removing mountain shadow from each image using dem data 3 calculating indicators for multi band images and using k means clustering to generate classification results 4 extracting lake water bodies from the classification results through the ff algorithm and 5 evaluating the accuracy of extraction of lake water bodies each step is described in detail below 3 1 image preprocessing radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction of satellite images are important prerequisites for obtaining high quality data chander et al 2009 the landsat 8 oli image dataset provided by gee performs image preprocessing for the 1 t products from usgs owing to the influence of cloud monthly cloudless images were almost impossible to obtain therefore we selected the images from december 2016 to february 2017 winter and from june 2017 to august 2017 summer based on the built in cloud scoring algorithm provided by gee cloud removal was carried out by multi temporal synthesis gorelick et al 2017 firstly the cloudless pixels of the images pertaining to each lake were screened out according to the quality assessment qa band furthermore the median value of the cloudless pixels was selected and a seasonal cloudless image was formed 3 2 removing mountain shadow the large mountains in the study area with high altitude along with the mountain shadows have an influence on the extraction of lake water bodies owing to their similar spectral characteristics with water verpoorter et al 2012 this study implemented dem data to eliminate the influence of mountain shadows in order to improve the extraction accuracy of lake water bodies li and sheng 2012 firstly the gradient of each pixel was calculated based on the strm dem data through the four way gradient algorithm on the gee platform furthermore the mountain shadows were removed when the pixel slope was less than 10 and the range of flat terrain was delineated due to the non participation of pixels in the subsequent classification and extraction steps the computing time and internal storage are effectively saved however minimum effect was observed on the extraction accuracy of lake water bodies during the non ice and non snow periods 3 3 k means clustering for image classification as a widely used water extraction method the threshold segmentation method based on the water index distinguishes water and non water pixels by the bimodal feature of the index histogram this method calculates the euclidean distance between similar pixels and the images are then classified based on the distance however the characteristics of similar pixels contain several dimensions and adding more effective index information can improve the accuracy of pixel discrimination the kcm is adopted in this study to distinguish similar pixels as it incorporates euclidean distance as the deciding condition and freely adds more indicator information kcm is an unsupervised classification method that can gather pixels with similar properties into the same group according to the chosen indicators it is widely used owing to the minimum requirement of prior knowledge and training samples hegarat mascle et al 1997 the principle of kcm is to minimize the sum of the distance between each pixel in the cluster and the cluster center jain 2010 when the cluster centers do not change or the iteration times are sufficiently large the iteration process is stopped and all image pixels are divided into k clusters in this study the euclidean distance between different indicators was calculated as the evaluation standard of pixel similarity the cluster center is the average value of all the pixels in this cluster the objective function can be expressed as 1 e k 1 k i 1 n x i u k 2 where e is the sum of the euclidean distances between pixels and their center in each cluster n is the number of pixels and x i u k 2 is the euclidean distance from the pixel x i to the i cluster center u k the application of kcm in image classification is mainly divided into the following three steps firstly the indicators for image classification were selected the following section discusses the selection of indicators in two cases the non ice period summer and the ice period winter in summer the extraction accuracy of lake water bodies is mainly affected by mountain shadows and built up areas in the images the near infrared band nir band ndwi and aweish were selected as the three indicators in the kcm the reasons are as follows 1 surface water has strong absorption spectral characteristics in the nir band which is useful for distinguishing water from other surface types in images 2 ndwi extracts water bodies by amplifying the difference in spectral signatures between water and non water pixels 3 the aweish method is more suitable for the mountainous landform of central asia owing to its high classification accuracy in the shaded areas in winter the extraction accuracy of lake water bodies is affected by mountain shadows snow and land ice in the images especially for regions with wide snow and ice cover the blue band mid infrared swir band and snow cover index ndsi were chosen as indicators in winter because of the following reasons 1 compared to other land cover types water ice and snow have lower reflectance in the nir and swir band 2 ice snow and water indicate similar spectral signatures from visible spectrum bands to the nir band but the reflectance values of ice and snow in the blue band are higher than those of water 3 the ndsi has been proven to effectively distinguish snow and non snow pixels in moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis images salomonson and appel 2006 therefore these three indicators selected in kcm can effectively distinguish snow ice and other surface types and are suitable for most lakes in central asia which are covered by snow and ice in winter secondly the number of clusters and the initial center of the kcm are important parameters jain 2010 according to the surface types derived from visual interpretation the classification number of kcm was set to 3 therefore the surface types were divided into three clusters the initial center of each cluster was calculated using the following formula 2 cente r summer nir ndwi aweish 0 25 0 01 0 1 0 05 0 7 0 5 0 7 0 25 0 7 3 cente r winter blue swir ndsi 0 25 0 01 0 1 0 05 0 7 0 5 0 7 0 25 0 7 where cente r summer cente r winter are the initial centers of the cluster in summer and winter respectively thirdly each pixel would be classified to a certain cluster according to the minimum distance to the initial center when all pixels were divided in to three clusters the new center of each cluster formed we repeated the above operations for iteration until the center did not change and acquired the classification results 3 4 ff algorithm to obtain accurate lake boundaries and areas it is also necessary to extract the lake body from the classification results derived from the kcm the extraction procedure is critical as it aims to entirely remove the small clastic points of water or ice outside the lake boundary and achieve a complete and closed lake basin several studies have implemented visual interpretation to extract lakes and manually remove clastic points outside the lake basin although visual interpretation has high accuracy it is time consuming and labor intensive in large regions and for computation of long term time series compared with other types of water bodies lakes are surrounded by land and the lake basin is relatively closed so that water pixels are connected inside the lake body according to the characteristics of lakes this study used the ff algorithm which can automatically extract the lake body remove the clastic points outside the lake basin and obtain more accurate lake areas the ff algorithm is a classic algorithm that can extract a number of connected points inside an area from other adjacent areas berends and van de wal 2016 burtsev and kuzmin 1993 its major step is to start with an initial node and then extract the points in the same cluster connected to the initial node until all points in the enclosed region are processed we selected a point in the lake which is usually the center point of the image as the initial node and used the ff algorithm to identify all lake pixels inside the lake and eventually extract the entire lake boundary therefore the overall method in this study is named as k means clustering and the flood fill method kcffm in winter the lake boundary was covered by snow and the lake basin was not closed which would cause inadequate extraction of the lake bodies on implementing the ff algorithm therefore additional recognition is performed on snow pixels in images when the snow cover area is more than 30 of the total area the recognition condition is based on the assumption that the slope of the snow pixel is less than 2 which can ensure the closure of the lake boundary 3 5 accuracy assessment the accuracy assessment uses three indicators overall accuracy oa kappa coefficient ka and lake area error five other water extraction methods were selected for comparison with kcffm in terms of extraction accuracy for each lake namely the nir single band threshold method wang et al 2014 ndwi mndwi mbwi and aweish the extraction results from sentinel 2 images by visual interpretation were used as validation data 4 results 4 1 analysis of extraction results 4 1 1 extraction results of kcffm fig 3 displays the extraction results for lake balkhash using the kcffm the extraction results for lake alakol lake issykkul reservoir kapchagayskoye and lake sayram using the kcffm can be seen in figs s3 s10 kcffm can efficiently extract most of the lake bodies from complex surface backgrounds in summer the red area pertaining to misclassification was low indicating that the extraction accuracy of the lake body was very high moreover the misclassification was mostly concentrated in the mixed pixels at the lake boundary fig 3a in winter a large part of the images is covered by snow and ice therefore the extraction accuracy is lower than that computed for summer fig 3b owing to the influence of snow and ice there are several commission and omission errors of lake extraction which are mostly concentrated at the boundary of the lake basin and the snow and ice covered areas however kcffm can extract most lake bodies and identify various forms of water effectively which is convenient for monitoring the dynamics of water and ice inside the lake 4 1 2 comparison of lake body extraction using different methods to further explore the advantages of kcffm the kapchagayskoye reservoir was used as an example to compare the extraction results of kcffm with those of the other five methods fig 4 and fig 5 as shown in fig 4 most of the lake bodies could be extracted accurately in summer by implementing six different methods with few misclassifications at the lake boundary however kcffm exhibited the least misclassification shown in region 1 and region 2 in addition to the misclassifications of the mixed pixels at the lake boundaries the five other methods exhibited misclassifications in the background e g in the dark swamp near the river on the right side of the lake the nir single band threshold method demonstrated the greatest number of misclassifications followed by mbwi fig 4c f kcffm did not display misclassifications in the background outside the lake fig 4b as it could successfully filter the pixels in mountain shadows and dark areas which were easily confused with water bodies in the background in summer kcffm was the most accurate and stable among all the methods fig 5 shows the lake body extraction of the kapchagayskoye reservoir in winter it can be seen that on implementation of the nir single band threshold method both mndwi and aweish demonstrated a large range of misclassification in the background fig 5c e and g thus it can be inferred that these methods were incapable of extracting the lake bodies under snow and ice covered conditions ndwi could only extract a small part of the lake body blue part and demonstrated very little ability to identify lake ice fig 5d kcffm and mbwi could extract the lake surface and most misclassifications appeared at the mixed pixel value at the boundary fig 5b f however mbwi demonstrated higher commission and omission errors than kcffm in mountain shadows and dark construction areas therefore kcffm was superior among all the methods and the performance of the kcffm was the best in winter similar comparison results could be found for other lakes fig s1 s8 4 2 accuracy assessment 4 2 1 accuracy of different methods for lake body extraction the extraction results of each method were evaluated using accuracy indicators tables 3 and 4 show the ka and oa of the results extracted by each method for the five lakes respectively for ffkcm the ka was greater than 0 97 in summer and the oa was greater than 99 in all lakes the indicator values of kcffm were the lowest and the ka and oa were approximately 0 97 and 99 3 respectively for lake alakol in summer the performances of the five other methods were also relatively good with the ka values and oa in most cases being greater than 0 9 and greater than 90 respectively additionally the ndwi method achieved the best performance with ka greater than 0 97 and oa greater than 98 5 however there were few exceptions for example the accuracy of the nir single band threshold method was very low in lake alakol ka 0 17 oa 51 5 and mbwi and aweish exhibited slightly lower accuracy in lake alakol and lake issykkul ka less than 0 9 oa less than 90 in winter regarding kcffm the ka was greater than 0 92 and oa was greater than 98 in all lakes however the performance of the five other methods declined sharply demonstrating extraction failure in several lakes mostly ka less than 0 4 oa less than 70 for instance mndwi failed to extract the lake body in lake balkhash ka 0 146 oa 29 6 and lake alakol ka 0 09 oa 37 in addition the ka for ndwi in lake issykkul and lake sayram was negative although the overall performance of the five other methods was poor few of them performed well in specific lakes for example the accuracy of the nir single band threshold method in lake issykkul was slightly higher ka 0 707 oa 86 7 and the oa of ndwi in lake balkhash and lake alakol was also higher oa 87 7 than basic extraction accuracy requirements among the five other methods mbwi showed the most stable performance and met the basic extraction accuracy requirements ka greater than 0 4 oa greater than 70 in all lakes except lake alakol however its accuracy was still significantly lower than that of kcffm kcffm showed the highest accuracy and stability among all the methods and was suitable for all five lakes 4 2 2 accuracy of lake area extracted by different methods in this study the lake areas calculated using the sentinel 2 image were used to validate the area accuracy and the error rate er of the lake area obtained by various methods was calculated table 5 the er of the lake area was larger than 100 showed in table 5 because the method failed to effectively extract the lake body from surface backgrounds for instance most of the background was misclassified to the lake body in lake alakol by aweish in winter fig s2 therefore the lake area included most of the background and was very large in these cases a large number of background pixels were misclassified into lake pixels thus the area acquired was greater than the true lake area the lowest er of the balkhash lake area was exhibited by ndwi in summer er 1 29 and kcffm and mbwi in winter er 2 58 the ndwi in summer er 0 17 and kcffm in winter er 1 34 yielded the most accurate results for the lake area of kapchagayskoye for the other three lakes the kcffm exhibited the minimum area error the er of the lake area by kcffm in the four lakes was less than 3 except for lake alakol in winter er 8 8 this is because the region between lake alakol and the small swamp lake in the north was mostly covered by snow and ice and the lake boundary was sheltered in terms of lake area kcffm was the most stable and accurate method and could decrease the er of the lake area more significantly than the other methods 1 15 in summer and 10 50 in winter 5 discussion 5 1 the theoretical basis for selection of indicators pure pixel analysis was carried out on the landsat 8 images in order to prove that the indicators selected in the k means clustering step of kcffm can efficiently reflect the diversity in spectral signatures for different surface types a pure pixel means that the pixel contains only one type of surface information and its spectral information is the theoretical foundation for identifying different surface types we selected more than 700 pure pixel points and it was necessary to select the centers of various surface types to avoid mixed pixels at the boundaries the distributions of the spectral reflectance and water indices for all the pure pixels are depicted in fig 6 the results showed that the indicators selected in summer fig 6a b including the nir band ndwi and aweish were able to correctly distinguish between water and non water pixels showing that there was no overlap between boxes for example the range of the nir band from 0 05 to 0 15 can effectively distinguish between water and non water pixels fig 6c and 6d illustrate the three indicators selected in winter the blue band value of approximately 0 1 and 0 6 can distinguish water lake ice and snow pixels the swir band value of approximately 0 can distinguish lake ice and water pixels and the ndsi value of approximately 0 6 can distinguish ground pixels from others the combination of these three indictors can effectively distinguish water lake ice snow and other land cover types in winter compared with the single index method the k means clustering method can combine more spectral signature information and select more targeted indicators according to different lakes surface types and seasons for example we selected aweish as one of indicators in the central asia region considering it could effectively eliminate mountain shadows in mountainous areas 5 2 influence of lake ice cover on lake body extraction fig 7 a shows the clustering of all pixels in the lake sayram of kcffm it can be inferred that all pixels were divided into three categories except the pixels in the yellow circle which were close together this indicated that the euclidian distance of the three indicators was able to distinguish these pixels on the whole in addition the blue band swir band and ndsi could distinguish pixels when there was snow and ice cover in the region fig 7b f shows the histograms of the other water index methods and the threshold calculated by the otsu method li et al 2016 ostu 1979 xie et al 2016 as demonstrated the histograms of ndwi mndwi and mbwi represent a single peak characteristic without obvious troughs therefore the threshold failed to distinguish the lake bodies from the background the histograms of the nir band threshold method and aweish exhibited multi peak characteristics and demonstrated several unobvious troughs this further proved that solely dividing into two categories cannot provide theoretical justification in winter by increasing the number of categories more than two and selecting targeted indicators kcffm could discriminate major land surface types from complex backgrounds including lake ice cover compared with other water index methods kcffm is not solely limited to water bodies and non water bodies and is able to demonstrate better performance in lake ice or snow covered regions 5 3 the applicability of kcffm in extracting small lake bodies the five lakes discussed before are of medium or large size to test the applicability of kcffm in the small lake several complementary works were conducted in reservoir bartogay reservoir bartogay is in kazakhstan and about 16 km2 in area fig s9 s10 displays the extraction results of reservoir bartogay by different methods it can be seen that there were many misclassifications about the mountain shadow by the nir single band threshold method besides the rivers connected with reservoir bartogay were also been extracted by ndwi mndwi mbwi and aweish method in winter the nir single band threshold method and ndwi failed to extract the lake body showing all misclassifications inside the lake the extraction results of reservoir bartogay by mndwi mbwi and aweish in winter has many errors owing to the mountain shadow and snow while only kcffm showed comparatively accurate extraction results the ka oa and er of lake bartogay for different methods in the table s1 s3 demonstrated similar results 5 4 the characteristics of kcffm in contrast to five other methods the kcffm was designed according to the physical characteristics of lakes and the spectral reflectance of surface types combining k means clustering and the ff algorithm the results showed that kcffm performed successfully in different lakes from different backgrounds in central asia and modifying indicators may be able to adjust in different regions based on user judgments kcm is one of the simplest methods in unsupervised classification which can define a naturally similar spectral cluster in multispectral images and does not require a large number of prior training samples in addition to optical remote sensing images with different spatial resolutions kcm can also be applied to sar images to monitor lake ice and river ice sobiech and dierking 2013 the ff algorithm can capture the characteristics of lakes that are different from other water bodies and automatically remove the clastic points outside the lake which is a key step in acquiring an accurate lake area kcffm is automatic and improves the accuracy and stability of lake extraction results from complex backgrounds including lake ice cover 6 conclusion lake monitoring plays an important role in lake research and water resource management which benefits significantly from the appearance of remote sensing images however owing to the influence of snow and ice in the lake or other noises in relation to different surface types the accuracy and stability of lake body extraction from satellite images still need to be improved in this study a new method called kcffm was proposed for lake body extraction which can automatically extract lake bodies from landsat 8 oli images with improved accuracy and stability the extraction results using kcffm and five other water extraction methods nir single band threshold method ndwi mndwi mbwi and aweish for five different lakes in central asia in summer and winter were compared kcffm performed best and was able to extract lake bodies and boundaries more accurately and identify different forms of water it solved the problem of lake body extraction from complex backgrounds including lake ice cover effectively improving the accuracy of lake ice monitoring the results showed that 1 kcffm can extract lake bodies in both summer and winter with minimum misclassification compared with other methods the clastic points outside the lake were reduced and the accuracy of the extraction results improved significantly 2 for ffkcm the ka was more than 0 97 and 0 92 and the oa was greater than 99 and 98 in summer and winter respectively mbwi showed the best performance among the five methods and met the basic extraction accuracy requirements in four lakes ka greater than 0 4 oa greater than 70 but its accuracy was still much lower than that of kcffm 3 the er of lake area by kcffm was less than 10 in all lakes less than 3 except lake alakol and could decrease the er more significantly than other methods from 1 to 15 in summer and 10 to 50 in winter experiments on five different types of lakes in central asia showed that kcffm optimizes the time continuity accuracy and stability of lake data processing for research related to lakes and climate change therefore kcffm would be a useful tool for lake research using optical remote sensing images and would provide valuable information for the monitoring and

3893,lakes play an important role in terrestrial ecosystems and have a significant impact on human production and life remote sensing techniques have been widely used to monitor changes in lakes several studies have been conducted pertaining to extraction of lake bodies using optical remote sensing images however owing to the influence of ice and snow in the lake and other parameters such as noise the accuracy and stability of lake extraction still need to be improved this study designed a new method by combing k means clustering and the flood fill method kcffm to improve the accuracy and stability of extraction results from complex backgrounds using landsat 8 operational land imager oli data for five lakes in central asia the accuracy and stability of kcffm in summer and winter were evaluated and compared with those of five other methods kcffm showed the highest accuracy and stability among all the methods especially during the lake ice period for kcffm the kappa coefficient was greater than 0 97 and 0 92 and the overall accuracy was greater than 99 and 98 in summer and winter respectively the area error rate of kcffm was less than 3 except for lake alakol less than 10 in addition kcffm significantly decreased the area error rate compared to other methods 1 to 15 in summer and 10 to 50 in winter the proposed method optimized the time continuity accuracy and stability of lake body extraction thus kcffm can provide valuable basic data for monitoring lake water bodies keywords lake landsat k means clustering water index 1 introduction as an important part of surface water resources lakes especially lake areas and lake ice are deeply affected by anthropogenic activities and global climate change guan et al 2020 jiang et al 2017 ma et al 2010 schindler 2009 song et al 2013 song et al 2014 zhang et al 2020b han et al 2019 kouraev et al 2007 yang et al 2020 the rapid accurate and automatic extraction of lake water bodies is of great significance for lake research and monitoring feng et al 2019 xu 2020 filed survey of lakes requires a significant amount of manpower material and financial resources and it is often difficult to obtain long term and stable data huang et al 2018a huang et al 2018b huang et al 2019 huang et al 2020 li et al 2019 satellite imagery especially landsat imagery has been widely used for the extraction of lake water bodies owing to its wide coverage short revisit time and multispectral band characteristics palmer et al 2015 xu 2020 several researchers have conducted various studies on the extraction of lake water bodies by formulating water indices to distinguish water from the background based on its spectral characteristics table 1 lists the water indices that have been commonly used for the extraction of lake water bodies in the past crist 1985 obtained the brightness greenness and humidity through the tasseled cap transformation of the reflectance pertaining to the landsat 5 thematic mapper tm image and pioneered the application of landsat imagery in the extraction of water bodies mcfeeters 1996 constructed the normalized difference water index ndwi using the near infrared and green bands to enhance the water spectrum characteristics xu 2007 modified ndwi to modified normalized difference water index mndwi by replacing the near infrared band with the short wave infrared of tm images mndwi was better than ndwi for the extraction of water bodies in urban areas nevertheless the extraction accuracy of these dual band water indices from complex backgrounds still needs to be improved especially in shadows and dark areas many researchers have used multiple band data of tm or landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper etm images to build models such as the water index wi2006 danaher and collett 2006 furthermore fisher et al 2016 based on wi2006 used surface reflectance instead of top of atmosphere toa reflectance to build another water index named wi2015 which improved the extraction accuracy of water bodies in addition feyisa et al 2014 used the blue green near infrared and mid infrared bands to create an automatic water extraction index awei which includes two cases for unshaded areas and shadowed areas respectively experiments revealed improved accuracy in extraction of water bodies from shadows and dark surfaces to amplify the spectral difference between water and non water surfaces wang et al 2018 based on pure pixel analysis developed a new multi band water index mbwi by selecting several bands with large differences in the spectral characteristics of surface objects the experiment revealed an improved performance for 29 sites in china in addition to these widely used dual band and multi band water indices fuzzy clustering yang et al 2015 machine learning wang et al 2020 wei et al 2018 spectrum matching based on discrete particle swarm optimization jia et al 2018 and other methods are gradually used for the extraction of water bodies although these methods have been widely used in water extraction ogilvie et al 2018 yao et al 2019 xu 2018 the accuracy of extracting lake water bodies from complex backgrounds still requires improvement several lake mapping products liao et al 2014 sheng et al 2016 verpoorter et al 2014 have been presented however few studies have focused on accurately extracting lake water bodies when the lake surface is covered by ice and snow the widely used water indices have relatively higher total errors in winter compared with those in other seasons wang et al 2018 several researchers have ignored datasets pertaining to regions that are covered by ice and snow yuan et al 2018 and the results extracted proved to be discontinuous other researchers implemented manual visual interpretation and several other manual techniques after the extraction of lake water bodies zhang et al 2020a this proved to be time consuming and labor intensive in case of processing a large number of remote sensing images to resolve the above mentioned problems in this study a novel method that combines k means clustering method kcm and a flood fill ff algorithm to extract lake water bodies has been proposed after assessment and comparison with other methods for five lakes located in central asia using the landsat 8 operational land imager oli images in summer and winter our proposed method can be used to improve the accuracy of lake water extraction from complex backgrounds including lake ice cover 2 study area and dataset 2 1 study area central asia is located in the center of the eurasian continent and mainly covers kazakhstan kyrgyzstan and the xinjiang region of china in central asia more than 60 lakes are larger than 100 km2 jun li et al 2013 this area is controlled by an arid and semi arid climate abuduwaili et al 2019 with hot and dry weather in summer and cold weather in winter this region witness uneven distribution of water resources and severe droughts in addition lakes and reservoirs are the most important water resources found in this region che et al 2019 klein et al 2014 five lakes in central asia were selected lake balkhash lake issykkul lake alakol kapchagayskoye reservoir and lake sayram fig 1 the selection was based on the following criteria 1 size super large lakes larger than10 000 km2 large lakes larger than 1000 km2 and small and medium sized lakes 2 type natural lakes and reservoirs and 3 background surface features mountain lakes and plain lakes information regarding the five selected lakes is presented in table 2 2 2 dataset the data used in this study include landsat 8 oli images shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem data and sentinel 2 images landsat 8 oli the latest landsat 8 satellite launched by the earth resources satellite has been in service since february 2013 the satellite carries a new oli including all the bands of the etm sensor to avoid atmospheric absorption characteristics oli reconfigured the bands and included nine bands in total with a spatial resolution of 30 m the landsat 8 oli images used in this study were all derived from the landsat 8 surface reflectance sr dataset from the google earth engine gee platform which acquires the image collection from the united states geological survey usgs landsat 8 sr dataset https code earthengine google com dataset landsat lc08 c01 t1 sr this study incorporated landsat 8 images from december 2016 to february 2017 winter and june 2017 to august 2017 summer dem data the dem data used in this study were derived from srtm this mission was a collaborative effort by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the national geospatial intelligence agency nga and the participation of the german and italian space agencies in the year 2000 the srtm v3 product used in this study with a resolution of 30 m was acquired from the gee platform https developers google com earth engine datasets catalog usgs srtm gl1 003 sentinel 2 image to verify the accuracy of the extraction results of our method the sentinel 2 high resolution image was used as the reference verification data sentinel 2 is a part of the copernicus program released by the european space agency esa which mostly provides high resolution optical images sentinel 2a and 2b products with a spatial resolution of 10 m the sentinel 2 images used in this study are also from the sentinel 2 dataset on the gee platform and selected at a similar time to landsat 8 images https developers google com earth engine datasets catalog copernicus s2 sr 3 methodology the method used in this study includes five steps fig 2 1 preprocessing of landsat 8 oli images 2 removing mountain shadow from each image using dem data 3 calculating indicators for multi band images and using k means clustering to generate classification results 4 extracting lake water bodies from the classification results through the ff algorithm and 5 evaluating the accuracy of extraction of lake water bodies each step is described in detail below 3 1 image preprocessing radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction of satellite images are important prerequisites for obtaining high quality data chander et al 2009 the landsat 8 oli image dataset provided by gee performs image preprocessing for the 1 t products from usgs owing to the influence of cloud monthly cloudless images were almost impossible to obtain therefore we selected the images from december 2016 to february 2017 winter and from june 2017 to august 2017 summer based on the built in cloud scoring algorithm provided by gee cloud removal was carried out by multi temporal synthesis gorelick et al 2017 firstly the cloudless pixels of the images pertaining to each lake were screened out according to the quality assessment qa band furthermore the median value of the cloudless pixels was selected and a seasonal cloudless image was formed 3 2 removing mountain shadow the large mountains in the study area with high altitude along with the mountain shadows have an influence on the extraction of lake water bodies owing to their similar spectral characteristics with water verpoorter et al 2012 this study implemented dem data to eliminate the influence of mountain shadows in order to improve the extraction accuracy of lake water bodies li and sheng 2012 firstly the gradient of each pixel was calculated based on the strm dem data through the four way gradient algorithm on the gee platform furthermore the mountain shadows were removed when the pixel slope was less than 10 and the range of flat terrain was delineated due to the non participation of pixels in the subsequent classification and extraction steps the computing time and internal storage are effectively saved however minimum effect was observed on the extraction accuracy of lake water bodies during the non ice and non snow periods 3 3 k means clustering for image classification as a widely used water extraction method the threshold segmentation method based on the water index distinguishes water and non water pixels by the bimodal feature of the index histogram this method calculates the euclidean distance between similar pixels and the images are then classified based on the distance however the characteristics of similar pixels contain several dimensions and adding more effective index information can improve the accuracy of pixel discrimination the kcm is adopted in this study to distinguish similar pixels as it incorporates euclidean distance as the deciding condition and freely adds more indicator information kcm is an unsupervised classification method that can gather pixels with similar properties into the same group according to the chosen indicators it is widely used owing to the minimum requirement of prior knowledge and training samples hegarat mascle et al 1997 the principle of kcm is to minimize the sum of the distance between each pixel in the cluster and the cluster center jain 2010 when the cluster centers do not change or the iteration times are sufficiently large the iteration process is stopped and all image pixels are divided into k clusters in this study the euclidean distance between different indicators was calculated as the evaluation standard of pixel similarity the cluster center is the average value of all the pixels in this cluster the objective function can be expressed as 1 e k 1 k i 1 n x i u k 2 where e is the sum of the euclidean distances between pixels and their center in each cluster n is the number of pixels and x i u k 2 is the euclidean distance from the pixel x i to the i cluster center u k the application of kcm in image classification is mainly divided into the following three steps firstly the indicators for image classification were selected the following section discusses the selection of indicators in two cases the non ice period summer and the ice period winter in summer the extraction accuracy of lake water bodies is mainly affected by mountain shadows and built up areas in the images the near infrared band nir band ndwi and aweish were selected as the three indicators in the kcm the reasons are as follows 1 surface water has strong absorption spectral characteristics in the nir band which is useful for distinguishing water from other surface types in images 2 ndwi extracts water bodies by amplifying the difference in spectral signatures between water and non water pixels 3 the aweish method is more suitable for the mountainous landform of central asia owing to its high classification accuracy in the shaded areas in winter the extraction accuracy of lake water bodies is affected by mountain shadows snow and land ice in the images especially for regions with wide snow and ice cover the blue band mid infrared swir band and snow cover index ndsi were chosen as indicators in winter because of the following reasons 1 compared to other land cover types water ice and snow have lower reflectance in the nir and swir band 2 ice snow and water indicate similar spectral signatures from visible spectrum bands to the nir band but the reflectance values of ice and snow in the blue band are higher than those of water 3 the ndsi has been proven to effectively distinguish snow and non snow pixels in moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis images salomonson and appel 2006 therefore these three indicators selected in kcm can effectively distinguish snow ice and other surface types and are suitable for most lakes in central asia which are covered by snow and ice in winter secondly the number of clusters and the initial center of the kcm are important parameters jain 2010 according to the surface types derived from visual interpretation the classification number of kcm was set to 3 therefore the surface types were divided into three clusters the initial center of each cluster was calculated using the following formula 2 cente r summer nir ndwi aweish 0 25 0 01 0 1 0 05 0 7 0 5 0 7 0 25 0 7 3 cente r winter blue swir ndsi 0 25 0 01 0 1 0 05 0 7 0 5 0 7 0 25 0 7 where cente r summer cente r winter are the initial centers of the cluster in summer and winter respectively thirdly each pixel would be classified to a certain cluster according to the minimum distance to the initial center when all pixels were divided in to three clusters the new center of each cluster formed we repeated the above operations for iteration until the center did not change and acquired the classification results 3 4 ff algorithm to obtain accurate lake boundaries and areas it is also necessary to extract the lake body from the classification results derived from the kcm the extraction procedure is critical as it aims to entirely remove the small clastic points of water or ice outside the lake boundary and achieve a complete and closed lake basin several studies have implemented visual interpretation to extract lakes and manually remove clastic points outside the lake basin although visual interpretation has high accuracy it is time consuming and labor intensive in large regions and for computation of long term time series compared with other types of water bodies lakes are surrounded by land and the lake basin is relatively closed so that water pixels are connected inside the lake body according to the characteristics of lakes this study used the ff algorithm which can automatically extract the lake body remove the clastic points outside the lake basin and obtain more accurate lake areas the ff algorithm is a classic algorithm that can extract a number of connected points inside an area from other adjacent areas berends and van de wal 2016 burtsev and kuzmin 1993 its major step is to start with an initial node and then extract the points in the same cluster connected to the initial node until all points in the enclosed region are processed we selected a point in the lake which is usually the center point of the image as the initial node and used the ff algorithm to identify all lake pixels inside the lake and eventually extract the entire lake boundary therefore the overall method in this study is named as k means clustering and the flood fill method kcffm in winter the lake boundary was covered by snow and the lake basin was not closed which would cause inadequate extraction of the lake bodies on implementing the ff algorithm therefore additional recognition is performed on snow pixels in images when the snow cover area is more than 30 of the total area the recognition condition is based on the assumption that the slope of the snow pixel is less than 2 which can ensure the closure of the lake boundary 3 5 accuracy assessment the accuracy assessment uses three indicators overall accuracy oa kappa coefficient ka and lake area error five other water extraction methods were selected for comparison with kcffm in terms of extraction accuracy for each lake namely the nir single band threshold method wang et al 2014 ndwi mndwi mbwi and aweish the extraction results from sentinel 2 images by visual interpretation were used as validation data 4 results 4 1 analysis of extraction results 4 1 1 extraction results of kcffm fig 3 displays the extraction results for lake balkhash using the kcffm the extraction results for lake alakol lake issykkul reservoir kapchagayskoye and lake sayram using the kcffm can be seen in figs s3 s10 kcffm can efficiently extract most of the lake bodies from complex surface backgrounds in summer the red area pertaining to misclassification was low indicating that the extraction accuracy of the lake body was very high moreover the misclassification was mostly concentrated in the mixed pixels at the lake boundary fig 3a in winter a large part of the images is covered by snow and ice therefore the extraction accuracy is lower than that computed for summer fig 3b owing to the influence of snow and ice there are several commission and omission errors of lake extraction which are mostly concentrated at the boundary of the lake basin and the snow and ice covered areas however kcffm can extract most lake bodies and identify various forms of water effectively which is convenient for monitoring the dynamics of water and ice inside the lake 4 1 2 comparison of lake body extraction using different methods to further explore the advantages of kcffm the kapchagayskoye reservoir was used as an example to compare the extraction results of kcffm with those of the other five methods fig 4 and fig 5 as shown in fig 4 most of the lake bodies could be extracted accurately in summer by implementing six different methods with few misclassifications at the lake boundary however kcffm exhibited the least misclassification shown in region 1 and region 2 in addition to the misclassifications of the mixed pixels at the lake boundaries the five other methods exhibited misclassifications in the background e g in the dark swamp near the river on the right side of the lake the nir single band threshold method demonstrated the greatest number of misclassifications followed by mbwi fig 4c f kcffm did not display misclassifications in the background outside the lake fig 4b as it could successfully filter the pixels in mountain shadows and dark areas which were easily confused with water bodies in the background in summer kcffm was the most accurate and stable among all the methods fig 5 shows the lake body extraction of the kapchagayskoye reservoir in winter it can be seen that on implementation of the nir single band threshold method both mndwi and aweish demonstrated a large range of misclassification in the background fig 5c e and g thus it can be inferred that these methods were incapable of extracting the lake bodies under snow and ice covered conditions ndwi could only extract a small part of the lake body blue part and demonstrated very little ability to identify lake ice fig 5d kcffm and mbwi could extract the lake surface and most misclassifications appeared at the mixed pixel value at the boundary fig 5b f however mbwi demonstrated higher commission and omission errors than kcffm in mountain shadows and dark construction areas therefore kcffm was superior among all the methods and the performance of the kcffm was the best in winter similar comparison results could be found for other lakes fig s1 s8 4 2 accuracy assessment 4 2 1 accuracy of different methods for lake body extraction the extraction results of each method were evaluated using accuracy indicators tables 3 and 4 show the ka and oa of the results extracted by each method for the five lakes respectively for ffkcm the ka was greater than 0 97 in summer and the oa was greater than 99 in all lakes the indicator values of kcffm were the lowest and the ka and oa were approximately 0 97 and 99 3 respectively for lake alakol in summer the performances of the five other methods were also relatively good with the ka values and oa in most cases being greater than 0 9 and greater than 90 respectively additionally the ndwi method achieved the best performance with ka greater than 0 97 and oa greater than 98 5 however there were few exceptions for example the accuracy of the nir single band threshold method was very low in lake alakol ka 0 17 oa 51 5 and mbwi and aweish exhibited slightly lower accuracy in lake alakol and lake issykkul ka less than 0 9 oa less than 90 in winter regarding kcffm the ka was greater than 0 92 and oa was greater than 98 in all lakes however the performance of the five other methods declined sharply demonstrating extraction failure in several lakes mostly ka less than 0 4 oa less than 70 for instance mndwi failed to extract the lake body in lake balkhash ka 0 146 oa 29 6 and lake alakol ka 0 09 oa 37 in addition the ka for ndwi in lake issykkul and lake sayram was negative although the overall performance of the five other methods was poor few of them performed well in specific lakes for example the accuracy of the nir single band threshold method in lake issykkul was slightly higher ka 0 707 oa 86 7 and the oa of ndwi in lake balkhash and lake alakol was also higher oa 87 7 than basic extraction accuracy requirements among the five other methods mbwi showed the most stable performance and met the basic extraction accuracy requirements ka greater than 0 4 oa greater than 70 in all lakes except lake alakol however its accuracy was still significantly lower than that of kcffm kcffm showed the highest accuracy and stability among all the methods and was suitable for all five lakes 4 2 2 accuracy of lake area extracted by different methods in this study the lake areas calculated using the sentinel 2 image were used to validate the area accuracy and the error rate er of the lake area obtained by various methods was calculated table 5 the er of the lake area was larger than 100 showed in table 5 because the method failed to effectively extract the lake body from surface backgrounds for instance most of the background was misclassified to the lake body in lake alakol by aweish in winter fig s2 therefore the lake area included most of the background and was very large in these cases a large number of background pixels were misclassified into lake pixels thus the area acquired was greater than the true lake area the lowest er of the balkhash lake area was exhibited by ndwi in summer er 1 29 and kcffm and mbwi in winter er 2 58 the ndwi in summer er 0 17 and kcffm in winter er 1 34 yielded the most accurate results for the lake area of kapchagayskoye for the other three lakes the kcffm exhibited the minimum area error the er of the lake area by kcffm in the four lakes was less than 3 except for lake alakol in winter er 8 8 this is because the region between lake alakol and the small swamp lake in the north was mostly covered by snow and ice and the lake boundary was sheltered in terms of lake area kcffm was the most stable and accurate method and could decrease the er of the lake area more significantly than the other methods 1 15 in summer and 10 50 in winter 5 discussion 5 1 the theoretical basis for selection of indicators pure pixel analysis was carried out on the landsat 8 images in order to prove that the indicators selected in the k means clustering step of kcffm can efficiently reflect the diversity in spectral signatures for different surface types a pure pixel means that the pixel contains only one type of surface information and its spectral information is the theoretical foundation for identifying different surface types we selected more than 700 pure pixel points and it was necessary to select the centers of various surface types to avoid mixed pixels at the boundaries the distributions of the spectral reflectance and water indices for all the pure pixels are depicted in fig 6 the results showed that the indicators selected in summer fig 6a b including the nir band ndwi and aweish were able to correctly distinguish between water and non water pixels showing that there was no overlap between boxes for example the range of the nir band from 0 05 to 0 15 can effectively distinguish between water and non water pixels fig 6c and 6d illustrate the three indicators selected in winter the blue band value of approximately 0 1 and 0 6 can distinguish water lake ice and snow pixels the swir band value of approximately 0 can distinguish lake ice and water pixels and the ndsi value of approximately 0 6 can distinguish ground pixels from others the combination of these three indictors can effectively distinguish water lake ice snow and other land cover types in winter compared with the single index method the k means clustering method can combine more spectral signature information and select more targeted indicators according to different lakes surface types and seasons for example we selected aweish as one of indicators in the central asia region considering it could effectively eliminate mountain shadows in mountainous areas 5 2 influence of lake ice cover on lake body extraction fig 7 a shows the clustering of all pixels in the lake sayram of kcffm it can be inferred that all pixels were divided into three categories except the pixels in the yellow circle which were close together this indicated that the euclidian distance of the three indicators was able to distinguish these pixels on the whole in addition the blue band swir band and ndsi could distinguish pixels when there was snow and ice cover in the region fig 7b f shows the histograms of the other water index methods and the threshold calculated by the otsu method li et al 2016 ostu 1979 xie et al 2016 as demonstrated the histograms of ndwi mndwi and mbwi represent a single peak characteristic without obvious troughs therefore the threshold failed to distinguish the lake bodies from the background the histograms of the nir band threshold method and aweish exhibited multi peak characteristics and demonstrated several unobvious troughs this further proved that solely dividing into two categories cannot provide theoretical justification in winter by increasing the number of categories more than two and selecting targeted indicators kcffm could discriminate major land surface types from complex backgrounds including lake ice cover compared with other water index methods kcffm is not solely limited to water bodies and non water bodies and is able to demonstrate better performance in lake ice or snow covered regions 5 3 the applicability of kcffm in extracting small lake bodies the five lakes discussed before are of medium or large size to test the applicability of kcffm in the small lake several complementary works were conducted in reservoir bartogay reservoir bartogay is in kazakhstan and about 16 km2 in area fig s9 s10 displays the extraction results of reservoir bartogay by different methods it can be seen that there were many misclassifications about the mountain shadow by the nir single band threshold method besides the rivers connected with reservoir bartogay were also been extracted by ndwi mndwi mbwi and aweish method in winter the nir single band threshold method and ndwi failed to extract the lake body showing all misclassifications inside the lake the extraction results of reservoir bartogay by mndwi mbwi and aweish in winter has many errors owing to the mountain shadow and snow while only kcffm showed comparatively accurate extraction results the ka oa and er of lake bartogay for different methods in the table s1 s3 demonstrated similar results 5 4 the characteristics of kcffm in contrast to five other methods the kcffm was designed according to the physical characteristics of lakes and the spectral reflectance of surface types combining k means clustering and the ff algorithm the results showed that kcffm performed successfully in different lakes from different backgrounds in central asia and modifying indicators may be able to adjust in different regions based on user judgments kcm is one of the simplest methods in unsupervised classification which can define a naturally similar spectral cluster in multispectral images and does not require a large number of prior training samples in addition to optical remote sensing images with different spatial resolutions kcm can also be applied to sar images to monitor lake ice and river ice sobiech and dierking 2013 the ff algorithm can capture the characteristics of lakes that are different from other water bodies and automatically remove the clastic points outside the lake which is a key step in acquiring an accurate lake area kcffm is automatic and improves the accuracy and stability of lake extraction results from complex backgrounds including lake ice cover 6 conclusion lake monitoring plays an important role in lake research and water resource management which benefits significantly from the appearance of remote sensing images however owing to the influence of snow and ice in the lake or other noises in relation to different surface types the accuracy and stability of lake body extraction from satellite images still need to be improved in this study a new method called kcffm was proposed for lake body extraction which can automatically extract lake bodies from landsat 8 oli images with improved accuracy and stability the extraction results using kcffm and five other water extraction methods nir single band threshold method ndwi mndwi mbwi and aweish for five different lakes in central asia in summer and winter were compared kcffm performed best and was able to extract lake bodies and boundaries more accurately and identify different forms of water it solved the problem of lake body extraction from complex backgrounds including lake ice cover effectively improving the accuracy of lake ice monitoring the results showed that 1 kcffm can extract lake bodies in both summer and winter with minimum misclassification compared with other methods the clastic points outside the lake were reduced and the accuracy of the extraction results improved significantly 2 for ffkcm the ka was more than 0 97 and 0 92 and the oa was greater than 99 and 98 in summer and winter respectively mbwi showed the best performance among the five methods and met the basic extraction accuracy requirements in four lakes ka greater than 0 4 oa greater than 70 but its accuracy was still much lower than that of kcffm 3 the er of lake area by kcffm was less than 10 in all lakes less than 3 except lake alakol and could decrease the er more significantly than other methods from 1 to 15 in summer and 10 to 50 in winter experiments on five different types of lakes in central asia showed that kcffm optimizes the time continuity accuracy and stability of lake data processing for research related to lakes and climate change therefore kcffm would be a useful tool for lake research using optical remote sensing images and would provide valuable information for the monitoring and

3894,high temperature aquifer thermal energy storage ht ates is a cost effective and suitable technology to store large amounts of energy ht ates has been demonstrated to be an efficient and stable tool to buffer seasonal imbalances and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions fractured reservoirs are widespread in sedimentary basins worldwide however naturally fractured reservoirs have received little attention as potential formations for ht ates the main concern regarding thermal energy storage in naturally fractured formations is the high fracture permeability which may result in fast fluid flow and an increase in thermal losses therefore quantification of the effects of fracture flow is essential to ht ates site verification an ht ates system in a generic fractured reservoir is simulated with a 3d stochastically generated discrete fracture network dfn model combined with a fluid flow and heat transport model the pressure and temperature evolutions at the well are analyzed and the total extracted energy and thermal recovery efficiency are evaluated the results confirm that the presence of the dfns enhances thermal loss and thereby results in a lower thermal recovery efficiency compared with those of an unfractured reservoir such a decrease can reach 20 however simulations show that naturally fractured reservoirs might be potential candidates for ht ates due to a larger injectivity a further discussion is conducted to characterize the relative importance of the hydrogeological properties of the fractures and fracture network structure on the thermal behavior of the ht ates system this study provides preliminary insights into the impacts of complex natural dfn on the thermal performance of ht ates in fractured reservoirs keywords high temperature aquifer thermal energy storage discrete fracture network hydro thermal couple model geothermal energy 1 introduction the heating and cooling of buildings results in roughly half of the world s final total energy consumption and is driven primarily by fossil fuels resultinginsubstantial emissions of greenhouse gases birdsell et al 2021 concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global warming are increasing among most governments which further promotes the energy transition from conventional fossil fuels to renewable and sustainable energy in these countries however some renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are described as variable energy sources as they are inconsistently available have variable outputs and are unpredictable such characteristics further result in the mismatch between demand and supply thermal energy storage tes is considered a key solution to bridge this seasonal demand supply gap on the one hand tes can facilitate demand side management which may lead to augmented use of variable renewable electricity sources such as wind and solar renaldi et al 2017 on the other hand seasonal tes can store the excess thermal energy supply in the non heating season for use during the winter heating season to meet the thermal energy demand fleuchaus et al 2018 seasonal underground thermal energy storage utes is a sensible tes method characterized by high storage efficiencies and high storage capacities utes sites can be located in underground pits tanks mines caverns and aquifers where large amounts of sensible heat can be stored with high efficiency among these options aquifer thermal energy storage ates has the largest storage capacity ates is a proven technology with great storage potential more than 2800 systems have already been put into operation worldwide by 2018 fleuchaus et al 2018 ates has been demonstrated to be an economic and efficient tool to buffer seasonal imbalances and significantly contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions according to the temperature of the stored water ates can be categorized into two distinctive types 1 low and intermediate temperature aquifer thermal energy storage lt ates in which the stored water temperature usually ranges from 20 to 50 c and the depth of the target aquifer formations is usually below 500 m and 2 high temperature aquifer thermal energy storage ht ates which is typically characterized by a water temperature above 50 c and the depth of the corresponding reservoirs is often deeper than that of lt ates reservoirs typically targeting more than 1000 m depth the lt ates system has been widely studied since the mid 20th century recently ht ates has received renewed interests of a growing scientific community due to its contribution to the energy transition ht ates has several potential advantages over lt ates first a higher fluid temperature leads to a higher energy density and therefore higher economic benefits second operating at higher temperatures could eliminate the need for the heat pump that raises the temperature of the fluid before it enters district heating networks thereby reducing investment costs wesselink et al 2018 finally ht ates can store larger amounts of heat up to 100 gwh yr and typically targets deeper reservoirs than those of lt ates holstenkamp et al 2017 however compared to lt ates the storage of fluid at a high temperature in deep reservoirs is associated with multidisciplinary and complex hydrogeological risks thus a comprehensive investigation of reservoir hydrogeology should be an integral part of any project to develop site specific risk mitigation strategies fleuchaus et al 2020 the feasibility of a ht ates system highly relies on proper reservoir characteristics sedimentary basins are the main geothermal resource distribution areas it is also considered as an ideal formation candidate for thermal energy storage green et al 2021 panja et al 2021a the geothermal reservoirs of sedimentary basins can be generally divided into two types the sandstone porous media reservoir and the carbonate fractured reservoir the difficulty of geothermal fluid reinjection is a common problem in sandstone reservoirs and thus an obstacle for the development and implementation of ht ates while naturally fractured reservoirs are ubiquitous in sedimentary basins march et al 2018 they have received little attention as potential storage formations for ht ates according to fleuchaus et al 2020 the geological formations of the most existing ht ates projects are sand type only recent planned ht ates projects have taken the natural fractured reservoirs into account such as munich project bern project and geneva project thus less experiences were gained with the fractured reservoir formation the research on the potential of establishing ht ates in fractured reservoirs has been poorly studied yet nevertheless fractures or faults play a major role in geothermal fluid migration as they often result in a faster flow preferentially oriented along the fracture and further determine the thermal anomaly distribution chevalier and banton 1999 however to the best of our knowledge the influence of natural fractures on the thermal performance of the ht ates system has been rarely investigated quantifying the impact of fractures on fluid flow and heat transfer in a numerical model is a demanding task due to 1 the complexity and varying nature of fractures and their representation in grid meshes for simulation 2 the correct mathematical description of the thermal and fluid transport processes and the computationally demanding solution of the governing equations information on the complex geometry and topology of fractures in large scale reservoir is difficult to determine traditional methods e g a simple fracture model are often considered to underrepresent the complex distribution of fractures and thus insufficient to characterize them while geologically mapped fracture network methods are challenging to carry out due to the difficulty of performing a complete measurement of natural fracture systems lei et al 2017 a possible solution to these challenges is to study the hydrogeological properties of rock as a function of the fracture topology by means of stochastically generated fractures details on such investigations can be found for example in cacas et al 1990 ito and seol 2003 lee and ni 2015 and lee et al 2019 a review of several other works in which stochastically generated fractures have been used can be found in lei et al 2017 the stochastically generated fracture model can represent natural fractures in a statistical sense and thus capture the main features of fractured reservoirs in recent decades various numerical methods have been proposed for modeling fluid flow and transport processes in fractured reservoirs which can be described using the following three approaches i the equivalent porous medium approach shaik et al 2011 in which averaged estimations of the hydrogeological properties over a representative elementary volume rev are used to represent the domain ii the dual porosity model approach in which the domain is considered the superposition of two continuums representing rocks and fractures fahs et al 2014 march et al 2018 iii the discrete fracture model approach in which the fractures and matrix are handled explicitly berre et al 2021 the third approach is considered as a most accurate model because fractures are explicitly simulated without simplification discrete fracture models can simulate fluid flow and transport behaviors in fractured media particularly in each individual fracture in a more realistic way and reflect the strongly anisotropic flow transport caused by the nonuniform distribution of the fractures discrete fracture models have been successfully applied to domains with a small number of fractures koohbor et al 2019 however discrete fracture models require considerable computational resources when applied to a dense fracture network thus it is inappropriate to apply this approach to real complex reservoirs alternatively a so called hybrid dimensional discrete fracture networks dfns approach is proposed as an approximation of the discrete fracture model it makes use of lower dimensional elements of zero effective thickness to represent the fractures or faults as discontinuities in the rock matrix jacquey et al 2017 watanabe et al 2012 then the fractures are embedded as d 1 dimensional elements into a d dimensional physical domain the main advantage of this method is that it represents the discontinuity resulting from the presence of these fractures without considerably increasing the number of degrees of freedom of the problem furthermore this approach enables the generation of a high quality mesh with a relatively larger mesh size allowed which makes the model more efficient and stable the aforementioned classical dfn approaches usually rely on a conforming mesh in which rock matrix grid elements follow the lower dimensional fracture element features by aligning the element faces with the fracture element geometries flemisch et al 2018 in addition to the classical models several so called non conforming dfn models have been developed in recent years such as embedded discrete fracture method edfm wang et al 2020 extended embedded discrete fracture method xedfm zheng et al 2021 or projection based embedded discrete fracture model pedfm ţene et al 2017 to further address the complex discontinuous interfaces challenges between rock matrix and dfn several numerical methods are proposed such as phase field method lepillier et al 2020 and numerical manifold method nmm hu et al 2015 in recent decades many numerical discretization approaches have been proposed to model fractured reservoirs based on the dfn approach for the purpose of achieving an accurate and reliable numerical solution among these approaches for instance mixed finite element martin et al 2005 mixed virtual element nordbotten et al 2019 and finite volume techniques ahmed et al 2015 ngo et al 2017 have been proposed a python based open source software package porepy integrates several of the abovementioned methods keilegavlen et al 2017 in this work we focus on finite element method fem discretization as the fem is flexible enough to discretize complex subsurface geometries of reservoirs such as fracture intersections or irregularly shaped rock matrices examples for this type of model regarding single phase fluid flow using finite elements and lagrange multipliers can be found in watanabe et al 2010 köppel et al 2019 and schädle et al 2019 approaches using an extended finite element formulation have been presented e g in schwenck et al 2015 for single phase flow and in fumagalli and scotti 2013 for two phase flow recently a variety of models have been developed and applied within the context of enhanced geothermal systems egs in which they have been successfully coupled with fluid flow and heat transfer models for the characterization of natural and artificial fractures in geothermal reservoirs for example cacace and jacquey 2017 developed an open source simulator golem to model the coupled thermal hydraulic mechanical thm processes in fractured rocks using a fully implicit method sun et al 2017 introduced the stochastically generated dfn model into the reservoir modeling in egs with thm coupled however only the 2d model is considered and the fractures are represented as 1d polylines various toolkits have been developed to aid in the coupling between dfn and heat and flow transport numerical simulations hyman et al 2015 developed the open source toolkit dfnworks which combines the feature rejection algorithm for meshing fram and the lagrit meshing toolbox to generate 3d fracture networks and create a computational mesh the generated dfn model and the mesh can be further assembled into other hydro thermal simulators such as pflotran lichtner et al 2015 recently gläser et al 2020 developed an open source software framework frackit for the stochastic generation of fracture networks it provides a means of generating dfns with specific statistical characteristics to be used in conjunction with numerical simulators in this work to quantitatively evaluate the potential of a ht ates system in a naturally fractured reservoir numerical simulations are carried out to characterize the influence of dfns on the thermal performance of ht ates system we use the stochastically generated dfn model to characterize the complex fracture distribution and properties a convenient model tool is provided to simulate fluid flow and heat transport in dfn and rock matrix by coupling of two open source toolkits opengeosys and frackit in particular sensitivity analysis is conducted to characterize the influence of the network structure e g the fracture density and the hydrogeological properties of the fractures on the thermal performance of the ht ates system currently this study is limited to a hydro thermal numerical modeling and no chemical and geomechanical effects are taken into account 2 modeling approach for the purpose of quantitatively describing the fluid flow and heat transport in fractured reservoirs a model that preserve the distinctive features of the dfns is required therefore a numerical model is presented in this work accounting for coupled fluid flow and heat transport in fractured reservoirs in which the governing equations are given separately in rock matrix and fractures to characterize their different behaviors 2 1 governing equations for the porous media a non deformable porous medium is considered to consist of a liquid and a solid phase the volume fraction of liquid phase in the medium is denoted by the porosity n according to the mass conservation of both liquid and solid phases aqueous fluid flow in porous media can be expressed as 1 s m p t q m 0 where s m is the constrained specific storage 1 pa and q m is the darcy velocity m s the specific storage undergoes a mechanical alteration in response to pressure and can be given as s m 1 n k s n k l in terms of the bulk modulus of solid k s and that of liquid k l pa the darcy velocity q m is given as q m k μ p ρ l t g the temperature distribution is based on the energy conservation of the solid fluid mixture assuming local thermal equilibrium between the two phases ts tf t 2 c ρ t t t c l ρ l t q m t λ b t 0 λ b represents the bulk thermal conductivity which can be estimated as λ b n λ f 1 n λ s with λ f and λ s corresponding to the fluid and solid thermal conductivities c and c l j kg k are the specific heat capacities of the porous medium and of geothermal fluid respectively with c defined as c ρ t 1 n c s ρ s n c l ρ l t 2 2 governing equations for the fractures in this work fractures are explicitly represented by lower dimensional finite elements these elements are assumed to be clean e g no asperities are considered in their geometric description and fully saturated n 1 and can be parameterized based on their effective aperture which provides a quantitative measure of the geometric width of the fracture plane in the following the governing equations for fluid flow and heat transfer within fractures are briefly described notably in the current approach we do not distinguish between mechanical and hydraulic apertures of the fracture plane and both are considered constant in the present study because no chemical or mechanic effects are taken into account fluid transport in fractures fractures can be idealized as a parallel plate with an aperture the width of b m it is assumed that the physical processes occur mainly along the surface of fractures and fluid pressure and temperature are uniform across the fracture width single phase fluid flow in discrete fractures can be given as the following volume balance equation along the fractures 3 b s f p t b q f 0 where s f is the specific storage of a fracture and q f is the fluid velocity within the fracture governed by the cubic law snow 1969 zimmerman and yeo 2000 q f b 2 12 μ p ρ l g 2 heat transport in fractures 4 b ρ c t t b λ b t ρ l c l q f t 0 where b is the fracture aperture fluid and heat flux should be exchanged between porous medium and discrete fractures one of the simplest approaches to numerically implement these exchanges is to impose continuity conditions of pressure and temperature along the boundary of porous media and fractures the approach is feasible when discrete fractures have high permeability and the fluid flow within the fractures mainly occurs along the fracture surfaces baca et al 1984 segura and carol 2004 to implement the continuity conditions of variables at the boundary of porous media and fractures one must locate fracture elements along edges of porous medium elements and ensure that both kinds of elements share the same nodes 2 3 numerical solution the above governing equations can be numerically solved using the finite element method fem for space discretization and the backward euler scheme for time discretization the fem is chosen in this study because the method is suitable for handling non uniform complex reservoir geometries the discretized weak forms of the governing equation are given in detail in appendix a the governing equations have been implemented in a flexible object oriented fem based numerical framework opengeosys ogs v5 kolditz et al 2012 watanabe et al 2017 ogs can explicitly considers complex geometric features of fractured systems in heat and flow transport simulations in both 2d and 3d it also provides flexible routines to couple heat and fluid flow model with the geo mechanical simulation the code has successfully been applied to studies of geothermal systems jacquey et al 2017 lepillier et al 2020 parisio et al 2019 however it is difficult to represent low permeable fractures or faults in the models and incapable to handle the discontinuous pressure problems the discretized linear system is solved using a pre conditioned krylov space solver bicgstab a newton raphson iteration scheme is employed for the linearization 2 4 stochastic fracture network generation due to the complex geological structure of reservoirs it is quite difficult to directly obtain information on the large scale fracture network system and describe its distribution in the model generally the number of fractures in a fractured reservoir is large and the fracture intersections are complicated as a result the reservoir is considered to be extremely heterogeneous which further poses a significant challenge in meshing and substantially increases the complexity of computational models to overcome these limitations a 3d stochastic dfn generation approach is employed in which discrete fractures are stochastically generated within a prescribed domain to resemble the real fracture matrix system of fractured reservoirs a large number of fractures are generated and intersected to form a complicated network embedded in the rock matrix in this work the computational suite frackit gläser et al 2020 is used to generate a stochastic dfn in this code each stochastically generated fracture is assigned a location shape size and orientation on the basis of user assigned probability distributions the generation of the dfn occurs by randomly sampling instances of the desired fracture geometry on the basis of the probability distributions of the parameters that describe their orientation and or spatial location after the generation of a new candidate for a fracture entity several user defined constraints are employed for its evaluation these can be used to enforce topological characteristics of the fracture network e g fracture spacing by defining a minimum distance between entities other constraints are targeted at mainly guaranteeing certain mesh properties by avoiding very small length scales and thus ensuring a high quality mesh as constraints one can define a minimum length scale of the intersections between fracture entities a minimum intersection angle and a minimum distance of the intersection geometry to the boundaries of the intersecting entities if the user defined constraints are not fulfilled the candidate can be rejected frackit provides flexibilities with respect to the geometries that can be used in dfn generations and it enables users to mesh the resulting geometries of dfn with the desired resolution and high qualities however the current version of frackit cannot be parallelized which leads to potential enormous computation costs especially when attempting to generating large networks of fractures a detailed document of the suite its abilities applications and references for detailed implementation can be found in gläser et al 2020 once the dfn is generated the open source finite element mesh generator gmsh geuzaine and remacle 2009 is used to create a high resolution computational mesh representation of the dfn a conforming delaunay triangulation of the network is performed to ensure fracture intersections are located along the triangle edges and the fracture elements coincide with the edge of the elements of the porous medium 2 5 coupling between opengeosys ogs and frackit the coupling between ogs and frackit is straightforward via gmsh the detailed coupling routine can be interpreted in the following procedures the stochastic dfn model generated by frackit can be directly exported in gmsh geometry format geo file which mainly includes the geometric features constituting the fractures and matrix e g points lines surfaces and volumes the geometry file geo can be read by gmsh the mesh resolution can be controlled in gmsh by defining the mesh size factor of the points which constitutes the rock matrix or dfn a conforming unstructured mesh is created with gmsh which mainly contains the 3d elements for matrix 2d elements for fractures and 1d elements for fracture intersections the resulting mesh can be directly output as msh format a c script is applied to process the gmsh output msh file into a vtu format supported by paraview visualization software ahrens et al 2005 which is compatible with ogs as the input mesh the vtu file can be import to ogs code which further enables the users to perform the fluid and heat transport simulation a flowchart view that summarizes the model coupling between ogs and frackit presented here is shown in fig 1 the model is validated with two selected benchmarks in aspect of simulating fluid flow and heat transfer within fractures the detailed model validations are described in appendix b 3 ht ates application after validation the model is applied to simulate a ht ates system in a generic fractured reservoir the geometry of the simulation domain is shown in fig 2 which is regarded to represent one quarter of the reservoir due to the axisymmetric geometry the domain consists of three layers from top to bottom the overburden formation aquifer formation and underburden formation the model is 150 m long along the axis and 100 m long along the y axis the aquifer formation thickness varies from 30 to 35 m while the thicknesses of the over and underburden formations range from 30 to 35 m the aquifer is assumed to be located 500 m below the ground surface and the hydraulic gradient is thereby taken into account although the geothermal gradient is neglected in the model to limit the uncertainties of the input variables and focus on the changes in the physical properties of the water and aquifer a single injection production well is considered where hot water is injected and then produced from the same well the injection point shown in fig 2 left is assumed to resemble the injection well in our model the physical and thermal properties of the water and aquifer for the modeling are listed in table 1 the parameters are adopted from literatures with slightly modification to overcome the numerical difficulties the injection rate flux is selected to avoid leading to the hydraulic fracturing of the rock to identify the effects of fractures we compare the model of a fractured reservoir with a fully porous medium an unfractured reservoir the unfractured reservoir holds the same domain geometry as depicted in fig 2 the only difference is no dfn embedded in the aquifer formation the simulated dfn in the fractured reservoir has a total of 28 fractures the characteristics of the dfn and the fracture entities constraints to dfn generation are summarized in table 1 the other model configurations are kept the same as the unfractured reservoir model variations in the fluid density and viscosity resulting from the high temperature water injection into the aquifer are accounted for in the simulations with an equation of state according to the international association for the properties of water and steam iawps wagner and kretzschmar 2008 the detailed operation parameters are listed in table 3 after studying the influence of different mesh sizes and considering the computation time a discretized mesh with a total of 162 680 tetrahedron elements is adopted for the domain with a dfn while a 165 354 tetrahedron element mesh is adopted for the domain without fractures the initial water pressure in the reservoir is assumed to be hydrostatic and a prescribed pressure of 4 mpa is given at the top points of the inputs a hydrostatic dirichlet boundary condition that is identical to the initial condition is assumed at the downstream surface labeled as light yellow in fig 2 left besides a fixed temperature which is identical to the initial condition is also applied at this surface for the other external conditions impermeable boundaries are imposed the initial temperature in the reservoir is 50 c for both the rock and water the temperature at the injection well is set to 90 c during the injection periods a fixed temperature is imposed on the downstream surface corresponding to the initial reservoir temperature the top bottom and other lateral boundaries are thermally insulated each injection production cycle lasts for one year one year is assumed to be 360 days for simplicity the first 6 months 180 days are the storage period while the remaining 6 months are the production period during the storage period 90 c water is injected into the well during the production period the same mass of water is extracted from the well this schedule is repeated for 5 cycles i e 5 years are simulated in total with a constant time step size of 1 d as it is known that the storage capacity of a mono well ht ates system is either constrained by the injection flow rate or constrained by the bottom hole pressure collignon et al 2020 two scenarios in the injection periods are thereby considered scenario 0 identical injection rates in which a constant injection flowrate is applied on the well and identical value is set to both fractured and unfractured reservoirs this scenario also serves as the base case while during the production period same production rate is set to keep the pressure balance scenario 1 identical bottom hole pressure build up in which the well operates under the control of a constant bottom hole pressure and identical value are assumed for both fractured and unfractured reservoirs it is noted that the injection rate and the bottom hole pressure build up are chosen such that the no hydraulic fracturing hf occurs in the reservoir thus the injection production rate is set as 3e 3 m3 s in scenario 0 while in scenario 1 the bottom hole pressure is set as 6 25e 6 pa during injection periods and 1 45e 6 pa during production periods corresponding to a steady state injection production flow rate of 4e 3 m3 s in the fractured reservoir and 3e 3 m3 s in the unfractured reservoir which is further discussed in section 4 2 4 results the simulation results of this ht ates model are discussed in detail in this section first the effects of dfn on the performance of a typical ht ates system are presented the reference case scenario 0 this is followed by the results of the scenario 1 table 2 and the comparison between the two cases a discussion on the sensitivity analysis is also given 4 1 scenario 0 4 1 1 pressure a better understanding of the subsurface hydraulic process is important for determining the thermal performance of ht ates since the fluid flow velocity may directly affect the heat transfer process between the fractures and surrounding rock matrix fig 3 shows the bottom hole pressure evolution at the well at different times it can be observed that the bottom hole pressure in the unfractured reservoir is higher than that in the fractured reservoir during the injection periods while the pressure in the fractured reservoir drops lower during the extraction periods which can be explained by the localized preferential flow paths created by the dfn and the resulting higher flow velocity along the fractures such differences indicate that a higher injection and production rate is allowed in the fractured reservoir moreover the pressure rapidly changes from the time when injection or production begins until steady state conditions within approximately 1 d 4 1 2 temperature fig 4 shows the predicted extracted temperature evolutions for the fractured reservoir and unfractured reservoir over the 5 simulated years in both cases the temperature decreases during the production period mainly due to the mixing of the injected hot water and the relatively colder ambient water in the original reservoir formation however the minimum temperature during the production period increases as the injection production cycling continues although the water injected into the fractured reservoir is 90 c the produced temperatures during the 5th cycle vary from 90 c down to approximately 65 c with a monotonic temperature decline during each production cycle in the unfractured reservoir the temperature variations show less amplitudes as the minimum extracted temperature after approximately 5 cycles is approximately 75 c 10 c higher than that in the fractured case in this study the temperature distributions in the fractured and unfractured reservoirs before and after the 5th cycle are shown in fig 5 the two models show significantly different thermal plume geometries at the injection stage heat exchange takes place between the rock matrix and the fluid flowing in the fracture due to the injection of the high temperature water due to heat conduction the rock matrix is heated gradually forming a high temperature zone the existence of fractures provides fluid conduits that carry more fluid during the injection period which consequently results in more thermal energy being transferred via convection upon extraction the thermal energy stored in the dfn can be recovered more easily with compared to that stored in the rock matrix fig 5 d confirms that the temperature in the fractures is lower than the temperature in the surrounding rock matrix after the 5th extraction period it can be observed that the temperature drop is more rapid near some regions with more fractures connected these connected fractures form the preferential flow pathways for circulating fluid the effect of heat convection is considerably strong in these connected fractures due to the high flow velocity which further enhance the heat loss 4 1 3 thermal recovery efficiency first we introduce the thermal recovery efficiency defined as the ratio of the total recovered energy over the stored amount of energy which can be described as follows η e p r o d e i n j v p r o d c f t p r o d v i n j c f t i n j e p r o d and e i n j are the total produced and injected energy respectively v i n j and v p r o d are the volumes of the injected and produced fluid during the injection and production periods for each cycle t inj and t prod are the injected and produced fluid temperatures and c f is the specific thermal capacity of the geothermal fluid the thermal recovery efficiencies of the fractured reservoir and unfractured reservoir are shown in fig 6 significant differences in thermal recovery efficiency are observed the thermal recovery efficiency of the fractured reservoir is up to 20 less than that of the unfractured reservoir the largest difference arises in the first cycle fig 7 gives the total energy that can be extracted per cycle with respect to the fractured and unfractured reservoirs and the injected energy is also presented as a reference the extracted energy per cycle increases as the injection production cycle continues the difference between the fractured and unfractured reservoirs decreases with an increasing number of cycles 4 1 4 thermal plume in panja et al 2021b it was concluded that the spatial variation in permeability has only a small influence on the temperature distribution however if we consider the dfn as an extreme case of permeability heterogeneity it can be observed from fig 8 that the presence of the fractures significantly disturbs the temperature distribution in the model water convection in fractures can greatly affect the thermal plume geometry indicating that discrete fractures play an important role in accelerating heat transport 4 2 scenario 1 in this section the simulation results given in scenario 1 are presented special attention has been paid to the comparison between the results of scenario 1 and scenario 0 table 4 presents the comparison of injectivity in scenario 1 which is defined as the rate of water injection over the pressure differential satter and iqbal 2016 it is shown that the fractured reservoir allows higher injection rate at the steady state and injectivity with an increasing injection rate the difference of the extracted temperature from the fractured reservoir between the scenario 1 and 0 can be negligible as shown in fig 9 left and both are significantly lower than that of the unfractured reservoir moreover the thermal recovery efficiency of the fractured reservoir in scenario 1 is also 20 lower than that in the unfractured reservoir scenario 0 it can be also observed that increasing the injection rate slightly decreases the thermal recovery efficiency in the fractured reservoir as compared with scenario 0 and scenario 1 fig 10 shows that under the constraint of identical bottom hole pressure the total energy extracted from the fractured reservoir in scenario 1 is comparable to that of the corresponding unfractured reservoir after 5 cycles the extracted energy is even higher from the fractured reservoir than from the unfractured reservoir that can be explained by the higher injectivity in the fractured reservoir 4 3 uncertainty analysis in the previous sections only one set of dfn is examined for the thermal performance of ht ates in order to reduce the uncertainties of the stochastic dfn model we investigate the thermo hydrological responses of fractured reservoirs with various random dfn patterns in real world reservoirs natural fractures were created by a variety of geophysical and geological processes in rock formations the geometry and distribution pattern are irregular therefore we investigate a number of randomly generated fracture networks that collectively represent a variety of distinct dfn geometries and patterns the main objective is to reveal how these network characteristics affect the thermal behavior of the ht ates system rather than to quantify the performance of one specific dfn here the same model parameters listed in table 2 are applied in frackit software to generate another 9 sets of dfn with different fracture patterns and they are labelled as no 1 9 while no 0 network represents the one applied in sections 4 1 and 4 2 the fracture pattern of these dfn is plotted in fig 11 the fracture density of all 10 sets of dfn is constraint to 0 05 0 005 regarding the definition of fracture density it is discussed in detail in section 4 4 4 3 1 scenario 0 the numerical simulations were run for the 10 sets of dfn under the scenario 0 condition with the identical injection production rates the results are compared against the no fracture case the uncertainty range of production temperature during the first extraction period for all the 10 fracture networks is shown in fig 12 both the uncertainty range and the mean temperature curve for the 10 sets of dfn sit below the curve of no fracture case which indicates dfn enhanced heat loss the maximum standard deviation of the production temperature for the 10 sets of dfn is around 2 c and it happens in the mid time of the production period the standard deviation is getting smaller for beginning and end time of the production period fig 13 shows the uncertainty range of thermal recovery efficiency for all the 10 fracture networks it can be observed that thermal recovery efficiency is significantly lower than that of no fracture case the maximum standard deviation of the thermal recovery efficiency for the 10 sets of dfn is around 0 065 see fig 14 4 3 2 scenario 1 to further explore the influence of dfn geometry and pattern on the injectivity of ht ates system the numerical simulations were run for the 10 sets of dfn under the scenario 1 condition with identical bottom hole pressure control the injectivity and injection production flow rates for each set of dfn are summarized in the table 5 injectivity of all 10 sets of dfn is larger than that of the unfractured reservoir the increase of injectivity can reach 20 30 fig 10 plots the mean overall extracted energy during the 5 year cycles for the 10 sets of dfn as well as the uncertainty range it shows that under the constraint of identical bottom hole pressure the total energy extracted from the fractured reservoir is even larger than that of the unfractured reservoir after 5 cycles the extracted energy is more than 10 higher from the fractured reservoir than that from the unfractured reservoir 4 4 discussion as previously mentioned the presence of fractures accounts for the different thermal performances of the ht ates systems in fractured and unfractured reservoirs however how fluid flow and heat transport are influenced by the features of fracture networks is poorly understood therefore it is of great importance to conduct a sensitivity analysis on two distinct categories of fracture network characteristics those relating to the fracture network structure and hydrogeological properties 4 4 1 fracture density in this section the modeling results are compared with regard to different fracture densities of the fracture networks while the fracture apertures and hydrogeological parameters are kept constant throughout the simulations a useful measure is introduced for measurement of the fracture network structures i e the fracture density p f s f v s f is the surface area of the f th fracture and v is the total volume of the domain three fracture densities are taken into account table 6 0 05 0 1 and 0 15 m 1 the corresponding numbers of fractures are 35 55 and 115 for each density we generate 10ndependent dfn realizations fig 15 shows snapshots of 3 groups of dfns one from each of the densities is presented left group 1 low density middle group 2 medium density right group 3 highest density in table 6 the influenced surface area indicates the area that is influenced by hot fluid injection and storage specifically this is the integration of the surface area of the fracture elements that have a higher temperature than the initial temperature 323 15 k the total volume represents the total volume of the 3d domain while the ratio indicates the ratio of the influenced surface area to the total volume clearly changes in the fracture network structure impose a significant influence on the thermal performance of the ht ates system fig 16 shows the temperature evolution curves for different fracture densities a significant temperature drawdown occurs at the well during the 1st extraction cycle in all three cases overall the extracted fluid temperature decreases as the fracture density increases the main reason for these phenomena is that the increase in the fracture density increases the number of fluid seepage paths resulting in an increase in the thermal loss 4 4 2 aperture effects fracture aperture is also one of the main sources of uncertainty in fracture flow modeling this uncertainty is due to the difficulty of accurately quantifying fracture aperture in situ and the limited understanding of the main factors controlling fracture aperture in this section the influence of the aperture of the fractures on thermal loss is investigated by comparing the temperature evolutions with different fracture apertures five groups of aperture values are considered 1 1e 4 m 2 5e 5 m 3 1e 3 m 4 5e 3 m and 5 1e 2 m the case without fractures is also taken as a reference fig 17 depicts the temperature evolution at the well during the 1st cycle of the extraction period it can be observed that by increasing the fracture aperture the produced temperature from the well decreases which indicates that the heat loss is enhanced during fluid flow in fractures with a higher aperture 4 4 3 matrix permeability effects previous literatures birdsell et al 2021 collignon et al 2020 panja et al 2021a have pointed out that the matrix permeability imposes significant effects on the thermal performance of the ht ates system in porous media reservoirs however when the dfn exists how the matrix permeability alters the overall performance of the ht ates system in fractured reservoirs remains unclear in this section two groups of matrix permeabilities have been investigated 1 matrix permeability 1e 14 m2 2 matrix permeability 1e 11 m2 the simulation results are plotted in fig 18 it shows that in both cases the extracted temperature in fractured reservoirs is lower than the unfractured one by decreasing the matrix permeabilities the extracted temperature is getting lower in both fractured and unfractured reservoirs while in the fractured reservoir the extracted temperature is larger in the large permeability case than that in the low permeability case similar trend can be found for the thermal recovery efficiency additionally it is noted that the uncertainty range of low matrix permeability case is wider than that in large permeability case 5 conclusions this paper presents our current knowledge on the characterization of the potential of ht ates in naturally fractured reservoirs a 3d stochastically generated fracture model combined with coupled fluid flow and heat transport simulation is utilized to study the thermal performance of ht ates in a generic fractured reservoir the main contribution of this work to the existing knowledge of ht ates are summarized the presence of the dfns enhances thermal loss and thereby results in a lower thermal recovery efficiency compared with that of the unfractured reservoir the thermal recovery efficiency of the fractured reservoir is approximately 20 lower and the fluid of the temperature extracted from the well is approximately 10 c lower after 5 cycles the fractured reservoir allows higher injectivity compared with that of the unfractured reservoir the increase of injectivity can achieve 20 30 the allowed higher injectivity can offset the lower thermal recovery efficiency which leads to a comparable or even higher overall extracted energy than the unfractured reservoir the hydrogeological properties e g fracture aperture and network structure e g fracture density of dfn play key roles on the thermal performance of ht ates systems overall by integrating stochastic dfn models and available hydro thermal simulation tools i e opengeosys we can make plausible predictions of hot water injection migration production in naturally fractured reservoirs our finding demonstrates that fractured reservoirs can be a potential alternative solution to ht ates storage formations it can also provide some general guides to the design of ht ates in fractured reservoirs furthermore the uncertainties in dfn structures and hydrogeological parameters should be carefully accounted for when

tolerance for linear solver bicgstab is 1e 14 a constant time step size of 1 d is applied throughout the simulation except the benchmark cases the maximum number of nonlinear iterations is 20 appendix b model validation this section is dedicated to validating the accuracy of the ogs model in simulating fluid flow and heat transfer within fractures two benchmark tests are carried out i numerical simulation of single phase isothermal flow within on 52 fracture dfn are compared to those obtained from berre et al 2021 ii validation is performed by comparing ogs results to semi analytical solutions pruess and bodvarsson 1984 in a single fracture single phase isothermal flow within fractures the accuracy of the ogs model with respect to the single phase fluid flow in fractures has been validated in previous literatures however such comparisons were made with only simple discrete fracture models i e only limited amounts of fracture are considered to examine the validity and reliability of the model in a stochastically generated dense dfn model a 3d benchmark presented in berre et al 2021 is selected for validation the case is dedicated to simulating the single phase fluid transport in a 3d dfn note that no thermal and mechanical effects are considered in this case the geometry of the case is based on a subset of the fracture network presented in fumagalli et al 2019 the simulated network has a total of 52 fractures and 106 fracture intersections multiple fractures of which intersect the domain boundary the fracture geometry is depicted in fig b19 the simulation domain is the box ω x y z 500 m 350 m 100 m 1500 m 100 m 500 m in fig b19 the intersections of the two dark surfaces at the top left with the boundary are treated as inlets and a neumann boundary condition is applied with a value of 1 the two purple surfaces are set as outlets of the domain where dirichlet boundary conditions are applied with a pressure of zero initially the pressure over the domain is set to zero for simplicity gravity is not taken into account the total simulation time is 5e 3 s and a constant time step of 5 s is applied the parameters for permeability and porosity are listed in table b7 fig b20 shows the hydraulic head profiles along two specified lines both lines start at the outflow boundaries where the hydraulic head is 0 the first line ends at the opposite vertex point of the inlet while the second ends at the inlet boundary the simulation results are compared against the results reported from berre et al 2021 a good agreement can be observed between the simulation results and reference results single phase flow and heat transfer within a single fracture following the original benchmark configuration in wang et al 2020 two cases are simulated here in the first case only fractures are included in the numerical model which means the heat supply from surrounding rock matrix is ignored in the second case both the fracture and its surrounding rocks are included in the numerical setup and the heat supply from surrounding rock matrix is taken into account the parameters applied in the numerical models are presented in table b8 for validation the simulation results are compared against the semi analytical solution presented in pruess and bodvarsson 1984 fig b21 presents the simulation results of the outlet temperature vs time for these two cases it s observed that results based on the ogs simulation model have a good agreement with semi analytical solutions for both cases the first case with no heat supplies from surrounding rocks matrix has an early thermal breakthrough time and a faster temperature decrease 
3894,high temperature aquifer thermal energy storage ht ates is a cost effective and suitable technology to store large amounts of energy ht ates has been demonstrated to be an efficient and stable tool to buffer seasonal imbalances and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions fractured reservoirs are widespread in sedimentary basins worldwide however naturally fractured reservoirs have received little attention as potential formations for ht ates the main concern regarding thermal energy storage in naturally fractured formations is the high fracture permeability which may result in fast fluid flow and an increase in thermal losses therefore quantification of the effects of fracture flow is essential to ht ates site verification an ht ates system in a generic fractured reservoir is simulated with a 3d stochastically generated discrete fracture network dfn model combined with a fluid flow and heat transport model the pressure and temperature evolutions at the well are analyzed and the total extracted energy and thermal recovery efficiency are evaluated the results confirm that the presence of the dfns enhances thermal loss and thereby results in a lower thermal recovery efficiency compared with those of an unfractured reservoir such a decrease can reach 20 however simulations show that naturally fractured reservoirs might be potential candidates for ht ates due to a larger injectivity a further discussion is conducted to characterize the relative importance of the hydrogeological properties of the fractures and fracture network structure on the thermal behavior of the ht ates system this study provides preliminary insights into the impacts of complex natural dfn on the thermal performance of ht ates in fractured reservoirs keywords high temperature aquifer thermal energy storage discrete fracture network hydro thermal couple model geothermal energy 1 introduction the heating and cooling of buildings results in roughly half of the world s final total energy consumption and is driven primarily by fossil fuels resultinginsubstantial emissions of greenhouse gases birdsell et al 2021 concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global warming are increasing among most governments which further promotes the energy transition from conventional fossil fuels to renewable and sustainable energy in these countries however some renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are described as variable energy sources as they are inconsistently available have variable outputs and are unpredictable such characteristics further result in the mismatch between demand and supply thermal energy storage tes is considered a key solution to bridge this seasonal demand supply gap on the one hand tes can facilitate demand side management which may lead to augmented use of variable renewable electricity sources such as wind and solar renaldi et al 2017 on the other hand seasonal tes can store the excess thermal energy supply in the non heating season for use during the winter heating season to meet the thermal energy demand fleuchaus et al 2018 seasonal underground thermal energy storage utes is a sensible tes method characterized by high storage efficiencies and high storage capacities utes sites can be located in underground pits tanks mines caverns and aquifers where large amounts of sensible heat can be stored with high efficiency among these options aquifer thermal energy storage ates has the largest storage capacity ates is a proven technology with great storage potential more than 2800 systems have already been put into operation worldwide by 2018 fleuchaus et al 2018 ates has been demonstrated to be an economic and efficient tool to buffer seasonal imbalances and significantly contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions according to the temperature of the stored water ates can be categorized into two distinctive types 1 low and intermediate temperature aquifer thermal energy storage lt ates in which the stored water temperature usually ranges from 20 to 50 c and the depth of the target aquifer formations is usually below 500 m and 2 high temperature aquifer thermal energy storage ht ates which is typically characterized by a water temperature above 50 c and the depth of the corresponding reservoirs is often deeper than that of lt ates reservoirs typically targeting more than 1000 m depth the lt ates system has been widely studied since the mid 20th century recently ht ates has received renewed interests of a growing scientific community due to its contribution to the energy transition ht ates has several potential advantages over lt ates first a higher fluid temperature leads to a higher energy density and therefore higher economic benefits second operating at higher temperatures could eliminate the need for the heat pump that raises the temperature of the fluid before it enters district heating networks thereby reducing investment costs wesselink et al 2018 finally ht ates can store larger amounts of heat up to 100 gwh yr and typically targets deeper reservoirs than those of lt ates holstenkamp et al 2017 however compared to lt ates the storage of fluid at a high temperature in deep reservoirs is associated with multidisciplinary and complex hydrogeological risks thus a comprehensive investigation of reservoir hydrogeology should be an integral part of any project to develop site specific risk mitigation strategies fleuchaus et al 2020 the feasibility of a ht ates system highly relies on proper reservoir characteristics sedimentary basins are the main geothermal resource distribution areas it is also considered as an ideal formation candidate for thermal energy storage green et al 2021 panja et al 2021a the geothermal reservoirs of sedimentary basins can be generally divided into two types the sandstone porous media reservoir and the carbonate fractured reservoir the difficulty of geothermal fluid reinjection is a common problem in sandstone reservoirs and thus an obstacle for the development and implementation of ht ates while naturally fractured reservoirs are ubiquitous in sedimentary basins march et al 2018 they have received little attention as potential storage formations for ht ates according to fleuchaus et al 2020 the geological formations of the most existing ht ates projects are sand type only recent planned ht ates projects have taken the natural fractured reservoirs into account such as munich project bern project and geneva project thus less experiences were gained with the fractured reservoir formation the research on the potential of establishing ht ates in fractured reservoirs has been poorly studied yet nevertheless fractures or faults play a major role in geothermal fluid migration as they often result in a faster flow preferentially oriented along the fracture and further determine the thermal anomaly distribution chevalier and banton 1999 however to the best of our knowledge the influence of natural fractures on the thermal performance of the ht ates system has been rarely investigated quantifying the impact of fractures on fluid flow and heat transfer in a numerical model is a demanding task due to 1 the complexity and varying nature of fractures and their representation in grid meshes for simulation 2 the correct mathematical description of the thermal and fluid transport processes and the computationally demanding solution of the governing equations information on the complex geometry and topology of fractures in large scale reservoir is difficult to determine traditional methods e g a simple fracture model are often considered to underrepresent the complex distribution of fractures and thus insufficient to characterize them while geologically mapped fracture network methods are challenging to carry out due to the difficulty of performing a complete measurement of natural fracture systems lei et al 2017 a possible solution to these challenges is to study the hydrogeological properties of rock as a function of the fracture topology by means of stochastically generated fractures details on such investigations can be found for example in cacas et al 1990 ito and seol 2003 lee and ni 2015 and lee et al 2019 a review of several other works in which stochastically generated fractures have been used can be found in lei et al 2017 the stochastically generated fracture model can represent natural fractures in a statistical sense and thus capture the main features of fractured reservoirs in recent decades various numerical methods have been proposed for modeling fluid flow and transport processes in fractured reservoirs which can be described using the following three approaches i the equivalent porous medium approach shaik et al 2011 in which averaged estimations of the hydrogeological properties over a representative elementary volume rev are used to represent the domain ii the dual porosity model approach in which the domain is considered the superposition of two continuums representing rocks and fractures fahs et al 2014 march et al 2018 iii the discrete fracture model approach in which the fractures and matrix are handled explicitly berre et al 2021 the third approach is considered as a most accurate model because fractures are explicitly simulated without simplification discrete fracture models can simulate fluid flow and transport behaviors in fractured media particularly in each individual fracture in a more realistic way and reflect the strongly anisotropic flow transport caused by the nonuniform distribution of the fractures discrete fracture models have been successfully applied to domains with a small number of fractures koohbor et al 2019 however discrete fracture models require considerable computational resources when applied to a dense fracture network thus it is inappropriate to apply this approach to real complex reservoirs alternatively a so called hybrid dimensional discrete fracture networks dfns approach is proposed as an approximation of the discrete fracture model it makes use of lower dimensional elements of zero effective thickness to represent the fractures or faults as discontinuities in the rock matrix jacquey et al 2017 watanabe et al 2012 then the fractures are embedded as d 1 dimensional elements into a d dimensional physical domain the main advantage of this method is that it represents the discontinuity resulting from the presence of these fractures without considerably increasing the number of degrees of freedom of the problem furthermore this approach enables the generation of a high quality mesh with a relatively larger mesh size allowed which makes the model more efficient and stable the aforementioned classical dfn approaches usually rely on a conforming mesh in which rock matrix grid elements follow the lower dimensional fracture element features by aligning the element faces with the fracture element geometries flemisch et al 2018 in addition to the classical models several so called non conforming dfn models have been developed in recent years such as embedded discrete fracture method edfm wang et al 2020 extended embedded discrete fracture method xedfm zheng et al 2021 or projection based embedded discrete fracture model pedfm ţene et al 2017 to further address the complex discontinuous interfaces challenges between rock matrix and dfn several numerical methods are proposed such as phase field method lepillier et al 2020 and numerical manifold method nmm hu et al 2015 in recent decades many numerical discretization approaches have been proposed to model fractured reservoirs based on the dfn approach for the purpose of achieving an accurate and reliable numerical solution among these approaches for instance mixed finite element martin et al 2005 mixed virtual element nordbotten et al 2019 and finite volume techniques ahmed et al 2015 ngo et al 2017 have been proposed a python based open source software package porepy integrates several of the abovementioned methods keilegavlen et al 2017 in this work we focus on finite element method fem discretization as the fem is flexible enough to discretize complex subsurface geometries of reservoirs such as fracture intersections or irregularly shaped rock matrices examples for this type of model regarding single phase fluid flow using finite elements and lagrange multipliers can be found in watanabe et al 2010 köppel et al 2019 and schädle et al 2019 approaches using an extended finite element formulation have been presented e g in schwenck et al 2015 for single phase flow and in fumagalli and scotti 2013 for two phase flow recently a variety of models have been developed and applied within the context of enhanced geothermal systems egs in which they have been successfully coupled with fluid flow and heat transfer models for the characterization of natural and artificial fractures in geothermal reservoirs for example cacace and jacquey 2017 developed an open source simulator golem to model the coupled thermal hydraulic mechanical thm processes in fractured rocks using a fully implicit method sun et al 2017 introduced the stochastically generated dfn model into the reservoir modeling in egs with thm coupled however only the 2d model is considered and the fractures are represented as 1d polylines various toolkits have been developed to aid in the coupling between dfn and heat and flow transport numerical simulations hyman et al 2015 developed the open source toolkit dfnworks which combines the feature rejection algorithm for meshing fram and the lagrit meshing toolbox to generate 3d fracture networks and create a computational mesh the generated dfn model and the mesh can be further assembled into other hydro thermal simulators such as pflotran lichtner et al 2015 recently gläser et al 2020 developed an open source software framework frackit for the stochastic generation of fracture networks it provides a means of generating dfns with specific statistical characteristics to be used in conjunction with numerical simulators in this work to quantitatively evaluate the potential of a ht ates system in a naturally fractured reservoir numerical simulations are carried out to characterize the influence of dfns on the thermal performance of ht ates system we use the stochastically generated dfn model to characterize the complex fracture distribution and properties a convenient model tool is provided to simulate fluid flow and heat transport in dfn and rock matrix by coupling of two open source toolkits opengeosys and frackit in particular sensitivity analysis is conducted to characterize the influence of the network structure e g the fracture density and the hydrogeological properties of the fractures on the thermal performance of the ht ates system currently this study is limited to a hydro thermal numerical modeling and no chemical and geomechanical effects are taken into account 2 modeling approach for the purpose of quantitatively describing the fluid flow and heat transport in fractured reservoirs a model that preserve the distinctive features of the dfns is required therefore a numerical model is presented in this work accounting for coupled fluid flow and heat transport in fractured reservoirs in which the governing equations are given separately in rock matrix and fractures to characterize their different behaviors 2 1 governing equations for the porous media a non deformable porous medium is considered to consist of a liquid and a solid phase the volume fraction of liquid phase in the medium is denoted by the porosity n according to the mass conservation of both liquid and solid phases aqueous fluid flow in porous media can be expressed as 1 s m p t q m 0 where s m is the constrained specific storage 1 pa and q m is the darcy velocity m s the specific storage undergoes a mechanical alteration in response to pressure and can be given as s m 1 n k s n k l in terms of the bulk modulus of solid k s and that of liquid k l pa the darcy velocity q m is given as q m k μ p ρ l t g the temperature distribution is based on the energy conservation of the solid fluid mixture assuming local thermal equilibrium between the two phases ts tf t 2 c ρ t t t c l ρ l t q m t λ b t 0 λ b represents the bulk thermal conductivity which can be estimated as λ b n λ f 1 n λ s with λ f and λ s corresponding to the fluid and solid thermal conductivities c and c l j kg k are the specific heat capacities of the porous medium and of geothermal fluid respectively with c defined as c ρ t 1 n c s ρ s n c l ρ l t 2 2 governing equations for the fractures in this work fractures are explicitly represented by lower dimensional finite elements these elements are assumed to be clean e g no asperities are considered in their geometric description and fully saturated n 1 and can be parameterized based on their effective aperture which provides a quantitative measure of the geometric width of the fracture plane in the following the governing equations for fluid flow and heat transfer within fractures are briefly described notably in the current approach we do not distinguish between mechanical and hydraulic apertures of the fracture plane and both are considered constant in the present study because no chemical or mechanic effects are taken into account fluid transport in fractures fractures can be idealized as a parallel plate with an aperture the width of b m it is assumed that the physical processes occur mainly along the surface of fractures and fluid pressure and temperature are uniform across the fracture width single phase fluid flow in discrete fractures can be given as the following volume balance equation along the fractures 3 b s f p t b q f 0 where s f is the specific storage of a fracture and q f is the fluid velocity within the fracture governed by the cubic law snow 1969 zimmerman and yeo 2000 q f b 2 12 μ p ρ l g 2 heat transport in fractures 4 b ρ c t t b λ b t ρ l c l q f t 0 where b is the fracture aperture fluid and heat flux should be exchanged between porous medium and discrete fractures one of the simplest approaches to numerically implement these exchanges is to impose continuity conditions of pressure and temperature along the boundary of porous media and fractures the approach is feasible when discrete fractures have high permeability and the fluid flow within the fractures mainly occurs along the fracture surfaces baca et al 1984 segura and carol 2004 to implement the continuity conditions of variables at the boundary of porous media and fractures one must locate fracture elements along edges of porous medium elements and ensure that both kinds of elements share the same nodes 2 3 numerical solution the above governing equations can be numerically solved using the finite element method fem for space discretization and the backward euler scheme for time discretization the fem is chosen in this study because the method is suitable for handling non uniform complex reservoir geometries the discretized weak forms of the governing equation are given in detail in appendix a the governing equations have been implemented in a flexible object oriented fem based numerical framework opengeosys ogs v5 kolditz et al 2012 watanabe et al 2017 ogs can explicitly considers complex geometric features of fractured systems in heat and flow transport simulations in both 2d and 3d it also provides flexible routines to couple heat and fluid flow model with the geo mechanical simulation the code has successfully been applied to studies of geothermal systems jacquey et al 2017 lepillier et al 2020 parisio et al 2019 however it is difficult to represent low permeable fractures or faults in the models and incapable to handle the discontinuous pressure problems the discretized linear system is solved using a pre conditioned krylov space solver bicgstab a newton raphson iteration scheme is employed for the linearization 2 4 stochastic fracture network generation due to the complex geological structure of reservoirs it is quite difficult to directly obtain information on the large scale fracture network system and describe its distribution in the model generally the number of fractures in a fractured reservoir is large and the fracture intersections are complicated as a result the reservoir is considered to be extremely heterogeneous which further poses a significant challenge in meshing and substantially increases the complexity of computational models to overcome these limitations a 3d stochastic dfn generation approach is employed in which discrete fractures are stochastically generated within a prescribed domain to resemble the real fracture matrix system of fractured reservoirs a large number of fractures are generated and intersected to form a complicated network embedded in the rock matrix in this work the computational suite frackit gläser et al 2020 is used to generate a stochastic dfn in this code each stochastically generated fracture is assigned a location shape size and orientation on the basis of user assigned probability distributions the generation of the dfn occurs by randomly sampling instances of the desired fracture geometry on the basis of the probability distributions of the parameters that describe their orientation and or spatial location after the generation of a new candidate for a fracture entity several user defined constraints are employed for its evaluation these can be used to enforce topological characteristics of the fracture network e g fracture spacing by defining a minimum distance between entities other constraints are targeted at mainly guaranteeing certain mesh properties by avoiding very small length scales and thus ensuring a high quality mesh as constraints one can define a minimum length scale of the intersections between fracture entities a minimum intersection angle and a minimum distance of the intersection geometry to the boundaries of the intersecting entities if the user defined constraints are not fulfilled the candidate can be rejected frackit provides flexibilities with respect to the geometries that can be used in dfn generations and it enables users to mesh the resulting geometries of dfn with the desired resolution and high qualities however the current version of frackit cannot be parallelized which leads to potential enormous computation costs especially when attempting to generating large networks of fractures a detailed document of the suite its abilities applications and references for detailed implementation can be found in gläser et al 2020 once the dfn is generated the open source finite element mesh generator gmsh geuzaine and remacle 2009 is used to create a high resolution computational mesh representation of the dfn a conforming delaunay triangulation of the network is performed to ensure fracture intersections are located along the triangle edges and the fracture elements coincide with the edge of the elements of the porous medium 2 5 coupling between opengeosys ogs and frackit the coupling between ogs and frackit is straightforward via gmsh the detailed coupling routine can be interpreted in the following procedures the stochastic dfn model generated by frackit can be directly exported in gmsh geometry format geo file which mainly includes the geometric features constituting the fractures and matrix e g points lines surfaces and volumes the geometry file geo can be read by gmsh the mesh resolution can be controlled in gmsh by defining the mesh size factor of the points which constitutes the rock matrix or dfn a conforming unstructured mesh is created with gmsh which mainly contains the 3d elements for matrix 2d elements for fractures and 1d elements for fracture intersections the resulting mesh can be directly output as msh format a c script is applied to process the gmsh output msh file into a vtu format supported by paraview visualization software ahrens et al 2005 which is compatible with ogs as the input mesh the vtu file can be import to ogs code which further enables the users to perform the fluid and heat transport simulation a flowchart view that summarizes the model coupling between ogs and frackit presented here is shown in fig 1 the model is validated with two selected benchmarks in aspect of simulating fluid flow and heat transfer within fractures the detailed model validations are described in appendix b 3 ht ates application after validation the model is applied to simulate a ht ates system in a generic fractured reservoir the geometry of the simulation domain is shown in fig 2 which is regarded to represent one quarter of the reservoir due to the axisymmetric geometry the domain consists of three layers from top to bottom the overburden formation aquifer formation and underburden formation the model is 150 m long along the axis and 100 m long along the y axis the aquifer formation thickness varies from 30 to 35 m while the thicknesses of the over and underburden formations range from 30 to 35 m the aquifer is assumed to be located 500 m below the ground surface and the hydraulic gradient is thereby taken into account although the geothermal gradient is neglected in the model to limit the uncertainties of the input variables and focus on the changes in the physical properties of the water and aquifer a single injection production well is considered where hot water is injected and then produced from the same well the injection point shown in fig 2 left is assumed to resemble the injection well in our model the physical and thermal properties of the water and aquifer for the modeling are listed in table 1 the parameters are adopted from literatures with slightly modification to overcome the numerical difficulties the injection rate flux is selected to avoid leading to the hydraulic fracturing of the rock to identify the effects of fractures we compare the model of a fractured reservoir with a fully porous medium an unfractured reservoir the unfractured reservoir holds the same domain geometry as depicted in fig 2 the only difference is no dfn embedded in the aquifer formation the simulated dfn in the fractured reservoir has a total of 28 fractures the characteristics of the dfn and the fracture entities constraints to dfn generation are summarized in table 1 the other model configurations are kept the same as the unfractured reservoir model variations in the fluid density and viscosity resulting from the high temperature water injection into the aquifer are accounted for in the simulations with an equation of state according to the international association for the properties of water and steam iawps wagner and kretzschmar 2008 the detailed operation parameters are listed in table 3 after studying the influence of different mesh sizes and considering the computation time a discretized mesh with a total of 162 680 tetrahedron elements is adopted for the domain with a dfn while a 165 354 tetrahedron element mesh is adopted for the domain without fractures the initial water pressure in the reservoir is assumed to be hydrostatic and a prescribed pressure of 4 mpa is given at the top points of the inputs a hydrostatic dirichlet boundary condition that is identical to the initial condition is assumed at the downstream surface labeled as light yellow in fig 2 left besides a fixed temperature which is identical to the initial condition is also applied at this surface for the other external conditions impermeable boundaries are imposed the initial temperature in the reservoir is 50 c for both the rock and water the temperature at the injection well is set to 90 c during the injection periods a fixed temperature is imposed on the downstream surface corresponding to the initial reservoir temperature the top bottom and other lateral boundaries are thermally insulated each injection production cycle lasts for one year one year is assumed to be 360 days for simplicity the first 6 months 180 days are the storage period while the remaining 6 months are the production period during the storage period 90 c water is injected into the well during the production period the same mass of water is extracted from the well this schedule is repeated for 5 cycles i e 5 years are simulated in total with a constant time step size of 1 d as it is known that the storage capacity of a mono well ht ates system is either constrained by the injection flow rate or constrained by the bottom hole pressure collignon et al 2020 two scenarios in the injection periods are thereby considered scenario 0 identical injection rates in which a constant injection flowrate is applied on the well and identical value is set to both fractured and unfractured reservoirs this scenario also serves as the base case while during the production period same production rate is set to keep the pressure balance scenario 1 identical bottom hole pressure build up in which the well operates under the control of a constant bottom hole pressure and identical value are assumed for both fractured and unfractured reservoirs it is noted that the injection rate and the bottom hole pressure build up are chosen such that the no hydraulic fracturing hf occurs in the reservoir thus the injection production rate is set as 3e 3 m3 s in scenario 0 while in scenario 1 the bottom hole pressure is set as 6 25e 6 pa during injection periods and 1 45e 6 pa during production periods corresponding to a steady state injection production flow rate of 4e 3 m3 s in the fractured reservoir and 3e 3 m3 s in the unfractured reservoir which is further discussed in section 4 2 4 results the simulation results of this ht ates model are discussed in detail in this section first the effects of dfn on the performance of a typical ht ates system are presented the reference case scenario 0 this is followed by the results of the scenario 1 table 2 and the comparison between the two cases a discussion on the sensitivity analysis is also given 4 1 scenario 0 4 1 1 pressure a better understanding of the subsurface hydraulic process is important for determining the thermal performance of ht ates since the fluid flow velocity may directly affect the heat transfer process between the fractures and surrounding rock matrix fig 3 shows the bottom hole pressure evolution at the well at different times it can be observed that the bottom hole pressure in the unfractured reservoir is higher than that in the fractured reservoir during the injection periods while the pressure in the fractured reservoir drops lower during the extraction periods which can be explained by the localized preferential flow paths created by the dfn and the resulting higher flow velocity along the fractures such differences indicate that a higher injection and production rate is allowed in the fractured reservoir moreover the pressure rapidly changes from the time when injection or production begins until steady state conditions within approximately 1 d 4 1 2 temperature fig 4 shows the predicted extracted temperature evolutions for the fractured reservoir and unfractured reservoir over the 5 simulated years in both cases the temperature decreases during the production period mainly due to the mixing of the injected hot water and the relatively colder ambient water in the original reservoir formation however the minimum temperature during the production period increases as the injection production cycling continues although the water injected into the fractured reservoir is 90 c the produced temperatures during the 5th cycle vary from 90 c down to approximately 65 c with a monotonic temperature decline during each production cycle in the unfractured reservoir the temperature variations show less amplitudes as the minimum extracted temperature after approximately 5 cycles is approximately 75 c 10 c higher than that in the fractured case in this study the temperature distributions in the fractured and unfractured reservoirs before and after the 5th cycle are shown in fig 5 the two models show significantly different thermal plume geometries at the injection stage heat exchange takes place between the rock matrix and the fluid flowing in the fracture due to the injection of the high temperature water due to heat conduction the rock matrix is heated gradually forming a high temperature zone the existence of fractures provides fluid conduits that carry more fluid during the injection period which consequently results in more thermal energy being transferred via convection upon extraction the thermal energy stored in the dfn can be recovered more easily with compared to that stored in the rock matrix fig 5 d confirms that the temperature in the fractures is lower than the temperature in the surrounding rock matrix after the 5th extraction period it can be observed that the temperature drop is more rapid near some regions with more fractures connected these connected fractures form the preferential flow pathways for circulating fluid the effect of heat convection is considerably strong in these connected fractures due to the high flow velocity which further enhance the heat loss 4 1 3 thermal recovery efficiency first we introduce the thermal recovery efficiency defined as the ratio of the total recovered energy over the stored amount of energy which can be described as follows η e p r o d e i n j v p r o d c f t p r o d v i n j c f t i n j e p r o d and e i n j are the total produced and injected energy respectively v i n j and v p r o d are the volumes of the injected and produced fluid during the injection and production periods for each cycle t inj and t prod are the injected and produced fluid temperatures and c f is the specific thermal capacity of the geothermal fluid the thermal recovery efficiencies of the fractured reservoir and unfractured reservoir are shown in fig 6 significant differences in thermal recovery efficiency are observed the thermal recovery efficiency of the fractured reservoir is up to 20 less than that of the unfractured reservoir the largest difference arises in the first cycle fig 7 gives the total energy that can be extracted per cycle with respect to the fractured and unfractured reservoirs and the injected energy is also presented as a reference the extracted energy per cycle increases as the injection production cycle continues the difference between the fractured and unfractured reservoirs decreases with an increasing number of cycles 4 1 4 thermal plume in panja et al 2021b it was concluded that the spatial variation in permeability has only a small influence on the temperature distribution however if we consider the dfn as an extreme case of permeability heterogeneity it can be observed from fig 8 that the presence of the fractures significantly disturbs the temperature distribution in the model water convection in fractures can greatly affect the thermal plume geometry indicating that discrete fractures play an important role in accelerating heat transport 4 2 scenario 1 in this section the simulation results given in scenario 1 are presented special attention has been paid to the comparison between the results of scenario 1 and scenario 0 table 4 presents the comparison of injectivity in scenario 1 which is defined as the rate of water injection over the pressure differential satter and iqbal 2016 it is shown that the fractured reservoir allows higher injection rate at the steady state and injectivity with an increasing injection rate the difference of the extracted temperature from the fractured reservoir between the scenario 1 and 0 can be negligible as shown in fig 9 left and both are significantly lower than that of the unfractured reservoir moreover the thermal recovery efficiency of the fractured reservoir in scenario 1 is also 20 lower than that in the unfractured reservoir scenario 0 it can be also observed that increasing the injection rate slightly decreases the thermal recovery efficiency in the fractured reservoir as compared with scenario 0 and scenario 1 fig 10 shows that under the constraint of identical bottom hole pressure the total energy extracted from the fractured reservoir in scenario 1 is comparable to that of the corresponding unfractured reservoir after 5 cycles the extracted energy is even higher from the fractured reservoir than from the unfractured reservoir that can be explained by the higher injectivity in the fractured reservoir 4 3 uncertainty analysis in the previous sections only one set of dfn is examined for the thermal performance of ht ates in order to reduce the uncertainties of the stochastic dfn model we investigate the thermo hydrological responses of fractured reservoirs with various random dfn patterns in real world reservoirs natural fractures were created by a variety of geophysical and geological processes in rock formations the geometry and distribution pattern are irregular therefore we investigate a number of randomly generated fracture networks that collectively represent a variety of distinct dfn geometries and patterns the main objective is to reveal how these network characteristics affect the thermal behavior of the ht ates system rather than to quantify the performance of one specific dfn here the same model parameters listed in table 2 are applied in frackit software to generate another 9 sets of dfn with different fracture patterns and they are labelled as no 1 9 while no 0 network represents the one applied in sections 4 1 and 4 2 the fracture pattern of these dfn is plotted in fig 11 the fracture density of all 10 sets of dfn is constraint to 0 05 0 005 regarding the definition of fracture density it is discussed in detail in section 4 4 4 3 1 scenario 0 the numerical simulations were run for the 10 sets of dfn under the scenario 0 condition with the identical injection production rates the results are compared against the no fracture case the uncertainty range of production temperature during the first extraction period for all the 10 fracture networks is shown in fig 12 both the uncertainty range and the mean temperature curve for the 10 sets of dfn sit below the curve of no fracture case which indicates dfn enhanced heat loss the maximum standard deviation of the production temperature for the 10 sets of dfn is around 2 c and it happens in the mid time of the production period the standard deviation is getting smaller for beginning and end time of the production period fig 13 shows the uncertainty range of thermal recovery efficiency for all the 10 fracture networks it can be observed that thermal recovery efficiency is significantly lower than that of no fracture case the maximum standard deviation of the thermal recovery efficiency for the 10 sets of dfn is around 0 065 see fig 14 4 3 2 scenario 1 to further explore the influence of dfn geometry and pattern on the injectivity of ht ates system the numerical simulations were run for the 10 sets of dfn under the scenario 1 condition with identical bottom hole pressure control the injectivity and injection production flow rates for each set of dfn are summarized in the table 5 injectivity of all 10 sets of dfn is larger than that of the unfractured reservoir the increase of injectivity can reach 20 30 fig 10 plots the mean overall extracted energy during the 5 year cycles for the 10 sets of dfn as well as the uncertainty range it shows that under the constraint of identical bottom hole pressure the total energy extracted from the fractured reservoir is even larger than that of the unfractured reservoir after 5 cycles the extracted energy is more than 10 higher from the fractured reservoir than that from the unfractured reservoir 4 4 discussion as previously mentioned the presence of fractures accounts for the different thermal performances of the ht ates systems in fractured and unfractured reservoirs however how fluid flow and heat transport are influenced by the features of fracture networks is poorly understood therefore it is of great importance to conduct a sensitivity analysis on two distinct categories of fracture network characteristics those relating to the fracture network structure and hydrogeological properties 4 4 1 fracture density in this section the modeling results are compared with regard to different fracture densities of the fracture networks while the fracture apertures and hydrogeological parameters are kept constant throughout the simulations a useful measure is introduced for measurement of the fracture network structures i e the fracture density p f s f v s f is the surface area of the f th fracture and v is the total volume of the domain three fracture densities are taken into account table 6 0 05 0 1 and 0 15 m 1 the corresponding numbers of fractures are 35 55 and 115 for each density we generate 10ndependent dfn realizations fig 15 shows snapshots of 3 groups of dfns one from each of the densities is presented left group 1 low density middle group 2 medium density right group 3 highest density in table 6 the influenced surface area indicates the area that is influenced by hot fluid injection and storage specifically this is the integration of the surface area of the fracture elements that have a higher temperature than the initial temperature 323 15 k the total volume represents the total volume of the 3d domain while the ratio indicates the ratio of the influenced surface area to the total volume clearly changes in the fracture network structure impose a significant influence on the thermal performance of the ht ates system fig 16 shows the temperature evolution curves for different fracture densities a significant temperature drawdown occurs at the well during the 1st extraction cycle in all three cases overall the extracted fluid temperature decreases as the fracture density increases the main reason for these phenomena is that the increase in the fracture density increases the number of fluid seepage paths resulting in an increase in the thermal loss 4 4 2 aperture effects fracture aperture is also one of the main sources of uncertainty in fracture flow modeling this uncertainty is due to the difficulty of accurately quantifying fracture aperture in situ and the limited understanding of the main factors controlling fracture aperture in this section the influence of the aperture of the fractures on thermal loss is investigated by comparing the temperature evolutions with different fracture apertures five groups of aperture values are considered 1 1e 4 m 2 5e 5 m 3 1e 3 m 4 5e 3 m and 5 1e 2 m the case without fractures is also taken as a reference fig 17 depicts the temperature evolution at the well during the 1st cycle of the extraction period it can be observed that by increasing the fracture aperture the produced temperature from the well decreases which indicates that the heat loss is enhanced during fluid flow in fractures with a higher aperture 4 4 3 matrix permeability effects previous literatures birdsell et al 2021 collignon et al 2020 panja et al 2021a have pointed out that the matrix permeability imposes significant effects on the thermal performance of the ht ates system in porous media reservoirs however when the dfn exists how the matrix permeability alters the overall performance of the ht ates system in fractured reservoirs remains unclear in this section two groups of matrix permeabilities have been investigated 1 matrix permeability 1e 14 m2 2 matrix permeability 1e 11 m2 the simulation results are plotted in fig 18 it shows that in both cases the extracted temperature in fractured reservoirs is lower than the unfractured one by decreasing the matrix permeabilities the extracted temperature is getting lower in both fractured and unfractured reservoirs while in the fractured reservoir the extracted temperature is larger in the large permeability case than that in the low permeability case similar trend can be found for the thermal recovery efficiency additionally it is noted that the uncertainty range of low matrix permeability case is wider than that in large permeability case 5 conclusions this paper presents our current knowledge on the characterization of the potential of ht ates in naturally fractured reservoirs a 3d stochastically generated fracture model combined with coupled fluid flow and heat transport simulation is utilized to study the thermal performance of ht ates in a generic fractured reservoir the main contribution of this work to the existing knowledge of ht ates are summarized the presence of the dfns enhances thermal loss and thereby results in a lower thermal recovery efficiency compared with that of the unfractured reservoir the thermal recovery efficiency of the fractured reservoir is approximately 20 lower and the fluid of the temperature extracted from the well is approximately 10 c lower after 5 cycles the fractured reservoir allows higher injectivity compared with that of the unfractured reservoir the increase of injectivity can achieve 20 30 the allowed higher injectivity can offset the lower thermal recovery efficiency which leads to a comparable or even higher overall extracted energy than the unfractured reservoir the hydrogeological properties e g fracture aperture and network structure e g fracture density of dfn play key roles on the thermal performance of ht ates systems overall by integrating stochastic dfn models and available hydro thermal simulation tools i e opengeosys we can make plausible predictions of hot water injection migration production in naturally fractured reservoirs our finding demonstrates that fractured reservoirs can be a potential alternative solution to ht ates storage formations it can also provide some general guides to the design of ht ates in fractured reservoirs furthermore the uncertainties in dfn structures and hydrogeological parameters should be carefully accounted for when

tolerance for linear solver bicgstab is 1e 14 a constant time step size of 1 d is applied throughout the simulation except the benchmark cases the maximum number of nonlinear iterations is 20 appendix b model validation this section is dedicated to validating the accuracy of the ogs model in simulating fluid flow and heat transfer within fractures two benchmark tests are carried out i numerical simulation of single phase isothermal flow within on 52 fracture dfn are compared to those obtained from berre et al 2021 ii validation is performed by comparing ogs results to semi analytical solutions pruess and bodvarsson 1984 in a single fracture single phase isothermal flow within fractures the accuracy of the ogs model with respect to the single phase fluid flow in fractures has been validated in previous literatures however such comparisons were made with only simple discrete fracture models i e only limited amounts of fracture are considered to examine the validity and reliability of the model in a stochastically generated dense dfn model a 3d benchmark presented in berre et al 2021 is selected for validation the case is dedicated to simulating the single phase fluid transport in a 3d dfn note that no thermal and mechanical effects are considered in this case the geometry of the case is based on a subset of the fracture network presented in fumagalli et al 2019 the simulated network has a total of 52 fractures and 106 fracture intersections multiple fractures of which intersect the domain boundary the fracture geometry is depicted in fig b19 the simulation domain is the box ω x y z 500 m 350 m 100 m 1500 m 100 m 500 m in fig b19 the intersections of the two dark surfaces at the top left with the boundary are treated as inlets and a neumann boundary condition is applied with a value of 1 the two purple surfaces are set as outlets of the domain where dirichlet boundary conditions are applied with a pressure of zero initially the pressure over the domain is set to zero for simplicity gravity is not taken into account the total simulation time is 5e 3 s and a constant time step of 5 s is applied the parameters for permeability and porosity are listed in table b7 fig b20 shows the hydraulic head profiles along two specified lines both lines start at the outflow boundaries where the hydraulic head is 0 the first line ends at the opposite vertex point of the inlet while the second ends at the inlet boundary the simulation results are compared against the results reported from berre et al 2021 a good agreement can be observed between the simulation results and reference results single phase flow and heat transfer within a single fracture following the original benchmark configuration in wang et al 2020 two cases are simulated here in the first case only fractures are included in the numerical model which means the heat supply from surrounding rock matrix is ignored in the second case both the fracture and its surrounding rocks are included in the numerical setup and the heat supply from surrounding rock matrix is taken into account the parameters applied in the numerical models are presented in table b8 for validation the simulation results are compared against the semi analytical solution presented in pruess and bodvarsson 1984 fig b21 presents the simulation results of the outlet temperature vs time for these two cases it s observed that results based on the ogs simulation model have a good agreement with semi analytical solutions for both cases the first case with no heat supplies from surrounding rocks matrix has an early thermal breakthrough time and a faster temperature decrease
