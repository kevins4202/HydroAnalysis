on local recurrent neural networks was proposed which can be described using state space equation the algorithm for selecting model parameters was obtained by constructing a nonlinear constrained optimization model based on an identification model a sliding mode observer was developed and employed for online fault reconstruction compared with traditional analytical model based thruster fault diagnosis methods the proposed method can determine the fault cause to improve the submarine safety the proposed method was validated based on the data of jiaolong human occupied vehicle hov keywords underwater vehicle fault detection underwater thruster sliding mode observer neural networks 1 introduction unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs are widely used in underwater investigation seabed exploration seabed development marine salvage life saving missions and other fields a thruster is the main power source of uuvs and a main cause of faults occurring in uuvs lin et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 qin et al 2019 therefore detecting thruster faults is essential for improving uuvs safety the drive mode of underwater thrusters includes hydraulic drive and electric drive the hydraulic drive thrusters are mostly used in the heavy remotely operated vehicles rovs jee et al 2015 in human occupied vehicles hovs autonomous underwater vehicles auvs and small and medium rovs most of them use the electric drive thrusters for the electric drive thrusters it is necessary to consider the power transfer from the motor in the sealed shell to the propeller in the sea water the main solutions include two types one is the dynamic sealing scheme mainly based on seal ring or rotating mechanical seal the other is the static sealing scheme based on magnetic coupling scaradozzi et al 2017 pugi et al 2018 among them the thrusters based on magnetic coupling have the advantages of high pressure resistance and high reliability which are the most widely used thruster type in the uuvs therefore this paper will focus on the fault detection problem for magnetic coupling underwater thrusters since the 1990s thruster fault diagnosis has been studied in great detail there are two kinds methods for thruster fault diagnosis one is based on analytical model and the other is based on data driven jiang 2019 in liu et al 2019 chu et al 2020 the sliding mode observers were designed and applied to fault reconstruction of underwater thrusters in sun et al 2016 a thruster failure model was established and a gaussian particle filter was used for the thruster fault diagnosis in terms of application the analytical model based fault diagnosis methods are relatively easy to implement however fault detection correctness depends on the model accuracy lyu et al 2019 due to the data noise external interference and other factors the accurate model is difficult to obtain xu et al 2020 in samy and matias 2018 a data driven diagnosis scheme based on recurrent neural networks and empirical data was established for the soft fault problems of thrusters in yin et al 2020 a thruster fault diagnosis approach based on time frequency entropy enhancement and boundary constraint assisted relative gray relational grade was proposed the data driven based methods do not require modeling however the diagnosis systems are necessary to be designed for different thrusters although the detection correctness is good the universality is not strong in addition it is difficult to analyzing the fault causes because of its black box internal structures lei et al 2020 moreira and lesage 2019 therefore in this study a combined method based on analytical model and data driven was used for complete thruster fault detection many existing analytical model methods were applied at a system level that is the thruster fault was detected using the information of vehicle motion states and thruster control signals liu et al 2020 zhao et al 2014 in baldini et al 2018 a second order sliding mode observer was employed to estimate system states including linear and angular speed states of uuvs in filaretov 2019 thruster fault detection and identification based on the bank of sliding mode observers was proposed however these methods can only detect thruster faults and cannot identify fault locations venkataraman et al 2019 nemati et al 2019 for uuvs dives are time consuming and costly in some fault modes such as propeller loss and blade fracture fault tolerant control can be conducted using remaining redundant thrusters to continue operation in other fault modes such as driver and coil damage the uuvs must stop working and float up to prevent a short circuit therefore determining the thruster fault modes is highly crucial in this study a fault detection scheme was proposed for magnetic coupling underwater thrusters in this scheme the data driven method based on neural networks was used for model identification and the analytical model method based on sliding mode observer was used for fault detection the main innovative research works of this paper includes 1 a model identification method based on local recurrent neural networks was designed and described using state space equations the selection method of model parameters was obtained by constructing a nonlinear constrained optimization model 2 based on an identification model a sliding mode observer was constructed and online fault reconstruction was realized it can isolate the location of the thruster fault which is an advantage thus it can analyze the fault cause more accurately the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the thruster fault model and the fault detection scheme section 3 presents a neural network based model identification method section 4 presents the sliding mode observer for fault detection section 5 provides experimental results section 6 presents conclusions 2 problem description 2 1 fault analysis fig 1 illustrates the composition and control model of magnetic coupling thrusters fig 1 indicates that both a brushless dc motor and driver are placed in a sealed shell a propeller is integrated with an outer rotor of a magnetic coupling the propeller is rotated with a shaft through the magnetic coupling of inner and outer rotors by using a waterproof connector the power supply and control of the brushless dc motor can be realized and the feedback of motor speed can be obtained because most of the drivers of the magnetic coupling underwater thrusters are not integrated with the micro processing unit the speed feedback is in the form of a single pulse that is it is unable to directly determine the direction of the motor in addition the motor current is measured from the external power supply so the direction of the current cannot be obtained either however due to the low acquisition frequency usually set as 1 2 hz of data recording system the direction of speed and current can be estimated according to the symbol of thruster control signals this processing method will inevitably introduce some errors but usually only in 1 2 periods of control signal switching instantaneous the effect on modeling error should be negligible according to experienced personnel most magnetic coupling thruster faults occur in locations such as the driver brushless dc motor magnetic coupler and propeller in uuvs operating in the deep sea environment oil is usually filled in the sealed shell for increasing the compression ability therefore the sealed shell and waterproof connector exhibit high reliability table 1 presents the common fault modes of magnetic coupling thrusters table 1 only provides the simple description of the fault modes of magnetic coupling thrusters in many cases fault modes do not occur separately because of the unique structural form of magnetic coupling thrusters fig 1 propeller winding may lead to power device or coil damage and the exfoliate of the outer rotor inevitably leads to propeller loss accurately analyzing the initial cause of faults is considerably difficult this paper focuses on fault detection in underwater thrusters because uuvs are usually equipped with redundant thrusters when a fault is detected a faulty thruster can be shielded and then fault tolerant control can be performed through thrust reaccommodation 2 2 mathematical model a magnetic coupling thruster system is essentially a brushless dc motor drive system however because the driver is integrated into the sealed shell many state signals are not available therefore a simple mathematical model 1 is used to describe the thruster system chu et al 2019 1 k 1 u r i c e ω l d i d t c m i j d ω d t b ω t ω p k 2 ω where u is the speed control signal k 1 is the ratio coefficient k 1 u is the stator voltage i is the stator current r is the stator resistance ω is the motor speed ω p is the propeller speed k 2 is the reduction ratio of a gear box c e is the electric potential constant c m is the torque constant j is the moment of inertia b is the viscous friction coefficient and t is the load torque of the propeller as mentioned before eq 1 is only a simplified mathematical model it ignores many nonlinear terms and the model parameters may be variables therefore there must be a large modeling error it is not reliable to carry out fault diagnosis based on the model 1 directly however many historical experiences showed that the qualitative relationship among the variables described by eq 1 is certain therefore this paper will carry out fault model analysis and further model identification on the basis of this model in the thruster system presented in eq 1 the input and output are the speed control signal u and propeller speed ω p respectively the motor speed ω and stator current i can be measured the load torque t comprises various torques including mechanical friction and propeller torques t can be decomposed into two parts namely inherent and motor speed dependent therefore t can be represented as follows 2 t t o t ω where t 0 is the inherent load and t ω is the load related to the motor speed next we analyze the mathematical model of the faulty thruster combined with table 1 there are two kinds of fault locations one is motor input including driver and brushless dc motor the other is load output including magnetic coupling and propeller the faults of the driver and brushless dc motor are equivalent to the abnormal input current thus the motor speed is abnormal change in t can be considered the faults of the magnetic coupling and propeller resulting in an abnormal current this analysis is reasonable for example when the power devices of driver such as igbt are damaged the brushless dc motor cannot work which is the same as the phenomenon that occurs when the motor speed is zero when the propeller is lost the brushless dc motor must only drive the inner rotor and current decreases therefore in this paper two kinds of fault location are mapped into two fault signals f ω and f i and the fault location can be determined by reconstructing the fault signal values based on this analysis the mathematical model of the faulty thruster system can be described as follows 3 k u f ω r i c e ω l d i d t c m i f i j d ω d t b ω t o t ω in eq 3 an increase in f ω indicates a faulty load output that is the magnetic coupling or propeller fault and an increase in f i indicates a faulty motor input that is the driver or motor fault 2 3 fault detection scheme for follow up analysis x x 1 x 2 t where x 1 i and x 2 ω thus eq 3 can be rewritten as 4 x a x g x u f where f f 1 f 2 t l 1 f ω j 1 f i t g x u l 1 ku rx 1 c e x 2 j 1 c m x 1 bx 2 t 0 t x 2 t ax a is the hurwitz matrix and it satisfies the lyapunov equation a t p pa q where p p t and q both are positive definite matrices for the thruster system presented in eq 4 when all parameters are known the fault can easily be detected according to an analytical model method however in many cases thruster suppliers do not provide these parameters in addition some parameters change with frequent use therefore in this study the fault detection scheme is divided into two parts first without considering the fault that is f 0 0 t the mathematical model is identified based on data driven method with the control signal stator current and motor speed second the fault signal f is reconstructed using the analytical model method subsequently according to the reconstructed fault signal fault is detected this fault detection scheme presents an advantage of the addition of dedicated detection module for each thruster without the need for increasing the burden of the central control system of uuvs in particular improving an existing uuv by using this scheme is highly convenient in addition the traditional fault detection methods based on analytical models were applied at a system level it can only determine the thruster fault whereas the proposed scheme can isolate location more accurately according to the reconstructed fault signal 3 model identification many methods are available for model identification for example least square and maximum likelihood methods can be employed to identify the parameters presented in eq 4 abtahi et al 2018 liang et al 2010 the implementation of these methods is easy however eq 4 is a simplified linear system model which does not consider many nonlinear items including these nonlinear items is necessary to improve the modeling accuracy because of the nonlinear mapping ability of neural networks local recurrent neural networks are selected to identify an unknown item g x u fig 2 illustrates the structure of local recurrent neural networks in local recurrent neural networks only some hidden layer neurons regress to recurrent layers which is different from other total regression neural networks as we described in chu et al 2017 local recurrent neural networks have a faster learning speed than back propagation and elman neural networks and retain a satisfactory performance optimal weights are obtained when local recurrent neural networks are used to identify g x u such that 5 g x u w ϕ v x hin ε x u where x hin x in x r t is the input vector of a hidden layer x in x u t is the input vector of an input layer x r is the output vector of the recurrent layer which is equal to the output of hidden layer neurons connected to the recurrent layer w is the weight matrix between hidden and output layer neurons v is the weight matrix between input recurrent and hidden layer neurons ϕ vx hin 1 1 e vxhin is the sigmoid function that satisfies ϕ vx hin ϕ m and ϕ v 1 x hin ϕ v 2 x hin v 1 v 2 and ε x u is the optimal approximation error vector for local recurrent neural networks the following assumptions are satisfied assumption 1 the optimal approximation error vector ε x u is bounded and a positive constant ε 0 is present such that ε x u ε 0 assumption 2 both optimal weights w and v are bounded and positive constants w m and v m are present such that w w m and v v m based on the local recurrent neural networks an identification model is represented as 6 x ˆ a x ˆ w ˆ ϕ v ˆ x hin the identification model presented in eq 6 is similar to an adaptive state observer which has been used in many studies rojas and verde 2020 shojaei et al 2019 faramin et al 2019 the large difference in the design of the updating rules of neural network weights must be explained in the adaptive state observer weight updating rules were designed based on lyapunov stability theory generally to ensure the convergence of the lyapunov function sign function is used however introducing the sign function made the identification of the real convergence of the identification model difficult the identification error can be compensated by the sign function that is the convergence of the estimation term cannot be guaranteed in this paper a cost function is constructed and updating rules are derived directly then lyapunov stability theory is used to verify the convergence of the identification model thus no sign function is required and the convergence of identification model can be determined using the cost function consider a cost function as follows 7 j 1 2 x t x where x x x ˆ is the identification error the updating rules of weights presented in eqs 8 and 9 can be derived based on a chain rule 8 w ˆ w λ 1 j w ˆ m 1 x w ˆ 9 v ˆ v λ 2 j v ˆ m 2 x v ˆ where λ 1 and λ 2 are positive learning rates m 1 and m 2 are small positive constants and w w w ˆ and v v v ˆ are weights errors for eqs 8 and 9 the derivatives of the cost function can be represented as 10 j w ˆ j x x x ˆ x ˆ w ˆ x x ˆ w ˆ 11 j v ˆ j x x x ˆ x ˆ ϕ v ˆ x hin ϕ v ˆ x hin v ˆ x x ˆ ϕ v ˆ x hin diag ϕ v ˆ x hin i ϕ v ˆ x hin x hin t if x ˆ 0 then according to eq 6 the static approximation of x ˆ w ˆ and x ˆ ϕ v ˆ x hin can be written as follows 12 x ˆ w ˆ a 1 ϕ v ˆ x hin t 13 x ˆ ϕ v ˆ x ˆ hin a 1 w ˆ using eq 10 13 to eqs 8 and 9 updating rules can be rewritten as 14 w ˆ w λ 1 x t a 1 t ϕ v ˆ x hin t m 1 x w ˆ 15 v ˆ v λ 2 x t a 1 w ˆ diag ϕ v ˆ x hin i ϕ v ˆ x hin t x hin t m 2 x v ˆ next the convergence of the identification model will be verified using lyapunov stability theory according to eqs 4 and 6 the dynamics of identification error can be written as follows 16 x a x w ϕ v ˆ x hin ϖ where ϖ w ϕ v x hin w ϕ v ˆ x hin ε x u because of the optimal weight w optimal approximation error ε x u and sigmoid function ϕ vx hin are bounded an unknown constant δ can be represented as follows 17 ϖ w ϕ v x hin w ϕ v ˆ x hin ε x u δ we selected the following lyapunov function 18 l 1 1 2 x t p x 1 2 tr w t m 1 1 w differentiating eq 18 with respect to the identification error and substituting eq 14 we get 19 l 1 1 2 x t q x x t p w ϕ v ˆ x hin ϖ tr w t m 1 1 λ 1 x t a 1 t ϕ v ˆ x hin t w t x w ˆ because the following inequality holds 20 tr w t w ˆ tr w t w w 1 2 w 2 1 2 w m 2 then 21 l 1 x 1 2 λ min q x p w m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 w 1 2 w 2 p δ 1 2 w m 2 x 1 2 λ min q x 1 2 w p m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 2 1 2 p m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 2 p δ 1 2 w m 2 where λ min q is the minimum eigenvalue of q according to eq 21 l 1 is negative when following conditions are satisfied 22 x x max p m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 2 2 p δ w m 2 λ min q 23 w w max p m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 2 2 p δ w m 2 p m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 from eqs 22 and 23 we can infer that if the norms of estimation error x and weight error w are larger than x max and w max respectively then l 1 is negative that is estimation and weight errors are reduced and thus both estimation and weight errors are bounded furthermore the convergence of the weight error v is analyzed consider the following lyapunov function 24 l 2 1 2 tr v t m 2 1 v differentiating eq 24 and substituting eq 15 to it we get 25 l 2 tr v t m 2 1 λ 2 x t a 1 w ˆ diag ϕ v ˆ x hin i ϕ v ˆ x hin t x hin t v t x v ˆ x m 2 1 λ 2 a 1 w ˆ x hin v tr v t x v ˆ because the following inequality holds 26 tr v t v ˆ tr v t v v 1 2 v 2 1 2 v m 2 then 27 l 2 x 1 2 v m 2 1 λ 2 a 1 w ˆ x hin 2 1 2 m 2 1 λ 2 a 1 w ˆ x hin 2 1 2 v m 2 because the estimation weight w ˆ and weight errors w are both bounded l 2 is negative when the following conditions are satisfied 28 v v max m 2 1 λ 2 a 1 w ˆ x hin 2 v m 2 m 2 1 λ 2 a 1 w ˆ x hin when the norm of weight error v is larger than v max then l 2 is negative and v decreases thus the weight error v is also bounded the aforementioned results indicated that both estimation and weight errors are bounded however error values are concerning in particular the estimation error which reflected the accuracy of model identification the smaller is the estimation error the higher is the accuracy of model identification in eq 22 both δ and w m are unknown however their values are determined for a deterministic neural network structure therefore the upper bound of the estimation error is mainly related to a p and q the computation problem faced when solving eq 22 to obtain suitable values to meet the minimum estimation error is equivalent to the following nonlinear constraint optimization problem 29 min f a p q p m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 2 2 p λ min q s t a t p p a q a 0 p 0 q 0 by solving the optimization problem in eq 29 the values of a p and q can be obtained 4 observer based fault detection this section presents fault detection based on the identification model using the identification model the sliding mode observer presented in eq 30 is constructed for state estimation 30 x ˆ a x ˆ w ˆ ϕ v ˆ x hin k sgn x the state estimation error is defined as x x x ˆ then 31 x a x w ϕ v ˆ x hin w ϕ v x hin w ϕ v ˆ x hin ε x u f k sgn x where k is a positive definite diagonal matrix considering the following lyapunov function 32 l 3 1 2 x t p x differentiating 32 and substituting 31 to it we get 33 l 3 x t q x x t p w ϕ v ˆ x hin w ϕ v x hin w ϕ v ˆ x hin ε x u f k sgn x x t q x x p w ϕ m w m v ε 0 f k because weight errors are bounded a suitable value for k can be obtained such that l 3 0 a sliding motion is established and the estimation error is asymptotically convergent during the sliding motion x 0 and x 0 therefore 31 can be written as 34 k sgn x w ϕ v ˆ x hin w ϕ v x hin w ϕ v ˆ x hin ε x u f applying the equivalent output injection concept the real fault signal f can be represented as 35 f k x x δ w ϕ v ˆ x hin w ϕ v x hin w ϕ v ˆ x hin ε x u where δ is a positive scalar vector because all w w and ε x u are unknown the real fault signal is incalculable the fault signal f is reconstructed as 36 f r k x x δ the reconstructed fault signal deviated from the real fault signal even for no fault the reconstructed fault signal may not be zero therefore similar to most analytical models threshold must be introduced in fault detection the thruster fault depends on whether the reconstructed fault signal exceeds the threshold to improve the accuracy of detection e presented in eq 37 must have the smallest value possible so that a smaller threshold can be selected 37 e w ϕ v ˆ x hin w ϕ v x hin w ϕ v ˆ x hin ε x u w w m v ε 0 from the nonlinear mapping ability of neural networks a considerably small optimal approximation error can be obtained by selecting a reasonable network structure therefore ignoring the optimal approximation error and substituting eq 23 into eq 28 we get 38 e e max p m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 2 2 p δ w m 2 p m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 w m m 2 1 λ 2 a 1 w ˆ x hin 2 v m 2 w m m 2 1 λ 2 a 1 w ˆ x hin when the optimization problem presented in eq 29 is solved e max can be determined therefore for establishing the optimization model we must consider eq 38 and construct the new optimization model as 39 min f a p q p m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 2 2 p λ min q p m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 2 2 p p 3 m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 s t a t p p a q a 0 p 0 q 0 because the solution of optimization problem is offline evaluating the solving speed is not necessary most optimization methods can be used to obtain the most favorable matrix values of a p and q 5 experimental results in order to illustrate the validity of the proposed model identification method and fault detection method the experimental are carried out for the right thruster of the stern of jiaolong hov it should be noted that although the experiment is based on historical data offline the data taken are real and the same therefore the proposed scheme can be transplanted to jiaolong hov for online detection 5 1 model identification results to verify the effectiveness of model identification the data of thruster without fault are used based on the nonlinear constraint optimization model 39 a matlab genetic algorithm toolbox is used to calculate the value of matrix a to improve the optimization speed a is considered as a diagonal matrix once the value of a is calculated it will not change in the subsequence model identification and fault detection however a values obtained from multiple optimizations are different and different a values have influence on the accuracy of model and fault reconstruction therefore we selected a solution with smallest f a p q after multiple optimizations and the a value is selected as a 2 6 0 0 1 0 in the updating rules presented in eqs 14 and 15 parameters are selected as λ 1 0 1 λ 2 0 001 and m 1 m 2 0 01 the numbers of hidden and recurrent layer neurons are 32 and 16 respectively initial weight values are randomly selected from 1 to 1 after model identification 600 control steps of data are used for validation low pass filtering are used for data processing because of the large noise present in the raw data figs 3 and 4 present the validation results of the identification model the mean square deviations of current and speed estimation errors are 1 14 a and 80 55 rpm respectively figs 3 and 4 the estimation results revealed that the identification model is convergent and bounded indicating that the proposed identification method is effective 5 2 fault detection results to verify the effectiveness of the fault detection method the proposed sliding mode observer is used for verification k 8 0 0 1 δ 40 40 because of the error of the identification model the aforementioned normal data is used to select thresholds for fault detection fig 5 presents the estimation fault values obtained by the proposed observer fig 5 indicates that although the thruster is not faulty the fault estimation values do not converge to zero the fault estimation average values are 0 007 a and 0 024 rpm respectively due to the average values are both close to zero if the low pass filters are used the amplitude and oscillation of the estimation values will be significantly reduced however considering that some information may be lost and the fault detection cannot be carried out quickly the threshold selection is directly based on the unprocessed data fig 5 according to the data without fault 1 is the selected threshold for both f 1 and f 2 subsequently the thruster data of the jiaolong hov with fault are used to verify fault detection fig 6 presents the original thruster data including coil current motor speed and control signal fig 6 reveals that after the 440th control step a feedback of motor speed seems normal when the control signal is provided but the coil current is close to zero after the hov was recovered the propeller of thruster was found to be lost that is no load was applied to the motor for the thruster data with fault the fault is detected using the proposed observer presented in eq 30 figs 7 and 8 present the state estimation results of the observer and fig 9 presents the fault estimation results the state estimation errors are convergent and bounded figs 7 and 8 the fault estimation values are not converged to zero because of the errors of model identification fig 9 after the 440th control step the estimation value of f 1 substantially increased when 1 was considered as the threshold it can be judged that the thruster has a fault and the fault occurred at the output end that is magnetic coupling or the propeller is faulty this is in line with the actual fault from the fault model 3 the fault estimation value f 1 is related to the control signal due to the control signal from 528 step to 546 step is zero it can be assumed that the motor is not working and the fault estimated value is zero this is in line with the actual situation the detection results revealed the effectiveness of the proposed method 6 conclusion in this paper a fault detection method based on the sliding mode observer with a neural network model was proposed for magnetic coupling underwater thrusters the parameter selection algorithm of model parameters was obtained by constructing the nonlinear constrained optimization problem the application results of the jiaolong hov indicated that the state space equation based on local recurrent neural networks can be used to describe a dynamic system of underwater thrusters in the case of the fault mode of propeller lost the fault can be detected using the sliding mode observer the experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed model identification and fault detection methods these can be implemented in the existing uuvs as an independent fault detection module for each thruster which can effectively improve uuvs reliability credit authorship contribution statement zhenzhong chu conceptualization methodology

thruster control signals this processing method will inevitably introduce some errors but usually only in 1 2 periods of control signal switching instantaneous the effect on modeling error should be negligible according to experienced personnel most magnetic coupling thruster faults occur in locations such as the driver brushless dc motor magnetic coupler and propeller in uuvs operating in the deep sea environment oil is usually filled in the sealed shell for increasing the compression ability therefore the sealed shell and waterproof connector exhibit high reliability table 1 presents the common fault modes of magnetic coupling thrusters table 1 only provides the simple description of the fault modes of magnetic coupling thrusters in many cases fault modes do not occur separately because of the unique structural form of magnetic coupling thrusters fig 1 propeller winding may lead to power device or coil damage and the exfoliate of the outer rotor inevitably leads to propeller loss accurately analyzing the initial cause of faults is considerably difficult this paper focuses on fault detection in underwater thrusters because uuvs are usually equipped with redundant thrusters when a fault is detected a faulty thruster can be shielded and then fault tolerant control can be performed through thrust reaccommodation 2 2 mathematical model a magnetic coupling thruster system is essentially a brushless dc motor drive system however because the driver is integrated into the sealed shell many state signals are not available therefore a simple mathematical model 1 is used to describe the thruster system chu et al 2019 1 k 1 u r i c e ω l d i d t c m i j d ω d t b ω t ω p k 2 ω where u is the speed control signal k 1 is the ratio coefficient k 1 u is the stator voltage i is the stator current r is the stator resistance ω is the motor speed ω p is the propeller speed k 2 is the reduction ratio of a gear box c e is the electric potential constant c m is the torque constant j is the moment of inertia b is the viscous friction coefficient and t is the load torque of the propeller as mentioned before eq 1 is only a simplified mathematical model it ignores many nonlinear terms and the model parameters may be variables therefore there must be a large modeling error it is not reliable to carry out fault diagnosis based on the model 1 directly however many historical experiences showed that the qualitative relationship among the variables described by eq 1 is certain therefore this paper will carry out fault model analysis and further model identification on the basis of this model in the thruster system presented in eq 1 the input and output are the speed control signal u and propeller speed ω p respectively the motor speed ω and stator current i can be measured the load torque t comprises various torques including mechanical friction and propeller torques t can be decomposed into two parts namely inherent and motor speed dependent therefore t can be represented as follows 2 t t o t ω where t 0 is the inherent load and t ω is the load related to the motor speed next we analyze the mathematical model of the faulty thruster combined with table 1 there are two kinds of fault locations one is motor input including driver and brushless dc motor the other is load output including magnetic coupling and propeller the faults of the driver and brushless dc motor are equivalent to the abnormal input current thus the motor speed is abnormal change in t can be considered the faults of the magnetic coupling and propeller resulting in an abnormal current this analysis is reasonable for example when the power devices of driver such as igbt are damaged the brushless dc motor cannot work which is the same as the phenomenon that occurs when the motor speed is zero when the propeller is lost the brushless dc motor must only drive the inner rotor and current decreases therefore in this paper two kinds of fault location are mapped into two fault signals f ω and f i and the fault location can be determined by reconstructing the fault signal values based on this analysis the mathematical model of the faulty thruster system can be described as follows 3 k u f ω r i c e ω l d i d t c m i f i j d ω d t b ω t o t ω in eq 3 an increase in f ω indicates a faulty load output that is the magnetic coupling or propeller fault and an increase in f i indicates a faulty motor input that is the driver or motor fault 2 3 fault detection scheme for follow up analysis x x 1 x 2 t where x 1 i and x 2 ω thus eq 3 can be rewritten as 4 x a x g x u f where f f 1 f 2 t l 1 f ω j 1 f i t g x u l 1 ku rx 1 c e x 2 j 1 c m x 1 bx 2 t 0 t x 2 t ax a is the hurwitz matrix and it satisfies the lyapunov equation a t p pa q where p p t and q both are positive definite matrices for the thruster system presented in eq 4 when all parameters are known the fault can easily be detected according to an analytical model method however in many cases thruster suppliers do not provide these parameters in addition some parameters change with frequent use therefore in this study the fault detection scheme is divided into two parts first without considering the fault that is f 0 0 t the mathematical model is identified based on data driven method with the control signal stator current and motor speed second the fault signal f is reconstructed using the analytical model method subsequently according to the reconstructed fault signal fault is detected this fault detection scheme presents an advantage of the addition of dedicated detection module for each thruster without the need for increasing the burden of the central control system of uuvs in particular improving an existing uuv by using this scheme is highly convenient in addition the traditional fault detection methods based on analytical models were applied at a system level it can only determine the thruster fault whereas the proposed scheme can isolate location more accurately according to the reconstructed fault signal 3 model identification many methods are available for model identification for example least square and maximum likelihood methods can be employed to identify the parameters presented in eq 4 abtahi et al 2018 liang et al 2010 the implementation of these methods is easy however eq 4 is a simplified linear system model which does not consider many nonlinear items including these nonlinear items is necessary to improve the modeling accuracy because of the nonlinear mapping ability of neural networks local recurrent neural networks are selected to identify an unknown item g x u fig 2 illustrates the structure of local recurrent neural networks in local recurrent neural networks only some hidden layer neurons regress to recurrent layers which is different from other total regression neural networks as we described in chu et al 2017 local recurrent neural networks have a faster learning speed than back propagation and elman neural networks and retain a satisfactory performance optimal weights are obtained when local recurrent neural networks are used to identify g x u such that 5 g x u w ϕ v x hin ε x u where x hin x in x r t is the input vector of a hidden layer x in x u t is the input vector of an input layer x r is the output vector of the recurrent layer which is equal to the output of hidden layer neurons connected to the recurrent layer w is the weight matrix between hidden and output layer neurons v is the weight matrix between input recurrent and hidden layer neurons ϕ vx hin 1 1 e vxhin is the sigmoid function that satisfies ϕ vx hin ϕ m and ϕ v 1 x hin ϕ v 2 x hin v 1 v 2 and ε x u is the optimal approximation error vector for local recurrent neural networks the following assumptions are satisfied assumption 1 the optimal approximation error vector ε x u is bounded and a positive constant ε 0 is present such that ε x u ε 0 assumption 2 both optimal weights w and v are bounded and positive constants w m and v m are present such that w w m and v v m based on the local recurrent neural networks an identification model is represented as 6 x ˆ a x ˆ w ˆ ϕ v ˆ x hin the identification model presented in eq 6 is similar to an adaptive state observer which has been used in many studies rojas and verde 2020 shojaei et al 2019 faramin et al 2019 the large difference in the design of the updating rules of neural network weights must be explained in the adaptive state observer weight updating rules were designed based on lyapunov stability theory generally to ensure the convergence of the lyapunov function sign function is used however introducing the sign function made the identification of the real convergence of the identification model difficult the identification error can be compensated by the sign function that is the convergence of the estimation term cannot be guaranteed in this paper a cost function is constructed and updating rules are derived directly then lyapunov stability theory is used to verify the convergence of the identification model thus no sign function is required and the convergence of identification model can be determined using the cost function consider a cost function as follows 7 j 1 2 x t x where x x x ˆ is the identification error the updating rules of weights presented in eqs 8 and 9 can be derived based on a chain rule 8 w ˆ w λ 1 j w ˆ m 1 x w ˆ 9 v ˆ v λ 2 j v ˆ m 2 x v ˆ where λ 1 and λ 2 are positive learning rates m 1 and m 2 are small positive constants and w w w ˆ and v v v ˆ are weights errors for eqs 8 and 9 the derivatives of the cost function can be represented as 10 j w ˆ j x x x ˆ x ˆ w ˆ x x ˆ w ˆ 11 j v ˆ j x x x ˆ x ˆ ϕ v ˆ x hin ϕ v ˆ x hin v ˆ x x ˆ ϕ v ˆ x hin diag ϕ v ˆ x hin i ϕ v ˆ x hin x hin t if x ˆ 0 then according to eq 6 the static approximation of x ˆ w ˆ and x ˆ ϕ v ˆ x hin can be written as follows 12 x ˆ w ˆ a 1 ϕ v ˆ x hin t 13 x ˆ ϕ v ˆ x ˆ hin a 1 w ˆ using eq 10 13 to eqs 8 and 9 updating rules can be rewritten as 14 w ˆ w λ 1 x t a 1 t ϕ v ˆ x hin t m 1 x w ˆ 15 v ˆ v λ 2 x t a 1 w ˆ diag ϕ v ˆ x hin i ϕ v ˆ x hin t x hin t m 2 x v ˆ next the convergence of the identification model will be verified using lyapunov stability theory according to eqs 4 and 6 the dynamics of identification error can be written as follows 16 x a x w ϕ v ˆ x hin ϖ where ϖ w ϕ v x hin w ϕ v ˆ x hin ε x u because of the optimal weight w optimal approximation error ε x u and sigmoid function ϕ vx hin are bounded an unknown constant δ can be represented as follows 17 ϖ w ϕ v x hin w ϕ v ˆ x hin ε x u δ we selected the following lyapunov function 18 l 1 1 2 x t p x 1 2 tr w t m 1 1 w differentiating eq 18 with respect to the identification error and substituting eq 14 we get 19 l 1 1 2 x t q x x t p w ϕ v ˆ x hin ϖ tr w t m 1 1 λ 1 x t a 1 t ϕ v ˆ x hin t w t x w ˆ because the following inequality holds 20 tr w t w ˆ tr w t w w 1 2 w 2 1 2 w m 2 then 21 l 1 x 1 2 λ min q x p w m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 w 1 2 w 2 p δ 1 2 w m 2 x 1 2 λ min q x 1 2 w p m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 2 1 2 p m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 2 p δ 1 2 w m 2 where λ min q is the minimum eigenvalue of q according to eq 21 l 1 is negative when following conditions are satisfied 22 x x max p m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 2 2 p δ w m 2 λ min q 23 w w max p m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 2 2 p δ w m 2 p m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 from eqs 22 and 23 we can infer that if the norms of estimation error x and weight error w are larger than x max and w max respectively then l 1 is negative that is estimation and weight errors are reduced and thus both estimation and weight errors are bounded furthermore the convergence of the weight error v is analyzed consider the following lyapunov function 24 l 2 1 2 tr v t m 2 1 v differentiating eq 24 and substituting eq 15 to it we get 25 l 2 tr v t m 2 1 λ 2 x t a 1 w ˆ diag ϕ v ˆ x hin i ϕ v ˆ x hin t x hin t v t x v ˆ x m 2 1 λ 2 a 1 w ˆ x hin v tr v t x v ˆ because the following inequality holds 26 tr v t v ˆ tr v t v v 1 2 v 2 1 2 v m 2 then 27 l 2 x 1 2 v m 2 1 λ 2 a 1 w ˆ x hin 2 1 2 m 2 1 λ 2 a 1 w ˆ x hin 2 1 2 v m 2 because the estimation weight w ˆ and weight errors w are both bounded l 2 is negative when the following conditions are satisfied 28 v v max m 2 1 λ 2 a 1 w ˆ x hin 2 v m 2 m 2 1 λ 2 a 1 w ˆ x hin when the norm of weight error v is larger than v max then l 2 is negative and v decreases thus the weight error v is also bounded the aforementioned results indicated that both estimation and weight errors are bounded however error values are concerning in particular the estimation error which reflected the accuracy of model identification the smaller is the estimation error the higher is the accuracy of model identification in eq 22 both δ and w m are unknown however their values are determined for a deterministic neural network structure therefore the upper bound of the estimation error is mainly related to a p and q the computation problem faced when solving eq 22 to obtain suitable values to meet the minimum estimation error is equivalent to the following nonlinear constraint optimization problem 29 min f a p q p m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 2 2 p λ min q s t a t p p a q a 0 p 0 q 0 by solving the optimization problem in eq 29 the values of a p and q can be obtained 4 observer based fault detection this section presents fault detection based on the identification model using the identification model the sliding mode observer presented in eq 30 is constructed for state estimation 30 x ˆ a x ˆ w ˆ ϕ v ˆ x hin k sgn x the state estimation error is defined as x x x ˆ then 31 x a x w ϕ v ˆ x hin w ϕ v x hin w ϕ v ˆ x hin ε x u f k sgn x where k is a positive definite diagonal matrix considering the following lyapunov function 32 l 3 1 2 x t p x differentiating 32 and substituting 31 to it we get 33 l 3 x t q x x t p w ϕ v ˆ x hin w ϕ v x hin w ϕ v ˆ x hin ε x u f k sgn x x t q x x p w ϕ m w m v ε 0 f k because weight errors are bounded a suitable value for k can be obtained such that l 3 0 a sliding motion is established and the estimation error is asymptotically convergent during the sliding motion x 0 and x 0 therefore 31 can be written as 34 k sgn x w ϕ v ˆ x hin w ϕ v x hin w ϕ v ˆ x hin ε x u f applying the equivalent output injection concept the real fault signal f can be represented as 35 f k x x δ w ϕ v ˆ x hin w ϕ v x hin w ϕ v ˆ x hin ε x u where δ is a positive scalar vector because all w w and ε x u are unknown the real fault signal is incalculable the fault signal f is reconstructed as 36 f r k x x δ the reconstructed fault signal deviated from the real fault signal even for no fault the reconstructed fault signal may not be zero therefore similar to most analytical models threshold must be introduced in fault detection the thruster fault depends on whether the reconstructed fault signal exceeds the threshold to improve the accuracy of detection e presented in eq 37 must have the smallest value possible so that a smaller threshold can be selected 37 e w ϕ v ˆ x hin w ϕ v x hin w ϕ v ˆ x hin ε x u w w m v ε 0 from the nonlinear mapping ability of neural networks a considerably small optimal approximation error can be obtained by selecting a reasonable network structure therefore ignoring the optimal approximation error and substituting eq 23 into eq 28 we get 38 e e max p m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 2 2 p δ w m 2 p m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 w m m 2 1 λ 2 a 1 w ˆ x hin 2 v m 2 w m m 2 1 λ 2 a 1 w ˆ x hin when the optimization problem presented in eq 29 is solved e max can be determined therefore for establishing the optimization model we must consider eq 38 and construct the new optimization model as 39 min f a p q p m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 2 2 p λ min q p m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 2 2 p p 3 m 1 1 λ 1 a 1 s t a t p p a q a 0 p 0 q 0 because the solution of optimization problem is offline evaluating the solving speed is not necessary most optimization methods can be used to obtain the most favorable matrix values of a p and q 5 experimental results in order to illustrate the validity of the proposed model identification method and fault detection method the experimental are carried out for the right thruster of the stern of jiaolong hov it should be noted that although the experiment is based on historical data offline the data taken are real and the same therefore the proposed scheme can be transplanted to jiaolong hov for online detection 5 1 model identification results to verify the effectiveness of model identification the data of thruster without fault are used based on the nonlinear constraint optimization model 39 a matlab genetic algorithm toolbox is used to calculate the value of matrix a to improve the optimization speed a is considered as a diagonal matrix once the value of a is calculated it will not change in the subsequence model identification and fault detection however a values obtained from multiple optimizations are different and different a values have influence on the accuracy of model and fault reconstruction therefore we selected a solution with smallest f a p q after multiple optimizations and the a value is selected as a 2 6 0 0 1 0 in the updating rules presented in eqs 14 and 15 parameters are selected as λ 1 0 1 λ 2 0 001 and m 1 m 2 0 01 the numbers of hidden and recurrent layer neurons are 32 and 16 respectively initial weight values are randomly selected from 1 to 1 after model identification 600 control steps of data are used for validation low pass filtering are used for data processing because of the large noise present in the raw data figs 3 and 4 present the validation results of the identification model the mean square deviations of current and speed estimation errors are 1 14 a and 80 55 rpm respectively figs 3 and 4 the estimation results revealed that the identification model is convergent and bounded indicating that the proposed identification method is effective 5 2 fault detection results to verify the effectiveness of the fault detection method the proposed sliding mode observer is used for verification k 8 0 0 1 δ 40 40 because of the error of the identification model the aforementioned normal data is used to select thresholds for fault detection fig 5 presents the estimation fault values obtained by the proposed observer fig 5 indicates that although the thruster is not faulty the fault estimation values do not converge to zero the fault estimation average values are 0 007 a and 0 024 rpm respectively due to the average values are both close to zero if the low pass filters are used the amplitude and oscillation of the estimation values will be significantly reduced however considering that some information may be lost and the fault detection cannot be carried out quickly the threshold selection is directly based on the unprocessed data fig 5 according to the data without fault 1 is the selected threshold for both f 1 and f 2 subsequently the thruster data of the jiaolong hov with fault are used to verify fault detection fig 6 presents the original thruster data including coil current motor speed and control signal fig 6 reveals that after the 440th control step a feedback of motor speed seems normal when the control signal is provided but the coil current is close to zero after the hov was recovered the propeller of thruster was found to be lost that is no load was applied to the motor for the thruster data with fault the fault is detected using the proposed observer presented in eq 30 figs 7 and 8 present the state estimation results of the observer and fig 9 presents the fault estimation results the state estimation errors are convergent and bounded figs 7 and 8 the fault estimation values are not converged to zero because of the errors of model identification fig 9 after the 440th control step the estimation value of f 1 substantially increased when 1 was considered as the threshold it can be judged that the thruster has a fault and the fault occurred at the output end that is magnetic coupling or the propeller is faulty this is in line with the actual fault from the fault model 3 the fault estimation value f 1 is related to the control signal due to the control signal from 528 step to 546 step is zero it can be assumed that the motor is not working and the fault estimated value is zero this is in line with the actual situation the detection results revealed the effectiveness of the proposed method 6 conclusion in this paper a fault detection method based on the sliding mode observer with a neural network model was proposed for magnetic coupling underwater thrusters the parameter selection algorithm of model parameters was obtained by constructing the nonlinear constrained optimization problem the application results of the jiaolong hov indicated that the state space equation based on local recurrent neural networks can be used to describe a dynamic system of underwater thrusters in the case of the fault mode of propeller lost the fault can be detected using the sliding mode observer the experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed model identification and fault detection methods these can be implemented in the existing uuvs as an independent fault detection module for each thruster which can effectively improve uuvs reliability credit authorship contribution statement zhenzhong chu conceptualization methodology

21751,this study aims at modelling the suction bucket foundation in clay from full finite element analyses to simplified macro element to ensure the reliability of finite element simulation results as much as possible two well known constitutive models the modified cam clay model mcc and the hardening soil model hs are adopted respectively for the foundation soil which is normally consolidated clay with parameters directly determined from laboratory tests instead of inverse analysis or fitting using simple models in previous studies the finite element analyses using both models are validated by comparing centrifugal tests and further extended to study the failure patterns in v h m vertical force horizontal force moment space through radial displacement tests based on all results two new alternative analytical formulations based on both models are then proposed to describe the three dimensional 3d failure envelope in v h m space finally two new alternative macro element design models of suction bucket foundation in clay under the same framework of hypoplasticity for both monotonic and cyclic loading conditions are proposed by comparing with experimental results the effectiveness and efficiency of both macro element models are verified applicable and the one based on hs has slightly better performance than the one of mcc keywords suction bucket foundation failure envelope clay finite element method cyclic loading macro element 1 introduction a suction bucket is a closed top steel tube that is lowered to the ocean floor allowing sediments to seep in under their own weight water is then pulled out of its interior to produce a suction force that pushes it to full depth the main advantages of a suction bucket foundation are its adaptability to various seabed depths ease of installation reusability and ability to mobilise tremendous passive suction during uplift zhang et al 2013 suction bucket foundations often need to bear long term loads vertical force horizontal force and bending moment can be transferred to the bucket foundation under the upper building which is defined as the combined loading mode to optimise their design however it is necessary to understand the performance of the suction bucket foundation a great deal of experimental investigation has addressed the response of foundations under general monotonic cyclic combined loads which can be classified as 1 prototype and reduced scale field tests e g tjelta 1994 houlsby et al 2005 barari and ibsen 2011 2012 zhang et al 2015 2 scaled 1 g model test e g kelly et al 2006 villalobos et al

et al 1995 watson and randolph 1997 cassidy et al 2006 lu et al 2007 zhang et al 2007 kim et al 2014 note that this study focuses primarily on suction bucket foundations in clay experimental studies are valuable and provide basis for the design but it is time consuming and costly to study failure envelope and the characteristics of bearing capacity using a model test greater time savings and economies can be had using the finite element method fem many researchers have numerically studied the behaviour of a suction bucket foundation in clay including the characteristics of vertical bearing capacity under installation gerolymos et al 2015 harireche et al 2013 kourkoulis et al 2014 muduli et al 2013 samui et al 2011 zhou and randolph 2006 and bearing capacity behaviours under general loads cheng et al 2016 gourvenec and randolph 2003 randolph and house 2002 skau et al 2018 vásquez et al 2010 zdravkovic et al 1998 zdravković et al 2001 a variety of constitutive models are used to study the response of suction bucket foundations under combined loads however many studies used typical profile of soil strength or inverse calculation methods of empirical equation to calibrate the model parameters zhang et al 2020 since the reliability of numerical simulation largely depends on whether the results of fem can correctly regenerate the nonlinear response of soil soil parameters directly from conventional laboratory tests representing nonlinear soil behaviour instead of only indirectly from site investigation or inverse analysis should be recommended as tried in this study fem allows applications using complex constitutive laws 3d meshes and combined loads however these incur huge costs of data storage capacity and computer memory requiring the use of high performance computing machines and large amounts of time zhang et al 2019 in addition professional engineers must first become comfortable using the model accordingly a new method called the macro element method is proposed which is a generalised 2d or 3d force resultant model this method centralises the behaviour of the foundation and soil system to a point for example a hyperplastic model was adopted and used on suction bucket foundations by nguyen sy and houlsby 2005 similarly di prisco et al 2003a 2003b 2006 and foglia et al 2015 conducted a series of laboratory tests on suction bucket foundations in sand under monotonic and cyclic loads interpreting the results of the tests with the macro element method using the existing analysis model of villalobos et al 2009 with appropriate modifications to accommodate cyclic loading of the foundation and applications skau et al 2018 analysed the characteristic behaviour of suction bucket foundations under irregular cyclic loads using a multi surface plasticity framework most recently jin et al 2019a b c proposed a hypoplastic macro element model for suction bucket foundation in sand under drained condition with good performance and easy implementation it thus would be nice to follow this framework to propose a simple design tool for suction bucket foundation in clay therefore in this paper the failure patterns of suction bucket foundation in clay are first studied by fem simulations the numerical analyses are verified using centrifugal tests of suction bucket foundation in a normally consolidated kaolin clay followed by selecting a more representative loading combinations to reproduce the failure patterns under undrained condition the modified cam clay model mcc and hardening soil model hs are adopted for clay respectively to ensure the reliability of simulation results as much as possible as a basis two alternative failure envelops based on mcc and hs in v h m space are proposed and compared then two novel alternative macro element models are developed under the same framework of hypoplasticity using the two proposed failure envelops respectively through two monotonic and two cyclic model tests the predictive ability of two hypoplastic macro element models is evaluated and compared 2 numerical simulation in this section the numerical modelling of suction bucket foundation in clay is introduced simulations using a commercial finite element code plaxis 3d are first validated using centrifuge tests of a suction bucket foundation of watson 1999 2 1 adopted experimental campaign a series of laboratory tests of a suction bucket foundation in a normally consolidated kaolin clay are well documented including centrifuge tests and application of monotonic loadings selected hereafter watson 1999 the centrifuge at the university of western australia has a sample dimensions of 390 mm 650 mm 325 mm high which at 200 g represents a sample bed up to 78 m 130 m 65 m the suction bucket is based on a steel structure having a diameter of 50 mm 150 mm long with a skirt thickness of 1 mm the suction bucket foundation was used to perform one undrained bearing capacity test and two sideswipe tests 2 2 finite element model the numerical model of the suction bucket foundation was modelled according to the size and shape of the foundation in prototype scale 78 m 130 m 65 m plane strain condition was assumed in finite element analysis utilising axial symmetry shown in fig 1 the horizontal displacements are constrained on the lateral sides both vertical and horizontal displacements are constrained on the bottom the finite element mesh was constituted of 19664 10 noded tetrahedron elements resulting in 30098 nodes mesh sensitivity studies were done to ensure that the mesh was dense enough to produce accurate results according to watson 1999 the values of parameters of mcc model for the normally consolidated kaolin clay are listed in table 1 note that a typical value of poisson s ratio for clays ν 0 3 was given for simulations since no value was not provided by watson 1999 for hs model the parameters were equivalently determined using the equations by schanz et al 1999 power

unloading reloading modulus e u r r e f p r e f κ 15133 3 kn m 2 with κ κ 1 e 0 the model for the suction bucket is built using plaxis 3d shown in fig 1 the aspect ratio l d ratio is equal to 0 5 with d 7 5 m the bucket foundation is composed of two rigid body elements the bucket lid and the skirt with a reference point for both at the symmetry line centre of the foundation after the bucket foundation model is constructed the boundary conditions of this structure were applied as summarised in table 2 for the translation and rotation conditions defined in plaxis the interfaces of the skirt and the lid of suction bucket are created to allow proper modelling of the interaction between soil and structure the interface is set to the rigid coulomb friction model for the entire simulation with a friction angle of 10 7 1 2 φ c half of critical friction angle of the soil the initial stress state of the foundation soil was generated according to the gravity of saturated unit weight of the kaolin clay γ sat 16 5 kn m3 the coefficient of earth pressure at rest is set as k n c 0 1 sin φ c 0 64 according to jacky s formula the installation of suction bucket into foundation soil is ignored since this effects very locally the soils surrounding the bucket and thus gives very slight influence according to jin et al 2019a b c furthermore since the kaolin clay has very low permeability all simulations were carried out under full undrained condition 2 3 validation against centrifuge tests three centrifuge tests of watson 1999 presented in table 3 were simulated the sideswipe tests are subjected to a constant vertical load v 0 and v v respectively both tests are subjected to horizontal displacement at the loading reference point of the suction bucket fig 2 shows the result of k1 1 pure penetration test test which applied z vertical displacement versus v vertical force to compare the results obtained from the numerical simulations by using the mcc and hs respectively the simulation result of the mcc model is slightly closer to the experimental result than that of the hs model fig 3 shows comparisons of experimental and simulated results for k1 2 and k1 3 both results by the mcc model and hs model agree with experimental results with almost the same performance although there are discrepancies between experimental and numerical results all simulation results for different paths together should be acceptable 3 numerical investigation of the failure envelope in the h m v space 3 1 failure envelope in the h m plane gottardi et al 1999 presented two displacement control paths to determine the failure envelope of the suction bucket foundation 1 swipe tests firstly a certain level of vertical load is applied to the foundation after which a large horizontal displacement maximum load principle is applied to obtain h r horizontal resistance under this constant vertical load 2 radial displacement tests the increment or decrement of the ratio between the horizontal displacement and rotation displacement remains unchanged in this study the radial displacement control method is used as the main method the symbols of loads v h m are applied on the lrp loading reference point of the suction bucket foundation as shown in fig 4 the outer diameter d and skirt length l of the model are 7 5 m and 3 75 m respectively the purpose of this research is to evaluate the bearing capacity of this suction bucket foundation without discretisation of possible upper buildings the mass of typical offshore wind turbine is around 600 tons which is relatively light vertical deadload 6 mn as a result the design of the horizontal and rotational bearing capacities is critical to study the failure surface form in the h m plane a constant radial loading ratio is determined and the different displacements applied on the lrp of the suction bucket foundation as shown in fig 5 a certain vertical load was applied to a designated value χ v i v 0 v 0 is maximum vertical load and the radial displacement tests are then conducted the displacement should be large enough to ensure that maximum capacity is reached χ 0 means that only the self weight of suction bucket is considered fig 6 shows the selection method for determining the bearing capacity the ends of the loading paths up to failure of the foundation determine the ultimate bearing capacity and the lines before the ends represent loading paths with different ratios between the horizontal displacement and rotation angle i e dash line for higher rotation and solid line for higher displacement examples of the h m plane obtained by numerical radial displacement test simulation are presented in fig 7 the increment or decrement of the ratio between the horizontal displacement u and rotation displacement θ is constant δ θ δ u constant the failure envelope is obtained by the superposition of various failure points as presented in fig 7 a and for different vertical load levels as shown in fig 7 b from fig 7 some results of the failure surface can be summarised as follows 1 the bending moment has a noticeable impact on the horizontal bearing capacity that depends on the loading direction 2 the shape of the failure envelope of a suction bucket foundation in clay is the inclined ellipse 3 with an increase in the pre loaded vertical load the size of the failure envelope decreases 3 2 impact of vertical loads on the h m failure envelope the bearing capacity in the h m plane of the suction bucket foundations changed remarkably under different values of vertical loading to quantify this impact a procedure similar with section 3 1 is used hereafter specifically numerical simulation of radial displacement tests under different vertical loads are conducted the failure envelopes under different vertical loads are presented in fig 7 b fig 7 a also show the field case χ 0 overall the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the impact on the inclination degree of failure envelope under different vertical loads can be ignored 2 the size of the failure envelope decreases with a rise in the value of the vertical load 3 3 impact of vertical loads on the h v failure envelope several numerical swipe tests under different levels of vertical load are carried out to determine the failure envelope of the h v plane a series of constant vertical loads are applied on the lrp of the suction bucket foundation and the maximum load principle see section 3 1 is again used to obtain the failure locus see fig 6 then the failure envelope in the h v plane is obtained and found to be similar to the experimental diagrams from meyerhof 1953 hansen 1970 randolph and house 2002 gourvenec and randolph 2003 cassidy et al 2004 dnv 2013 and ibsen et al 2014 because of the high nonlinearity the failure point forms an unsmooth curve it can be concluded that there is a strong interaction between vertical load and horizontal load the diagram of vertical bearing capacity and horizontal bearing capacity approximates a quarter ellipse as shown in fig 8 a and b the peak value is at v 0 this agrees with fig 7 b on the h m plane combining the results in the h m plane under different levels of vertical load fig 7 and the h v plane fig 8 a and b the h m v 3d space envelope is plotted in fig 9 a and b based on simulations using mcc and hs respectively the size of the inclined ellipse is controlled by vertical load 4 analytical formulas for the failure envelope 4 1 analytical formula for the failure envelope based on hs model according to the previous section the failure envelope of the suction bucket foundation is like an inclined ellipse in the h m plane the failure surface of the suction bucket foundation can be reproduced by the formula introduced by villalobos et al 2009 1 y h h i v 0 2 m d m i v 0 2 2 e h h i v 0 m d m i v 0 1 0 in this equation the parameters h i m i and e are used to determine the shape of the failure surface the two variables h i and m i are used to describe respectively the intersection of the failure envelope and the axis of h v 0 and m dv 0 the eccentricity of the ellipse is expressed as e the yield points obtained can be fitted by this formula fig 10 shows how h i and m i changed with the value of v it can be seen that the relation curves are similar to a quarter circle and a quarter ellipse which is different from the proposed formulas to obtain a more accurate result the formulas of h i and m i are changed to the corresponding fitting formulas 2 h h 0 v v 0 3 6 1 3 m d m 0 d v v 0 2 5 1 4 h i h i v 0 h 0 1 v v

respectively which indicates that eq 8 is more suitable for reproducing the 3d failure surface of the suction bucket foundation 4 2 alternative analytical formula for the failure envelope based on mcc model fig 12 shows how h i and m i changed with the value of v it can be seen that the relation curves are similar to a quarter circle and a quarter ellipse which is different from the proposed formulas to obtain a more accurate result the formulas of h i and m i are changed to the corresponding fitting formulas 11 h h 0 25 9 v v 0 3 1 12 m d m 0 d 10 9 v v 0 3 1 13 h i h i v 0 h 0 1 v v 0 3

3d failure surface for the suction bucket foundation in clay are plotted in fig 13 the correlation coefficient r 2 is estimated as 0 979 which indicates that eq 15 is suitable for reproducing the 3d failure surface of the suction bucket foundation 4 3 effect of l d ratio the failure of caisson foundation for different l d ratio should be different for which an additional case of l 7 5 m and d 3 75 m l d 2 was simulated only using hs model through radial displacement tests simulations failure envelop in h m plane at a χ 0 b different vertical load levels fig 14 in h v plane fig 15 and the three dimensional failure surface in h m v space fig 16 were obtained it can be found the l d ratio significantly affects the size and the inclination of the failure envelop to examine the applicability of the failure surface formulation the three dimensional failure surface was fitted using the equation 9 as shown in fig 16 good agreement was achieved which demonstrates that the failure surface formulation is applicable for different l d ratios thus the macro element model based on above failure surface formulation should also be applicable for caisson foundations with different l d ratios 5 hypoplastic macro element modelling 5 1 general framework li et al 2016 introduced the hypoplasticity macro element for deep foundations which can be seen as the starting point establishing use of a hypoplastic macro element for foundations other than footings since then jin et al 2019a b c have developed the macro element method for the caisson in sand under monotonic and cyclic loadings the overall process is described hereafter using the following conventions tensors in bold letters norm of a tensor written as and the derivative of the variables with time represented by the generalised load vector t and displacement vector u are used to represent the mechanical response of suction bucket foundation 16 t v h m d t 17 u w u d θ t where v h and m d are the vertical horizontal and generalised rotational force applied to the suction bucket and w u and dθ are the vertical horizontal and rotational displacements respectively d is the diameter of the bucket foundation for homogenising the dimensions of the t and u components the vector d is defined as generalised velocity which can be expressed as 18 d u the macro element formulas of hypoplasticity under monotonic loading conditions are expressed as 19a t k t q d 19b k l t q n t q η t 19c η d d where q is the internal variable pseudo vector that accounts for the impacts of the previous loading history the difference between tangent stiffness k t q d and classical elastic plastic tangent stiffness is that k is changing the generalised velocity direction η a property that is incremental and nonlinear moreover k t q d has both a linear term l and a nonlinear term n l describes the initial linear constitutive relationship of the macro element and also represents the stiffness at a load reversal point as the stress state changes n will modify the linear behaviour continuously to investigate the cyclic loadings a definition of the internal displacement δ proposed by niemunis and herle 1997 and salciarini and tamagnini 2009 is adopted the formulations of the macro element are thus modified as follows 20 t k t q δ d 21 k ρ χ m t 1 ρ χ m r l ρ χ 1 m t l η δ η δ t ρ χ ν η δ t η δ η 0 ρ χ m r m t l η δ η δ t η δ η 0 the derivative of δ internal displacement is expressed as 22 δ i ρ β r η δ η δ t d η δ η 0 d η δ η 0 the value of scalar ρ is 0 1 which can be obtained by the norm of δ ρ δ r m t m r χ β r and r are five constants i is the identity matrix and 23 η δ δ δ δ 0 0 δ 0 it can be seen that to reproduce cyclic loadings of the suction bucket foundation the linear and nonlinear constitutive relationships of the macro element are modified by comparing eqs 19 21 the matrix l is expressed as 24 l 1 m r k e 25 k e k v v 0 0 0 k h h k h m 0 k h m k m m where k e is the elastic stiffness matrix and k represents the different dimensional stiffness of the bucket and soil system which was similar to that of pile foundations li et al 2016 2018 because of the skirt of the suction bucket foundation k hm must be taken into account n is defined as 26 n t y t l m t y t is a scalar function that controls the nonlinearity degree and m t is the unit gradient describing the direction of plastic flow to define y and m in eq 26 the ultimate failure surface f t and the loading surface f t are needed to be adopted 5 2 novel macro element models in this section in seeking to establish f t for a suction bucket foundation in clay we use numerical calculation and simulation to find the 3d failure surface we now review the details of the research discussed in previous sections different loading paths were selected to study the shape and size of the failure surface in the h m plane and as fig 5 shows a constant radial loading ratio was determined and the large displacements applied on the lrp of the suction bucket foundation to reach the ultimate strength under a constant vertical load the end points of the loading paths are defined as the failure loci points see fig 6 villalobos et al 2009 introduced a mathematical equation for reproducing the failure envelope in the h m d plane eq 1 in this equation the parameters h i m i and e are used to determine the shape of the failure surface the two variables h i and m i are used to describe the intersection of the failure envelope and the axis of h v 0 and m dv 0 respectively the eccentricity of the ellipse is expressed as e using least squares regression the yield points obtained in previous sections can be fitted by eq 1 villalobos et al 2009 shown in fig 17 figs 10 a and figure 12 show how h i and m i changed with the value of v v 0 it can be seen the relation curves are similar with a quarter circle and a quarter ellipse eqs 2 and 3 provide the fitting functions of hs model eqs 11 and 12 provide the fitting functions of mcc model the fitting equations of hs model are shown in eqs 2 5 also fitting equations of mcc model are shown in eqs 11 14 v 0 has been determined by applying the k1 1 test h 0 and m 0 are defined as the maximum h i and m i respectively found at v v 0 0 note that eqs 4 5 13 and 14 can be adopted at the different levels of v all the parameters of macro element are shown in table 5 half of the inclined parabolic ellipsoid of hs model failure envelop in the h v m plane see fig 11 a is expressed in eq 8 the failure surface in the h v m plane of mcc model fig 13 is expressed in eq 15 as for the hypoplasticity framework f t is the boundary of the stress state for a suction bucket foundation in clay that functions as a bounding surface plasticity will develop with the bounding surface reaching the full plastic state when the stress state of the foundation reaches the boundary surface in this case the current stress state can be considered to be lying on a smaller bounding surface which is defined as loading surface f t see fig 18 with the development of plasticity the size of the loading surface could enlarge as isotropic as the bounding surface y t is used to define the nonlinearity degree as 27 y t ξ κ the value of ξ is 0 1 and it measures the distance between f t and f t κ is a material constant which can control the loading function evolution geometrically as seen in fig 18 the loading surface f t has the same shape as f t but smaller so the associated formulas can be described as 28 f 1 v ξ v 0 2 5 2 h ξ h 0 v 0 2 2 e 1 v ξ v 0 2 5 1 v ξ v 0 3 6 h h 0 ξ v 0 m d m 0 ξ v 0 1 v ξ v 0 3 6 2 m d m 0 ξ v 0 2 1 v ξ v 0 2 5 2 1 v ξ v 0 3 6 2 0 by hs or 29 f 1 v ξ v 0 3 1 08 h ξ h 0 v 0 2 2 e 1 v ξ v 0 3 0 54 h ξ h 0 v 0 m d ξ m 0 v 0 m d ξ m 0 v 0 2 1 v ξ v 0 3 1 8 0 by mcc by plugging the current stress state h m d v into eq 28 or 29 we can obtain the root value of ξ 0 1 in this nonlinear function it can be calculated numerically by bisection or newton raphson method m t is the direction of normalised plastic flow taken as the normalised gradient of the f t at the current stress state fig 18 according to the associative plastic flow rule m t is given by 30 m t f t f t 5 3 parameters of macro element models and calibration the macro element parameters have been divided into four groups as shown in table 5 four parameters that determine the failure surface four pseudo elastic stiffness coefficients a hardening parameter used to control macro element stiffness decay under monotonic loadings and five parameters that control the behaviour of the foundation under cyclic loadings the hypoplastic macro elements for suction bucket foundations in clay are implemented in matlab experimental results are used to identify and validate these parameters using appropriate loading conditions and numerical simulation the pseudo elastic stiffness coefficients of macro elements can be determined as shown in fig 19 li et al 2016 for instance when the rotation remains unchanged a small horizontal displacement applied at lrp can obtain the value of k mh the results are shown in table 5 the k1 2 test was selected to calibrate the value of κ extra macro element simulations in the h u plane for other values of κ under the same loading condition are shown in fig 20 based on comparisons with experimental data κ 0 9 was chosen for the constant of the function of hs model and κ 0 6 was chosen for mcc model since there are no cyclic tests available in watson 1999 the field test at bothkennar and laboratory test under cyclic loadings by kelly et al 2006 were adopted to evaluate the predictive ability of the proposed macro elements since there are no tests under monotonic loading available we just adopted the parameters of the case of kaolin clay foundation as the cyclic loading states are inside of the yield envelope the parameters for cyclic behaviour have been calibrated by trial and error comparing the simulated and experimental in situ results of kelly et al 2006 more specifically the constants βr and f063 are less sensitive the size of the pseudo elastic region r can be inferred from the length of the pseudo linear part of the load displacement curve during unloading or reloading while the parameters m r and m t affect the stiffness ratio of the system under reverse or tangential loading and continuous loading conditions the calibrated values of the 5 parameters are summarised in table 5 the results of cyclic moment under small deformation moment loading m su 2r 3 0 25 from the field test at bothkennar and laboratory test are shown in fig 21 a and b which are used for parameters calibration the simulated results in fig 21 c and d well agree with the observed response of the system in the moment cyclic loading tests indicating a good descriptive performance of the macro element models note that all parameters can also be identified through the inverse analysis using optimisation or bayesian methods as shown by yin et al 2016 2017 2018 and jin et al 2016 2017 2018 2019a 2019b for advanced constitutive models of clay or sand 5 4 validation of models the swipe test k1 3 was adopted to validate the predicative performance of the macro element models that adopted the parameters of table 5 fig 22 shows that the calculation results are basically consistent by comparing results of the experiment and the macro elements under monotonic loading the results of cyclic moment under large deformation moment loading m su 2r 3 0 312 from the field test at bothkennar and laboratory test are shown in fig 23 a and b for predictions the comparison between experimental results and simulated results shown in fig 23 c and d demonstrates that both macro elements based on hs and mcc well describe the observed response of the system in the moment cyclic loading tests indicating a good predictive ability of the macro element models both macro elements are applicable and the one based on hs has slightly better performance than that of mcc furthermore by comparing the macro element results simulated by adopting hs and mcc models it can be found that even though the constitutive models and three dimensional failure surface selected are a little bit different the results are close at last in conclusion the behaviours of the complex loading pattern on the horizontal and rotational dimension are well regenerated by the macro elements the excellent comparison between the macro element predictions and the observed response in validation tests indicates that the proposed approach is capable of reproducing the foundation soil system behaviour with the same level of accuracy of advanced non linear three dimensional finite element simulations but with a dramatic reduction of the computational cost moreover the macro elements are robust without any convergence problem usually happened in finite element calculations 5 5 model validation by other tests in order to further evaluate the predictive ability of the proposed macro elements a series of swipe tests of caisson foundation with l 3 m and d 6 m in kaolin clay conducted by cassidy et al 2004 was adopted note that only the macro element model based on hs is used since the one based on mcc has similar predictive ability shown in previous sections four swipe tests were carried out by applying horizontal displacement under constant vertical forces without rotation and moment four different vertical forces bigger than the vertical bearing capacity v0 0 992 mn were applied for four swipe tests swipe 1 v0 1 268 mn swipe 2 v0 1 601 mn swipe 3 v0 1 919 mn and swipe 4 v0 2 352 mn for macro element parameters h 0 0 288 and m 0 0 073 were measured based on failure envelop of caisson foundations provided by cassidy et al 2004 then other parameters from the previous case table 5 were directly adopted since two cases of caisson foundation are quit similar the κ was found sensitive and thus re calibrated by using the swipe 2 as shown in fig 24 based on comparisons with experimental data κ 0 62 was determined the remaining three swipe tests were adopted hereafter to evaluate the predictive ability of the macro element fig 25 shows the comparison between the model test results and the macro element predictions a fairly good agreement is observed for all the swipe tests 6 conclusion through finite element analysis and development of new macro element models the mechanical response of a suction bucket foundation in clay was numerically investigated in this study the main conclusions and contributions are concluded as follows 1 using plaxis 3d the mcc and hs models were adopted to simulate the mechanical response of a suction bucket foundation in clay subjected to complex loading combinations based on a comparison of numerical results with experimental ones both mcc and hs models were validated and selected to study the 3d bearing capacity thenceforth then new analytical formulations for expressing the 3d failure envelope in the v h m space were proposed based on the results of numerical simulations 2 two novel macro element models based on mcc and hs respectively were proposed to reproduce the mechanical response of a suction bucket foundation in clay under the same framework of hypoplasticity it is shown that the macro elements are able to reproduce the nonlinear behaviour of the suction bucket foundation in clay under the monotonic and cyclic loadings by comparing the predicted results with experimental ones the computational cost and robustness when using the macro element is much lower and stronger than those for classical finite element analysis of the same problem making the macro element model valuable for foundation design in the field

21751,this study aims at modelling the suction bucket foundation in clay from full finite element analyses to simplified macro element to ensure the reliability of finite element simulation results as much as possible two well known constitutive models the modified cam clay model mcc and the hardening soil model hs are adopted respectively for the foundation soil which is normally consolidated clay with parameters directly determined from laboratory tests instead of inverse analysis or fitting using simple models in previous studies the finite element analyses using both models are validated by comparing centrifugal tests and further extended to study the failure patterns in v h m vertical force horizontal force moment space through radial displacement tests based on all results two new alternative analytical formulations based on both models are then proposed to describe the three dimensional 3d failure envelope in v h m space finally two new alternative macro element design models of suction bucket foundation in clay under the same framework of hypoplasticity for both monotonic and cyclic loading conditions are proposed by comparing with experimental results the effectiveness and efficiency of both macro element models are verified applicable and the one based on hs has slightly better performance than the one of mcc keywords suction bucket foundation failure envelope clay finite element method cyclic loading macro element 1 introduction a suction bucket is a closed top steel tube that is lowered to the ocean floor allowing sediments to seep in under their own weight water is then pulled out of its interior to produce a suction force that pushes it to full depth the main advantages of a suction bucket foundation are its adaptability to various seabed depths ease of installation reusability and ability to mobilise tremendous passive suction during uplift zhang et al 2013 suction bucket foundations often need to bear long term loads vertical force horizontal force and bending moment can be transferred to the bucket foundation under the upper building which is defined as the combined loading mode to optimise their design however it is necessary to understand the performance of the suction bucket foundation a great deal of experimental investigation has addressed the response of foundations under general monotonic cyclic combined loads which can be classified as 1 prototype and reduced scale field tests e g tjelta 1994 houlsby et al 2005 barari and ibsen 2011 2012 zhang et al 2015 2 scaled 1 g model test e g kelly et al 2006 villalobos et al

et al 1995 watson and randolph 1997 cassidy et al 2006 lu et al 2007 zhang et al 2007 kim et al 2014 note that this study focuses primarily on suction bucket foundations in clay experimental studies are valuable and provide basis for the design but it is time consuming and costly to study failure envelope and the characteristics of bearing capacity using a model test greater time savings and economies can be had using the finite element method fem many researchers have numerically studied the behaviour of a suction bucket foundation in clay including the characteristics of vertical bearing capacity under installation gerolymos et al 2015 harireche et al 2013 kourkoulis et al 2014 muduli et al 2013 samui et al 2011 zhou and randolph 2006 and bearing capacity behaviours under general loads cheng et al 2016 gourvenec and randolph 2003 randolph and house 2002 skau et al 2018 vásquez et al 2010 zdravkovic et al 1998 zdravković et al 2001 a variety of constitutive models are used to study the response of suction bucket foundations under combined loads however many studies used typical profile of soil strength or inverse calculation methods of empirical equation to calibrate the model parameters zhang et al 2020 since the reliability of numerical simulation largely depends on whether the results of fem can correctly regenerate the nonlinear response of soil soil parameters directly from conventional laboratory tests representing nonlinear soil behaviour instead of only indirectly from site investigation or inverse analysis should be recommended as tried in this study fem allows applications using complex constitutive laws 3d meshes and combined loads however these incur huge costs of data storage capacity and computer memory requiring the use of high performance computing machines and large amounts of time zhang et al 2019 in addition professional engineers must first become comfortable using the model accordingly a new method called the macro element method is proposed which is a generalised 2d or 3d force resultant model this method centralises the behaviour of the foundation and soil system to a point for example a hyperplastic model was adopted and used on suction bucket foundations by nguyen sy and houlsby 2005 similarly di prisco et al 2003a 2003b 2006 and foglia et al 2015 conducted a series of laboratory tests on suction bucket foundations in sand under monotonic and cyclic loads interpreting the results of the tests with the macro element method using the existing analysis model of villalobos et al 2009 with appropriate modifications to accommodate cyclic loading of the foundation and applications skau et al 2018 analysed the characteristic behaviour of suction bucket foundations under irregular cyclic loads using a multi surface plasticity framework most recently jin et al 2019a b c proposed a hypoplastic macro element model for suction bucket foundation in sand under drained condition with good performance and easy implementation it thus would be nice to follow this framework to propose a simple design tool for suction bucket foundation in clay therefore in this paper the failure patterns of suction bucket foundation in clay are first studied by fem simulations the numerical analyses are verified using centrifugal tests of suction bucket foundation in a normally consolidated kaolin clay followed by selecting a more representative loading combinations to reproduce the failure patterns under undrained condition the modified cam clay model mcc and hardening soil model hs are adopted for clay respectively to ensure the reliability of simulation results as much as possible as a basis two alternative failure envelops based on mcc and hs in v h m space are proposed and compared then two novel alternative macro element models are developed under the same framework of hypoplasticity using the two proposed failure envelops respectively through two monotonic and two cyclic model tests the predictive ability of two hypoplastic macro element models is evaluated and compared 2 numerical simulation in this section the numerical modelling of suction bucket foundation in clay is introduced simulations using a commercial finite element code plaxis 3d are first validated using centrifuge tests of a suction bucket foundation of watson 1999 2 1 adopted experimental campaign a series of laboratory tests of a suction bucket foundation in a normally consolidated kaolin clay are well documented including centrifuge tests and application of monotonic loadings selected hereafter watson 1999 the centrifuge at the university of western australia has a sample dimensions of 390 mm 650 mm 325 mm high which at 200 g represents a sample bed up to 78 m 130 m 65 m the suction bucket is based on a steel structure having a diameter of 50 mm 150 mm long with a skirt thickness of 1 mm the suction bucket foundation was used to perform one undrained bearing capacity test and two sideswipe tests 2 2 finite element model the numerical model of the suction bucket foundation was modelled according to the size and shape of the foundation in prototype scale 78 m 130 m 65 m plane strain condition was assumed in finite element analysis utilising axial symmetry shown in fig 1 the horizontal displacements are constrained on the lateral sides both vertical and horizontal displacements are constrained on the bottom the finite element mesh was constituted of 19664 10 noded tetrahedron elements resulting in 30098 nodes mesh sensitivity studies were done to ensure that the mesh was dense enough to produce accurate results according to watson 1999 the values of parameters of mcc model for the normally consolidated kaolin clay are listed in table 1 note that a typical value of poisson s ratio for clays ν 0 3 was given for simulations since no value was not provided by watson 1999 for hs model the parameters were equivalently determined using the equations by schanz et al 1999 power of stress dependency for clay m 1 reference oedometric modulus e o e d r e f p r e f λ 816 6 kn m 2 with λ λ 1 e 0 reference secant modulus e 50 r e f 1 25 e o e d r e f 1026 7 kn m 2 reference unloading reloading modulus e u r r e f p r e f κ 15133 3 kn m 2 with κ κ 1 e 0 the model for the suction bucket is built using plaxis 3d shown in fig 1 the aspect ratio l d ratio is equal to 0 5 with d 7 5 m the bucket foundation is composed of two rigid body elements the bucket lid and the skirt with a reference point for both at the symmetry line centre of the foundation after the bucket foundation model is constructed the boundary conditions of this structure were applied as summarised in table 2 for the translation and rotation conditions defined in plaxis the interfaces of the skirt and the lid of suction bucket are created to allow proper modelling of the interaction between soil and structure the interface is set to the rigid coulomb friction model for the entire simulation with a friction angle of 10 7 1 2 φ c half of critical friction angle of the soil the initial stress state of the foundation soil was generated according to the gravity of saturated unit weight of the kaolin clay γ sat 16 5 kn m3 the coefficient of earth pressure at rest is set as k n c 0 1 sin φ c 0 64 according to jacky s formula the installation of suction bucket into foundation soil is ignored since this effects very locally the soils surrounding the bucket and thus gives very slight influence according to jin et al 2019a b c furthermore since the kaolin clay has very low permeability all simulations were carried out under full undrained condition 2 3 validation against centrifuge tests three centrifuge tests of watson 1999 presented in table 3 were simulated the sideswipe tests are subjected to a constant vertical load v 0 and v v respectively both tests are subjected to horizontal displacement at the loading reference point of the suction bucket fig 2 shows the result of k1 1 pure penetration test test which applied z vertical displacement versus v vertical force to compare the results obtained from the numerical simulations by using the mcc and hs respectively the simulation result of the mcc model is slightly closer to the experimental result than that of the hs model fig 3 shows comparisons of experimental and simulated results for k1 2 and k1 3 both results by the mcc model and hs model agree with experimental results with almost the same performance although there are discrepancies between experimental and numerical results all simulation results for different paths together should be acceptable 3 numerical investigation of the failure envelope in the h m v space 3 1 failure envelope in the h m plane gottardi et al 1999 presented two displacement control paths to determine the failure envelope of the suction bucket foundation 1 swipe tests firstly a certain level of vertical load is applied to the foundation after which a large horizontal displacement maximum load principle is applied to obtain h r horizontal resistance under this constant vertical load 2 radial displacement tests the increment or decrement of the ratio between the horizontal displacement and rotation displacement remains unchanged in this study the radial displacement control method is used as the main method the symbols of loads v h m are applied on the lrp loading reference point of the suction bucket foundation as shown in fig 4 the outer diameter d and skirt length l of the model are 7 5 m and 3 75 m respectively the purpose of this research is to evaluate the bearing capacity of this suction bucket foundation without discretisation of possible upper buildings the mass of typical offshore wind turbine is around 600 tons which is relatively light vertical deadload 6 mn as a result the design of the horizontal and rotational bearing capacities is critical to study the failure surface form in the h m plane a constant radial loading ratio is determined and the different displacements applied on the lrp of the suction bucket foundation as shown in fig 5 a certain vertical load was applied to a designated value χ v i v 0 v 0 is maximum vertical load and the radial displacement tests are then conducted the displacement should be large enough to ensure that maximum capacity is reached χ 0 means that only the self weight of suction bucket is considered fig 6 shows the selection method for determining the bearing capacity the ends of the loading paths up to failure of the foundation determine the ultimate bearing capacity and the lines before the ends represent loading paths with different ratios between the horizontal displacement and rotation angle i e dash line for higher rotation and solid line for higher displacement examples of the h m plane obtained by numerical radial displacement test simulation are presented in fig 7 the increment or decrement of the ratio between the horizontal displacement u and rotation displacement θ is constant δ θ δ u constant the failure envelope is obtained by the superposition of various failure points as presented in fig 7 a and for different vertical load levels as shown in fig 7 b from fig 7 some results of the failure surface can be summarised as follows 1 the bending moment has a noticeable impact on the horizontal bearing capacity that depends on the loading direction 2 the shape of the failure envelope of a suction bucket foundation in clay is the inclined ellipse 3 with an increase in the pre loaded vertical load the size of the failure envelope decreases 3 2 impact of vertical loads on the h m failure envelope the bearing capacity in the h m plane of the suction bucket foundations changed remarkably under different values of vertical loading to quantify this impact a procedure similar with section 3 1 is used hereafter specifically numerical simulation of radial displacement tests under different vertical loads are conducted the failure envelopes under different vertical loads are presented in fig 7 b fig 7 a also show the field case χ 0 overall the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the impact on the inclination degree of failure envelope under different vertical loads can be ignored 2 the size of the failure envelope decreases with a rise in the value of the vertical load 3 3 impact of vertical loads on the h v failure envelope several numerical swipe tests under different levels of vertical load are carried out to determine the failure envelope of the h v plane a series of constant vertical loads are applied on the lrp of the suction bucket foundation and the maximum load principle see section 3 1 is again used to obtain the failure locus see fig 6 then the failure envelope in the h v plane is obtained and found to be similar to the experimental diagrams from meyerhof 1953 hansen 1970 randolph and house 2002 gourvenec and randolph 2003 cassidy et al 2004 dnv 2013 and ibsen et al 2014 because of the high nonlinearity the failure point forms an unsmooth curve it can be concluded that there is a strong interaction between vertical load and horizontal load the diagram of vertical bearing capacity and horizontal bearing capacity approximates a quarter ellipse as shown in fig 8 a and b the peak value is at v 0 this agrees with fig 7 b on the h m plane combining the results in the h m plane under different levels of vertical load fig 7 and the h v plane fig 8 a and b the h m v 3d space envelope is plotted in fig 9 a and b based on simulations using mcc and hs respectively the size of the inclined ellipse is controlled by vertical load 4 analytical formulas for the failure envelope 4 1 analytical formula for the failure envelope based on hs model according to the previous section the failure envelope of the suction bucket foundation is like an inclined ellipse in the h m plane the failure surface of the suction bucket foundation can be reproduced by the formula introduced by villalobos et al 2009 1 y h h i v 0 2 m d m i v 0 2 2 e h h i v 0 m d m i v 0 1 0 in this equation the parameters h i m i and e are used to determine the shape of the failure surface the two variables h i and m i are used to describe respectively the intersection of the failure envelope and the axis of h v 0 and m dv 0 the eccentricity of the ellipse is expressed as e the yield points obtained can be fitted by this formula fig 10 shows how h i and m i changed with the value of v it can be seen that the relation curves are similar to a quarter circle and a quarter ellipse which is different from the proposed formulas to obtain a more accurate result the formulas of h i and m i are changed to the corresponding fitting formulas 2 h h 0 v v 0 3 6 1 3 m d m 0 d v v 0 2 5 1 4 h i h i v 0 h 0 1 v v

shown in table 4 according to eqs 8 and 9 the 3d failure surface for the suction bucket foundation in clay are plotted in fig 11 the correlation coefficient r 2 is estimated as 0 982 and 0 873 respectively which indicates that eq 8 is more suitable for reproducing the 3d failure surface of the suction bucket foundation 4 2 alternative analytical formula for the failure envelope based on mcc model fig 12 shows how h i and m i changed with the value of v it can be seen that the relation curves are similar to a quarter circle and a quarter ellipse which is different from the proposed formulas to obtain a more accurate result the formulas of h i and m i are changed to the corresponding fitting formulas 11 h h 0 25 9 v v 0 3 1 12 m d m 0 d 10 9 v v 0 3 1 13 h i h i v 0 h 0 1 v v 0 3

2 2 e 1 v v 0 3 0 54 h h 0 v 0 m d m 0 v 0 m d m 0 v 0 2 15 1 v v 0 3 1 8 0 the parameters obtained by fitting the numerical results with the optimal curve are shown in table 4 according to eq 15 the 3d failure surface for the suction bucket foundation in clay are plotted in fig 13 the correlation coefficient r 2 is estimated as 0 979 which indicates that eq 15 is suitable for reproducing the 3d failure surface of the suction bucket foundation 4 3 effect of l d ratio the failure of caisson foundation for different l d ratio should be different for which an additional case of l 7 5 m and d 3 75 m l d 2 was simulated only using hs model through radial displacement tests simulations failure envelop in h m plane at a χ 0 b different vertical load levels fig 14 in h v plane fig 15 and the three dimensional failure surface in h m v space fig 16 were obtained it can be found the l d ratio significantly affects the size and the inclination of the failure envelop to examine the applicability of the failure surface formulation the three dimensional failure surface was fitted using the equation 9 as shown in fig 16 good agreement was achieved which demonstrates that the failure surface formulation is applicable for different l d ratios thus the macro element model based on above failure surface formulation should also be applicable for caisson foundations with different l d ratios 5 hypoplastic macro element modelling 5 1 general framework li et al 2016 introduced the hypoplasticity macro element for deep foundations which can be seen as the starting point establishing use of a hypoplastic macro element for foundations other than footings since then jin et al 2019a b c have developed the macro element method for the caisson in sand under monotonic and cyclic loadings the overall process is described hereafter using the following conventions tensors in bold letters norm of a tensor written as and the derivative of the variables with time represented by the generalised load vector t and displacement vector u are used to represent the mechanical response of suction bucket foundation 16 t v h m d t 17 u w u d θ t where v h and m d are the vertical horizontal and generalised rotational force applied to the suction bucket and w u and dθ are the vertical horizontal and rotational displacements respectively d is the diameter of the bucket foundation for homogenising the dimensions of the t and u components the vector d is defined as generalised velocity which can be expressed as 18 d u the macro element formulas of hypoplasticity under monotonic loading conditions are expressed as 19a t k t q d 19b k l t q n t q η t 19c η d d where q is the internal variable pseudo vector that accounts for the impacts of the previous loading history the difference between tangent stiffness k t q d and classical elastic plastic tangent stiffness is that k is changing the generalised velocity direction η a property that is incremental and nonlinear moreover k t q d has both a linear term l and a nonlinear term n l describes the initial linear constitutive relationship of the macro element and also represents the stiffness at a load reversal point as the stress state changes n will modify the linear behaviour continuously to investigate the cyclic loadings a definition of the internal displacement δ proposed by niemunis and herle 1997 and salciarini and tamagnini 2009 is adopted the formulations of the macro element are thus modified as follows 20 t k t q δ d 21 k ρ χ m t 1 ρ χ m r l ρ χ 1 m t l η δ η δ t ρ χ ν η δ t η δ η 0 ρ χ m r m t l η δ η δ t η δ η 0 the derivative of δ internal displacement is expressed as 22 δ i ρ β r η δ η δ t d η δ η 0 d η δ η 0 the value of scalar ρ is 0 1 which can be obtained by the norm of δ ρ δ r m t m r χ β r and r are five constants i is the identity matrix and 23 η δ δ δ δ 0 0 δ 0 it can be seen that to reproduce cyclic loadings of the suction bucket foundation the linear and nonlinear constitutive relationships of the macro element are modified by comparing eqs 19 21 the matrix l is expressed as 24 l 1 m r k e 25 k e k v v 0 0 0 k h h k h m 0 k h m k m m where k e is the elastic stiffness matrix and k represents the different dimensional stiffness of the bucket and soil system which was similar to that of pile foundations li et al 2016 2018 because of the skirt of the suction bucket foundation k hm must be taken into account n is defined as 26 n t y t l m t y t is a scalar function that controls the nonlinearity degree and m t is the unit gradient describing the direction of plastic flow to define y and m in eq 26 the ultimate failure surface f t and the loading surface f t are needed to be adopted 5 2 novel macro element models in this section in seeking to establish f t for a suction bucket foundation in clay we use numerical calculation and simulation to find the 3d failure surface we now review the details of the research discussed in previous sections different loading paths were selected to study the shape and size of the failure surface in the h m plane and as fig 5 shows a constant radial loading ratio was determined and the large displacements applied on the lrp of the suction bucket foundation to reach the ultimate strength under a constant vertical load the end points of the loading paths are defined as the failure loci points see fig 6 villalobos et al 2009 introduced a mathematical equation for reproducing the failure envelope in the h m d plane eq 1 in this equation the parameters h i m i and e are used to determine the shape of the failure surface the two variables h i and m i are used to describe the intersection of the failure envelope and the axis of h v 0 and m dv 0 respectively the eccentricity of the ellipse is expressed as e using least squares regression the yield points obtained in previous sections can be fitted by eq 1 villalobos et al 2009 shown in fig 17 figs 10 a and figure 12 show how h i and m i changed with the value of v v 0 it can be seen the relation curves are similar with a quarter circle and a quarter ellipse eqs 2 and 3 provide the fitting functions of hs model eqs 11 and 12 provide the fitting functions of mcc model the fitting equations of hs model are shown in eqs 2 5 also fitting equations of mcc model are shown in eqs 11 14 v 0 has been determined by applying the k1 1 test h 0 and m 0 are defined as the maximum h i and m i respectively found at v v 0 0 note that eqs 4 5 13 and 14 can be adopted at the different levels of v all the parameters of macro element are shown in table 5 half of the inclined parabolic ellipsoid of hs model failure envelop in the h v m plane see fig 11 a is expressed in eq 8 the failure surface in the h v m plane of mcc model fig 13 is expressed in eq 15 as for the hypoplasticity framework f t is the boundary of the stress state for a suction bucket foundation in clay that functions as a bounding surface plasticity will develop with the bounding surface reaching the full plastic state when the stress state of the foundation reaches the boundary surface in this case the current stress state can be considered to be lying on a smaller bounding surface which is defined as loading surface f t see fig 18 with the development of plasticity the size of the loading surface could enlarge as isotropic as the bounding surface y t is used to define the nonlinearity degree as 27 y t ξ κ the value of ξ is 0 1 and it measures the distance between f t and f t κ is a material constant which can control the loading function evolution geometrically as seen in fig 18 the loading surface f t has the same shape as f t but smaller so the associated formulas can be described as 28 f 1 v ξ v 0 2 5 2 h ξ h 0 v 0 2 2 e 1 v ξ v 0 2 5 1 v ξ v 0 3 6 h h 0 ξ v 0 m d m 0 ξ v 0 1 v ξ v 0 3 6 2 m d m 0 ξ v 0 2 1 v ξ v 0 2 5 2 1 v ξ v 0 3 6 2 0 by hs or 29 f 1 v ξ v 0 3 1 08 h ξ h 0 v 0 2 2 e 1 v ξ v 0 3 0 54 h ξ h 0 v 0 m d ξ m 0 v 0 m d ξ m 0 v 0 2 1 v ξ v 0 3 1 8 0 by mcc by plugging the current stress state h m d v into eq 28 or 29 we can obtain the root value of ξ 0 1 in this nonlinear function it can be calculated numerically by bisection or newton raphson method m t is the direction of normalised plastic flow taken as the normalised gradient of the f t at the current stress state fig 18 according to the associative plastic flow rule m t is given by 30 m t f t f t 5 3 parameters of macro element models and calibration the macro element parameters have been divided into four groups as shown in table 5 four parameters that determine the failure surface four pseudo elastic stiffness coefficients a hardening parameter used to control macro element stiffness decay under monotonic loadings and five parameters that control the behaviour of the foundation under cyclic loadings the hypoplastic macro elements for suction bucket foundations in clay are implemented in matlab experimental results are used to identify and validate these parameters using appropriate loading conditions and numerical simulation the pseudo elastic stiffness coefficients of macro elements can be determined as shown in fig 19 li et al 2016 for instance when the rotation remains unchanged a small horizontal displacement applied at lrp can obtain the value of k mh the results are shown in table 5 the k1 2 test was selected to calibrate the value of κ extra macro element simulations in the h u plane for other values of κ under the same loading condition are shown in fig 20 based on comparisons with experimental data κ 0 9 was chosen for the constant of the function of hs model and κ 0 6 was chosen for mcc model since there are no cyclic tests available in watson 1999 the field test at bothkennar and laboratory test under cyclic loadings by kelly et al 2006 were adopted to evaluate the predictive ability of the proposed macro elements since there are no tests under monotonic loading available we just adopted the parameters of the case of kaolin clay foundation as the cyclic loading states are inside of the yield envelope the parameters for cyclic behaviour have been calibrated by trial and error comparing the simulated and experimental in situ results of kelly et al 2006 more specifically the constants βr and f063 are less sensitive the size of the pseudo elastic region r can be inferred from the length of the pseudo linear part of the load displacement curve during unloading or reloading while the parameters m r and m t affect the stiffness ratio of the system under reverse or tangential loading and continuous loading conditions the calibrated values of the 5 parameters are summarised in table 5 the results of cyclic moment under small deformation moment loading m su 2r 3 0 25 from the field test at bothkennar and laboratory test are shown in fig 21 a and b which are used for parameters calibration the simulated results in fig 21 c and d well agree with the observed response of the system in the moment cyclic loading tests indicating a good descriptive performance of the macro element models note that all parameters can also be identified through the inverse analysis using optimisation or bayesian methods as shown by yin et al 2016 2017 2018 and jin et al 2016 2017 2018 2019a 2019b for advanced constitutive models of clay or sand 5 4 validation of models the swipe test k1 3 was adopted to validate the predicative performance of the macro element models that adopted the parameters of table 5 fig 22 shows that the calculation results are basically consistent by comparing results of the experiment and the macro elements under monotonic loading the results of cyclic moment under large deformation moment loading m su 2r 3 0 312 from the field test at bothkennar and laboratory test are shown in fig 23 a and b for predictions the comparison between experimental results and simulated results shown in fig 23 c and d demonstrates that both macro elements based on hs and mcc well describe the observed response of the system in the moment cyclic loading tests indicating a good predictive ability of the macro element models both macro elements are applicable and the one based on hs has slightly better performance than that of mcc furthermore by comparing the macro element results simulated by adopting hs and mcc models it can be found that even though the constitutive models and three dimensional failure surface selected are a little bit different the results are close at last in conclusion the behaviours of the complex loading pattern on the horizontal and rotational dimension are well regenerated by the macro elements the excellent comparison between the macro element predictions and the observed response in validation tests indicates that the proposed approach is capable of reproducing the foundation soil system behaviour with the same level of accuracy of advanced non linear three dimensional finite element simulations but with a dramatic reduction of the computational cost moreover the macro elements are robust without any convergence problem usually happened in finite element calculations 5 5 model validation by other tests in order to further evaluate the predictive ability of the proposed macro elements a series of swipe tests of caisson foundation with l 3 m and d 6 m in kaolin clay conducted by cassidy et al 2004 was adopted note that only the macro element model based on hs is used since the one based on mcc has similar predictive ability shown in previous sections four swipe tests were carried out by applying horizontal displacement under constant vertical forces without rotation and moment four different vertical forces bigger than the vertical bearing capacity v0 0 992 mn were applied for four swipe tests swipe 1 v0 1 268 mn swipe 2 v0 1 601 mn swipe 3 v0 1 919 mn and swipe 4 v0 2 352 mn for macro element parameters h 0 0 288 and m 0 0 073 were measured based on failure envelop of caisson foundations provided by cassidy et al 2004 then other parameters from the previous case table 5 were directly adopted since two cases of caisson foundation are quit similar the κ was found sensitive and thus re calibrated by using the swipe 2 as shown in fig 24 based on comparisons with experimental data κ 0 62 was determined the remaining three swipe tests were adopted hereafter to evaluate the predictive ability of the macro element fig 25 shows the comparison between the model test results and the macro element predictions a fairly good agreement is observed for all the swipe tests 6 conclusion through finite element analysis and development of new macro element models the mechanical response of a suction bucket foundation in clay was numerically investigated in this study the main conclusions and contributions are concluded as follows 1 using plaxis 3d the mcc and hs models were adopted to simulate the mechanical response of a suction bucket foundation in clay subjected to complex loading combinations based on a comparison of numerical results with experimental ones both mcc and hs models were validated and selected to study the 3d bearing capacity thenceforth then new analytical formulations for expressing the 3d failure envelope in the v h m space were proposed based on the results of numerical simulations 2 two novel macro element models based on mcc and hs respectively were proposed to reproduce the mechanical response of a suction bucket foundation in clay under the same framework of hypoplasticity it is shown that the macro elements are able to reproduce the nonlinear behaviour of the suction bucket foundation in clay under the monotonic and cyclic loadings by comparing the predicted results with experimental ones the computational cost and robustness when using the macro element is much lower and stronger than those for classical finite element analysis of the same problem making the macro element model valuable for foundation design in the field

21752,as a critical campaign in the offshore oil and gas engineering flexible riser replacements involve complex operations that need to be optimized and detailed to factor in trends in the industry since it allows engineers to interact with simulation tools in real time during the operation design phase virtual prototyping vp is an efficient method to obtain an optimal solution and improve operational procedures in terms of safety and effectiveness for risk based integrity management of flexible risers in this study a real time vp model is adopted to simulate the process of a water injection flexible riser pulled in from an installation vessel to a jacket platform which is one of the riser replacements tasks the results are validated against results based on a finite element analysis attention is paid to the configuration tension and maximum bending curvature along the flexible riser during the operation the innovative approach presented in this paper can provide guidance with respect to the operation limitations of a flexible pipe in practical engineering graphical abstract image 1 keywords flexible riser replacement operation virtual prototyping finite element method 1 introduction oil and gas will remain primary energy resources for many years to come pedersen 2015 flexible pipes have been vital to subsea developments worldwide and to norwegian oil and gas production facilities since 1986 leira et al 2015 as shown in fig 1 a flexible riser fr as a dynamic pipe application is applied in floating production systems mainly serving for a high pressure production gas lift and chemical water injection according to the norwegian petroleum safety authority 326 frs were in use on the norwegian continental shelf in 2013 however till 2013 more than 25 of frs had been replaced due to different failure mechanisms 4subsea 2013 a replacement of fr generally includes two reverse operations recovery and reinstallation during which specialized vessels operate in a close range to platforms both operations share a high risk of entanglement or spaghetti effect for the risers hung close to neighboring ones as shown in fig 1 in addition the probability of oil spills increases because replacement operations are typically performed without shutting down field production thus the relevant operations schedule should be carefully designed for fr integrity management based on analyses experiences and risk assessments to avoid initiations of failure modes such as annulus flood over bending etc however as seen in fig 1 the complex unbonded multi layered structure of frs not only contributes to the mechanical advantages but also makes testing with full scale physical prototypes highly costly and even unfeasible due to major developments in game engines and performance improvements in both accelerated hardware and real time compliant mathematical models up to date virtual prototyping vp technology can promote safer operation procedures through concept verification iterative engineering design crew training and communication between various teams in a flexible and efficient way which can be an optimal choice for riser operations optimization using advanced vp tools including ghosting based on real environmental models for wind waves and current allows the visualization of the predicted course of operations during contingency scenarios such as vessel drift off crane black out riser joint failure etc nevertheless there is always an issue about the tradeoff between model accuracy and computation efficiency in vp which makes the validation necessary to this end a finite element approach fea model is adopted for the verification purpose in this research since an fea is a widely accepted tool for the structural analysis of risers dynamic risers 2018 compared with vp a conventional fea simulation is limited in an offline environment and normally applies to the component analysis in a stress level the computation depending on the mesh strategy and the performance of processors may be tedious and tricky for the simulation of complex operation procedures which decreases the possibility of effective interactivity real time fea develops but normally has limited applications huang et al 2015 compared with the recovery of scrapped risers greater concern is needed for reinstallation of a new riser which imposes strict requirements on vessel station keeping capabilities and weather criteria fergestad and løtveit 2014 thus the case this paper addresses is an operation for an fr pulled from an installation vessel to a jacket platform this is the first phase of the reinstallation and in the beginning of this phase the vessel stays most closely to the platform the general process with 4 selected steps step i iv for pulling in a riser is shown in fig 2 the purpose of this research is to identify bottlenecks such as potential failure possibilities inconsistencies and inefficiencies in the procedures and then optimize the related operation this paper is extended from major et al 2019a an advanced vp framework for the riser operation is applied and the original contribution is integrating virtual reality real time and humans in the loop hitl into this framework to assess the vp results in terms of fidelity fea correspondingly provides a complete simulation for the consistent procedures attention is paid to the equilibrium positions maximum bend curvature and axial tension of the flexible riser during the operation 2 related works vp for engineering applications is increasingly developed in maritime industry li et al 2016 presented a vp framework including modeling simulation and control for ship maneuvering chu et al 2018 introduced the vp system for maritime crane design and operations major et al 2019b proposed a framework for the study on three positioning solutions of mobile offshore drilling units besides vp is often used with the conjunction of virtual reality and mathematical models for the purpose of training unskilled workers zhang et al 2017 described a mathematical model for virtual reality of a subsea production facilities installation to achieve the training goal yu et al 2017 presented a full mission simulator relying on a similar virtual reality however vp has rarely been applied on offshore flexible riser operations the validation in this paper is implemented for the results calculated by physics module in vp lee and roh 2018 detailed the requirements of physics engines for simulation of shipyard and offshore operations especially for coupled systems but the real time requirement is not fulfilled besides although vp framework for control design is already developed there is still a lack of the integration capability to interact with hitl and a real time virtual environment regarding riser operations analysis advances have mostly been achieved in the research of the structural integrity for the traditional local failure mechanism study a 3d finite element model with solid elements was presented in guedes mendonça and de arruda martins 2017 to investigate the effect of the launching procedure in flexible pipes installation collapse performances were experimentally and numerically investigated in caleyron et al 2017 to show the installation effect was positive fea turns out to be an effective method owen and qin 1986 fylling et al 1998 chai and varyani 2006 in riser global analysis and rod elements chen et al 2011 ruan et al 2017 or beam elements guo et al 2018 have often been adopted for the modelling of risers in addition to common wave configurations amaechi et al 2019 carried out the dynamic analysis on hoses in the chinese lantern configuration attached to a catenary anchor leg moorings buoys rao was acquired by ansys aqwa and coupled dynamic mode was developed by orcaflex besides chrolenko et al 2013 developed a dynamic analysis model of which installation vessel was coupled with the riser system used it to assess risk and weather limitations for riser replacements the boundary control problem of a marine flexible riser installation system was investigated in he et al 2013 with numerical simulations in addition as an alternative solution to pipeline installation planning and decision making a real time offshore pipeline installation monitoring system was developed wang et al 2017 the realistic pipeline behavior is calculated by orcaflex based on data acquired from sensors 3 flexible riser pull in operation 3 1 operation introduction riser replacement operations are complex and perilous when the production platform is connected to multiple risers the object here is a single water filled fr operated in shallow waters the whole pull in procedure in this case includes 14 steps which are simulated in vp and fea respectively a general introduction is as follows starting with the initial conditions of this procedure which is depicted in fig 3 1 offshore vessel equipped with vls mounted over a moonpool stays in close range to the platform using dynamic positioning dp to keep the position and heading 2 offshore vessel pays out part of the riser by tensioners through the moonpool center point a 3 an end of the winch wire on the platform is connected to the riser topside termination which is protected by a bend stiffener bs against over bending fatigue damage in the following operations keeping the heading always restricted vls pays out the riser by different lengths in the subsequent steps while the platform winch hauls in the wire to receive the riser the vessel moves away from the platform in certain steps without paying out or hauling in the pull in operation finishes when the topside termination reaches the platform and is installed to the locking mechanism on the platform the steps above are designed to avoid the potential risks during the operation e g the collision between the vessel and platform the collision between the riser and the moonpool s wall or the jackets legs or seabed and the excessive stretches on the riser and winch wire thus the riser winch wire configurations tension and curvature during the operation should be analyzed for the validation 3 2 simplified mechanical analysis during a general pull in operation the riser and winch wire both experience large displacements and rotations under dynamic boundaries in reeling process and dynamic environment loads which makes these flexible slender structures show strong geometrically nonlinear dynamic behaviors for the numerical method in the riser mechanical analysis the results derived from classic catenary theory is often adopted as initial iteration value for the following mechanical analysis therefore as a beginning work of the whole operation study a simplified mechanical analysis for the initial static configuration is shown in this section based on classic catenary theory as shown in fig 3 the focus is on ab part which includes 3 sections ae riser ed bs and db wire the initial equilibrium configuration is subjected to the distributed gravity buoyancy and support tensions by neglecting the bending stiffness and axial strain ae and db are both simplified as catenaries in the two dimensional x z plane while ed is considered as a rigid straignt line the known variables are the lengths of three parts l a e l e d l d b vertical distance v a b and horizontal distance h a b and equivalent weights per length ρ of each part the buoyancy from the seawater should be taken into account for ρ of the parts in the sea fe di and ic based on the catenary theory equations 1 8 can be obtained af fe and cb are all catenary parts without the lowest point and provide similar equations 1 v i j 1 ρ i j g t i z 2 t x 2 t j z 2 t x 2 2 h i j t x ρ i j g sinh 1 t i z t x sinh 1 t j z t x where i a f c and j f e b respectively the projection lengths of parts on the z axis are v and the x axis are h t z is the force component along the z axis while t x is the force component along the x axis di and ic parts have the lowest points included thus the vertical projections of di and ic can be presented in the following 3 v d i t x ρ

position of ab part then can be obtained and will be discussed in section 6 2 4 advanced virtual prototyping 4 1 software architecture the virtual prototyping work is implemented by the offshore simulator centre osc norway the architecture of the software adopted for vp is illustrated in fig 4 the sandbox is the instructor module which starts and controls the simulation scenarios in the platform called fathom which is developed by osc the core is the central module that dispatches the commands and feedbacks to the various modules e g communicating with physics engines via the apis jni and with the sandbox two ways and visual channels one way via a gaming network middleware called raknet the visual channels can update the visual frames fps faster than the network update rate using interpolation which smoothes network jitters the physics is a general purpose physics solver that assesses the behaviors of flexible slender bodies and rigid bodies in different scenarios it is implemented in the software agx dynamics algoryx simulation 2020 which offers a mix of solvers suitable for iteration on fast approximate solutions and runs at 60hz the visualization implemented on a game engine platform with broad developer base called unity provides a life like immersive environment in addition the human machine interface hmi developed in fathom with javafx sends the winch vessel lever commands from the human experts who perform the simulation therefore the framework can be used to identify bottlenecks and possible human communication challenges between the various teams during the simultaneous operations simops such as an offshore operation manager winch reel operator remotely operated vehicle pilot and offshore vessel captain 4 2 communication between modules according to the vp framework the user firstly starts with sandbox and chooses a scenario then the core is initiated with the set environmental parameters such as wind wave and current settings following the numbering in fig 4 the communications between modules are as follows 1 core module starts the simulation and obtains the commands from sandbox 2 core sends the environmental conditions forwards the commands to physics which calculates the forces accelerations velocities positions and orientations of all objects in the scene 3 results obtained are forwarded back to core 4 core forwards the positions and orientations to visualization at 60 hz and sends the static and dynamic properties of all the objects in the simulation to the sandbox 5 for the purpose of logging and analysis 6 the hmi module transfers the commands from the winch operators to the core module 4 3 physical model a scene is a description of how the models are interconnected and how they behave all scene items are placed and connected in a fathom module dedicated to composing scenes in a 3d environment which avoids time consuming and error prone xml tree structure editing of scene configuration the physical properties of the main components in the model are listed in table 1 in agx the fr and the winch wire are both modeled by agxwire which is a hybrid multiresolution wire combining lumped elements and massless quasi static representations without torsional properties the lumped element resolution is adapted dynamically based on local stability criteria which means the mesh density is changeable during the simulation the tensioner is modeled as a winch in the 3d model of the vessel the platform winch is placed at the relevant position on the deck both winch drums are not modeled which gives a significant performance boost without sacrificing precision the vessel is modeled with a dp system that controls the vessel s heading and position during offshore operation to circumvent a limitation of agx not handling the buoyancy of the riser properly the water density is chosen to be at 1080 kg m3 fig 5 shows the visualization result of the simulation for step 0 the green highlight line represents the bs the purple highlight line that is divided by the green line represents the flexible riser between the vessel and the bs and the winch wire from the bs to the platform 4 4 logged information the logging or data acquisition is performed at predefined operational steps the logged tension data comprises tension along the riser and tension along the wire based on simulation time and procedural steps as mentioned agxwire has dynamic resolution for calculation stability the higher the tension is the coarser the resolution becomes therefore not every position along the riser wire has a continuous data during the simulation the winches are commanded by operators with the help of joystick as preventing excessive riser bend is a key to operation the position with minimal radius of curvature is added to the logs for the validation 5 validation based on fea 5 1 fea based modeling to validate the results from vp an fea based simulation is adopted for the pull in operation of a flexible riser as an initial study a calm environment e g static sea state is set for the verification work therefore due to the low speed operation and static environment the pull in operation case can be regarded as a nonlinear static process without considering inertia effect and the flow effect from seawater followed by the operation procedure and the physical model presented in section 3 and 4 basic four parts fr with bs winch wire two drums are introduced in the fea model created with the commercial software suite abaqus 2019 this general fea suite consists of modeling simulation and visualization for event based realistic analysis the configuration tension and bending radius along the flexible riser can be calculated after the system meets the compatibility and equilibrium requirements besides the parameters in table 1 the additional parameters for fea are shown in table 2 5 1 1 flexible riser according to the nominal bending stiffness and axial stiffness the equivalent geometry and material for the cross section of the riser can be obtained to create the riser model using beam elements which are suitable for the riser global analysis in this case the hybrid beam elements are adopted because they well handle the slender structures which have significant axial stiffness compared to the bending stiffness the axial force is treated as an independent unknown introduced in the internal virtual work systemes 2019 as follows 13 δ w l n δ ε m δ κ δ λ n n d l where w is the internal virtual work l is the length n is the axial force variable and n is the independent variable δ λ represents a lagrange multiplier imposing n n m is the force moment and κ is the curvature of the cross section the hybrid beam element b31h with 2 node linear beam in 3d space is introduced to model the flexible riser from moonpool level point a in fig 3 to bs s tip end point e in fig 3 which is a free hanging part the model adopts 949 elements in the mesh strategy for the efficiency and comparison with vp mesh density is generally defined as 4 nodes per meter while the mesh density is increased as 10 nodes per meter in the region of 20 m near bs which considers the convergence and accuracy 5 1 2 ancillaries this part is extended from the riser and consists of the bs pup piece end fitting and pull head since this part is simplified as a rigid body in the vp model it is also modeled as a rigid body in fea the encased riser section is considered in the gravity of this part 5 1 3 winch wire the part between the actual position of winch drum and hang off position has been ignored for simplicity as a slender structure the winch wire also adopts b31h elements with equivalent bending stiffness and the same mesh density 4 nodes per meter as the riser a joint without rotation restrictions is created for the hinge between the wire and pull head to retract the riser 5 1 4 reeling systems two reeling systems in the operation are both simplified as simple drum shapes and simulated as rigid bodies in the model the reference point representing rigid body is set in the center of each drum the top end points of riser and wire are coupled with the reference points which means all the degrees of freedom for end points are consistent with reference points the contact and separation in the interactions between drums and slender structures are using surface to surface formulation in the frictionless contact pairs 5 1 5 environment according to the benign environment of the project only the buoyancy is considered for this simulation abaqus aqua is a module used to apply buoyancy steady current wave and wind loading to the model this module is introduced to the model by editing keywords in the input file in the aqua module the buoyancy is calculated based on the real volume of each component in the sea 5 2 fea based simulation for operation the procedure of fea simulation consists of position initialization riser pay out wire haul in and vessel translation these steps are all set as static analysis which means the inertia effect is excluded in the simulation evenly reeling on and off the drums for the winch wire and riser are controlled by the displacements of top end points and the normal contact introduced by the drums rotating around the y axis in fig 3 and translating along the y axis in addition the freedom of the joint between the wire and pull head is restricted along the y axis to prevent the riser wire from touching themselves on the drum an implicit method is adopted although it involves convergence issue this usually takes longer time to complete compared to the explicit method but leads to more accurate results the fea simulation on this research work was run on an i7 4770 ghz cpu 5 2 1 initialization a schematic of the initial configuration of pull in is shown in fig 3 which shows the initial length and spatial relations of components in the system since the accurate initial configuration under environmental loads is indeterminate in the preprocessing of this general purpose software three steps below are adopted for the initialization step 1 fig 6 1 shows the condition without environmental loads two reference points are both fixed the spatial relation is kept based on the horizontal distance 67m the blue line represents the winch wire with original length while the yellow line represents the riser step 2 the gravity is applied on the wire and riser the riser is reeled on the drum by the drum rotating and lowering down with the rest paid out length reaching the predefined value after the initialization as shown in fig 6 2 step 3 the winch drum is lowered down to the actual position pictured in fig 6 3 4 as the final step of initialization 5 2 2 pull in according to the designed operation procedures the first step is simultaneously paying out the riser and hauling in the winch wire then the pay out haul in and vessel translation are operated alternately the whole simulation is conducted in a continuous way which means the results of each step will have impact on the next step in terms of stress analysis 6 results and discussions in order to verify the virtual prototyping by the difference of these two methods comparisons are made between the results obtained from the vp simulation and from fea 6 1 sandbox results the operation was run on a standard gaming machine with an i7 6700k 4ghz cpu and could be performed at a real time factor of 2 which means that the simulation time goes twice as fast as the wall clock time as a result the simulation starts from step 0 as pictured in fig 7 with the riser hanging vertically and stops at step 14 the critical step when the largest curvature of riser is reached is shown as critical step in fig 7 the oreintation of bs is nearly horizontal step 0 step 5 are steps for the completion of bs hanging on and then step 6 step 14 are adopted for the rest procedures to find a suitable hanging position for the riser in case of touching down the seabed for simplicity step 7 step 13 are not shown in fig 7 the seawater is not rendered for the sake of scenario visibility for different conditions the whole riser points positions are stored 6 2 configurations in the pull in process as mentioned during the operation in the subsea the configurations of these slender structures should be well predicted to avoid collisions with other objects in the process the coordinates for the riser and winch wire in the vp model are based on the actual positions in the scene while there are no requirements for the absolute positions of the objects in fem thus the simulations in the vp and fea don t need to stay in the same plane here the configurations are studied based on the arc length to eliminate the impacts of orientations fig 8 a shows the comparison of the initial configurations of riser and wire in 3d space while fig 8 b presents the final configurations the positive direction of x axis indicates the increase of arc length from point b to point a in fig 3 from the curves in the figures the variations of the elevation from initial condition to the final condition are generally similar for different methods in fig 8 a the results from section 3 2 have been compared with fem and vp the coordinate of lowest point 107 8 61 3 from catenary method is higher than fem 106 66 7 and vp 104 7 68 the differences for elevations are both within 11 which results from the assumptions in the catenary method besides it is noticed that the agreements between the configurations from fea and vp in these two steps are basically good 6 3 tensions at measure points the maximum allowable tension is considered as an important design criterion for the winch or tensioner capacity in the installation process however due to the dynamic resolution of agxwire fixed points for logging the tension are limited therefore the measure points are chosen at moonpool mt and the hook between bs and wire ht in table 3 the results from 14 steps correspond with fig 7 the error is set as an absolute value it can be clearly seen that the differences for the riser tension between vp and fea at most of the steps are within 6 except step 0 which means the tension of riser from vp are acceptable in these steps for the tension of hook the errors in the most of steps are within 10 except step 0 and step 1 the most of differences probably results from different modelling methods in vp and fea in vp for example the reeling process has been simplified by paying out different riser wire lengths while in fea the reeling has been simulated by a dynamic boundary that rotates with a drum and it is a continuous iterative process which is closer to the reality in addition ht obtained from section 3 2 for step 0 is 0 19t which is much closer to fea than vp thus the large differences in the initial steps indicate that the differences between fea and vp have a big impact especially on the initial small ht equivalent weight of wire and should be improved 6 4 curvature variation at bs s tip end excessive bending can lead to local buckling of the flexible riser according to api 17j 2014 the minimum bend radius is from the concepts of minimum storage radius and the minimum locking radius fig 9 shows the configurations when the maximum curvature happens see fig 9 a for the vp result and fig 9 b for the fea result since the bs is modeled as a rigid body both in vp and fea there is a sharp change at the connection between bs and riser sk1 is the component of section curvature around the main normal exported from abaqus indicating that the location of maximum curvature is at the end of fr which is represented by bs s tip end in this section for further study about the curvature variation fig 10 shows the curvature of the bs s tip end at all the steps while fig 11 presents the curvature variation from bs to riser at the critical step based on equation 14 which is according to the differential geometry 14 κ r r r 3 where r is the position on the riser r is the change rate of directions between 2 consecutive points r is the change rate of 2 consecutive changes of directions and κ is the curvature at that position the maximum curvature happened at the same position bs s tip end in the simulations of fea and vp the peak values are also similar in terms of the error 3 in addition the reason for the different critical curvatures between abaqus and equation 14 is that the former is calculated based on the cross section properties and equation 14 is according to the curve properties in terms of differential geometry without cross section properties according to the critical curvature the real tapered bending stiffness of bs should be taken into account in both simulation and real practice to avoid local buckling at the connection 7 conclusions as a critical activity during the replacement of an fr the pull in procedure for a flexible pipe transferred from an installation vessel to a jacket platform is studied in this paper the results obtained from the virtual prototyping framework are compared with the ones achieved from the finite element simulation with the whole procedure modeling the changes of configuration tension and curvature of the riser section are mainly studied in detail the two sets of results are basically in a good agreement and it can be concluded that 1 the virtual prototyping model is physically suitable for predicting the riser behavior consistent procedure can predict the mechanical variation at any time in the process of operation 2 simulating winches without reels in the virtual prototyping framework did not affect the accuracy of the tension at either end in the most steps 3 modeling the bs as a rigid object coating the riser is a conservative approach since it tends to overestimate the curvature of the riser at its open end 4 the limitation from the capabilities of hardwares adopted have little impact on the case study since the real time requirement has been reached this work is suitable for any flexible slender structure in the offshore pull in operation for example cable umbilical etc however the operation in this simulation is a comparatively simple case future work should be extended to apply more severe dynamic environmental loads and boundary conditions this implies the requirement of considering the vessel model with response amplitude operator from a hydrodynamics analysis tool such as wamit or shipx the comparison with abaqus will then be based on statistical estimates of multiple runs once the dynamical analysis is validated it will be possible to conduct virtual prototyping of the riser installation operation with crews improving procedures by avoiding collisions and

21752,as a critical campaign in the offshore oil and gas engineering flexible riser replacements involve complex operations that need to be optimized and detailed to factor in trends in the industry since it allows engineers to interact with simulation tools in real time during the operation design phase virtual prototyping vp is an efficient method to obtain an optimal solution and improve operational procedures in terms of safety and effectiveness for risk based integrity management of flexible risers in this study a real time vp model is adopted to simulate the process of a water injection flexible riser pulled in from an installation vessel to a jacket platform which is one of the riser replacements tasks the results are validated against results based on a finite element analysis attention is paid to the configuration tension and maximum bending curvature along the flexible riser during the operation the innovative approach presented in this paper can provide guidance with respect to the operation limitations of a flexible pipe in practical engineering graphical abstract image 1 keywords flexible riser replacement operation virtual prototyping finite element method 1 introduction oil and gas will remain primary energy resources for many years to come pedersen 2015 flexible pipes have been vital to subsea developments worldwide and to norwegian oil and gas production facilities since 1986 leira et al 2015 as shown in fig 1 a flexible riser fr as a dynamic pipe application is applied in floating production systems mainly serving for a high pressure production gas lift and chemical water injection according to the norwegian petroleum safety authority 326 frs were in use on the norwegian continental shelf in 2013 however till 2013 more than 25 of frs had been replaced due to different failure mechanisms 4subsea 2013 a replacement of fr generally includes two reverse operations recovery and reinstallation during which specialized vessels operate in a close range to platforms both operations share a high risk of entanglement or spaghetti effect for the risers hung close to neighboring ones as shown in fig 1 in addition the probability of oil spills increases because replacement operations are typically performed without shutting down field production thus the relevant operations schedule should be carefully designed for fr integrity management based on analyses experiences and risk assessments to avoid initiations of failure modes such as annulus flood over bending etc however as seen in fig 1 the complex unbonded multi layered structure of frs not only contributes to the mechanical advantages but also makes testing with full scale physical prototypes highly costly and even unfeasible due to major developments in game engines and performance improvements in both accelerated hardware and real time compliant mathematical models up to date virtual prototyping vp technology can promote safer operation procedures through concept verification iterative engineering design crew training and communication between various teams in a flexible and efficient way which can be an optimal choice for riser operations optimization using advanced vp tools including ghosting based on real environmental models for wind waves and current allows the visualization of the predicted course of operations during contingency scenarios such as vessel drift off crane black out riser joint failure etc nevertheless there is always an issue about the tradeoff between model accuracy and computation efficiency in vp which makes the validation necessary to this end a finite element approach fea model is adopted for the verification purpose in this research since an fea is a widely accepted tool for the structural analysis of risers dynamic risers 2018 compared with vp a conventional fea simulation is limited in an offline environment and normally applies to the component analysis in a stress level the computation depending on the mesh strategy and the performance of processors may be tedious and tricky for the simulation of complex operation procedures which decreases the possibility of effective interactivity real time fea develops but normally has limited applications huang et al 2015 compared with the recovery of scrapped risers greater concern is needed for reinstallation of a new riser which imposes strict requirements on vessel station keeping capabilities and weather criteria fergestad and løtveit 2014 thus the case this paper addresses is an operation for an fr pulled from an installation vessel to a jacket platform this is the first phase of the reinstallation and in the beginning of this phase the vessel stays most closely to the platform the general process with 4 selected steps step i iv for pulling in a riser is shown in fig 2 the purpose of this research is to identify bottlenecks such as potential failure possibilities inconsistencies and inefficiencies in the procedures and then optimize the related operation this paper is extended from major et al 2019a an advanced vp framework for the riser operation is applied and the original contribution is integrating virtual reality real time and humans in the loop hitl into this framework to assess the vp results in terms of fidelity fea correspondingly provides a complete simulation for the consistent procedures attention is paid to the equilibrium positions maximum bend curvature and axial tension of the flexible riser during the operation 2 related works vp for engineering applications is increasingly developed in maritime industry li et al 2016 presented a vp framework including modeling simulation and control for ship maneuvering chu et al 2018 introduced the vp system for maritime crane design and operations major et al 2019b proposed a framework for the study on three positioning solutions of mobile offshore drilling units besides vp is often used with the conjunction of virtual reality and mathematical models for the purpose of training unskilled workers zhang et al 2017 described a mathematical model for virtual reality of a subsea production facilities installation to achieve the training goal yu et al 2017 presented a full mission simulator relying on a similar virtual reality however vp has rarely been applied on offshore flexible riser operations the validation in this paper is implemented for the results calculated by physics module in vp lee and roh 2018 detailed the requirements of physics engines for simulation of shipyard and offshore operations especially for coupled systems but the real time requirement is not fulfilled besides although vp framework for control design is already developed there is still a lack of the integration capability to interact with hitl and a real time virtual environment regarding riser operations analysis advances have mostly been achieved in the research of the structural integrity for the traditional local failure mechanism study a 3d finite element model with solid elements was presented in guedes mendonça and de arruda martins 2017 to investigate the effect of the launching procedure in flexible pipes installation collapse performances were experimentally and numerically investigated in caleyron et al 2017 to show the installation effect was positive fea turns out to be an effective method owen and qin 1986 fylling et al 1998 chai and varyani 2006 in riser global analysis and rod elements chen et al 2011 ruan et al 2017 or beam elements guo et al 2018 have often been adopted for the modelling of risers in addition to common wave configurations amaechi et al 2019 carried out the dynamic analysis on hoses in the chinese lantern configuration attached to a catenary anchor leg moorings buoys rao was acquired by ansys aqwa and coupled dynamic mode was developed by orcaflex besides chrolenko et al 2013 developed a dynamic analysis model of which installation vessel was coupled with the riser system used it to assess risk and weather limitations for riser replacements the boundary control problem of a marine flexible riser installation system was investigated in he et al 2013 with numerical simulations in addition as an alternative solution to pipeline installation planning and decision making a real time offshore pipeline installation monitoring system was developed wang et al 2017 the realistic pipeline behavior is calculated by orcaflex based on data acquired from sensors 3 flexible riser pull in operation 3 1 operation introduction riser replacement operations are complex and perilous when the production platform is connected to multiple risers the object here is a single water filled fr operated in shallow waters the whole pull in procedure in this case includes 14 steps which are simulated in vp and fea respectively a general introduction is as follows starting with the initial conditions of this procedure which is depicted in fig 3 1 offshore vessel equipped with vls mounted over a moonpool stays in close range to the platform using dynamic positioning dp to keep the position and heading 2 offshore vessel pays out part of the riser by tensioners through the moonpool center point a 3 an end of the winch wire on the platform is connected to the riser topside termination which is protected by a bend stiffener bs against over bending fatigue damage in the following operations keeping the heading always restricted vls pays out the riser by different lengths in the subsequent steps while the platform winch hauls in the wire to receive the riser the vessel moves away from the platform in certain steps without paying out or hauling in the pull in operation finishes when the topside termination reaches the platform and is installed to the locking mechanism on the platform the steps above are designed to avoid the potential risks during the operation e g the collision between the vessel and platform the collision between the riser and the moonpool s wall or the jackets legs or seabed and the excessive stretches on the riser and winch wire thus the riser winch wire configurations tension and curvature during the operation should be analyzed for the validation 3 2 simplified mechanical analysis during a general pull in operation the riser and winch wire both experience large displacements and rotations under dynamic boundaries in reeling process and dynamic environment loads which makes these flexible slender structures show strong geometrically nonlinear dynamic behaviors for the numerical method in the riser mechanical analysis the results derived from classic catenary theory is often adopted as initial iteration value for the following mechanical analysis therefore as a beginning work of the whole operation study a simplified mechanical analysis for the initial static configuration is shown in this section based on classic catenary theory as shown in fig 3 the focus is on ab part which includes 3 sections ae riser ed bs and db wire the initial equilibrium configuration is subjected to the distributed gravity buoyancy and support tensions by neglecting the bending stiffness and axial strain ae and db are both simplified as catenaries in the two dimensional x z plane while ed is considered as a rigid straignt line the known variables are the lengths of three parts l a e l e d l d b vertical distance v a b and horizontal distance h a b and equivalent weights per length ρ of each part the buoyancy from the seawater should be taken into account for ρ of the parts in the sea fe di

relationship of bs the following equations can be obtained 9 t e z h e d g e d h e d 2 t x v e d 0 10 h e d 2 v e d 2 l e d 2 the whole system should satisfy the compatibility therefore there comes 11

position of ab part then can be obtained and will be discussed in section 6 2 4 advanced virtual prototyping 4 1 software architecture the virtual prototyping work is implemented by the offshore

platform called fathom which is developed by osc the core is the central module that dispatches the commands and feedbacks to the various modules e g communicating with physics engines via the apis

game engine platform with broad developer base called unity provides a life like immersive environment in addition the human machine interface hmi developed in fathom with javafx sends the winch vessel lever commands from the human experts who perform the simulation therefore the framework can be used to identify bottlenecks and possible human communication challenges between the various teams during the simultaneous operations simops such as an offshore operation manager winch reel operator remotely operated vehicle pilot and offshore vessel captain 4 2 communication between modules according to the vp framework the user firstly starts with sandbox and chooses a scenario then the core is initiated with the set environmental parameters such as wind wave and current settings following the numbering in fig 4 the communications between modules are as follows 1 core module starts the simulation and obtains the commands from sandbox 2 core sends the environmental conditions forwards the commands to physics which calculates the forces accelerations velocities positions and orientations of all objects in the scene 3 results obtained are forwarded back to core 4 core forwards the positions and orientations to visualization at 60 hz and sends the static and dynamic properties of all the objects in the simulation to the sandbox 5 for the purpose of logging and analysis 6 the hmi module transfers the commands from the winch operators to the core module 4 3 physical model a scene is a description of how the models are interconnected and how they behave all scene items are placed and connected in a fathom module dedicated to composing scenes in a 3d environment which avoids time consuming and error prone xml tree structure editing of scene configuration the physical properties of the main components in the model are listed in table 1 in agx the fr and the winch wire are both modeled by agxwire which is a hybrid multiresolution wire combining lumped

which gives a significant performance boost without sacrificing precision the vessel is modeled with a dp system that controls the vessel s heading and position during offshore operation to circumvent a limitation of agx not handling the buoyancy of the riser properly the water density is chosen to be at 1080 kg m3 fig 5 shows the visualization result of the simulation for step 0 the green highlight line represents the bs the purple highlight line that is divided by the green line represents the flexible riser between the vessel and the bs and the winch wire from the bs to the platform 4 4 logged information the logging or data acquisition is performed at predefined operational steps the logged tension data comprises tension along the riser and tension along the wire based on simulation time and procedural steps as mentioned agxwire has dynamic resolution for calculation stability the higher the tension is the coarser the resolution becomes therefore not every position along the riser wire has a continuous data during the simulation the winches are commanded by operators with the help of joystick as preventing excessive riser bend is a key to operation the position with minimal radius of curvature is added to the logs for the validation 5 validation based on fea 5 1 fea based modeling to validate the results from vp an fea based simulation is adopted for the pull in operation of a flexible riser as an initial study a calm environment e g static sea state is set for the verification work therefore due to the low speed operation and static environment the pull in operation case can be regarded as a nonlinear static process without considering inertia effect and the flow effect from seawater followed by the operation procedure and the physical model presented in section 3 and 4 basic four parts fr with bs winch wire two drums are introduced in the fea model created with the commercial software suite abaqus 2019 this general fea suite consists of modeling simulation and visualization for event based realistic analysis the configuration tension and bending radius along the flexible riser can be calculated after the system meets the compatibility and equilibrium requirements besides the parameters in table 1 the additional parameters for fea are shown in table 2 5 1 1 flexible riser according to the nominal bending stiffness and axial stiffness the equivalent geometry and material for the cross section of the riser can be obtained to create the riser model using beam elements which are suitable for the riser global analysis in this case the hybrid beam elements are adopted because they well handle the slender structures which have significant axial stiffness compared to the bending stiffness the axial force is treated as an independent unknown introduced in the internal virtual work systemes 2019 as follows 13 δ w l n δ ε m δ κ δ λ n n d l where w is the internal virtual work l is the length n is the axial force variable and n is the independent variable δ λ represents a lagrange multiplier imposing n n m is the force moment and κ is the curvature of the cross section the hybrid beam element b31h with 2 node linear beam in 3d space is introduced to model the flexible riser from moonpool level point a in fig 3 to bs s tip end point e in fig 3 which is a free hanging part the model adopts 949 elements in the mesh strategy for the efficiency and comparison with vp mesh density is generally defined as 4 nodes per meter while the mesh density is increased as 10 nodes per meter in the region of 20 m near bs which considers the convergence and accuracy 5 1 2 ancillaries this part is extended from the riser and consists of the bs pup piece end fitting and pull head since this part is simplified as a rigid body in the vp model it is also modeled as a rigid body in fea the encased riser section is considered in the gravity of this part 5 1 3 winch wire the part between the actual position of winch drum and hang off position has been ignored for simplicity as a slender structure the winch wire also adopts b31h elements with equivalent bending stiffness and the same mesh density 4 nodes per meter as the riser a joint without rotation restrictions is created for the hinge between the wire and pull head to retract the riser 5 1 4 reeling systems two reeling systems in the operation are both simplified as simple drum shapes and simulated as rigid bodies in the model the reference point representing rigid body is set in the center of each drum the top end points of riser and wire are coupled with the reference points which means all the degrees of freedom for end points are consistent with reference points the contact and separation in the interactions between drums and slender structures are using surface to surface formulation in the frictionless contact pairs 5 1 5 environment according to the benign environment of the project only the buoyancy is considered for this simulation abaqus aqua is a module used to apply buoyancy steady current wave and wind loading to the model this module is introduced to the model by editing keywords in the input file in the aqua module the buoyancy is calculated based on the real volume of each component in the sea 5 2 fea based simulation for operation the procedure of fea simulation consists of position initialization riser pay out wire haul in and vessel translation these steps are all set as static analysis which means the inertia effect is excluded in the simulation evenly reeling on and off the drums for the winch wire and riser are controlled by the displacements of top end points and the normal contact introduced by the drums rotating around the y axis in fig 3 and translating along the y axis in addition the freedom of the joint between the wire and pull head is restricted along the y axis to prevent the riser wire from touching themselves on the drum an implicit method is adopted although it involves convergence issue this usually takes longer time to complete compared to the explicit method but leads to more accurate results the fea simulation on this research work was run on an i7 4770 ghz cpu 5 2 1 initialization a schematic of the initial configuration of pull in is shown in fig 3 which shows the initial length and spatial relations of components in the system since the accurate initial configuration under environmental loads is indeterminate in the preprocessing of this general purpose software three steps below are adopted for the initialization step 1 fig 6 1 shows the condition without environmental loads two reference points are both fixed the spatial relation is kept based on the horizontal distance 67m the blue line represents the winch wire with original length while the yellow line represents the riser step 2 the gravity is applied on the wire and riser the riser is reeled on the drum by the drum rotating and lowering down with the rest paid out length reaching the predefined value after the initialization as shown in fig 6 2 step 3 the winch drum is lowered down to the actual position pictured in fig 6 3 4 as the final step of initialization 5 2 2 pull in according to the designed operation procedures the first step is simultaneously paying out the riser and hauling in the winch wire then the pay out haul in and vessel translation are operated alternately the whole simulation is conducted in a continuous way which means the results of each step will have impact on the next step in terms of stress analysis 6 results and discussions in order to verify the virtual prototyping by the difference of these two methods comparisons are made between the results obtained from the vp simulation and from fea 6 1 sandbox results the operation was run on a standard gaming machine with an i7 6700k 4ghz cpu and could be performed at a real time factor of 2 which means that the simulation time goes twice as fast as the wall clock time as a result the simulation starts from step 0 as pictured in fig 7 with the riser hanging vertically and stops at step 14 the critical step when the largest curvature of riser is reached is shown as critical step in fig 7 the oreintation of bs is nearly horizontal step 0 step 5 are steps for the completion of bs hanging on and then step 6 step 14 are adopted for the rest procedures to find a suitable hanging position for the riser in case of touching down the seabed for simplicity step 7 step 13 are not shown in fig 7 the seawater is not rendered for the sake of scenario visibility for different conditions the whole riser points positions are stored 6 2 configurations in the pull in process as mentioned during the operation in the subsea the configurations of these slender structures should be well predicted to avoid collisions with other objects in the process the coordinates for the riser and winch wire in the vp model are based on the actual positions in the scene while there are no requirements for the absolute positions of the objects in fem thus the simulations in the vp and fea don t need to stay in the same plane here the configurations are studied based on the arc length to eliminate the impacts of orientations fig 8 a shows the comparison of the initial configurations of riser and wire in 3d space while fig 8 b presents the final configurations the positive direction of x axis indicates the increase of arc length from point b to point a in fig 3 from the curves in the figures the variations of the elevation from initial condition to the final condition are generally similar for different methods in fig 8 a the results from section 3 2 have been compared with fem and vp the coordinate of lowest point 107 8 61 3 from catenary method is higher than fem 106 66 7 and vp 104 7 68 the differences for elevations are both within 11 which results from the assumptions in the catenary method besides it is noticed that the agreements between the configurations from fea and vp in these two steps are basically good 6 3 tensions at measure points the maximum allowable tension is considered as an important design criterion for the winch or tensioner capacity in the installation process however due to the dynamic resolution of agxwire fixed points for logging the tension are limited therefore the measure points are chosen at moonpool mt and the hook between bs and wire ht in table 3 the results from 14 steps correspond with fig 7 the error is set as an absolute value it can be clearly seen that the differences for the riser tension between vp and fea at most of the steps are within 6 except step 0 which means the tension of riser from vp are acceptable in these steps for the tension of hook the errors in the most of steps are within 10 except step 0 and step 1 the most of differences probably results from different modelling methods in vp and fea in vp for example the reeling process has been simplified by paying out different riser wire lengths while in fea the reeling has been simulated by a dynamic boundary that rotates with a drum and it is a continuous iterative process which is closer to the reality in addition ht obtained from section 3 2 for step 0 is 0 19t which is much closer to fea than vp thus the large differences in the initial steps indicate that the differences between fea and vp have a big impact especially on the initial small ht equivalent weight of wire and should be improved 6 4 curvature variation at bs s tip end excessive bending can lead to local buckling of the flexible riser according to api 17j 2014 the minimum bend radius is from the concepts of minimum storage radius and the minimum locking radius fig 9 shows the configurations when the maximum curvature happens see fig 9 a for the vp result and fig 9 b for the fea result since the bs is modeled as a rigid body both in vp and fea there is a sharp change at the connection between bs and riser sk1 is the component of section curvature around the main normal exported from abaqus indicating that the location of maximum curvature is at the end of fr which is represented by bs s tip end in this section for further study about the curvature variation fig 10 shows the curvature of the bs s tip end at all the steps while fig 11 presents the curvature variation from bs to riser at the critical step based on equation 14 which is according to the differential geometry 14 κ r r r 3 where r is the position on the riser r is the change rate of directions between 2 consecutive points r is the change rate of 2 consecutive changes of directions and κ is the curvature at that position the maximum curvature happened at the same position bs s tip end in the simulations of fea and vp the peak values are also similar in terms of the error 3 in addition the reason for the different critical curvatures between abaqus and equation 14 is that the former is calculated based on the cross section properties and equation 14 is according to the curve properties in terms of differential geometry without cross section properties according to the critical curvature the real tapered bending stiffness of bs should be taken into account in both simulation and real practice to avoid local buckling at the connection 7 conclusions as a critical activity during the replacement of an fr the pull in procedure for a flexible pipe transferred from an installation vessel to a jacket platform is studied in this paper the results obtained from the virtual prototyping framework are compared with the ones achieved from the finite element simulation with the whole procedure modeling the changes of configuration tension and curvature of the riser section are mainly studied in detail the two sets of results are basically in a good agreement and it can be concluded that 1 the virtual prototyping model is physically suitable for predicting the riser behavior consistent procedure can predict the mechanical variation at any time in the process of operation 2 simulating winches without reels in the virtual prototyping framework did not affect the accuracy of the tension at either end in the most steps 3 modeling the bs as a rigid object coating the riser is a conservative approach since it tends to overestimate the curvature of the riser at its open end 4 the limitation from the capabilities of hardwares adopted have little impact on the case study since the real time requirement has been reached this work is suitable for any flexible slender structure in the offshore pull in operation for example cable umbilical etc however the operation in this simulation is a comparatively simple case future work should be extended to apply more severe dynamic environmental loads and boundary conditions this implies the requirement of considering the vessel model with response amplitude operator from a hydrodynamics analysis tool such as wamit or shipx the comparison with abaqus will then be based on statistical estimates of multiple runs once the dynamical analysis is validated it will be possible to conduct virtual prototyping of the riser installation operation with crews improving procedures by avoiding collisions and

21753,this paper is intended to present the authors know how about hybrid hardware in the loop hil wind tunnel testing of floating offshore wind turbines fowts that was acquired in the last decade through a very intense activity numerical codes commonly used within the scientific community to study fowts show significant uncertainties with respect to the prediction of some phenomena peculiar of these systems like the rotor wind dynamic interaction or the coupling between the machine controller and the low frequency rigid body motion modes of the platform a hybrid hil methodology was developed by the authors to exploit the unique characteristics of the politecnico di milano wind tunnel to collect data useful to improve the existing knowledge about the above mentioned scientific questions keywords floating offshore wind turbine hil wind tunnel scale model testing control 1 introduction in the beginning of the last decade floating offshore wind energy was a pioneering technology characterized by small scale prototypes driscoll et al 2016 roddier et al 2010 with recent commercial projects and the construction of the first floating offshore wind farm floating offshore wind energy is nowadays more than a merely potential market as it was considered in the past attracting great research development engineering and business efforts to decrease the cost of energy and to reach subsidy free projects and investments floating offshore wind turbines fowts are designed and studied relying on numerical simulation tools that must be validated by computations and experiments van kuik et al 2016 in the last decade many projects have been dedicated to the verification of numerical codes both through code to code and numerical experimental comparisons robertson et al 2017 popko et al 2018 and all of them evidenced a great dispersion of results uncertainties emerged from the past testing experiences shown the lack of reliable databases to understand these differences prototype testing is affected by the well known problems of full scale experiments environmental conditions cannot be controlled nor precisely described and the generality of the resulting data is often not completely asserted long times and high costs are often involved in many cases the size of recent fowt prototypes was also not significant with respect to the floating systems considered in commercial projects further lowering the generality of experimental data scale model testing can complement full scale experiments under many aspects providing low uncertainty data at a reasonable cost while widening the variety of dynamic conditions that are investigated in a fully controlled environment fowts scale model experiments require to simultaneously reproduce phenomena that are governed by very different physics to this purpose hybrid techniques were recently proposed to alleviate the limitations of traditional ocean basin tests where the fowt is reproduced by a scale model with the physical generation of wind and waves koo et al 2014 goupee et al 2014 kimball et al 2014 robertson et al 2013 in hardware in the loop hil tests the floating structure is divided into two complementary substructures either reproduced by a physical scale model or through a real time numerical model and an actuation system in ocean basin hil tests a physical model of the floating platform and wind turbine tower is combined with an actuation system tendons sauder et al 2016 bachynski et al 2016 winches gueydon et al 2018 ducted fans azcona et al 2014 vittori et al 2018 or multi fan systems battistella et al 2018 that is demanded to simulate rotor loads the physical reproduction of wave forces and platform response in a froude scaled environment makes ocean basin hil tests a key tool for the validation of hydrodynamic codes and for the investigation of the complex nature of low frequency non linear hydrodynamic loads cause of large platform motions hil sil ocean basin hybrid methodologies are however limited in the correct simulation of the aerodynamic loads associated with the wind turbine rotor even if the numerical rotor model used to compute forces is validated on the base of wind tunnel data bayati et al 2016b uncertainties are likely introduced in rotor loads by the hil measurement and actuation chains a complementary hybrid hil technique was developed at politecnico di milano polimi in order to perform wind tunnel tests of fowts taking advantage of the polimi wind tunnel galleria del vento politecnico di milano gvpm galleria del vento politecnico di milano 0000 in this case aerodynamic and rotor loads included those associated with the wind turbine controller action are reproduced by a physical scale model and combined with numerically computed hydrodynamic and wave loads for the real time integration of the platform rigid body motion the resulting displacements are imposed to the wind turbine model by means of a 6 degrees of freedom dofs parallel kinematic robot the possibility of operating at relatively high reynolds numbers and under a controlled inflow make wind tunnel hil tests the best tool to investigate how unsteady aerodynamic loads and wind turbine control logics impact the overall dynamics of the floating structure this paper is intended to give an insight into the hybrid hil methodology developed by the authors to perform wind tunnel tests about floating offshore wind turbines the hil setup is presented focusing on the definition of the scaling laws on which experiments are based then the physical subsystem the wind turbine scale model the numerical subsystem the floating platform model the hil force feedback and the 6 dofs robot are briefly described discussing the most significant choices made by the authors finally some results from a recent experimental campaign carried out in the framework of the h2020 lifes50 project lifes50 0000 are reported to show the typical outcome of hil wind tunnel tests 2 the hil system the polimi hil methodology is presented here with reference to the wind tunnel test campaign that was performed within the h2020 lifes50 research project fontanella et al 2019d the aim of the project was to qualify up to a technology readiness level trl of 5 two innovative substructure designs for 10mw wind turbines also making use of experimental data from hybrid hil ocean basin and wind tunnel tests the wind tunnel hil methodology is considered here applied to a floating system formed by the dtu 10mw reference wind turbine rwt bak et al 2013 and the oo star wind floater muller et al 2013 however its validity is general and the same techniques were also applied by the authors to other fowt concepts bayati et al 2017e fontanella et al 2019a the hil setup is shown in fig 1 and the control scheme of the system adopted for experiments is reported in fig 2 a wind turbine scale model is used to reproduce the rotor dynamics and the aerodynamic loads associated with the tower and the spinning rotor the wind turbine model is also featured by a complex mechatronic system that allows the implementation of wind turbine control logics representative of those used in modern machines the floating platform rigid body dynamics mooring line dynamics and hydrodynamic loads are introduced in the experiment through the real time integration of a numerical model the physical and numerical models are tied together by the hil measurement and actuation systems the forces associated with the wind turbine model are measured at tower base by a 6 components dynamometer the load reduction point of the transducer is ideally coincident with the connection point between tower and platform and are fed to the numerical model the numerical model is then integrated assuming as input the numerically computed hydrodynamic loads and the measured wind turbine loads computing the translations and rotations of the wind turbine tower base that are imposed to the scale model by a 6 dofs parallel kinematic robot hexafloat 2 1 scale factors the set of parameters required for the wind tunnel hil experiments was computed by scaling the corresponding quantities defined for the full scale floating system the scale factors needed for the calculations defined as the ratio between a given quantity evaluated for the scaled and full scale systems were obtained by independently fixing the length and velocity scale factors and deriving those relative to any other quantity of interest from dimensional analysis the length scale factor λ l was set by comparing the dtu 10mw specifications with the dimensions of the atmospheric boundary layer test section of the polimi wind tunnel 36 m length 14 m width and 4 m height as shown in table 1 the length scale factor directly impacts the mass requirements and the reynolds number for the wind turbine scale model it was fixed to 1 75 to have the largest possible rotor and avoid an excessive miniaturization of model components while limiting the blockage effect on the other hand since a maximum wind speed of 15 m s can be reached in laminar flow in the atmospheric boundary layer test section the velocity scale factor λ v was set to 1 3 to cover the entire dtu 10mw wind speed operating range limiting the reynolds number discrepancy with respect to full scale even with these scaling factors the reynolds number at model scale is more than two order of magnitude lower than at full scale as explained in section 3 2 this required to re design the wind turbine rotor choosing a different airfoil to correctly reproduce the aerodynamic forces of the full scale wind turbine in combination with the length scale factor λ l λ v sets the frequency scale λ ω that gives the performance requirements for the model actuators and natural frequencies of the aeroelastic components setting λ v to 1 3 also results in not too strict mechatronics and structural design constraints the complete set of scale factors for the wind turbine model and hil experiments derived from λ l and λ v is reported in table 1 3 the wind turbine scale model the wind turbine scale model wtm of the 1 75 dtu 10mw rwt bayati et al 2017c is featured by advanced mechatronic solutions bayati et al 2016a that were conceived to emulate the main control capabilities of a real wind turbine while respecting the very strict mass constraints imposed by the chosen scaling laws the rotor of the model was re designed with respect to full scale specifications to have correctly scaled aerodynamic loads operating at the reynolds numbers met inside the wind tunnel 3 1 mechatronic design the target properties for the wind turbine scale model reported in table 2 were easily derived by scaling the dtu 10mw rwt specifications according to the scale factors in table 1 it seems that the mass scale factor represents a strong constraint for the model even more strict considering that it is necessary to rely on commercial electronic components to implement the same control capabilities of a modern multi megawatt machine for the above mentioned reasons the scale model design was mainly driven by weight requirements and was headed on finding the best arrangement for the different components and the optimal design for in house realized parts in order to ensure the required functionalities while reducing masses in these regards some interesting elements of innovation were introduced with respect to the standard configuration of real wind turbines the exploded view and final assembly of the wtm nacelle and rotor are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively a hollow low speed shaft whose axis is misaligned with respect to the one of the high speed shaft allows the passage of the slip ring cables required to supply power and control signals to the rotating electronics i e the three pitch motors and their control boards the correct positioning of the two shafts is ensured by a u shaped support structure realized in carbon fiber reinforced plastic to be light and stiff cross roller bearings were adopted to withstand the high bending moments on the shafts saving space and weight in comparison to common double ball bearing solutions the torque unit is a maxon ec 4 pole 30 brushless motor with an integrated planetary gear connected to the low speed shaft through a belt transmission two carbon fiber reinforced plastic plates were used to realize the stiff and light hub structure where the individual pitch control ipc system and the related electronics are housed the ipc system is based on three harmonic drive rsf 5b 30 e050 c driven by maxon epos 24 2 motion controllers the wtm design proved to be very sound both from a structural and functional point of view and the model was successfully used for various wind tunnel test campaigns looking at table 2 it can be noticed that model masses still exceed the scaled target the only possibility to further reduce them is to design lighter structural components but this may be counterproductive structural components are impacting weight only for a small fraction being electronics and bearings the heaviest parts in the model a lighter structure would then result in small weight savings at the expense of a lower structural resistance and further complexity in operating the model e g in assembling and maintenance operations it is also to be considered that the model masses are not so meaningful when the wtm is used to reproduce aerodynamic loads only leaving the simulation of wind turbine weight and inertial loads to the hil numerical model pitch actuators were dimensioned neglecting the blade aerodynamic pitch moment assuming inertial loads to be dominant however experimental tests highlighted that the aerodynamic pitch moment can be significant in certain test conditions and this proved to be a constraint for the implementation of rotor pitch control logics 3 2 aerodynamic design the adoption of the scale factors of table 1 resulted in a reynolds number for the wind turbine model 225 times lower than at full scale that required to re design the wind turbine rotor to reproduce correctly its aerodynamic loads the aerodynamic design is deeply discussed in bayati et al 2017b and it was focused on minimizing the difference between the scale model and full scale thrust coefficient the sd7032 airfoil was used in place of the ffa w3 series airfoils of the rwt since its lower thickness makes it less sensible to flow separation the design procedure is based on the blade element approach and is aimed at defining the thickness over chord ratio t c and twist angle distribution of the scale model blade in common working conditions the rotor thrust is mostly related to the blade lift force and thus the blade geometry was selected to match the lift force and lift derivative with respect to the flow angle for any blade section the last requirement is necessary to ensure that the unsteady behavior of the wind turbine is well reproduced by the model the outputs of the optimization procedure are reported in fig 5 in terms of chord twist t c ratio and section shape for different non dimensional radial positions the aerodynamic performance of the wtm rotor can be analyzed looking at the power coefficient c p that impacts the implementation of any wind turbine power regulation control logic and thrust coefficient c t since the correct reproduction of the thrust force is of great importance in fowt testing the scale model power and thrust coefficients were experimentally measured for different combinations of tip speed ratio tsr λ and rotor collective blade pitch angle β tests were performed in a laminar wind field with a constant wind speed of 4 m s and the tsr was varied by adjusting the rotor speed in fig 6 the scale model aerodynamic coefficients extracted from steady state measurements of the tower top 6 components force transducer are compared to the corresponding values resulting from the fast jonkman and marshall 2005 model of the dtu 10mw rwt as visible the scale model and rwt performances are close but some differences are present in particular for the power coefficient for low values of tsr the scale model c p curves are convex and lower than the target ones especially for small pitch angles the wtm peak power coefficient for β 0 is 0 54 0 48 for the dtu 10mw and it is reached at a tsr λ 8 26 which is slightly greater than the target one 7 5 for the dtu 10mw for intermediate values of tsr the slope of the power coefficient characteristics is the same for the model and the rwt however for the first one a pitch angle variation results in a larger c p variation the wtm c t that was the main objective of the rotor optimal design process is closer to the dtu 10mw target the scale model curves are slightly steeper and approximate very well those of the rwt for intermediate tsr values some differences are evident for small pitch angles and high tsrs the wind turbine model c t is very close to the dtu 10mw one around λ 7 5 and β 0 i e the nominal tsr and pitch angle for the full scale wind turbine in below rated conditions that are the rotor settings considered in the design procedure differences are more evident for other combinations of λ and β but model curves still remain close enough to the full scale target when the main goal of the experiments is to study the rotor thrust force the wind turbine model is operated imposing the rotor pitch angle and angular speed i e excluding any closed loop control logic to match at any wind condition of interest the target thrust force the reproduction of power capture is sacrificed for thrust force and any influence of the wind turbine controller on the fowt is neglected this operating mode was successfully used to investigate the unsteady thrust force and wind turbine wake bayati et al 2017d a when the wind turbine controller has to be included in the experiment the full scale control logic is modified to accommodate the differences between the scale model and full scale machine rotor aerodynamics especially of power coefficient the low c p value experienced for small tsrs makes the wind turbine start up process difficult an ad hoc start up logic was included to maximize power and facilitate the start up in above rated conditions where rotor speed is regulated to its rated value and the tsr is consequently low the low c p results into a pitch angle request lower than target to this purpose it is possible to track the reference rotor power obtaining a lower thrust force in reason of the lower pitch angle or to track the reference thrust modifying the power set point to make the rotor operating at higher tsr values thrust force has a significant impact on the response of an fowt and the thrust force coefficient derivatives with respect to tsr and rotor pitch angle can provide information about the coupling between the wind turbine controller rotor aerodynamics and platform motion for this reason it is important to correctly scale not only the thrust coefficient but also its derivatives the thrust coefficient derivatives with respect to tsr and rotor pitch for the polimi wtm and for the dtu 10mw are compared in fig 7 as seen the derivatives for the model are quite close to the reference both in terms of values and trends in future designs the wind turbine scale model aerodynamic performance could be improved by adopting a more complex rotor design procedure thus making the implementation of power control logics easier the model could be designed to match the full scale performance not only in some discrete conditions but for a wide range of tsrs and rotor pitch angles another possibility for improvement is to include a basic power controller in the rotor optimization and to carry out the design not at reference operating points but at the steady state conditions found at each algorithm iteration 3 3 control system the wind turbine scale model mechatronic solutions described in section 3 1 are combined with an embedded control and monitoring system ecm based on ni labview veristand to achieve a very flexible environment for the implementation of control logics it is well known that pitch to feather control logics traditionally used to regulate power in modern onshore machines may interact with the platform rigid body motion modes causing large amplitude low frequent motions that have a severe impact on the machine fatigue life a variable speed variable pitch to feather vs vp controller whose scheme is shown in fig 8 was derived from the basic dtu wind energy controller hansen and henriksen 2013 and implemented on the wind turbine scale model fontanella et al 2019c to investigate the fowt closed loop dynamics adding data to those collected in few other experimental activities traditional ocean basin tests yu et al 2017 and hil tests bachynski et al 2016 azcona et al 2014 the vs vp controller also represents the starting point for more advanced control logics and the baseline case for the differential evaluation of the related benefits for below rated wind speeds partial load region the controller is designed to operate at the fixed rotor pitch angle β 0 and varying the generator torque q g according to eq 1 to keep the tsr constant for any wind speed 1 q g k g ω g 2 where k g is the optimal mode gain for tracking the maximum power coefficient at a pitch angle β β 0 and ω g is the generator angular speed for above rated wind speeds full load region the generator torque is held constant at q g 0 p 0 ω g 0 where p 0 and ω g 0 are the rated power and generator speed respectively the rotor collective pitch angle is set according to eq 2 as the sum of the output of two proportional integral pi controllers acting on the generator speed error and the mechanical power error 2 β k p ω e ω k i ω e ω d t k p p e p k i p e p d t where the e ω is the generator speed error i

the actual and rated generator mechanical power k p p and k i p the proportional and integral gains of the power pi controller a gain scheduling law is added to adapt the pitch controller gains to the different aerodynamic conditions faced by the rotor the total gain scheduling factor is the product of two terms η a and η n l the first one expressed by eq 3 is the aerodynamic gain scheduling 3 η a 1 1 β β 0 k k 1 β β 0 2 k k 2 where k k 1 and k k 2 are constants obtained from curve fitting of the pitch to torque sensitivity see hansen and henriksen 2013 the second contribution expressed by eq 4 is function of the generator speed error and is added to the previous one to increase the sensitivity of the pitch controller to large speed excursions 4 η n l 1 e ω 2 ω 2 ω g 0 2 where ω 2 is the generator speed where the pitch controller gains are doubled see hansen and henriksen 2013 for further details scaling errors in the rotor inertial properties see table 2 and aerodynamic performance see fig 6 result in the impossibility of controlling the wind turbine scale model with an exactly scaled version of the full scale controller this has some important consequences on the wind tunnel hil experimental methodology and on the outcome of the hybrid tests if the main goal is the validation of a numerical model it is possible to tune the latter to reflect the scale model properties differences in the fowt closed loop response resulting from numerical simulations and wind tunnel tests would then be caused by modeling choices only if instead the main goal of the wind tunnel experiment is the study of the fowt global dynamics the wind turbine controller must be re designed to have the same dynamic behavior expected for the full scale system at model scale the wind turbine model is affected by some scaling errors but when part of the hil system it is implicitly coupled with a perfectly scaled floating platform a wind turbine controller tuned for the full scale system would then determine a coupling between the fowt dofs different from what is expected at full scale the wind turbine model controller gains should then be re tuned to minimize the difference between the closed loop response of the hil floating system and of the target full scale system in this respect a tentative procedure was developed in fontanella et al 2018a through a numerical computational framework 4 the floating platform model the fowt 6 dofs surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw rigid body dynamics is reproduced by the hil numerical model and the real time integration of eq 5 5 m s a q r s q k s q f p l a t f w t where m s is the overall mass matrix of the floating system platform and wind turbine about the rigid body dofs a is the infinite frequency added mass matrix r s is adopted to optionally introduce additional linear damping in the system to match experimental data from ocean basin tests k s is the floating system gravitational and buoyancy stiffness matrix the complete expressions of the above mentioned matrices can be found in the appendix of bayati et al 2018 the external loads on the right hand side of eq 5 are the sum of platform loads f p l a t and wind turbine loads f w t all the quantities above are defined at model scale floating platform loads f p l a t are the sum of different contributions summarized in eq 6 6 f p l a t f r a d q f w e t f v i s c q t f m o o r q q in order to cope with real time execution constraints radiation loads f r a d modeling the memory effect are not implemented by direct calculation of the convolution integral between platform velocities and retardation matrix impulse response bayati et al 2017e but exploiting a state space approximation perez and fossen 2009 duarte 0000 f w e are the first and second order wave excitation loads f v i s c the morison s viscous loads and f m o o r the loads exerted by the mooring system on the floating platform 4 1 mooring lines the mooring system dynamics is implemented in the hil numerical subsystem by means of a lumped mass model this is integrated together with the floating structure model to reproduce the nonlinear mooring system dynamics bayati et al 2018 keeping into account mooring stiffness inertia damping weight buoyancy seabed forces hydrodynamic drag bending and torsional stiffness are neglected as well as seabed friction forces the computation of mooring line forces from the real time integration of a mooring system model was preferred to the use of pre defined look up tables i e pre computed static forces as function of platform displacements and rotations the use of look up tables would require to deploy multidimensional arrays on the hil real time controller and the operation turned out to be unfeasible both in terms of required memory and computational resources for the look up operation moreover the integration of a complete mooring line model allows to take into account the velocity dependent components of mooring line loads like linear and quadratic damping forces that have a non negligible influence in the mooring lines fatigue loads wendt et al 2016 4 2 optimization for real time implementation the floating platform model is optimized with respect to the computational effort required to run in parallel with the physical part of the experiment the number of computations executed in real time has been reduced as a compromise between physical consistency of the model output and computational requirements an extensive discussion of this topic can be found in bayati et al 2018 the main issues that were considered are 1 the number of harmonic components in the irregular wave spectrum the maximum frequency up to which the spectrum is defined and its frequency resolution have a significant impact on the effort for simulating wave loads the frequency resolution is fixed to 0 02 rad s full scale and the upper cut off frequency after which the spectrum is zeroed to 3 3 rad s full scale above this frequency the typical jonswap spectrum is almost negligible in amplitude 2 the number of elements in the platform members for the calculation of viscous forces the element size was adapted based on the vertical distance from the mean sea level bigger elements are used in the lower part of the platform where the gradient of the wave particle velocity is lower 3 the number of nodes in the mooring lines model this is lower that what is used in the most common simulation codes e g hall and goupee 2015 and it was chosen as the best compromise between simulating the mooring line response with good fidelity and low computational effort bayati et al 2018 thank to these approximations the model can be integrated in real time by means of a fourth order runge kutta method and a fixed time step of 0 015 s model scale on a dspace ds1006 3 0 ghz this integration time step is upperly bounded on account of the mooring lines dynamics 5 wind turbine loads measurement wind turbine loads f w t are obtained depriving the wind turbine model tower base loads f t b of the inertial and weight components as described by eq 7 7 f w t f t b f c o r r where f c o r r is the wind turbine model inertia and weight wind turbine loads obtained according to eq 7 include the effect of aerodynamic rotor loads aerodynamic tower loads gyroscopic moments and mechanical rotor loads whereas the reproduction of the wind turbine inertia and weight entirely relies on the numerical model f w t is defined in the local reference system that is considered to be coincident with the global one assuming small rotations 1 1 in any test reported in this work the maximum platform rotation was limited to 5 loads required to perform the operations of eq 7 force correction are expressed by eq 8 and are defined as the inertial and gravitational loads associated with the wind turbine model motion considering the latter a single rigid body eq 8 is based on a linear approximation of the system kinematics where small rotations are considered 8 f c o r r m t q a k t q a where m t and k t are the 6 by 6 wind turbine model mass and gravitational stiffness matrix for the fowt rigid body dofs and q a is the physical wind turbine model actual position translations and rotations as provided by the actuation system actual values are adopted in eq 8 to minimize the effects of small delays coming from system actuation on the calculation of correction forces in this respect the maximum observed actuation delay was in the order of 10 ms which is acceptable considering the frequency range of interest for the physics of the studied system 0 5 hz at model scale the wind turbine tower base position and acceleration must be available at the time instants when the loads are sampled from the tower base dynamometer measuring the wind turbine model 6 dofs position is a very tough task thus a numeric estimation was preferred to direct measurement the actual wind turbine model position and orientation is estimated from the position of the single actuators of the 6 dofs robot solving the non linear forward kinematic equations a fast and efficient real time virtual sensor was realized thanks to a jacobian free monotonic descent algorithm jfmd shen et al 2016 la mura et al 2018a b the parameters inside m t and k t are obtained from experimental identification tests imposing sinusoidal motions to the wind turbine model and measuring the pure inertial and weight loads at tower base the procedure adopted to extract wind turbine loads from the tower base force transducer signals produces better results when inertial and weight loads represent a small fraction of the overall measurements when operating in a constant laminar wind field this is in general true for the surge force and pitch moment mostly related to the wind turbine rotor thrust but not for sway and heave forces roll and pitch moment that are negligible with respect to the respective inertial and weight loads fontanella et al 2019b tower base measurements are also affected by the wind turbine scale model aeroelastic response mainly associated with the first fore aft tower mode the contributions due to flexibility must be removed from force measurements by proper filtering so to leave only aerodynamic loads and inertial and weight loads due to the rigid body motion of the wind turbine model with the current methodology the force correction procedure is necessary and it is not possible to rely on the pure tower base loads for hil force feedback being the scaled system not based on froude similitude and the acceleration scale factor different from 1 see table 1 it would be necessary to perform experiments in presence of a gravity acceleration different from 9 81 m s 2 i e 81 75 m s 2 to measure the correctly scaled wind turbine weight moreover the fraction of tower base loads associated with the wind turbine model inertia is not a correct reproduction of the full scale system inertia since the model mass and mass distribution are not correctly scaled see table 2 the first issue is more significant than the second one since as already seen the model mass is still very close to target whereas the error on gravity acceleration is large by performing hil wind tunnel tests at froude scale it would be possible to get rid of the force correction procedure and use pure tower base loads for hil feedback accepting the small error in the reproduction of wind turbine inertial forces that would then be produced by the physical scale model in this way it would be possible to avoid all the problems related to force correction and to reproduce the coupling between wind turbine flexible modes and platform modes however froude scaling would imply to operate at very low wind speeds and reynolds numbers penalizing the rotor design and the reproduction of aerodynamic loads thus partially wasting the main advantage of wind tunnel hil tests 6 the hexafloat robot the hil numerical and physical subsystems are coupled by means of the hexafloat 6 dofs parallel kinematic machine pkm that provides the required motions to the wind turbine model this task implies challenges both from mechanical and control points of view that were faced according to the workflow in fig 9 the general architecture of the machine was chosen to meet requirements in terms of workspace dimensions dynamic performances stiffness position accuracy and compactness low height from the floor to keep the wind turbine model rotor far from the wind tunnel ceiling la mura et al 2018b among well known 6 dofs pkm examples a completely customized architecture shown in fig 10 was designed and optimized based on the requirements of this specific application bayati et al 2014 giberti and ferrari 2015 the 6 prismatic universal spherical pus custom topology resulting from a genetic optimization ferrari and giberti 2014 is moved by ball screw axes arranged in radial symmetric couples the use of a pkm configuration also has some drawbacks like workspace anisotropy only partially mitigated by the radial symmetric topology pose dependent stiffness and modal behavior large weight and low encumbrance to work volume ratio some of these aspects influenced the design process and control development as detailed in the next sections 6 1 design and dimensioning the machine desired trajectory is the result of the hil numerical model real time integration thus it is not known in advance and due to non linear parallel kinematics it is very difficult to evaluate which workspace dof motion combination is the most demanding for the actuators a systematic procedure based on monte carlo method anon 2011 fiore et al 2017 giberti et al 2018 and a multibody model fiore et al 2016 was implemented for the sizing and dimensioning of the mechanical components of the 6 dofs robot the pkm must ensure low dynamic disturbances to minimize delays to preserve the wind turbine model aeroelastic vibration modes and to actively manage any potentially dangerous source of alteration of the hil control loop the influence of the robot dynamics on the hil system was assessed through simulated and experimental modal analyses also considering the influence of the hexafloat control system results showed that tracking performances are not affected by the robot dynamics inside the desired system bandwidth whereas the robot control dynamics has a non negligible influence on the preservation of the wind turbine model aeroelastic response the force correction procedure and the hil force feedback impose two major requirements on the hexafloat design the robot motors have to be tuned to avoid any coupling with the wind turbine scale model flexible modes and an unwanted structural excitation the force feedback calculation procedure requires to know the actual position and acceleration of the wind turbine tower base in real time that is obtained relying on a jfmd algorithm a reliable virtual representation of the complete machine equipped with the real low level control algorithms digital twin was created for fine control tuning to study the system response under realistic dynamic loads and to test high level control algorithms to understand their effects on the turbine motion raineri et al 2018 6 2 electronics and control design the core of the hexafloat electronics is a delta tau data systems power pmac motion controller real time performance and safety requirements led to the design of a multilevel control software la mura et al 2018b a underneath this primary and secondary state machines manage all the main functionalities of the system at the lowest level of the control system are the position and velocity servo loops setting the analog torque reference for the servo actuators high level control modalities were developed to respect the desired real time performance and safety requirements some advanced tools were designed such as set point buffering with time based control active delay control allowing motion look ahead for smooth trajectory blending non linear forward kinematics acting like a virtual pose sensor workspace boundaries check with controlled dynamics on the limits la mura et al 2018a acceleration saturation with workspace reference tracking asc the experimental campaigns proved the control system effectiveness under the most demanding working conditions high and low level algorithms are very effective at managing all the challenging aspects of this complex hil setup such as motion smoothness inertial loads bearing acquisition performances transparency la mura et al 2018b and workspace monitoring 7 experimental results the potentialities of the experimental methodology presented in this paper are demonstrated through a sample of results from a test campaign about a 10mw fowt that was carried out within the lifes50 project the main aim of the tests was to assess the fowt global response in different wind and wave conditions and to understand how the wind turbine controller interacts with the platform rigid body motion modes at different wind speeds experiments were repeated for four different operating conditions corresponding to still air no wind a mean wind speed of 10 m s below 1 wind turbine working at partial loads 18 m s and 25 m s above 1 and above 2 wind turbine working at full load 7 1 description of the reference floating system the 10mw fowt object of the experimental campaign is constituted by the oo star wind floater semi submersible platform and the dtu 10mw rwt an image of the floating wind turbine concept is shown in fig 11 the platform consists of a star shaped pontoon connecting a central column and three outer columns the structure is built out of post tensioned concrete the mooring system is a catenary system with three mooring lines the main parameters of the wind turbine are summarized in table 2 those of the floating platform in table 3 the wind turbine is controlled according to the vs vp control strategy described is section 3 3 the controller parameters chosen according to the procedure described in fontanella et al 2019c are reported in table 4 7 2 free decay tests free decay tests were carried out to characterize the linearized dynamics of the platform surge and platform pitch dofs in still air and for different laminar wind conditions experiments were performed alternatively imposing an initial offset with respect to the static equilibrium position to the platform surge 4 5 m or pitch 3 5 dof and allowing the system to come at rest the natural period and damping ratio for the two platform modes were extracted from the analysis of the response of the dof subjected to the initial condition and are reported in table 5 the platform pitch response in above 2 conditions was critically damped and the evaluation of period and damping ratio is not applicable the natural period and damping ratio for still air are comparable to those observed in ocean basin tests anon 2019 especially when considering the surge response in this respect it is worth mentioning that observed deviations in the damping ratio may be ascribed to non perfect actuation and measurement chains bayati et al 2020 the platform surge and pitch dofs response for an imposed surge or pitch offset and different wind conditions is shown in fig 12 and fig 13 respectively in the plots the steady state response is subtracted from the signals among the six rigid body platform modes surge and pitch are the most strongly coupled with the wind turbine drivetrain mode and controller action fontanella et al 2018b as highlighted by table 5 the linearized properties of the two modes show large variations for different wind conditions the surge mode period and damping decrease when the wind turbine is operating their lowest value is recorded for the slightly above rated wind and an increment is seen for wind speeds approaching cut off the pitch mode period decreases in below rated condition where maximum damping is achieved in above rated conditions both period and damping are lower but still greater than in still air 7 3 irregular wave tests irregular waves from the jonswap spectrum significant height h s 7 7 m peak spectral period t p 12 4 s with no misalignment were run to assess the fowt response in still air and for different laminar wind conditions in presence of a stochastic non linear hydrodynamic excitation the power spectral density psd of the platform surge and pitch is analyzed together with the psd of rotor speed and collective blade pitch angle i e the wind turbine controller feedback and control action in full load in fig 14 which includes colored vertical lines to highlight some important frequencies of the fowt the red line marks the platform surge and the green line the platform pitch frequency in still air as measured in free decay experiments i e the inverse of the natural periods t n of table 5 the blue line highlights the rotor 1p frequency as already seen for free decays the response of the platform surge and platform pitch dofs is strongly coupled with the wind turbine controller action the low frequency motion is dominated by the surge mode response that shows a variable amplitude for different operating conditions in particular in presence of wind and an operating rotor the response amplitude at the surge frequency is higher and the surge mode period is lower the peak of the low frequency response is maximum in above 1 and decreases in above 2 conditions in agreement with the result of free decay tests the platform response at higher frequencies and in particular in the wave frequency range shows little to no dependence on the operating condition since hydrodynamic loads are predominant on rotor loads the platform motion at the surge mode period causes a variation of the relative wind speed seen by the turbine rotor that translates into a low frequency varying aerodynamic torque this results into strong rotor speed oscillations at the surge mode frequency the amplitude of the rotor speed psd at surge frequency is maximum and presents similar values in below and above 1 conditions whereas it decreases in above 2 conditions as said for above rated wind speeds the rotor collective pitch angle is the main control input and rotor speed oscillations at the surge mode frequency make the wind turbine blades pitching at the same frequency the amplitude of rotor speed oscillations caused by platform motions induced by linear wave loads is lower than at low frequency being the high frequency variation of aerodynamic torque filtered by rotor inertia finally both the psd of rotor speed and rotor pitch show a peak at the 1p frequency associated with rotor mechanical and aerodynamic imbalance the psd of the other platform dofs response is shown in fig 15 for the same operating conditions considered in fig 14 also in this case vertical red green and blue lines highlight the platform surge platform pitch and rotor 1p frequencies respectively the heave response is dominated by wave loads and does not show any significant dependence on the wind turbine operating condition the other dofs response is excited by misaligned waves imbalanced wind speeds on the rotor swept area mechanical imbalances and gyroscopic moments fontanella et al 2019b in the analyzed tests cases that were performed under a constant laminar wind with no misalignment the response of the sway roll and yaw dofs is very small 8 conclusions this paper presented the hil methodology to test fowts in the polimi wind tunnel exploiting the characteristics of the facility to better investigate the effects of unsteady aerodynamics and the interaction between wind turbine controller and overall platform dynamics to this end a wind turbine scale model with realistic control capabilities is combined with a numerical model of the floating platform the real time coupling between the two subsystems is based on the measurement of aerodynamic loads at the model tower base and on a 6 dofs robot that moves the wind turbine according to the displacements obtained from the numerical model integration the wind tunnel hil methodology has some noticeable advantages with respect to other experimental methodologies for research about fowts in particular the airflow quality the possibility to reproduce turbulence and wind shear across the whole test chamber and to use large wind turbine scale models all the aspects make possible to better simulate the interaction between wind turbine controller structure wind and wave loads in this respect the wind tunnel hil methodology presented in this paper can be addressed as a useful tool for validating fowt simulation models focused on the wind turbine unsteady aerodynamics for the experimental verification of complex control logics and for the study of floating wind farms where it is fundamental to reproduce the effects of the upstream wind turbine wake on the downwind ones the wind tunnel hil methodology was applied to a floating concept formed by the dtu 10mw rwt and the semisubmersible oo star wind floater to better show its main potentialities and drawbacks its effectiveness lies in the fidelity of the two subsystems and the quality of the measurement and actuation chains realizing the coupling between them the methodology still has some limitations that were analyzed in this work even if the dimensions of the polimi wind tunnel allowed to design a large scale model the size reduction imposed some hard constraints on the wind turbine scaling in terms of an unavoidable reynolds number reduction a low reynolds rotor was designed trying to match the full scale wind turbine aerodynamic performance with the actual inflow conditions achieved inside the wind tunnel the rotor thrust force that sets the fowt aero hydro elastic response is highly comparable between the scale model and the dtu 10mw however some discrepancies are still present especially in the rotor power wind turbine loads are not directly measured by a physical sensor but are instead estimated depriving tower base loads of the inertial and weight components the procedure requires the knowledge of the wind turbine scale model geometry and inertial properties and any uncertainty on these quantities directly translates into errors in the estimated wind turbine loads at the time of this work it is possible to extract with good accuracy only the surge force and pitch moment that are large with respect to the associated inertial and weight components the extraction of sway and heave forces roll and yaw moments that are small when considering constant uniform wind conditions and in presence of small wind wave misalignments is still difficult moreover it was not possible to respect mass and aeroelastic requirements because the model construction relied on commercial components and resulted in a rotor nacelle assembly heavier than expected this hinders the reproduction of the tower flexible response requiring to add filters to cancel out the harmonics components associated with tower flexibility from the wind turbine loads measurement since those may destabilize the hil system improvements are expected to be achieved modifying the wind turbine scale model and adopting more sophisticated mechatronic solutions in any case high fidelity model testing is currently used only in the final design phases of fowts for the verification and optimization of the complete system to overcome the limitations of classical testing it is possible to rely on hybrid methodologies and results from experiments in different facilities can be combined to obtain more accurate results thys et al 2019 it is of fundamental importance to recognize the complementarity of numerical modeling field testing and scale model experiments with particular focus on the different physical aspects i e hydrodynamics in ocean basins wind turbine control and aerodynamics in wind tunnels for making the entire process behind the study of fowts reliable joint activities are currently promoted by the wind energy research community to define how to best complement the different testing methodologies developed so far the scientific community still lacks of a common strategy to systematically investigate the different challenges related to floating offshore wind energy systems the accuracy level of the different methodologies in relation to their capabilities still have to be assessed in order to provide more reliable best practices and guidelines for the design to this aim round robin tests could be valuably adopted not only for numerical model validation but also for assessing the experimental

21753,this paper is intended to present the authors know how about hybrid hardware in the loop hil wind tunnel testing of floating offshore wind turbines fowts that was acquired in the last decade through a very intense activity numerical codes commonly used within the scientific community to study fowts show significant uncertainties with respect to the prediction of some phenomena peculiar of these systems like the rotor wind dynamic interaction or the coupling between the machine controller and the low frequency rigid body motion modes of the platform a hybrid hil methodology was developed by the authors to exploit the unique characteristics of the politecnico di milano wind tunnel to collect data useful to improve the existing knowledge about the above mentioned scientific questions keywords floating offshore wind turbine hil wind tunnel scale model testing control 1 introduction in the beginning of the last decade floating offshore wind energy was a pioneering technology characterized by small scale prototypes driscoll et al 2016 roddier et al 2010 with recent commercial projects and the construction of the first floating offshore wind farm floating offshore wind energy is nowadays more than a merely potential market as it was considered in the past attracting great research development engineering and business efforts to decrease the cost of energy and to reach subsidy free projects and investments floating offshore wind turbines fowts are designed and studied relying on numerical simulation tools that must be validated by computations and experiments van kuik et al 2016 in the last decade many projects have been dedicated to the verification of numerical codes both through code to code and numerical experimental comparisons robertson et al 2017 popko et al 2018 and all of them evidenced a great dispersion of results uncertainties emerged from the past testing experiences shown the lack of reliable databases to understand these differences prototype testing is affected by the well known problems of full scale experiments environmental conditions cannot be controlled nor precisely described and the generality of the resulting data is often not completely asserted long times and high costs are often involved in many cases the size of recent fowt prototypes was also not significant with respect to the floating systems considered in commercial projects further lowering the generality of experimental data scale model testing can complement full scale experiments under many aspects providing low uncertainty data at a reasonable cost while widening the variety of dynamic conditions that are investigated in a fully controlled environment fowts scale model experiments require to simultaneously reproduce phenomena that are governed by very different physics to this purpose hybrid techniques were recently proposed to alleviate the limitations of traditional ocean basin tests where the fowt is reproduced by a scale model with the physical generation of wind and waves koo et al 2014 goupee et al 2014 kimball et al 2014 robertson et al 2013 in hardware in the loop hil tests the floating structure is divided into two complementary substructures either reproduced by a physical scale model or through a real time numerical model and an actuation system in ocean basin hil tests a physical model of the floating platform and wind turbine tower is combined with an actuation system tendons sauder et al 2016 bachynski et al 2016 winches gueydon et al 2018 ducted fans azcona et al 2014 vittori et al 2018 or multi fan systems battistella et al 2018 that is demanded to simulate rotor loads the physical reproduction of wave forces and platform response in a froude scaled environment makes ocean basin hil tests a key tool for the validation of hydrodynamic codes and for the investigation of the complex nature of low frequency non linear hydrodynamic loads cause of large platform motions hil sil ocean basin hybrid methodologies are however limited in the correct simulation of the aerodynamic loads associated with the wind turbine rotor even if the numerical rotor model used to compute forces is validated on the base of wind tunnel data bayati et al 2016b uncertainties are likely introduced in rotor loads by the hil measurement and actuation chains a complementary hybrid hil technique was developed at politecnico di milano polimi in order to perform wind tunnel tests of fowts taking advantage of the polimi wind tunnel galleria del vento politecnico di milano gvpm galleria del vento politecnico di milano 0000 in this case aerodynamic and rotor loads included those associated with the wind turbine controller action are reproduced by a physical scale model and combined with numerically computed hydrodynamic and wave loads for the real time integration of the platform rigid body motion the resulting displacements are imposed to the wind turbine model by means of a 6 degrees of freedom dofs parallel kinematic robot the possibility of operating at relatively high reynolds numbers and under a controlled inflow make wind tunnel hil tests the best tool to investigate how unsteady aerodynamic loads and wind turbine control logics impact the overall dynamics of the floating structure this paper is intended to give an insight into the hybrid hil methodology developed by the authors to perform wind tunnel tests about floating offshore wind turbines the hil setup is presented focusing on the definition of the scaling laws on which experiments are based then the physical subsystem the wind turbine scale model the numerical subsystem the floating platform model the hil force feedback and the 6 dofs robot are briefly described discussing the most significant choices made by the authors finally some results from a recent experimental campaign carried out in the framework of the h2020 lifes50 project lifes50 0000 are reported to show the typical outcome of hil wind tunnel tests 2 the hil system the polimi hil methodology is presented here with reference to the wind tunnel test campaign that was performed within the h2020 lifes50 research project fontanella et al 2019d the aim of the project was to qualify up to a technology readiness level trl of 5 two innovative substructure designs for 10mw wind turbines also making use of experimental data from hybrid hil ocean basin and wind tunnel tests the wind tunnel hil methodology is considered here applied to a floating system formed by the dtu 10mw reference wind turbine rwt bak et al 2013 and the oo star wind floater muller et al 2013 however its validity is general and the same techniques were also applied by the authors to other fowt concepts bayati et al 2017e fontanella et al 2019a the hil setup is shown in fig 1 and the control scheme of the system adopted for experiments is reported in fig 2 a wind turbine scale model is used to reproduce the rotor dynamics and the aerodynamic loads associated with the tower and the spinning rotor the wind turbine model is also featured by a complex mechatronic system that allows the implementation of wind turbine control logics representative of those used in modern machines the floating platform rigid body dynamics mooring line dynamics and hydrodynamic loads are introduced in the experiment through the real time integration of a numerical model the physical and numerical models are tied together by the hil measurement and actuation systems the forces associated with the wind turbine model are measured at tower base by a 6 components dynamometer the load reduction point of the transducer is ideally coincident with the connection point between tower and platform and are fed to the numerical model the numerical model is then integrated assuming as input the numerically computed hydrodynamic loads and the measured wind turbine loads computing the translations and rotations of the wind turbine tower base that are imposed to the scale model by a 6 dofs parallel kinematic robot hexafloat 2 1 scale factors the set of parameters required for the wind tunnel hil experiments was computed by scaling the corresponding quantities defined for the full scale floating system the scale factors needed for the calculations defined as the ratio between a given quantity evaluated for the scaled and full scale systems were obtained by independently fixing the length and velocity scale factors and deriving those relative to any other quantity of interest from dimensional analysis the length scale factor λ l was set by comparing the dtu 10mw specifications with the dimensions of the atmospheric boundary layer test section of the polimi wind tunnel 36 m length 14 m width and 4 m height as shown in table 1 the length scale factor directly impacts the mass requirements and the reynolds number for the wind turbine scale model it was fixed to 1 75 to have the largest possible rotor and avoid an excessive miniaturization of model components while limiting the blockage effect on the other hand since a maximum wind speed of 15 m s can be reached in laminar flow in the atmospheric boundary layer test section the velocity scale factor λ v was set to 1 3 to cover the entire dtu 10mw wind speed operating range limiting the reynolds number discrepancy with respect to full scale even with these scaling factors the reynolds number at model scale is more than two order of magnitude lower than at full scale as explained in section 3 2 this required to re design the wind turbine rotor choosing a different airfoil to correctly reproduce the aerodynamic forces of the full scale wind turbine in combination with the length scale factor λ l λ v sets the frequency scale λ ω that gives the performance requirements for the model actuators and natural frequencies of the aeroelastic components setting λ v to 1 3 also results in not too strict mechatronics and structural design constraints the complete set of scale factors for the wind turbine model and hil experiments derived from λ l and λ v is reported in table 1 3 the wind turbine scale model the wind turbine scale model wtm of the 1 75 dtu 10mw rwt bayati et al 2017c is featured by advanced mechatronic solutions bayati et al 2016a that were conceived to emulate the main control capabilities of a real wind turbine while respecting the very strict mass constraints imposed by the chosen scaling laws the rotor of the model was re designed with respect to full scale specifications to have correctly scaled aerodynamic loads operating at the reynolds numbers met inside the wind tunnel 3 1 mechatronic design the target properties for the wind turbine scale model reported in table 2 were easily derived by scaling the dtu 10mw rwt specifications according to the scale factors in table 1 it seems that the mass scale factor represents a strong constraint for the model even more strict considering that it is necessary to rely on commercial electronic components to implement the same control capabilities of a modern multi megawatt machine for the above mentioned reasons the scale model design was mainly driven by weight requirements and was headed on finding the best arrangement for the different components and the optimal design for in house realized parts in order to ensure the required functionalities while reducing masses in these regards some interesting elements of innovation were introduced with respect to the standard configuration of real wind turbines the exploded view and final assembly of the wtm nacelle and rotor are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively a hollow low speed shaft whose axis is misaligned with respect to the one of the high speed shaft allows the passage of the slip ring cables required to supply power and control signals to the rotating electronics i e the three pitch motors and their control boards the correct positioning of the two shafts is ensured by a u shaped support structure realized in carbon fiber reinforced plastic to be light and stiff cross roller bearings were adopted to withstand the high bending moments on the shafts saving space and weight in comparison to common double ball bearing solutions the torque unit is a maxon ec 4 pole 30 brushless motor with an integrated planetary gear connected to the low speed shaft through a belt transmission two carbon fiber reinforced plastic plates were used to realize the stiff and light hub structure where the individual pitch control ipc system and the related electronics are housed the ipc system is based on three harmonic drive rsf 5b 30 e050 c driven by maxon epos 24 2 motion controllers the wtm design proved to be very sound both from a structural and functional point of view and the model was successfully used for various wind tunnel test campaigns looking at table 2 it can be noticed that model masses still exceed the scaled target the only possibility to further reduce them is to design lighter structural components but this may be counterproductive structural components are impacting weight only for a small fraction being electronics and bearings the heaviest parts in the model a lighter structure would then result in small weight savings at the expense of a lower structural resistance and further complexity in operating the model e g in assembling and maintenance operations it is also to be considered that the model masses are not so meaningful when the wtm is used to reproduce aerodynamic loads only leaving the simulation of wind turbine weight and inertial loads to the hil numerical model pitch actuators were dimensioned neglecting the blade aerodynamic pitch moment assuming inertial loads to be dominant however experimental tests highlighted that the aerodynamic pitch moment can be significant in certain test conditions and this proved to be a constraint for the implementation of rotor pitch control logics 3 2 aerodynamic design the adoption of the scale factors of table 1 resulted in a reynolds number for the wind turbine model 225 times lower than at full scale that required to re design the wind turbine rotor to reproduce correctly its aerodynamic loads the aerodynamic design is deeply discussed in bayati et al 2017b and it was focused on minimizing the difference between the scale model and full scale thrust coefficient the sd7032 airfoil was used in place of the ffa w3 series airfoils of the rwt since its lower thickness makes it less sensible to flow separation the design procedure is based on the blade element approach and is aimed at defining the thickness over chord ratio t c and twist angle distribution of the scale model blade in common working conditions the rotor thrust is mostly related to the blade lift force and thus the blade geometry was selected to match the lift force and lift derivative with respect to the flow angle for any blade section the last requirement is necessary to ensure that the unsteady behavior of the wind turbine is well reproduced by the model the outputs of the optimization procedure are reported in fig 5 in terms of chord twist t c ratio and section shape for different non dimensional radial positions the aerodynamic performance of the wtm rotor can be analyzed looking at the power coefficient c p that impacts the implementation of any wind turbine power regulation control logic and thrust coefficient c t since the correct reproduction of the thrust force is of great importance in fowt testing the scale model power and thrust coefficients were experimentally measured for different combinations of tip speed ratio tsr λ and rotor collective blade pitch angle β tests were performed in a laminar wind field with a constant wind speed of 4 m s and the tsr was varied by adjusting the rotor speed in fig 6 the scale model aerodynamic coefficients extracted from steady state measurements of the tower top 6 components force transducer are compared to the corresponding values resulting from the fast jonkman and marshall 2005 model of the dtu 10mw rwt as visible the scale model and rwt performances are close but some differences are present in particular for the power coefficient for low values of tsr the scale model c p curves are convex and lower than the target ones especially for small pitch angles the wtm peak power coefficient for β 0 is 0 54 0 48 for the dtu 10mw and it is reached at a tsr λ 8 26 which is slightly greater than the target one 7 5 for the dtu 10mw for intermediate values of tsr the slope of the power coefficient characteristics is the same for the model and the rwt however for the first one a pitch angle variation results in a larger c p variation the wtm c t that was the main objective of the rotor optimal design process is closer to the dtu 10mw target the scale model curves are slightly steeper and approximate very well those of the rwt for intermediate tsr values some differences are evident for small pitch angles and high tsrs the wind turbine model c t is very close to the dtu 10mw one around λ 7 5 and β 0 i e the nominal tsr and pitch angle for the full scale wind turbine in below rated conditions that are the rotor settings considered in the design procedure differences are more evident for other combinations of λ and β but model curves still remain close enough to the full scale target when the main goal of the experiments is to study the rotor thrust force the wind turbine model is operated imposing the rotor pitch angle and angular speed i e excluding any closed loop control logic to match at any wind condition of interest the target thrust force the reproduction of power capture is sacrificed for thrust force and any influence of the wind turbine controller on the fowt is neglected this operating mode was successfully used to investigate the unsteady thrust force and wind turbine wake bayati et al 2017d a when the wind turbine controller has to be included in the experiment the full scale control logic is modified to accommodate the differences between the scale model and full scale machine rotor aerodynamics especially of power coefficient the low c p value experienced for small tsrs makes the wind turbine start up process difficult an ad hoc start up logic was included to maximize power and facilitate the start up in above rated conditions where rotor speed is regulated to its rated value and the tsr is consequently low the low c p results into a pitch angle request lower than target to this purpose it is possible to track the reference rotor power obtaining a lower thrust force in reason of the lower pitch angle or to track the reference thrust modifying the power set point to make the rotor operating at higher tsr values thrust force has a significant impact on the response of an fowt and the thrust force coefficient derivatives with respect to tsr and rotor pitch angle can provide information about the coupling between the wind turbine controller rotor aerodynamics and platform motion for this reason it is important to correctly scale not only the thrust coefficient but also its derivatives the thrust coefficient derivatives with respect to tsr and rotor pitch for the polimi wtm and for the dtu 10mw are compared in fig 7 as seen the derivatives for the model are quite close to the reference both in terms of values and trends in future designs the wind turbine scale model aerodynamic performance could be improved by adopting a more complex rotor design procedure thus making the implementation of power control logics easier the model could be designed to match the full scale performance not only in some discrete conditions but for a wide range of tsrs and rotor pitch angles another possibility for improvement is to include a basic power controller in the rotor optimization and to carry out the design not at reference operating points but at the steady state conditions found at each algorithm iteration 3 3 control system the wind turbine scale model mechatronic solutions described in section 3 1 are combined with an embedded control and monitoring system ecm based on ni labview veristand to achieve a very flexible environment for the implementation of control logics it is well known that pitch to feather control logics traditionally used to regulate power in modern onshore machines may interact with the platform rigid body motion modes causing large amplitude low frequent motions that have a severe impact on the machine fatigue life a variable speed variable pitch to feather vs vp controller whose scheme is shown in fig 8 was derived from the basic dtu wind energy controller hansen and henriksen 2013 and implemented on the wind turbine scale model fontanella et al 2019c to investigate the fowt closed loop dynamics adding data to those collected in few other experimental activities traditional ocean basin tests yu et al 2017 and hil tests bachynski et al 2016 azcona et al 2014 the vs vp controller also represents the starting point for more advanced control logics and the baseline case for the differential evaluation of the related benefits for below rated wind speeds partial load region the controller is designed to operate at the fixed rotor pitch angle β 0 and varying the generator torque q g according to eq 1 to keep the tsr constant for any wind speed 1 q g k g ω g 2 where k g is the optimal mode gain for tracking the maximum power coefficient at a pitch angle β β 0 and ω g is the generator angular speed for above rated wind speeds full load region the generator torque is held constant at q g 0 p 0 ω g 0 where p 0 and ω g 0 are the rated power and generator speed respectively the rotor collective pitch angle is set according to eq 2 as the sum of the output of two proportional integral pi controllers acting on the generator speed error and the mechanical power error 2 β k p ω e ω k i ω e ω d t k p p e p k i p e p d t where the e ω is the generator speed error i

the actual and rated generator mechanical power k p p and k i p the proportional and integral gains of the power pi controller a gain scheduling law is added to adapt the pitch controller gains to the different aerodynamic conditions faced by the rotor the total gain scheduling factor is the product of two terms η a and η n l the first one expressed by eq 3 is the aerodynamic gain scheduling 3 η a 1 1 β β 0 k k 1 β β 0 2 k k 2 where k k 1 and k k 2 are constants obtained from curve fitting of the pitch to torque sensitivity see hansen and henriksen 2013 the second contribution expressed by eq 4 is function of the generator speed error and is added to the previous one to increase the sensitivity of the pitch controller to large speed excursions 4 η n l 1 e ω 2 ω 2 ω g 0 2 where ω 2 is the generator speed where the pitch controller gains are doubled see hansen and henriksen 2013 for further details scaling errors in the rotor inertial properties see table 2 and aerodynamic performance see fig 6 result in the impossibility of controlling the wind turbine scale model with an exactly scaled version of the full scale controller this has some important consequences on the wind tunnel hil experimental methodology and on the outcome of the hybrid tests if the main goal is the validation of a numerical model it is possible to tune the latter to reflect the scale model properties differences in the fowt closed loop response resulting from numerical simulations and wind tunnel tests would then be caused by modeling choices only if instead the main goal of the wind tunnel experiment is the study of the fowt global dynamics the wind turbine controller must be re designed to have the same dynamic behavior expected for the full scale system at model scale the wind turbine model is affected by some scaling errors but when part of the hil system it is implicitly coupled with a perfectly scaled floating platform a wind turbine controller tuned for the full scale system would then determine a coupling between the fowt dofs different from what is expected at full scale the wind turbine model controller gains should then be re tuned to minimize the difference between the closed loop response of the hil floating system and of the target full scale system in this respect a tentative procedure was developed in fontanella et al 2018a through a numerical computational framework 4 the floating platform model the fowt 6 dofs surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw rigid body dynamics is reproduced by the hil numerical model and the real time integration of eq 5 5 m s a q r s q k s q f p l a t f w t where m s is the overall mass matrix of the floating system platform and wind turbine about the rigid body dofs a is the infinite frequency added mass matrix r s is adopted to optionally introduce additional linear damping in the system to match experimental data from ocean basin tests k s is the floating system gravitational and buoyancy stiffness matrix the complete expressions of the above mentioned matrices can be found in the appendix of bayati et al 2018 the external loads on the right hand side of eq 5 are the sum of platform loads f p l a t and wind turbine loads f w t all the quantities above are defined at model scale floating platform loads f p l a t are the sum of different contributions summarized in eq 6 6 f p l a t f r a d q f w e t f v i s c q t f m o o r q q in order to cope with real time execution constraints radiation loads f r a d modeling the memory effect are not implemented by direct calculation of the convolution integral between platform velocities and retardation matrix impulse response bayati et al 2017e but exploiting a state space approximation perez and fossen 2009 duarte 0000 f w e are the first and second order wave excitation loads f v i s c the morison s viscous loads and f m o o r the loads exerted by the mooring system on the floating platform 4 1 mooring lines the mooring system dynamics is implemented in the hil numerical subsystem by means of a lumped mass model this is integrated together with the floating structure model to reproduce the nonlinear mooring system dynamics bayati et al 2018 keeping into account mooring stiffness inertia damping weight buoyancy seabed forces hydrodynamic drag bending and torsional stiffness are neglected as well as seabed friction forces the computation of mooring line forces from the real time integration of a mooring system model was preferred to the use of pre defined look up tables i e pre computed static forces as function of platform displacements and rotations the use of look up tables would require to deploy multidimensional arrays on the hil real time controller and the operation turned out to be unfeasible both in terms of required memory and computational resources for the look up operation moreover the integration of a complete mooring line model allows to take into account the velocity dependent components of mooring line loads like linear and quadratic damping forces that have a non negligible influence in the mooring lines fatigue loads wendt et al 2016 4 2 optimization for real time implementation the floating platform model is optimized with respect to the computational effort required to run in parallel with the physical part of the experiment the number of computations executed in real time has been reduced as a compromise between physical consistency of the model output and computational requirements an extensive discussion of this topic can be found in bayati et al 2018 the main issues that were considered are 1 the number of harmonic components in the irregular wave spectrum the maximum frequency up to which the spectrum is defined and its frequency resolution have a significant impact on the effort for simulating wave loads the frequency resolution is fixed to 0 02 rad s full scale and the upper cut off frequency after which the spectrum is zeroed to 3 3 rad s full scale above this frequency the typical jonswap spectrum is almost negligible in amplitude 2 the number of elements in the platform members for the calculation of viscous forces the element size was adapted based on the vertical distance from the mean sea level bigger elements are used in the lower part of the platform where the gradient of the wave particle velocity is lower 3 the number of nodes in the mooring lines model this is lower that what is used in the most common simulation codes e g hall and goupee 2015 and it was chosen as the best compromise between simulating the mooring line response with good fidelity and low computational effort bayati et al 2018 thank to these approximations the model can be integrated in real time by means of a fourth order runge kutta method and a fixed time step of 0 015 s model scale on a dspace ds1006 3 0 ghz this integration time step is upperly bounded on account of the mooring lines dynamics 5 wind turbine loads measurement wind turbine loads f w t are obtained depriving the wind turbine model tower base loads f t b of the inertial and weight components as described by eq 7 7 f w t f t b f c o r r where f c o r r is the wind turbine model inertia and weight wind turbine loads obtained according to eq 7 include the effect of aerodynamic rotor loads aerodynamic tower loads gyroscopic moments and mechanical rotor loads whereas the reproduction of the wind turbine inertia and weight entirely relies on the numerical model f w t is defined in the local reference system that is considered to be coincident with the global one assuming small rotations 1 1 in any test reported in this work the maximum platform rotation was limited to 5 loads required to perform the operations of eq 7 force correction are expressed by eq 8 and are defined as the inertial and gravitational loads associated with the wind turbine model motion considering the latter a single rigid body eq 8 is based on a linear approximation of the system kinematics where small rotations are considered 8 f c o r r m t q a k t q a where m t and k t are the 6 by 6 wind turbine model mass and gravitational stiffness matrix for the fowt rigid body dofs and q a is the physical wind turbine model actual position translations and rotations as provided by the actuation system actual values are adopted in eq 8 to minimize the effects of small delays coming from system actuation on the calculation of correction forces in this respect the maximum observed actuation delay was in the order of 10 ms which is acceptable considering the frequency range of interest for the physics of the studied system 0 5 hz at model scale the wind turbine tower base position and acceleration must be available at the time instants when the loads are sampled from the tower base dynamometer measuring the wind turbine model 6 dofs position is a very tough task thus a numeric estimation was preferred to direct measurement the actual wind turbine model position and orientation is estimated from the position of the single actuators of the 6 dofs robot solving the non linear forward kinematic equations a fast and efficient real time virtual sensor was realized thanks to a jacobian free monotonic descent algorithm jfmd shen et al 2016 la mura et al 2018a b the parameters inside m t and k t are obtained from experimental identification tests imposing sinusoidal motions to the wind turbine model and measuring the pure inertial and weight loads at tower base the procedure adopted to extract wind turbine loads from the tower base force transducer signals produces better results when inertial and weight loads represent a small fraction of the overall measurements when operating in a constant laminar wind field this is in general true for the surge force and pitch moment mostly related to the wind turbine rotor thrust but not for sway and heave forces roll and pitch moment that are negligible with respect to the respective inertial and weight loads fontanella et al 2019b tower base measurements are also affected by the wind turbine scale model aeroelastic response mainly associated with the first fore aft tower mode the contributions due to flexibility must be removed from force measurements by proper filtering so to leave only aerodynamic loads and inertial and weight loads due to the rigid body motion of the wind turbine model with the current methodology the force correction procedure is necessary and it is not possible to rely on the pure tower base loads for hil force feedback being the scaled system not based on froude similitude and the acceleration scale factor different from 1 see table 1 it would be necessary to perform experiments in presence of a gravity acceleration different from 9 81 m s 2 i e 81 75 m s 2 to measure the correctly scaled wind turbine weight moreover the fraction of tower base loads associated with the wind turbine model inertia is not a correct reproduction of the full scale system inertia since the model mass and mass distribution are not correctly scaled see table 2 the first issue is more significant than the second one since as already seen the model mass is still very close to target whereas the error on gravity acceleration is large by performing hil wind tunnel tests at froude scale it would be possible to get rid of the force correction procedure and use pure tower base loads for hil feedback accepting the small error in the reproduction of wind turbine inertial forces that would then be produced by the physical scale model in this way it would be possible to avoid all the problems related to force correction and to reproduce the coupling between wind turbine flexible modes and platform modes however froude scaling would imply to operate at very low wind speeds and reynolds numbers penalizing the rotor design and the reproduction of aerodynamic loads thus partially wasting the main advantage of wind tunnel hil tests 6 the hexafloat robot the hil numerical and physical subsystems are coupled by means of the hexafloat 6 dofs parallel kinematic machine pkm that provides the required motions to the wind turbine model this task implies challenges both from mechanical and control points of view that were faced according to the workflow in fig 9 the general architecture of the machine was chosen to meet requirements in terms of workspace dimensions dynamic performances stiffness position accuracy and compactness low height from the floor to keep the wind turbine model rotor far from the wind tunnel ceiling la mura et al 2018b among well known 6 dofs pkm examples a completely customized architecture shown in fig 10 was designed and optimized based on the requirements of this specific application bayati et al 2014 giberti and ferrari 2015 the 6 prismatic universal spherical pus custom topology resulting from a genetic optimization ferrari and giberti 2014 is moved by ball screw axes arranged in radial symmetric couples the use of a pkm configuration also has some drawbacks like workspace anisotropy only partially mitigated by the radial symmetric topology pose dependent stiffness and modal behavior large weight and low encumbrance to work volume ratio some of these aspects influenced the design process and control development as detailed in the next sections 6 1 design and dimensioning the machine desired trajectory is the result of the hil numerical model real time integration thus it is not known in advance and due to non linear parallel kinematics it is very difficult to evaluate which workspace dof motion combination is the most demanding for the actuators a systematic procedure based on monte carlo method anon 2011 fiore et al 2017 giberti et al 2018 and a multibody model fiore et al 2016 was implemented for the sizing and dimensioning of the mechanical components of the 6 dofs robot the pkm must ensure low dynamic disturbances to minimize delays to preserve the wind turbine model aeroelastic vibration modes and to actively manage any potentially dangerous source of alteration of the hil control loop the influence of the robot dynamics on the hil system was assessed through simulated and experimental modal analyses also considering the influence of the hexafloat control system results showed that tracking performances are not affected by the robot dynamics inside the desired system bandwidth whereas the robot control dynamics has a non negligible influence on the preservation of the wind turbine model aeroelastic response the force correction procedure and the hil force feedback impose two major requirements on the hexafloat design the robot motors have to be tuned to avoid any coupling with the wind turbine scale model flexible modes and an unwanted structural excitation the force feedback calculation procedure requires to know the actual position and acceleration of the wind turbine tower base in real time that is obtained relying on a jfmd algorithm a reliable virtual representation of the complete machine equipped with the real low level control algorithms digital twin was created for fine control tuning to study the system response under realistic dynamic loads and to test high level control algorithms to understand their effects on the turbine motion raineri et al 2018 6 2 electronics and control design the core of the hexafloat electronics is a delta tau data systems power pmac motion controller real time performance and safety requirements led to the design of a multilevel control software la mura et al 2018b a underneath this primary and secondary state machines manage all the main functionalities of the system at the lowest level of the control system are the position and velocity servo loops setting the analog torque reference for the servo actuators high level control modalities were developed to respect the desired real time performance and safety requirements some advanced tools were designed such as set point buffering with time based control active delay control allowing motion look ahead for smooth trajectory blending non linear forward kinematics acting like a virtual pose sensor workspace boundaries check with controlled dynamics on the limits la mura et al 2018a acceleration saturation with workspace reference tracking asc the experimental campaigns proved the control system effectiveness under the most demanding working conditions high and low level algorithms are very effective at managing all the challenging aspects of this complex hil setup such as motion smoothness inertial loads bearing acquisition performances transparency la mura et al 2018b and workspace monitoring 7 experimental results the potentialities of the experimental methodology presented in this paper are demonstrated through a sample of results from a test campaign about a 10mw fowt that was carried out within the lifes50 project the main aim of the tests was to assess the fowt global response in different wind and wave conditions and to understand how the wind turbine controller interacts with the platform rigid body motion modes at different wind speeds experiments were repeated for four different operating conditions corresponding to still air no wind a mean wind speed of 10 m s below 1 wind turbine working at partial loads 18 m s and 25 m s above 1 and above 2 wind turbine working at full load 7 1 description of the reference floating system the 10mw fowt object of the experimental campaign is constituted by the oo star wind floater semi submersible platform and the dtu 10mw rwt an image of the floating wind turbine concept is shown in fig 11 the platform consists of a star shaped pontoon connecting a central column and three outer columns the structure is built out of post tensioned concrete the mooring system is a catenary system with three mooring lines the main parameters of the wind turbine are summarized in table 2 those of the floating platform in table 3 the wind turbine is controlled according to the vs vp control strategy described is section 3 3 the controller parameters chosen according to the procedure described in fontanella et al 2019c are reported in table 4 7 2 free decay tests free decay tests were carried out to characterize the linearized dynamics of the platform surge and platform pitch dofs in still air and for different laminar wind conditions experiments were performed alternatively imposing an initial offset with respect to the static equilibrium position to the platform surge 4 5 m or pitch 3 5 dof and allowing the system to come at rest the natural period and damping ratio for the two platform modes were extracted from the analysis of the response of the dof subjected to the initial condition and are reported in table 5 the platform pitch response in above 2 conditions was critically damped and the evaluation of period and damping ratio is not applicable the natural period and damping ratio for still air are comparable to those observed in ocean basin tests anon 2019 especially when considering the surge response in this respect it is worth mentioning that observed deviations in the damping ratio may be ascribed to non perfect actuation and measurement chains bayati et al 2020 the platform surge and pitch dofs response for an imposed surge or pitch offset and different wind conditions is shown in fig 12 and fig 13 respectively in the plots the steady state response is subtracted from the signals among the six rigid body platform modes surge and pitch are the most strongly coupled with the wind turbine drivetrain mode and controller action fontanella et al 2018b as highlighted by table 5 the linearized properties of the two modes show large variations for different wind conditions the surge mode period and damping decrease when the wind turbine is operating their lowest value is recorded for the slightly above rated wind and an increment is seen for wind speeds approaching cut off the pitch mode period decreases in below rated condition where maximum damping is achieved in above rated conditions both period and damping are lower but still greater than in still air 7 3 irregular wave tests irregular waves from the jonswap spectrum significant height h s 7 7 m peak spectral period t p 12 4 s with no misalignment were run to assess the fowt response in still air and for different laminar wind conditions in presence of a stochastic non linear hydrodynamic excitation the power spectral density psd of the platform surge and pitch is analyzed together with the psd of rotor speed and collective blade pitch angle i e the wind turbine controller feedback and control action in full load in fig 14 which includes colored vertical lines to highlight some important frequencies of the fowt the red line marks the platform surge and the green line the platform pitch frequency in still air as measured in free decay experiments i e the inverse of the natural periods t n of table 5 the blue line highlights the rotor 1p frequency as already seen for free decays the response of the platform surge and platform pitch dofs is strongly coupled with the wind turbine controller action the low frequency motion is dominated by the surge mode response that shows a variable amplitude for different operating conditions in particular in presence of wind and an operating rotor the response amplitude at the surge frequency is higher and the surge mode period is lower the peak of the low frequency response is maximum in above 1 and decreases in above 2 conditions in agreement with the result of free decay tests the platform response at higher frequencies and in particular in the wave frequency range shows little to no dependence on the operating condition since hydrodynamic loads are predominant on rotor loads the platform motion at the surge mode period causes a variation of the relative wind speed seen by the turbine rotor that translates into a low frequency varying aerodynamic torque this results into strong rotor speed oscillations at the surge mode frequency the amplitude of the rotor speed psd at surge frequency is maximum and presents similar values in below and above 1 conditions whereas it decreases in above 2 conditions as said for above rated wind speeds the rotor collective pitch angle is the main control input and rotor speed oscillations at the surge mode frequency make the wind turbine blades pitching at the same frequency the amplitude of rotor speed oscillations caused by platform motions induced by linear wave loads is lower than at low frequency being the high frequency variation of aerodynamic torque filtered by rotor inertia finally both the psd of rotor speed and rotor pitch show a peak at the 1p frequency associated with rotor mechanical and aerodynamic imbalance the psd of the other platform dofs response is shown in fig 15 for the same operating conditions considered in fig 14 also in this case vertical red green and blue lines highlight the platform surge platform pitch and rotor 1p frequencies respectively the heave response is dominated by wave loads and does not show any significant dependence on the wind turbine operating condition the other dofs response is excited by misaligned waves imbalanced wind speeds on the rotor swept area mechanical imbalances and gyroscopic moments fontanella et al 2019b in the analyzed tests cases that were performed under a constant laminar wind with no misalignment the response of the sway roll and yaw dofs is very small 8 conclusions this paper presented the hil methodology to test fowts in the polimi wind tunnel exploiting the characteristics of the facility to better investigate the effects of unsteady aerodynamics and the interaction between wind turbine controller and overall platform dynamics to this end a wind turbine scale model with realistic control capabilities is combined with a numerical model of the floating platform the real time coupling between the two subsystems is based on the measurement of aerodynamic loads at the model tower base and on a 6 dofs robot that moves the wind turbine according to the displacements obtained from the numerical model integration the wind tunnel hil methodology has some noticeable advantages with respect to other experimental methodologies for research about fowts in particular the airflow quality the possibility to reproduce turbulence and wind shear across the whole test chamber and to use large wind turbine scale models all the aspects make possible to better simulate the interaction between wind turbine controller structure wind and wave loads in this respect the wind tunnel hil methodology presented in this paper can be addressed as a useful tool for validating fowt simulation models focused on the wind turbine unsteady aerodynamics for the experimental verification of complex control logics and for the study of floating wind farms where it is fundamental to reproduce the effects of the upstream wind turbine wake on the downwind ones the wind tunnel hil methodology was applied to a floating concept formed by the dtu 10mw rwt and the semisubmersible oo star wind floater to better show its main potentialities and drawbacks its effectiveness lies in the fidelity of the two subsystems and the quality of the measurement and actuation chains realizing the coupling between them the methodology still has some limitations that were analyzed in this work even if the dimensions of the polimi wind tunnel allowed to design a large scale model the size reduction imposed some hard constraints on the wind turbine scaling in terms of an unavoidable reynolds number reduction a low reynolds rotor was designed trying to match the full scale wind turbine aerodynamic performance with the actual inflow conditions achieved inside the wind tunnel the rotor thrust force that sets the fowt aero hydro elastic response is highly comparable between the scale model and the dtu 10mw however some discrepancies are still present especially in the rotor power wind turbine loads are not directly measured by a physical sensor but are instead estimated depriving tower base loads of the inertial and weight components the procedure requires the knowledge of the wind turbine scale model geometry and inertial properties and any uncertainty on these quantities directly translates into errors in the estimated wind turbine loads at the time of this work it is possible to extract with good accuracy only the surge force and pitch moment that are large with respect to the associated inertial and weight components the extraction of sway and heave forces roll and yaw moments that are small when considering constant uniform wind conditions and in presence of small wind wave misalignments is still difficult moreover it was not possible to respect mass and aeroelastic requirements because the model construction relied on commercial components and resulted in a rotor nacelle assembly heavier than expected this hinders the reproduction of the tower flexible response requiring to add filters to cancel out the harmonics components associated with tower flexibility from the wind turbine loads measurement since those may destabilize the hil system improvements are expected to be achieved modifying the wind turbine scale model and adopting more sophisticated mechatronic solutions in any case high fidelity model testing is currently used only in the final design phases of fowts for the verification and optimization of the complete system to overcome the limitations of classical testing it is possible to rely on hybrid methodologies and results from experiments in different facilities can be combined to obtain more accurate results thys et al 2019 it is of fundamental importance to recognize the complementarity of numerical modeling field testing and scale model experiments with particular focus on the different physical aspects i e hydrodynamics in ocean basins wind turbine control and aerodynamics in wind tunnels for making the entire process behind the study of fowts reliable joint activities are currently promoted by the wind energy research community to define how to best complement the different testing methodologies developed so far the scientific community still lacks of a common strategy to systematically investigate the different challenges related to floating offshore wind energy systems the accuracy level of the different methodologies in relation to their capabilities still have to be assessed in order to provide more reliable best practices and guidelines for the design to this aim round robin tests could be valuably adopted not only for numerical model validation but also for assessing the experimental

industrial growth the offshore wind energy industry now plays a central role in the long and short term international energy strategies the interest in the offshore wind power exploitation is increasing significantly worldwide the reasons are the high energy demand fig 1 the global development of energy sector with the high relevance of renewable resources and that the wind speed ratio offshore is potentially higher than onshore therefore higher energy production can be obtained the currently offshore wind energy potential can be considered to be in a significant implementation state and is also expected to grow faster in the next couple of years thus the new offshore wind generators can achieve an increase in the full load time that varies between 40 and 55 depending on resource availability the global offshore wind energy production reached 39 twh in 2015 and 42 twh in 2016 the worldwide offshore wind cumulative capacity is expected to move from the 14 gw registered in 2016 to 41 gw in 2022 european countries and china will lead the offshore wind market greater access to resources and funds along with enhanced policies and faster project deployments could mean an increase by approximately 7 gw international energy agency 2017 in recent years the european offshore wind energy sector on the north sea has been rapidly developed and this fact has meant a large scale commercial deployment of offshore wind farms by 2030 the planning of new offshore wind farms in nordic and baltic seas will represent a total installed capacity of 45 gw and 8 gw respectively ewea 2015 moreover offshore wind technology is a promising alternative to achieve the objective of greenhouse gas reduction for instance the world s largest offshore wind farm walney extension generates clean electricity for more than half a million homes orsted 2017 almost as much as the nuclear power station power can provide 659 mw 1000 mw h h and a m 2000 in addition politically and socially the offshore wind farms have a negligible visual and noise impact related to the distance to shore nevertheless the influence on marine ecosystems must still be analysed in greater detail on the other hand large scale offshore wind locations were identified in the us beiter et al 2017 and china yang et al 2017 where the large marine areas available can deliver favourable wind conditions the evolution of the mega offshore wind projects would lead to a revolution in the current scenario this evolution would cause a series of challenges for the different participants of the wind energy projects such as system planners and operators turbine manufacturers structures constructors and other participants thus this study aims to clarify the current situation of offshore wind projects and provides a review of the main components including foundations turbines operators etc additionally the number of installations by country distance to shore and water depth is reported in this paper following the introduction section 2 analyses the state of offshore wind projects section 3 focuses on the current state of operative wind farms worldwide also explaining the main characteristics at the regional and national level the evaluation of operative wind farms layout main parameters is described in section 4 section 5 presents the pre and under construction offshore wind projects and analyses the main trends respect to operative projects finally section 6 sums up the essential findings and concludes the paper 2 the current state of offshore wind energy after the world s first offshore wind power plant was installed in 1991 denmark the growth of offshore wind farms has been encouraging and the growth is expected to increase in the forthcoming years in addition to the 112 offshore wind farms currently operational there are 712 projects in different phases of development and 53 projects in pre and under construction fig 2 the future projects are being mostly developed in the countries already equipped with this technology besides countries as greece finland norway india brazil canada australia poland croatia sri lanka or cyprus among others begin to get involved today the total offshore installed capacity is approximately 18 9 gw during the last years the installation rate has had a positive year on year trend fig 3 the offshore market has grown significantly over the last decades with the total installed offshore wind capacity rising nearly ten fold from just 0 06 gw in the period 1996 2000 to 18 gw in 2018 and 36 gw at the beginning of the 2020s annex b this fact reflects a percentage change average of 412 during the last two decades and a half moreover the number of wind farms and installed turbines grown experimented an average percentage of 121 and 245 respectively for the same period this increase also implies a scaling up offshore wind installations by just continuing the historical pace the tendency is in concordance with the growth precisions in offshore wind capacities by 2030 in line with the national renewable energy laboratory nrel 2018 offshore wind technologies market report which estimates that the offshore wind industry will grow above 154 gw walter et al 2018 even though the large scale offshore wind projects are challenging some of the main issues have already been addressed by other industries such as the onshore wind oil and gas and coastal engineering industries the critical aspect is to understand how this sector will evolve as it is crucial in the development of the global energy sector 3 the offshore wind farms around the world the offshore wind farms under operation are scattered in several countries around the world most of them in europe followed by asia and america fig 4 in europe there are offshore wind farms installed in belgium 6 finland 2 denmark 13 germany 19 ireland 1 the netherlands 6 sweden 4 and the uk 30 for its part the offshore wind potential of the asian continent is based mainly in countries such as china 21 japan 4 south korea 2 taiwan 1 and vietnam 2 with a lower expansion of the offshore wind sector us 1 is the only country in the americas that has offshore wind installations among the regions europe remains the continent with the largest installed capacity 16 3 gw followed by asia 2 7 gw and america 0 03 gw the total wind power capacity installed at the end of 2018 reached 19 gw table 1 according to the iea s renewables 2018 forecast international energy agency 2018 the united kingdom takes the leading position in developing offshore wind power whose total installed capacity is 7 3 gw which is followed by germany 5 3 gw denmark 1 2 gw the netherlands 1 1 gw belgium 0 8 gw sweden 0 2 gw finland 0 08 gw and ireland 0 03 gw the ranking in the asian continent is led by china 2 4 gw vietnam 0 2 gw japan 0 04 gw south korea 0 04 gw and taiwan 0 008 gw finally the american continent has only one offshore wind energy installation us 0 03 gw annex a so far 53 offshore wind farms are still pre under construction whose total installed capacity is 16 7 gw when the installation of new projects finished the whole global offshore wind farms capacity will be 35 6 gw slightly below the 42 gw forecast by the international energy agency iea for 2022 international energy agency 2017 for the goal of analysing the economics of offshore wind and more specifically their cost development a dataset comprising information about all operative offshore wind power plants worldwide was created annexe a the comprehensive dataset combines publicly available information from several project websites the dataset has 101 of 112 commercial offshore wind projects in total it comprises an investment volume of more than 65 billion euros offshore wind projects are highly capital cost intensive the initial financial investment makes up approximately three fourths of the total project lifetime cost this value is extremely high in comparison to conventional power stations where investment costs typically represent 40 of the project lifetime cost moreover the investment cost per mw in offshore wind is approximately 50 more expensive than in onshore wind this gap is mostly due to the costs of additional components underwater equipment construction and installation processes generally the economic value on an offshore turbine is 20 more expensive while the towers and foundations cost 2 5 times the total cost of an onshore project with the same installed capacity kitzing and morthorst 2015 the uk and germany lead the ranking of investment in offshore wind projects with almost 81 of the total investment in europe which reach 60 billion euros in asia the number of projects is less which suppose a total investment of 5315 million euros topping the list of asian countries is china with 92 of the money invested in the continent 3 1 offshore wind foundations most popular designs for wind offshore structures are monopiles jackets tripods or gravity based foundations o kelly and arshad 2016 each structure design has its own merits and strengths the current types of offshore wind foundations used in commercial projects are illustrated in fig 5 monopile the installation involves hydraulic hammering of the monopiles into the seabed which is typically 500 800 tons in weight with a diameter of 5 m 6 m and 50 m 60 m in length these types of structures are suitable for sites having a water depth ranging from 0 to 30 m the monopile foundation is used for most of the offshore wind farms especially in the european market for the following reasons the first one the soil in the north sea which requires relatively less effort on drilling of piles the second one most wind installations have been deployed in shallow waters areas with less than 30 m depth this support structure is the most suitable economically so far considering seafloor characteristics in europe 63 of operative offshore wind farms in 2018 adopted this foundation type by continents america uses this structure in 100 of the case europe in 70 and asia in 43 table 2 jacket structure typical jacket support structures are four legged piles with interconnected cross braces having a diameter of about 2 m the base piles are nailed inside the seabed to the adequate water depth with the support of pile sleeves these offshore structures are suitable for locations having a water depth between 25 m and 50 m currently there are 220 wind turbines supported by this foundation type the korean peninsula leads the installation of jackets with 100 of these structures installed in their waters due mainly to the water depth and meteorological conditions gravity base the gbs is generally a concrete based structure which consists of sand rock filled and iron ore filled inside the base and a central concrete or steel shaft from the transition piece to the turbine tower the gbs is suited for water depths greater than 20 m the gbs might be deemed as an alternative to the other support structures as the offshore wind power plants are planned to be constructed in greater size at deeper waters nevertheless annex a listed a significant number of danish wind farms nearshore where this foundation was used due to the shallow waters the deepest registered offshore wind farm with gravity base structures is blyth the uk with an average water depth of 35 5 m moreover 70 of operative wind farms foundations in asia such as the hydropower rudong i or hydropower rudong ii used this type of structure because the higher maturity in the construction process and installation procedures can minimise associated risk tripod the tripod structure is considered to be a relatively lightweight three legged steel jacket compared to a standard lattice structure under the central steel column which is below the turbines there is a steel frame that transfers the forces from the tower to the three steel piles piles are installed at each leg position to anchor the tripod to the seabed the three piles are driven into the seabed a range between 10 m and 20 m annexe a shows some projects as the globaltech i bard offshore 1 or trianel windpark borkum where the tripod is installed in transitional water depth these concepts were only implemented for the european continent considering the water depth and meteorological characteristics the most feasible sites featuring high wind potential for large scale development are in water deeper than 20 m besides the tripod can be more effective than monopile in the face of extreme events such as hurricanes or typhoons the monopolies require greater suction caissons or longer piles high rise pile cap hrpc the hrpc structure is suitable for sea areas with the water depth ranging from 0 m to 20 m applicable to soft soil foundation it can effectively resist seawater corrosion and is low in cost reliable and convenient to be constructed it comprises of a concrete bearing platform higher than the sea level and a group of steel pipe piles at the bottom of the bearing platform wherein the lower end of the steel pipe pile incline outward slightly similar to the previous structure the hrpc concept li et al 2017 only has been installed on the asian continent the 40 of foundations installed on this continent are hrpc all the offshore wind farms in vietnam use this type of support structure for their turbines suction bucket this technology can be visualised as upside down buckets which are lowered into the seabed to anchor the offshore structures the water is pumped out of the bucket thereby reducing the pressure inside the bucket skirt the formation of this negative pressure combined with the weight of the offshore foundation enables the latter to sink deeper into the seafloor the suction bucket installation process is easily reversible in the event of removal of the offshore foundation this technology is best suited for deep waters and large wind turbines and it does not require seabed preparation moreover this type of structure is more feasible economically because of the fast and straightforward installation procedure oh et al 2018 currently only xiangshui offshore wind farm in china installed these support structure type remote and deeper offshore wind sites will represent the future steps in this sector the new scenario will require new and more advanced structures moore et al 2018 a small number of the offshore wind farms studied in this research are located at water depths greater than 30 m based on that the monopile foundations are the most used structure nevertheless during the last years have seen an increase in the amount number of deeper waters locations as a result tripod jacket and gravity base foundations have been developed for these new scenarios table 2 shows that in the 18 9 gw installed worldwide 63 of foundations are monopile 12 are gravity base and high rise pile cap and 7 are jacket foundations based on the average water depth of operative wind turbines the deepest installation foundations are occupied by tripod and jacket 20 m 40 m followed by monopile 10 m 20 m and gravity base suction bucket and high rise pile cap less than 10 m similarly foundation costs are leading by tripod and jacket 4 m to 5 m followed by monopile 2 m and gravity base suction bucket and high rise pile cap less than 2 m 3 2 offshore wind turbines after the first offshore wind farm installed in 1991 eleven 450 kw turbines and a total capacity of 4 95 mw the increase in the distance to the shoreline has been the general trend voormolen et al 2016 this trend is based on the wind conditions higher wind speeds smoother and less turbulent airflows and open space larger offshore wind farms and high capacity turbines today 112 offshore wind farms with turbine capacity range of 500 kw to 8 mw exist offshore in an average water depth from 1m to 40 m due to these shallow waters the offshore turbines installed to date have been able to use conventional land based designs with upgraded electrical and corrosion control systems and foundations concrete bases or steel monopiles to anchor them to the seabed fig 5 table 1 shows europe leads the global distribution of wind turbines with 4173 turbines followed by asia and a great distance by america by countries the united kingdom and germany separately group a more significant number of turbines than the entire asian continent with a smaller number of installed turbines are denmark the netherlands belgium sweden ireland or finland on the other hand china dominates the offshore wind market in asia with a total number of 676 installed turbines followed by vietnam japan south korea and taiwan at the moment only 5 turbines are operative at america continent in the united states the energy production demands increased exponentially in the last decade that led to the continuous growth of offshore turbine installations accompanied by an increase in the unit rated power reaching 10 mw sethuraman et al 2017 table 3 shows the number of turbines and offshore wind farms in the function of the nominal turbine power the average turbine power is between 3 mw and 4 mw this power range comprises a total of 43 wind farms worldwide which means a total of 2366 installed turbines at the same time this supposes that almost 50 of the turbines currently operating globally have this range of nominal power in terms of continents the situation is repeated in the european case however it is different in the asian and american continent where the wind turbines capacity varies between 4 mw and 6 mw also both in europe and asia a few numbers of wind farms have generators below 2 mw in the european case these turbines were installed in the oldest wind farms that are still in operation in the asian countries the situation is different since as the offshore wind market is still in an early stage of development therefore these offshore wind turbines are more present in the domestic industry also a huge progress has been made in the offshore wind turbine capacity since 1995 fig 6 shows the evolution of wind turbines capacity on four years period time for the last 25 years in the first offshore wind farms a capacity of an average of around 70 kw was turned into machines with a nominal power of 5 mw or above in 2020 the average capacity of wind turbines will be 6 mw 3 2 1 offshore wind turbines manufacturers in 2018 there were 22 wind turbines manufacturers around the world all of them producing devices from 0 5 mw to 8 mw the market is divided among seven major manufacturers among which the german companies siemens senvion formerly repower and bard and the danish vestas bonus bordtank and wind world operate 77 of the worldwide market the largest manufacturers of offshore wind turbines are siemens and vestas with 3001 and 930 turbines respectively the largest operational wind turbine models classified according to their capacity and manufacturer are the following vestas v164 8 mw with 164 m rotor diameter siemens swt 7 0 154 senvion 6 2m126 united power 6 mw siemens swt 6 0 154 bard vm csic h 5mw xe128 5 mw senvion 5m and adwen ad 5 135 internationally there is still a significant gap in the designing and producing of large scale wind turbines it is mainly because the key technologies depend on imports and the quality of components needs improving the average nominal power of a single wind turbine at the worldwide level has not reached 3 mw while european market is moving to install generators with more than 7 mw with the expanding scale of offshore wind farms each wind turbine manufacturer is getting involved in the research on large size wind turbines table 4 shows the primary constructors in the world market offshore wind turbine the number of offshore wind farms the total number of operational turbines and the wind turbines full capacity installed by each constructor in the asian continent there are several wind farms in which part of their turbines belong to one or more manufacturers as an example the zhuhai guishan hai wind farm china has turbines supplied by united power and by mingyang additionally the comparison between annex a and table 4 shows the regional tendency of the turbine developers supplying their equipment in the area of influence of their headquarters only siemens and vestas are present in the asian market in the new projects the turbine manufacturers enter new markets turning the current situation into a more globalized system nevertheless the new turbines market becomes controlled by a smaller number of companies 3 3 distance to shore and water depth the majority of commercial offshore wind power plants operating to date were deployed within 20 km to the shoreline at a maximum average water depth of 30 m fig 7 currently the global averages of distance to shore and water depth are 18 8 km and 14 6 m respectively these dimensions for the power plants installed in europe have an averages of 23 3 km and 17 4 m while in asia were installed at an average distance to shore of 6 9 km and an average water depth of 6 7 m in america these dimensions have reached 4 5 km for distance from the coast and 25 5 m for the water depth annex a fig 8 shows the average distance from the coast and the water depth of the offshore wind farms by country the highest average water depth of an offshore wind farm 27 8 m is found in the german exclusive economic zone the turbines in vietnam 2 m japan 6 m finland 8 5 m and sweden 8 5 m are erected in very shallow waters the most remarkable average distances from the coast are in germany 52 7 km and belgium 35 km the offshore wind farm currently operative farther from shore is global tech 1 at a distance of 115 km from the german coast while japan hosts the farm with the lowest average distance to the coast 0 5 km the distance to shore and water depth are of economic importance because they influence both the investment spending and the operation and maintenance cost kota et al 2015 the costs associated with the installation process and grid connection increase with a higher distance to the shoreline also an increase in the water depth is reflected in foundations higher costs the shallow waters foundation costs including installation has an approximate value that oscillates between 1 5 m mw and 2 m mw these values wore exponentially increased proportionally to the water depth european environment agency 2014 3 4 the environmental impact of offshore wind energy the products released during the combustion of fossil fuels as carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o leads to environmental damage or health problems among others heal 2009 as opposed to fossil fuels wind energy in its role of renewable energy is characterised by its low emissions and energy conservation as presented in table 5 currently the offshore wind energy production grows at an accelerating rate that reaches up to 18 gw installed more than 13 million households benefit from this energy resource additionally the offshore wind farms deployment alleviates the energetic demands and contributes to environmental sustainability kaldellis and apostolou 2017 the current study identified a total annual reduction of co2 and so2 of 27 048 916 tons and 629 060 tons respectively the potential of offshore wind shows that the operative wind farm could supply enough energy to cover the energy demand of large population centres the united kingdom which leads the homes powered annually guarantee energy to cover the energy consumption of london or germany could provide electricity to ensure the electrical consume of berlin on the other hand the reduction of co2 and so2 is a mandatory achieve in international regulations as an example air pollution in china has been extreme the air quality has caused immense health damages for a long time in recent years pollution is becoming a political problem of utmost importance several regulations and directives have been implemented such as the air pollution prevention and control action plan hereinafter the action plan china state council 2013 other regions around the world have launched action plans on climate change dawn et al 2019 the growing economy not only increases the comfort levels of people but also increases the demand for electricity therefore offshore wind energy resource is come out as the best solution to maintain the balance be tween generation and demand while reducing significantly the harmful emissions 4 evaluation of offshore wind farms layout parameters the large offshore wind farms planned for extreme climate conditions and designed to reduce installation time and maintenance frequency is the research topic for the offshore wind developers these large scale projects will have associated with the need to improve the supply chain towards the establishment of coastal logistic centres to avoid constraints associated with conventional transport road rail moreover the near future offshore wind market will be characterised by larger rotors taller towers advanced materials autonomous monitoring systems and advanced electrical transmission systems among others in the following points is defined the highlights that the operative wind farms and their characteristics directed towards six core areas number of wind farms number of turbines installed capacity distance to shore water depth and turbine height the obtain results helps evaluate the critical factors in the fixed offshore wind farms layout and measure the global market evolution 4 1 number of wind farms vs number of turbines the total area occupied by offshore wind farms is approximately 6 100 km2 assuming the previous global average of 3 mw turbines installed per km2 volker et al 2017 that equates to a potential wind energy generating capacity of roughly 18 300 mw in this context two points are of particular importance the number of wind farms and wind turbines fig 9 represents the dimensions for currently operative offshore wind farms in the world it is shown that 96 of operative wind farms have between 0 and 120 turbines nevertheless the number of wind farms with more than 120 turbines is low the vast percentage 55 corresponds to wind farms with 0 40 turbines installed in correspondence with what was perceptible in fig 7 only the average number of turbines by the wind farm is superior to 40 devices in germany 61 the netherlands 61 the uk 60 and vietnam 51 in the same way there are only four megaprojects with more than 120 turbines installed gemini 150 greater gabbard 140 gwynt and mor 160 and london array 175 three of them in the uk and the other one in the netherlands annex a 4 2 wind farms and number of turbines vs installed capacity a conventional offshore wind farm usually has a significant number of generators which is proportional to the installed megawatts and outspread in the range of several kilometres so that there is a direct relation between wind farms installed capacity the number of wind farms and the average of turbines by a wind farm as shown in table 6 most of the operational wind farms 81 of operational wind farms have an installed capacity lower than 300 mw which adds up to a total of 2956 turbines of the 4995 installed fig 10 presents the number of turbines by the wind farm and the number of wind farms related to the installed capacity the number of turbines increases with the increase of the installed capacity of a wind farm nevertheless the number of wind plants is reduced with the growth of installed turbines by wind farm this last observation is related to the high capacity wind projects immaturity that only in the previous five years have been developing however the pattern could evolve in the following years annex b 4 3 distance to shore and water depth vs installed capacity the average water depth of offshore wind farms currently operative is 27 5 m the average distance to shore for those projects is 41 km the first floating offshore wind farm hywind scotland equinor 2018 has an average water depth twice as deep as that of other bottom fixed offshore wind farms nevertheless there are some areas not yet exploited that meet the conditions to deploy fixed platforms and that in the next years will be the locations of the offshore wind large scale projects fig 11 gives a general overview of the wind farms installed capacity and the relation with the depth and distance to shore nowadays the water depth of the majority of operative offshore wind farms varies between 0 m and 10 m and the distances to the coast of no greater than 10 km nevertheless the worldwide trend is characterized by the increase of water depth and distance to shore as a function of the installed wind power capacity table 7 the european sector leads this evolution in these wind farms characteristics in germany there are 47 of wind farms with a distance to shore superior to 50 km and in 32 of these installations the water depth exceeds 30 m the three main considerations to this evolution in these parameters are 1 the areas further from the coast have a greater wind potential therefore it is more attractive for the construction of wind farms 2 some countries have specific regulations for offshore wind restricting the spatial zones far away from the coast bailey et al 2014 an example of this regulations is the offshore energy strategic environmental assessment that excluded the twelve nautical mile territorial sea limit and all waters with water depths greater than 60 m in scotland and north ireland higgins and foley 2014 3 conflicts between offshore wind and other marine uses rudolph 2014 4 4 number of wind farms and turbines vs water depth as previously mentioned the offshore wind industry evolves to deeper waters this direction rep resents wind farm developers and maritime industry desire to harness wind energy resource at sea the average water depth for offshore wind farms worldwide is 14 6 m bard offshore 1 is the currently offshore wind farm installed to a most considerable depth 40 m in german waters it is clear from projects in pre and under construction which average water depth will increase annex b future installations announced will be deploying in average water depths up to 18 m beatrice offshore wind farm will be deployed in 2020 at 45 m water depth fig 12 shows the gross number of wind turbines and wind farms for various water depth intervals the number of wind farms falls as the depth of the water increases the number of facilities goes from 37 farms in depths ranging from 0 m to 8 m depth to 10 farms in the range of 32 m 40 m further the number of turbines installed increases in depths ranging from 0 m to 24 m and then reduces in the last intervals of depth it is therefore observable that up to 24 m water deep wind farms have a higher number of foundations installed 4 5 number of wind farms and turbines vs distance to shore the overwhelming majority of operative offshore wind farms are located nearshore less than 30 km to shore although the trend is gradually moving towards greater distances douglas westwood 2013 the distance increase allows to take advantage of the higher and steadier wind speeds found at greater distances from the shoreline and reduces turbines visual impact nevertheless the fixed bottom support structures are inapplicable with great depths due to the loading increases moreover deeper waters mean larger structural dimensions that are economically non viable at present fig 13 illustrates the number of wind farms and turbines deployed in 15 km ranges from the shoreline to an upper limit of 120 km the maximum distance corresponds to global tech i offshore wind farm situated 115 km from the german coast currently 98 offshore wind farms 4006 turbines are deployed at a distance from the shoreline less than 30 km above 30 km the number of wind farms is reduced there is only a small rebound in the range of 90 105 km generated by the wind parks sandbank bard offshore i and veja mate annex a 4 6 number of wind farms and turbines vs turbine height and diameter the offshore wind industry is observing an increase in average turbine size fig 6 fig 14 represents the main turbine dimensions as a function of the number of offshore wind farms installed and wind turbines deployed in the range that covers 65 m 135 m blades diameter is found the largest number of wind farms and turbines with 93 and 4236 respectively the diameter of a turbine is commonly proportional to the turbine height therefore in the range from 95 m to 165 m of altitude also hosts the highest percentage of turbines in this range there are operative 89 wind farms and 4032 turbines although the most significant number of deployed equipment moves in the range of dimensions described above the last segment that is characterized by housing the giant turbines represents 20 of the installed machines worldwide the first range of turbines in height were deployed in sweden the netherlands denmark and japan bockstigen se or tuno knob dk wind farms are an example of low height generators for its part superior dimensions turbines are installed almost entirely in the european continent in countries such as denmark germany or the uk an example of these turbines would be found in offshore wind farms as nissum bredning vind dk gode wind de and blyth uk 5 offshore wind projects in preconstruction or under constructions all around the world according to the offshore wind energy farms roadmap in 2018 the number of pre and under construction projects were equal to 53 fig 2 divided between 2 continents and 8 countries belgium 2 denmark 2 germany 8 the united kingdom 6 china 27 south korea 1 taiwan 1 and vietnam 6 annex b shows future offshore wind projects that will have a total installed capacity of 16 7 gw the capacity of these new projects is significantly larger than in the operational ones an example is the average capacity install by the wind farm this value is double going from the 169 mw of wind farms currently operating to 314 mw into the pre and under construction projects the development of such large scale projects brings the possibility to drive down costs in the offshore wind industry indeed there are clear indications in the energy industry that increasing projects size is a substantial driver of cost reduction by moving from the current project size to megaprojects there are some aspects where economies of scale could be achieved more efficient contracting and better risk sharing greater competition putting downward pressure on prices across parts of the value chain more cost effective geological surveys and environmental studies a greater desire for investing in optimising and integrating supply chains larger turbine size and next generation technologies for substructures could jointly deliver lower installation costs higher power output per unit of investment greater energy capture and lower o m cost faster and safer installation and operations could be facilitated by a more extensive fleet of bespoke and specialised vessels for offshore wind more mature technologies and processes would perform with higher reliability reducing operating costs and health and safety issues 5 1 future trends for offshore wind farms the patterns identified provides a context to understand the critical factors behind recent innovations using annexes a and b the real data of operative and pre under construction projects offer insight into global technology trends for the almost next decade with a focus on offshore wind farm capacities water depths distances to shore and number of turbines the discussion is focused mainly on the offshore wind worldwide evolution nevertheless a comparison between trends at the continental level is also provided fig 15 illustrates the trends based on global offshore wind projects that are in on the pre construction phase and under construction as a function of distance to shore and water depth this figure also used the values of new projects that have advanced beyond the site control phase and announced the bidding process the european and asian projects follow similar patterns in terms of distance to shore and water depth the evolution is positive with a significant increase in the parameters analysed the average of asia projects however extends to less than 10 km from shore as compared with some european projects that are sited up to 53 km from the coast table 7 an example of this variation between regions will be the peaks values of the projects list hornsea i wind farm de will take place at 120 km from shore while the huaneng dafeng ii wind farm ch will be located at 56 km to shore in the case of water depth european wind farms will range an average water depth superior to 31 m while asian farms only will reach the 12 m in spite of the differences between continents the global tendency is to increment both parameters the worldwide increase in distance to shore and water depth will be 38 and 21 respectively fig 16 represents the global and regional number of the offshore wind turbines and installed capacity by wind farm from currently operational to pre under construction projects the average of installed capacity by farm and the number of offshore wind turbines are continuing their upscaling trend for example the completion of the london array uk greater gabbard uk and gemini nl were the first commercial projects to install more than 100 turbines with a total capacity higher than 500 mw nevertheless an upgraded of technology will permit install wind farms with more than 150 turbines and 1000 mw of installed capacity as the case of hornsea i and ii respectively the turbines are suffering an update from the currently operative generators of up 8 mw of nominal power to the 9 5 mw turbines furthermore incorporating big size turbines in a project s design may also reduce the plant costs by having fewer machines installed the worldwide average installed capacity of wind farms in pre under construction is 314 mw a 21 increase from currently operative projects the number of turbines by installation increases slightly to 58 22 growth concerning operative projects these capacity averages are consistent directionally with longer term industry trends musial et al 2016 kitzing and morthorst 2015 by continents the variations of the percentages are significantly higher in europe the installed capacity and number of wind turbines increase by 44 and 27 respectively which means farms with an average of 71 turbines and a capacity of 500 mw while the variations in asia are of 43 to installed capacity and 46 for the number of turbines which would result in 214 mw and 51 turbines by wind farm table 7 5 2 future trends for offshore wind turbines the offshore wind industry push toward bigger machines show no sign of slowing down in the coming years the average rating of wind turbines worldwide is expected to reach 6 mw 37 above the current average most of this increase in growth will be due to happen in the european market with the uk and germany leading the charge rotor diameter growth and turbine height are also expected to continue unabated table 8 shows a worldwide increase of turbines diameter and height of installation of 23 and 19 respectively these increases although led by the european market will be closely accompanied by the asian homonym the turbines will have an average diameter of 156 m in europe and 134 m in asia this increase in the diameter will impact in the height of the turbines that will measure at 155 m in the offshore wind farms of asia and 184 m in the european installations moreover the turbines will move from an average capacity of 4 mw into 6 mw in the new offshore wind farms fig 17 shows the forecast functions in turbine dimensions and the number of turbines by a wind farm calculated from the original data annex a there is a proportional relation between turbine height and diameter this relation results from the foundation s design being for offshore where there are some system requirements and safety limits on the sea the economic penalties of increased foundation load and tower cost will typically outweigh any small energy gains from a much increased turbine height the data obtained do not deviate substantially from the trend line besides forecasting modern large turbines above 10 mw the results values are seen to be consistent with the same to the indicated by the respective manufacturers mhi vestas offshore wind a s 2018 siemens gamesa 2018 general electric 2018 finally the number of turbines by the wind farm is explained with a power curve the evolution of wind farms moves to vast wind farms but with fewer turbines the reduction in turbines is caused basically by the improve in the generators nominal power the increase in the size of the generator increases the wind farm installed capacity in a smaller number of foundations which reduces the costs 6 conclusions in this paper a study of offshore wind farms in operation worldwide has been presented at the same time the wind farms layout parameters as water depth distance to shore and number of turbines are analysed and interconnected permitting a general view of the current situation in addition a brief study of the pre and under construction projects is performed allowing to obtain the trends in the evolution of offshore wind in terms of the operative projects the gross worldwide capacity installed of almost 18 9 gw is led by european countries principally for the uk 7 3 gw and germany 5 4 gw followed by china 2 4 gw in asia continent consequently the economic investment reaches in the uk and germany 81 of the total europe investment which reaches 60 billion euros and 92 in china where the asia investment reaches 5 billion euros however evolution progress has been remarkably rapid and successful in other countries due to positive collaboration between government and industry when considering the types of generator 4 mw 6 mw is the most used range of options with a clear trend towards the first one basically due to the implantation of siemens 3001 units and vestas 930 units generators concerning wind farm layout the vast percentage of wind farms is composed of a number of turbines less to 40 besides 81 of operational wind farms have less than 300 mw installed regarding average water depth and average distance to shore 91 of 112 operative wind farms are located at a maximum depth of 24 m while that a 87 5 of installations are located less than 30 km from the coast concerning the turbine and tower dimensions more than 90 wind farms with supposing around 4100 turbines have a diameter between 65 m and 135 m and a height between 95 m and 165 m regarding the situation of pre under construction projects in the world the global trend in comparison with the operative projects shows an increase in the main dimensions of the wind farm layout this increases at world level reach 38 in the distance to shore 21 in water depth 21 installed capacity and 22 number of turbines by a wind farm a generalised increase characterises the forecasting for turbines dimensions in each group of data the parameters fitting into a positive trend line exploring projections of the analysed wind farms and how the offshore wind energy industry would evolve it is no surprise that the overall progress is being remarkably rapid and successful due to positive advances on the industry and the new technological developments looking further ahead the evolutionary attitude in europe has encouraged interest outside the continent in asia countries as china or vietnam continues with the path developed by countries like the uk germany or denmark on a cautionary note however it seems probable that substantial offshore developments will be concentrated in a limited number of countries as with onshore wind energy probably the uk and germany the main conclusions taken from the comparison between operative and pre under construction offshore wind energy farms are the increase in turbine dimensions and power the increase of wind farm dimensions and number of turbines the increase of water depth and distance to the shore of new wind projects the evolution to mega projects in countries as the uk and germany the worldwide turbines market is concentrated in a few number

supply and costs of energy are becoming ever more present for governmental authorities and society thus national administrations are revising their approaches to energy generation and some countries are analysing a greater diversification in their electricity generation sources moving toward renewable resources in the last decades there have been growing efforts to reduce co2 emissions and other pollutants that increase global warming effects international protocols as the kyoto uu nn 1998 or paris agreement 2015 uu nn 2015 and regional protocols as the european 2030 climate energy framework try to mitigate the adverse climate effects these goals state 40 reduction of co2 emissions a binding target of 27 for renewables and a 27 increase in energy efficiency by 2030 european commission 2014 in this regard to achieve the established quota in renewable energy offshore wind industry appears to be a key element for some countries thanks mainly to new technological advances and industrial growth the offshore wind energy industry now plays a central role in the long and short term international energy strategies the interest in the offshore wind power exploitation is increasing significantly worldwide the reasons are the high energy demand fig 1 the global development of energy sector with the high relevance of renewable resources and that the wind speed ratio offshore is potentially higher than onshore therefore higher energy production can be obtained the currently offshore wind energy potential can be considered to be in a significant implementation state and is also expected to grow faster in the next couple of years thus the new offshore wind generators can achieve an increase in the full load time that varies between 40 and 55 depending on resource availability the global offshore wind energy production reached 39 twh in 2015 and 42 twh in 2016 the worldwide offshore wind cumulative capacity is expected to move from the 14 gw registered in 2016 to 41 gw in 2022 european countries and china will lead the offshore wind market greater access to resources and funds along with enhanced policies and faster project deployments could mean an increase by approximately 7 gw international energy agency 2017 in recent years the european offshore wind energy sector on the north sea has been rapidly developed and this fact has meant a large scale commercial deployment of offshore wind farms by 2030 the planning of new offshore wind farms in nordic and baltic seas will represent a total installed capacity of 45 gw and 8 gw respectively ewea 2015 moreover offshore wind technology is a promising alternative to achieve the objective of greenhouse gas reduction for instance the world s largest offshore wind farm walney extension generates clean electricity for more than half a million homes orsted 2017 almost as much as the nuclear power station power can provide 659 mw 1000 mw h h and a m 2000 in addition politically and socially the offshore wind farms have a negligible visual and noise impact related to the distance to shore nevertheless the influence on marine ecosystems must still be analysed in greater detail on the other hand large scale offshore wind locations were identified in the us beiter et al 2017 and china yang et al 2017 where the large marine areas available can deliver favourable wind conditions the evolution of the mega offshore wind projects would lead to a revolution in the current scenario this evolution would cause a series of challenges for the different participants of the wind energy projects such as system planners and operators turbine manufacturers structures constructors and other participants thus this study aims to clarify the current situation of offshore wind projects and provides a review of the main components including foundations turbines operators etc additionally the number of installations by country distance to shore and water depth is reported in this paper following the introduction section 2 analyses the state of offshore wind projects section 3 focuses on the current state of operative wind farms worldwide also explaining the main characteristics at the regional and national level the evaluation of operative wind farms layout main parameters is described in section 4 section 5 presents the pre and under construction offshore wind projects and analyses the main trends respect to operative projects finally section 6 sums up the essential findings and concludes the paper 2 the current state of offshore wind energy after the world s first offshore wind power plant was installed in 1991 denmark the growth of offshore wind farms has been encouraging and the growth is expected to increase in the forthcoming years in addition to the 112 offshore wind farms currently operational there are 712 projects in different phases of development and 53 projects in pre and under construction fig 2 the future projects are being mostly developed in the countries already equipped with this technology besides countries as greece finland norway india brazil canada australia poland croatia sri lanka or cyprus among others begin to get involved today the total offshore installed capacity is approximately 18 9 gw during the last years the installation rate has had a positive year on year trend fig 3 the offshore market has grown significantly over the last decades with the total installed offshore wind capacity rising nearly ten fold from just 0 06 gw in the period 1996 2000 to 18 gw in 2018 and 36 gw at the beginning of the 2020s annex b this fact reflects a percentage change average of 412 during the last two decades and a half moreover the number of wind farms and installed turbines grown experimented an average percentage of 121 and 245 respectively for the same period this increase also implies a scaling up offshore wind installations by just continuing the historical pace the tendency is in concordance with the growth precisions in offshore wind capacities by 2030 in line with the national renewable energy laboratory nrel 2018 offshore wind technologies market report which estimates that the offshore wind industry will grow above 154 gw walter et al 2018 even though the large scale offshore wind projects are challenging some of the main issues have already been addressed by other industries such as the onshore wind oil and gas and coastal engineering industries the critical aspect is to understand how this sector will evolve as it is crucial in the development of the global energy sector 3 the offshore wind farms around the world the offshore wind farms under operation are scattered in several countries around the world most of them in europe followed by asia and america fig 4 in europe there are offshore wind farms installed in belgium 6 finland 2 denmark 13 germany 19 ireland 1 the netherlands 6 sweden 4 and the uk 30 for its part the offshore wind potential of the asian continent is based mainly in countries such as china 21 japan 4 south korea 2 taiwan 1 and vietnam 2 with a lower expansion of the offshore wind sector us 1 is the only country in the americas that has offshore wind installations among the regions europe remains the continent with the largest installed capacity 16 3 gw followed by asia 2 7 gw and america 0 03 gw the total wind power capacity installed at the end of 2018 reached 19 gw table 1 according to the iea s renewables 2018 forecast international energy agency 2018 the united kingdom takes the leading position in developing offshore wind power whose total installed capacity is 7 3 gw which is followed by germany 5 3 gw denmark 1 2 gw the netherlands 1 1 gw belgium 0 8 gw sweden 0 2 gw finland 0 08 gw and ireland 0 03 gw the ranking in the asian continent is led by china 2 4 gw vietnam 0 2 gw japan 0 04 gw south korea 0 04 gw and taiwan 0 008 gw finally the american continent has only one offshore wind energy installation us 0 03 gw annex a so far 53 offshore wind farms are still pre under construction whose total installed capacity is 16 7 gw when the installation of new projects finished the whole global offshore wind farms capacity will be 35 6 gw slightly below the 42 gw forecast by the international energy agency iea for 2022 international energy agency 2017 for the goal of analysing the economics of offshore wind and more specifically their cost development a dataset comprising information about all operative offshore wind power plants worldwide was created annexe a the comprehensive dataset combines publicly available information from several project websites the dataset has 101 of 112 commercial offshore wind projects in total it comprises an investment volume of more than 65 billion euros offshore wind projects are highly capital cost intensive the initial financial investment makes up approximately three fourths of the total project lifetime cost this value is extremely high in comparison to conventional power stations where investment costs typically represent 40 of the project lifetime cost moreover the investment cost per mw in offshore wind is approximately 50 more expensive than in onshore wind this gap is mostly due to the costs of additional components underwater equipment construction and installation processes generally the economic value on an offshore turbine is 20 more expensive while the towers and foundations cost 2 5 times the total cost of an onshore project with the same installed capacity kitzing and morthorst 2015 the uk and germany lead the ranking of investment in offshore wind projects with almost 81 of the total investment in europe which reach 60 billion euros in asia the number of projects is less which suppose a total investment of 5315 million euros topping the list of asian countries is china with 92 of the money invested in the continent 3 1 offshore wind foundations most popular designs for wind offshore structures are monopiles jackets tripods or gravity based foundations o kelly and arshad 2016 each structure design has its own merits and strengths the current types of offshore wind foundations used in commercial projects are illustrated in fig 5 monopile the installation involves hydraulic hammering of the monopiles into the seabed which is typically 500 800 tons in weight with a diameter of 5 m 6 m and 50 m 60 m in length these types of structures are suitable for sites having a water depth ranging from 0 to 30 m the monopile foundation is used for most of the offshore wind farms especially in the european market for the following reasons the first one the soil in the north sea which requires relatively less effort on drilling of piles the second one most wind installations have been deployed in shallow waters areas with less than 30 m depth this support structure is the most suitable economically so far considering seafloor characteristics in europe 63 of operative offshore wind farms in 2018 adopted this foundation type by continents america uses this structure in 100 of the case europe in 70 and asia in 43 table 2 jacket structure typical jacket support structures are four legged piles with interconnected cross braces having a diameter of about 2 m the base piles are nailed inside the seabed to the adequate water depth with the support of pile sleeves these offshore structures are suitable for locations having a water depth between 25 m and 50 m currently there are 220 wind turbines supported by this foundation type the korean peninsula leads the installation of jackets with 100 of these structures installed in their waters due mainly to the water depth and meteorological conditions gravity base the gbs is generally a concrete based structure which consists of sand rock filled and iron ore filled inside the base and a central concrete or steel shaft from the transition piece to the turbine tower the gbs is suited for water depths greater than 20 m the gbs might be deemed as an alternative to the other support structures as the offshore wind power plants are planned to be constructed in greater size at deeper waters nevertheless annex a listed a significant number of danish wind farms nearshore where this foundation was used due to the shallow waters the deepest registered offshore wind farm with gravity base structures is blyth the uk with an average water depth of 35 5 m moreover 70 of operative wind farms foundations in asia such as the hydropower rudong i or hydropower rudong ii used this type of structure because the higher maturity in the construction process and installation procedures can minimise associated risk tripod the tripod structure is considered to be a relatively lightweight three legged steel jacket compared to a standard lattice structure under the central steel column which is below the turbines there is a steel frame that transfers the forces from the tower to the three steel piles piles are installed at each leg position to anchor the tripod to the seabed the three piles are driven into the seabed a range between 10 m and 20 m annexe a shows some projects as the globaltech i bard offshore 1 or trianel windpark borkum where the tripod is installed in transitional water depth these concepts were only implemented for the european continent considering the water depth and meteorological characteristics the most feasible sites featuring high wind potential for large scale development are in water deeper than 20 m besides the tripod can be more effective than monopile in the face of extreme events such as hurricanes or typhoons the monopolies require greater suction caissons or longer piles high rise pile cap hrpc the hrpc structure is suitable for sea areas with the water depth ranging from 0 m to 20 m applicable to soft soil foundation it can effectively resist seawater corrosion and is low in cost reliable and convenient to be constructed it comprises of a concrete bearing platform higher than the sea level and a group of steel pipe piles at the bottom of the bearing platform wherein the lower end of the steel pipe pile incline outward slightly similar to the previous structure the hrpc concept li et al 2017 only has been installed on the asian continent the 40 of foundations installed on this continent are hrpc all the offshore wind farms in vietnam use this type of support structure for their turbines suction bucket this technology can be visualised as upside down buckets which are lowered into the seabed to anchor the offshore structures the water is pumped out of the bucket thereby reducing the pressure inside the bucket skirt the formation of this negative pressure combined with the weight of the offshore foundation enables the latter to sink deeper into the seafloor the suction bucket installation process is easily reversible in the event of removal of the offshore foundation this technology is best suited for deep waters and large wind turbines and it does not require seabed preparation moreover this type of structure is more feasible economically because of the fast and straightforward installation procedure oh et al 2018 currently only xiangshui offshore wind farm in china installed these support structure type remote and deeper offshore wind sites will represent the future steps in this sector the new scenario will require new and more advanced structures moore et al 2018 a small number of the offshore wind farms studied in this research are located at water depths greater than 30 m based on that the monopile foundations are the most used structure nevertheless during the last years have seen an increase in the amount number of deeper waters locations as a result tripod jacket and gravity base foundations have been developed for these new scenarios table 2 shows that in the 18 9 gw installed worldwide 63 of foundations are monopile 12 are gravity base and high rise pile cap and 7 are jacket foundations based on the average water depth of operative wind turbines the deepest installation foundations are occupied by tripod and jacket 20 m 40 m followed by monopile 10 m 20 m and gravity base suction bucket and high rise pile cap less than 10 m similarly foundation costs are leading by tripod and jacket 4 m to 5 m followed by monopile 2 m and gravity base suction bucket and high rise pile cap less than 2 m 3 2 offshore wind turbines after the first offshore wind farm installed in 1991 eleven 450 kw turbines and a total capacity of 4 95 mw the increase in the distance to the shoreline has been the general trend voormolen et al 2016 this trend is based on the wind conditions higher wind speeds smoother and less turbulent airflows and open space larger offshore wind farms and high capacity turbines today 112 offshore wind farms with turbine capacity range of 500 kw to 8 mw exist offshore in an average water depth from 1m to 40 m due to these shallow waters the offshore turbines installed to date have been able to use conventional land based designs with upgraded electrical and corrosion control systems and foundations concrete bases or steel monopiles to anchor them to the seabed fig 5 table 1 shows europe leads the global distribution of wind turbines with 4173 turbines followed by asia and a great distance by america by countries the united kingdom and germany separately group a more significant number of turbines than the entire asian continent with a smaller number of installed turbines are denmark the netherlands belgium sweden ireland or finland on the other hand china dominates the offshore wind market in asia with a total number of 676 installed turbines followed by vietnam japan south korea and taiwan at the moment only 5 turbines are operative at america continent in the united states the energy production demands increased exponentially in the last decade that led to the continuous growth of offshore turbine installations accompanied by an increase in the unit rated power reaching 10 mw sethuraman et al 2017 table 3 shows the number of turbines and offshore wind farms in the function of the nominal turbine power the average turbine power is between 3 mw and 4 mw this power range comprises a total of 43 wind farms worldwide which means a total of 2366 installed turbines at the same time this supposes that almost 50 of the turbines currently operating globally have this range of nominal power in terms of continents the situation is repeated in the european case however it is different in the asian and american continent where the wind turbines capacity varies between 4 mw and 6 mw also both in europe and asia a few numbers of wind farms have generators below 2 mw in the european case these turbines were installed in the oldest wind farms that are still in operation in the asian countries the situation is different since as the offshore wind market is still in an early stage of development therefore these offshore wind turbines are more present in the domestic industry also a huge progress has been made in the offshore wind turbine capacity since 1995 fig 6 shows the evolution of wind turbines capacity on four years period time for the last 25 years in the first offshore wind farms a capacity of an average of around 70 kw was turned into machines with a nominal power of 5 mw or above in 2020 the average capacity of wind turbines will be 6 mw 3 2 1 offshore wind turbines manufacturers in 2018 there were 22 wind turbines manufacturers around the world all of them producing devices from 0 5 mw to 8 mw the market is divided among seven major manufacturers among which the german companies siemens senvion formerly repower and bard and the danish vestas bonus bordtank and wind world operate 77 of the worldwide market the largest manufacturers of offshore wind turbines are siemens and vestas with 3001 and 930 turbines respectively the largest operational wind turbine models classified according to their capacity and manufacturer are the following vestas v164 8 mw with 164 m rotor diameter siemens swt 7 0 154 senvion 6 2m126 united power 6 mw siemens swt 6 0 154 bard vm csic h 5mw xe128 5 mw senvion 5m and adwen ad 5 135 internationally there is still a significant gap in the designing and producing of large scale wind turbines it is mainly because the key technologies depend on imports and the quality of components needs improving the average nominal power of a single wind turbine at the worldwide level has not reached 3 mw while european market is moving to install generators with more than 7 mw with the expanding scale of offshore wind farms each wind turbine manufacturer is getting involved in the research on large size wind turbines table 4 shows the primary constructors in the world market offshore wind turbine the number of offshore wind farms the total number of operational turbines and the wind turbines full capacity installed by each constructor in the asian continent there are several wind farms in which part of their turbines belong to one or more manufacturers as an example the zhuhai guishan hai wind farm china has turbines supplied by united power and by mingyang additionally the comparison between annex a and table 4 shows the regional tendency of the turbine developers supplying their equipment in the area of influence of their headquarters only siemens and vestas are present in the asian market in the new projects the turbine manufacturers enter new markets turning the current situation into a more globalized system nevertheless the new turbines market becomes controlled by a smaller number of companies 3 3 distance to shore and water depth the majority of commercial offshore wind power plants operating to date were deployed within 20 km to the shoreline at a maximum average water depth of 30 m fig 7 currently the global averages of distance to shore and water depth are 18 8 km and 14 6 m respectively these dimensions for the power plants installed in europe have an averages of 23 3 km and 17 4 m while in asia were installed at an average distance to shore of 6 9 km and an average water depth of 6 7 m in america these dimensions have reached 4 5 km for distance from the coast and 25 5 m for the water depth annex a fig 8 shows the average distance from the coast and the water depth of the offshore wind farms by country the highest average water depth of an offshore wind farm 27 8 m is found in the german exclusive economic zone the turbines in vietnam 2 m japan 6 m finland 8 5 m and sweden 8 5 m are erected in very shallow waters the most remarkable average distances from the coast are in germany 52 7 km and belgium 35 km the offshore wind farm currently operative farther from shore is global tech 1 at a distance of 115 km from the german coast while japan hosts the farm with the lowest average distance to the coast 0 5 km the distance to shore and water depth are of economic importance because they influence both the investment spending and the operation and maintenance cost kota et al 2015 the costs associated with the installation process and grid connection increase with a higher distance to the shoreline also an increase in the water depth is reflected in foundations higher costs the shallow waters foundation costs including installation has an approximate value that oscillates between 1 5 m mw and 2 m mw these values wore exponentially increased proportionally to the water depth european environment agency 2014 3 4 the environmental impact of offshore wind energy the products released during the combustion of fossil fuels as carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o leads to environmental damage or health problems among others heal 2009 as opposed to fossil fuels wind energy in its role of renewable energy is characterised by its low emissions and energy conservation as presented in table 5 currently the offshore wind energy production grows at an accelerating rate that reaches up to 18 gw installed more than 13 million households benefit from this energy resource additionally the offshore wind farms deployment alleviates the energetic demands and contributes to environmental sustainability kaldellis and apostolou 2017 the current study identified a total annual reduction of co2 and so2 of 27 048 916 tons and 629 060 tons respectively the potential of offshore wind shows that the operative wind farm could supply enough energy to cover the energy demand of large population centres the united kingdom which leads the homes powered annually guarantee energy to cover the energy consumption of london or germany could provide electricity to ensure the electrical consume of berlin on the other hand the reduction of co2 and so2 is a mandatory achieve in international regulations as an example air pollution in china has been extreme the air quality has caused immense health damages for a long time in recent years pollution is becoming a political problem of utmost importance several regulations and directives have been implemented such as the air pollution prevention and control action plan hereinafter the action plan china state council 2013 other regions around the world have launched action plans on climate change dawn et al 2019 the growing economy not only increases the comfort levels of people but also increases the demand for electricity therefore offshore wind energy resource is come out as the best solution to maintain the balance be tween generation and demand while reducing significantly the harmful emissions 4 evaluation of offshore wind farms layout parameters the large offshore wind farms planned for extreme climate conditions and designed to reduce installation time and maintenance frequency is the research topic for the offshore wind developers these large scale projects will have associated with the need to improve the supply chain towards the establishment of coastal logistic centres to avoid constraints associated with conventional transport road rail moreover the near future offshore wind market will be characterised by larger rotors taller towers advanced materials autonomous monitoring systems and advanced electrical transmission systems among others in the following points is defined the highlights that the operative wind farms and their characteristics directed towards six core areas number of wind farms number of turbines installed capacity distance to shore water depth and turbine height the obtain results helps evaluate the critical factors in the fixed offshore wind farms layout and measure the global market evolution 4 1 number of wind farms vs number of turbines the total area occupied by offshore wind farms is approximately 6 100 km2 assuming the previous global average of 3 mw turbines installed per km2 volker et al 2017 that equates to a potential wind energy generating capacity of roughly 18 300 mw in this context two points are of particular importance the number of wind farms and wind turbines fig 9 represents the dimensions for currently operative offshore wind farms in the world it is shown that 96 of operative wind farms have between 0 and 120 turbines nevertheless the number of wind farms with more than 120 turbines is low the vast percentage 55 corresponds to wind farms with 0 40 turbines installed in correspondence with what was perceptible in fig 7 only the average number of turbines by the wind farm is superior to 40 devices in germany 61 the netherlands 61 the uk 60 and vietnam 51 in the same way there are only four megaprojects with more than 120 turbines installed gemini 150 greater gabbard 140 gwynt and mor 160 and london array 175 three of them in the uk and the other one in the netherlands annex a 4 2 wind farms and number of turbines vs installed capacity a conventional offshore wind farm usually has a significant number of generators which is proportional to the installed megawatts and outspread in the range of several kilometres so that there is a direct relation between wind farms installed capacity the number of wind farms and the average of turbines by a wind farm as shown in table 6 most of the operational wind farms 81 of operational wind farms have an installed capacity lower than 300 mw which adds up to a total of 2956 turbines of the 4995 installed fig 10 presents the number of turbines by the wind farm and the number of wind farms related to the installed capacity the number of turbines increases with the increase of the installed capacity of a wind farm nevertheless the number of wind plants is reduced with the growth of installed turbines by wind farm this last observation is related to the high capacity wind projects immaturity that only in the previous five years have been developing however the pattern could evolve in the following years annex b 4 3 distance to shore and water depth vs installed capacity the average water depth of offshore wind farms currently operative is 27 5 m the average distance to shore for those projects is 41 km the first floating offshore wind farm hywind scotland equinor 2018 has an average water depth twice as deep as that of other bottom fixed offshore wind farms nevertheless there are some areas not yet exploited that meet the conditions to deploy fixed platforms and that in the next years will be the locations of the offshore wind large scale projects fig 11 gives a general overview of the wind farms installed capacity and the relation with the depth and distance to shore nowadays the water depth of the majority of operative offshore wind farms varies between 0 m and 10 m and the distances to the coast of no greater than 10 km nevertheless the worldwide trend is characterized by the increase of water depth and distance to shore as a function of the installed wind power capacity table 7 the european sector leads this evolution in these wind farms characteristics in germany there are 47 of wind farms with a distance to shore superior to 50 km and in 32 of these installations the water depth exceeds 30 m the three main considerations to this evolution in these parameters are 1 the areas further from the coast have a greater wind potential therefore it is more attractive for the construction of wind farms 2 some countries have specific regulations for offshore wind restricting the spatial zones far away from the coast bailey et al 2014 an example of this regulations is the offshore energy strategic environmental assessment that excluded the twelve nautical mile territorial sea limit and all waters with water depths greater than 60 m in scotland and north ireland higgins and foley 2014 3 conflicts between offshore wind and other marine uses rudolph 2014 4 4 number of wind farms and turbines vs water depth as previously mentioned the offshore wind industry evolves to deeper waters this direction rep resents wind farm developers and maritime industry desire to harness wind energy resource at sea the average water depth for offshore wind farms worldwide is 14 6 m bard offshore 1 is the currently offshore wind farm installed to a most considerable depth 40 m in german waters it is clear from projects in pre and under construction which average water depth will increase annex b future installations announced will be deploying in average water depths up to 18 m beatrice offshore wind farm will be deployed in 2020 at 45 m water depth fig 12 shows the gross number of wind turbines and wind farms for various water depth intervals the number of wind farms falls as the depth of the water increases the number of facilities goes from 37 farms in depths ranging from 0 m to 8 m depth to 10 farms in the range of 32 m 40 m further the number of turbines installed increases in depths ranging from 0 m to 24 m and then reduces in the last intervals of depth it is therefore observable that up to 24 m water deep wind farms have a higher number of foundations installed 4 5 number of wind farms and turbines vs distance to shore the overwhelming majority of operative offshore wind farms are located nearshore less than 30 km to shore although the trend is gradually moving towards greater distances douglas westwood 2013 the distance increase allows to take advantage of the higher and steadier wind speeds found at greater distances from the shoreline and reduces turbines visual impact nevertheless the fixed bottom support structures are inapplicable with great depths due to the loading increases moreover deeper waters mean larger structural dimensions that are economically non viable at present fig 13 illustrates the number of wind farms and turbines deployed in 15 km ranges from the shoreline to an upper limit of 120 km the maximum distance corresponds to global tech i offshore wind farm situated 115 km from the german coast currently 98 offshore wind farms 4006 turbines are deployed at a distance from the shoreline less than 30 km above 30 km the number of wind farms is reduced there is only a small rebound in the range of 90 105 km generated by the wind parks sandbank bard offshore i and veja mate annex a 4 6 number of wind farms and turbines vs turbine height and diameter the offshore wind industry is observing an increase in average turbine size fig 6 fig 14 represents the main turbine dimensions as a function of the number of offshore wind farms installed and wind turbines deployed in the range that covers 65 m 135 m blades diameter is found the largest number of wind farms and turbines with 93 and 4236 respectively the diameter of a turbine is commonly proportional to the turbine height therefore in the range from 95 m to 165 m of altitude also hosts the highest percentage of turbines in this range there are operative 89 wind farms and 4032 turbines although the most significant number of deployed equipment moves in the range of dimensions described above the last segment that is characterized by housing the giant turbines represents 20 of the installed machines worldwide the first range of turbines in height were deployed in sweden the netherlands denmark and japan bockstigen se or tuno knob dk wind farms are an example of low height generators for its part superior dimensions turbines are installed almost entirely in the european continent in countries such as denmark germany or the uk an example of these turbines would be found in offshore wind farms as nissum bredning vind dk gode wind de and blyth uk 5 offshore wind projects in preconstruction or under constructions all around the world according to the offshore wind energy farms roadmap in 2018 the number of pre and under construction projects were equal to 53 fig 2 divided between 2 continents and 8 countries belgium 2 denmark 2 germany 8 the united kingdom 6 china 27 south korea 1 taiwan 1 and vietnam 6 annex b shows future offshore wind projects that will have a total installed capacity of 16 7 gw the capacity of these new projects is significantly larger than in the operational ones an example is the average capacity install by the wind farm this value is double going from the 169 mw of wind farms currently operating to 314 mw into the pre and under construction projects the development of such large scale projects brings the possibility to drive down costs in the offshore wind industry indeed there are clear indications in the energy industry that increasing projects size is a substantial driver of cost reduction by moving from the current project size to megaprojects there are some aspects where economies of scale could be achieved more efficient contracting and better risk sharing greater competition putting downward pressure on prices across parts of the value chain more cost effective geological surveys and environmental studies a greater desire for investing in optimising and integrating supply chains larger turbine size and next generation technologies for substructures could jointly deliver lower installation costs higher power output per unit of investment greater energy capture and lower o m cost faster and safer installation and operations could be facilitated by a more extensive fleet of bespoke and specialised vessels for offshore wind more mature technologies and processes would perform with higher reliability reducing operating costs and health and safety issues 5 1 future trends for offshore wind farms the patterns identified provides a context to understand the critical factors behind recent innovations using annexes a and b the real data of operative and pre under construction projects offer insight into global technology trends for the almost next decade with a focus on offshore wind farm capacities water depths distances to shore and number of turbines the discussion is focused mainly on the offshore wind worldwide evolution nevertheless a comparison between trends at the continental level is also provided fig 15 illustrates the trends based on global offshore wind projects that are in on the pre construction phase and under construction as a function of distance to shore and water depth this figure also used the values of new projects that have advanced beyond the site control phase and announced the bidding process the european and asian projects follow similar patterns in terms of distance to shore and water depth the evolution is positive with a significant increase in the parameters analysed the average of asia projects however extends to less than 10 km from shore as compared with some european projects that are sited up to 53 km from the coast table 7 an example of this variation between regions will be the peaks values of the projects list hornsea i wind farm de will take place at 120 km from shore while the huaneng dafeng ii wind farm ch will be located at 56 km to shore in the case of water depth european wind farms will range an average water depth superior to 31 m while asian farms only will reach the 12 m in spite of the differences between continents the global tendency is to increment both parameters the worldwide increase in distance to shore and water depth will be 38 and 21 respectively fig 16 represents the global and regional number of the offshore wind turbines and installed capacity by wind farm from currently operational to pre under construction projects the average of installed capacity by farm and the number of offshore wind turbines are continuing their upscaling trend for example the completion of the london array uk greater gabbard uk and gemini nl were the first commercial projects to install more than 100 turbines with a total capacity higher than 500 mw nevertheless an upgraded of technology will permit install wind farms with more than 150 turbines and 1000 mw of installed capacity as the case of hornsea i and ii respectively the turbines are suffering an update from the currently operative generators of up 8 mw of nominal power to the 9 5 mw turbines furthermore incorporating big size turbines in a project s design may also reduce the plant costs by having fewer machines installed the worldwide average installed capacity of wind farms in pre under construction is 314 mw a 21 increase from currently operative projects the number of turbines by installation increases slightly to 58 22 growth concerning operative projects these capacity averages are consistent directionally with longer term industry trends musial et al 2016 kitzing and morthorst 2015 by continents the variations of the percentages are significantly higher in europe the installed capacity and number of wind turbines increase by 44 and 27 respectively which means farms with an average of 71 turbines and a capacity of 500 mw while the variations in asia are of 43 to installed capacity and 46 for the number of turbines which would result in 214 mw and 51 turbines by wind farm table 7 5 2 future trends for offshore wind turbines the offshore wind industry push toward bigger machines show no sign of slowing down in the coming years the average rating of wind turbines worldwide is expected to reach 6 mw 37 above the current average most of this increase in growth will be due to happen in the european market with the uk and germany leading the charge rotor diameter growth and turbine height are also expected to continue unabated table 8 shows a worldwide increase of turbines diameter and height of installation of 23 and 19 respectively these increases although led by the european market will be closely accompanied by the asian homonym the turbines will have an average diameter of 156 m in europe and 134 m in asia this increase in the diameter will impact in the height of the turbines that will measure at 155 m in the offshore wind farms of asia and 184 m in the european installations moreover the turbines will move from an average capacity of 4 mw into 6 mw in the new offshore wind farms fig 17 shows the forecast functions in turbine dimensions and the number of turbines by a wind farm calculated from the original data annex a there is a proportional relation between turbine height and diameter this relation results from the foundation s design being for offshore where there are some system requirements and safety limits on the sea the economic penalties of increased foundation load and tower cost will typically outweigh any small energy gains from a much increased turbine height the data obtained do not deviate substantially from the trend line besides forecasting modern large turbines above 10 mw the results values are seen to be consistent with the same to the indicated by the respective manufacturers mhi vestas offshore wind a s 2018 siemens gamesa 2018 general electric 2018 finally the number of turbines by the wind farm is explained with a power curve the evolution of wind farms moves to vast wind farms but with fewer turbines the reduction in turbines is caused basically by the improve in the generators nominal power the increase in the size of the generator increases the wind farm installed capacity in a smaller number of foundations which reduces the costs 6 conclusions in this paper a study of offshore wind farms in operation worldwide has been presented at the same time the wind farms layout parameters as water depth distance to shore and number of turbines are analysed and interconnected permitting a general view of the current situation in addition a brief study of the pre and under construction projects is performed allowing to obtain the trends in the evolution of offshore wind in terms of the operative projects the gross worldwide capacity installed of almost 18 9 gw is led by european countries principally for the uk 7 3 gw and germany 5 4 gw followed by china 2 4 gw in asia continent consequently the economic investment reaches in the uk and germany 81 of the total europe investment which reaches 60 billion euros and 92 in china where the asia investment reaches 5 billion euros however evolution progress has been remarkably rapid and successful in other countries due to positive collaboration between government and industry when considering the types of generator 4 mw 6 mw is the most used range of options with a clear trend towards the first one basically due to the implantation of siemens 3001 units and vestas 930 units generators concerning wind farm layout the vast percentage of wind farms is composed of a number of turbines less to 40 besides 81 of operational wind farms have less than 300 mw installed regarding average water depth and average distance to shore 91 of 112 operative wind farms are located at a maximum depth of 24 m while that a 87 5 of installations are located less than 30 km from the coast concerning the turbine and tower dimensions more than 90 wind farms with supposing around 4100 turbines have a diameter between 65 m and 135 m and a height between 95 m and 165 m regarding the situation of pre under construction projects in the world the global trend in comparison with the operative projects shows an increase in the main dimensions of the wind farm layout this increases at world level reach 38 in the distance to shore 21 in water depth 21 installed capacity and 22 number of turbines by a wind farm a generalised increase characterises the forecasting for turbines dimensions in each group of data the parameters fitting into a positive trend line exploring projections of the analysed wind farms and how the offshore wind energy industry would evolve it is no surprise that the overall progress is being remarkably rapid and successful due to positive advances on the industry and the new technological developments looking further ahead the evolutionary attitude in europe has encouraged interest outside the continent in asia countries as china or vietnam continues with the path developed by countries like the uk germany or denmark on a cautionary note however it seems probable that substantial offshore developments will be concentrated in a limited number of countries as with onshore wind energy probably the uk and germany the main conclusions taken from the comparison between operative and pre under construction offshore wind energy farms are the increase in turbine dimensions and power the increase of wind farm dimensions and number of turbines the increase of water depth and distance to the shore of new wind projects the evolution to mega projects in countries as the uk and germany the worldwide turbines market is concentrated in a few number
