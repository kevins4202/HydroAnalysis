1550,aqueous solutions of micro nano bubbles mnbs containing ozone gas were injected through a napl contaminated glass bead column the glass column 15 cm 2 5 cm was packed with glass beads the first 12 cm was packed with coarse glass beads while much finer glass beads were used to pack the remaining 3 0 cm of the column decane was used as the representative napl to which an oil soluble fluorescence tracer was added the fluorescence tracer was considered as a constituent of the napl that readily reacts with ozone air and ozone containing oxygen were used to generate mnb solutions and injected through the column in addition h2o2 was introduced to the o3 containing mnb o3 mnb solution to investigate the effect of hydroxyl free radicals on the napl removal an ozone gas sparging experiment was also conducted for comparison after 72 h of o3 mnb application a significant mass of n decane 27 6 of the initial mass applied was removed from the column h2o2 injection into the column during o3 mnb application was effective in increasing the n decane mass removal by 22 compared to the o3 mnb experiment the rate of napl removal during o3 mnb flushing was significant although slower than ozone sparging during o3 mnb application fast decay of fluorescence was observed whereas during co injection of h2o2 and o3 mnb solutions only a slight change in the fluorescence was observed this indicates that oxidative degradation of napl during h2o2 and o3 mnb injection takes place only at the napl water interface due to the reactivity of hydroxyl free radical whereas ozone diffusion into napl induced the decay of the fluorescence tracer in the bulk napl the removal characteristics during mnb application and ozone gas sparging were investigated based on the analysis of napl using mass spectrophotometer when o3 mnb and h2o2 were co injected only n decane was detected in the napl while when o3 mnb was used for flushing oxidative products were found in the napl more hydrophilic compounds were found in the napl after ozone sparging this implies different removal mechanisms depending on the kind of oxidation agent and the state of oxidizing fluid based on the findings in this study the application of o3 mnb could be a feasible option for cleaning up napl contaminated aquifers keywords aquifer remediation micro nano bubbles napl ozone oxidation 1 introduction the subsurface environment can be contaminated by non aqueous phase liquids napls due to accidental releases from napl processing facilities once stabilized in an aquifer or the vadose zone they tend to persist at the location for extended periods of time serving as a contaminant source zones the fate of napls in the source zones differs depending on their physicochemical properties and the hydrogeological conditions napls include a wide spectrum of petroleum products with different aqueous solubility density microbial availability viscosity interfacial properties making it challenging to remove napl from the subsurface environment a number of subsurface remediation technologies have been developed depending on the nature of contaminants and hydrogeological conditions one practice for in situ napl removal is the application of chemicals to the source zone for oxidative contaminant degradation krembs et al 2010 this approach targets contaminants with low aqueous solubility low vapor pressure and being recalcitrant to biodegradation oxidizing agents include chemicals with high oxidizing potential oxygen and ozone are common gases that can be used for this purpose alcantara garduno et al 2008 kim et al 2013 nimmer et al 2000 water dissolved oxidizing agents are also used permanganate percarbonate and persulfate are examples of aqueous oxidizing agents kao et al 2008 the more powerful oxidizing agent hydroxyl free radical is often generated in situ by the mixing of chemicals e g ozone and hydrogen peroxide zero valent iron and hydrogen peroxide to degrade napl constituents in the source zone watts and teel 2005 tawabini 2014 the direct injection of gaseous oxidizing agent e g ozone is effective only in the radius of influence where the ozone containing gas is in contact with the napl the size of the radius of influence in the aquifer during gas sparging is very limited to the vicinity of the injection points mccray and falta 1996 although the radius of influence may be extended using surfactants kim et al 2004 the gas flow is still confined to a limited region at the same time the gas flows through higher permeable regions in the aquifer resulting in significant preferential flow leaving lower permeable regions un impacted tomlinson et al 2003 tsai 2007 in contrast aqueous phase oxidizing agents may flow through the aquifer sweeping both low and high permeable regions sung et al 2017 however water soluble oxidizing agents often contain heavy metals e g manganese which may be toxic to ecosystems or decomposes quickly in the aqueous solution limiting their potential for degradation of contaminants micro nano bubble mnb solutions may be a feasible option for the continuous introduction of gaseous oxidizing agents e g ozone to aquifers recently mnb solutions have received attention in the field of groundwater remediation due to its potential as an effective carrier of gaseous compounds in aqueous solutions mnbs are gas bubbles in the diameter range from sub micrometer to a few micrometers and are known to be stable in liquids at high internal gas pressures for substantial periods of time e g several days ushikubo et al 2010 early studies on mnbs focused on their generation characterization and physical properties in aqueous solutions alheshibri et al 2016 kwan and borden 2010 liu et al 2013 mnb solutions show typical properties of colloidal suspensions scattering light in aqueous solutions they shrink and disappear over time due to high gas pressures in the bubbles and the associated gas transfer to the bulk phase before they coagulate and float up to the water surface ozonation processes using mnbs containing gaseous ozone were found to significantly increase the degradation rate of a wide range of organic compounds in bulk solutions ikeura et al 2011 khuntia et al 2012 li et al 2009 takahashi et al 2012 yasuda and ban 2012 the transport study of mnb solutions through porous media confirmed that the solution flows in a plug flow manner when the bubbles are at micrometer scale choi et al 2008 other studies detected significant analogies to the transport of colloidal solutions such as the retention of mnbs in the interstices of porous media particles hamamoto et al 2017 2018 wan et al 2001 moreover mnb transport is affected by chemical properties i e zeta potential as well as the size of bubbles hamamoto et al 2018 introducing tiny air or oxygen bubbles into groundwater was also studied for their potential to enhance dissolved oxygen levels which may help to stimulate microbial communities for bioremediation li et al 2014 mnbs containing air or oxygen could be used to introduce oxygen into the aquifer over extended temporal and spatial scales at high concentrations for bioremediation of a napl contaminated source zone li et al 2014 whereas ozone containing mnbs o3 mnbs are generated in aqueous solution and applied for the more aggressive chemical treatment of napl agarwal et al 2016 hu and xia 2018 sung et al 2017 the overall mass transfer rate of ozone from mnbs to bulk water was increased and faster degradation of organic chemicals e g water soluble dye was also observed hu and xia 2018 only limited applications of mnbs at the field scale have been reported scheffer and van de ven 2010 despite its promising potential for degrading organic contaminants only a few studies have been performed on the effectiveness of o3 mnb solutions providing limited quantitative information for the remediation of napl contaminated porous media the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the mass removal of napl n decane from porous media glass beads using an o3 mnb solution a one dimensional bench scale column packed with glass beads of different sizes was used for the napl removal experiments the mass removal of napl from the column under different flushing conditions including air containing mnb solution o3 mnb and h2o2 mixture solution and bulk water was estimated and compared with that from an o3 mnb solution flushing experiment the purpose of using a mixture of o3 mnb and h2o2 solutions was to evaluate the effect of hydroxyl free radicals formed by the reaction of h2o2 and o3 molecules on napl removal the degradation of napl due to ozone gas sparging for the same experimental setting was also evaluated and compared to that from the mnb solution flushing experiments the characteristics of the oxidative reactions and the locations of those reactions during the o3 mnb the mixture of o3 mnb and h2o2 solution flushing and ozone gas sparging were investigated based on the gc ms analysis of the napl following treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials two different glass bead types 0 75 1 0 mm 0 05 0 15 mm diameter were used as the

shows a schematic of the experimental set up used in this study the water in the mnb solution reservoir was fed into the mnb generator ket 1 korea emb technology co ltd incheon city korea the mnb solution was circulated while a constant volume 50 l of mnb solution was maintained the fraction of mnb solution in the reservoir was replaced with fresh tap water at the rate of 1 0 l min while the solution was drained at the same rate to maintain constant temperature at 25 c gases were introduced to the mnb generator by control valves v 1 v 2 and v 3 an ozone generator model lab2b ozonia co was installed between the oxygen gas reservoir and mnb generator to produce the o3 mnb solution the ozone concentration in the gas effluent from the ozone generator was 43 5 0 2 g nm3 measured by the standard iodometric method provided by the international ozone association two black lamps were installed close to the column these lamps emit long wave uv light uv a which activated the fluorescence of the dye added to the n decane a reservoir of h2o2 solution was connected to the column by operating the peristaltic pump p 2 and the valve v 4 the h2o2 solution was introduced to the column the lower inlet part of the column 12 0 cm was packed with coarse glass beads 0 75 1 0 mm whereas the top 3 0 cm of the column outlet was packed with fine glass beads 0 05 0 15 mm the overall porosity of the column was 0 40 the column was connected to a peristaltic pump p 1 by which a constant flow of aqueous solution through the column was achieved all experiments were conducted at 25 2 c 2 3 experimental procedure 2 3 1 gas saturation change during mnb flushing the dry packed glass bead column described in the previous section was flushed with de gassed di water to achieve complete water saturation the water saturated column was then installed in the flow system fig 1 and flushed with air containing mnb air mnb solution the air mnb solution was generated using air fed to the mnb generator at the rate of 2 0 l min the air mnb solution was injected into the column using a peristaltic pump p 1 at the rate of 2 0 ml min the gas air saturation of the column was estimated based on the weight of the column each column was weighed at the beginning water saturated condition during mnb flushing and when the flushing experiment was completed upon completion of the air mnb flushing experiment the column was re saturated with di water by flushing the column with de gassed di water the re saturated column was then flushed with oxygen containing mnb o2 mnb solution the feed oxygen gas bypassed the ozone generator and was introduced directly to the mnb generator from the compressed oxygen reservoir the gas content in the column was estimated by the weight change of the column after the o2 mnb flushing experiment was completed the o3 mnb flushing experiment was conducted the experimental procedure was the same except ozone was fed to the mnb generator to produce ozone the oxygen reservoir was connected to the ozone generator at the flow rate of 2 0 l min all experiments were conducted in triplicate to measure the maximum air saturations 2 3 2 napl removal mnb flushing experiments mnb 1 4 the dry packed glass bead column was saturated by flushing the column with sufficient amount at least 10 pore volumes of de gassed di water about 10 ml of n decane solution containing 200 mg l fluorescence dye was injected into the column through the inlet at the bottom of the column using a glass syringe followed by flushing with di water at the rate of 10 ml min for 2 min the column was then flushed with di water at the rate of 2 ml min for 30 min leaving n decane at the residual saturation a series of partitioning tracer tests were conducted to evaluate the n decane saturation about 0 25 pore volume pv of the tracer solution containing dmp 830 mg l and bromide 30 mg l was injected into the column at the flowrate of 1 0 ml min using a high precision pump

available in previous studies e g jin et al 1995 the column was then installed in the mnb flushing system fig 1 for the control experiment mnb 1 table 1 the tap water in the water reservoir no mnb applied was introduced into the column at the flow rate of 2 0 ml min the flushing continued for 72 h photos of the fluorescence emission were taken during flushing with the black lamps on upon the completion of water flushing the column was weighed and flushed using degassed di water another set of tracer tests were conducted to evaluate the napl saturation after the flushing process after the flushing experiment and the tracer test the column was dismantled and the n decane left in the column was extracted using 100 ml of methylene chloride followed by gc analysis as previously described for the air mnb flushing experiment mnb 2 compressed air was fed into the mnb generator 2 0 l min the air mnb solution was introduced to the column in the same manner as described previously section 2 3 1 the mnb solution flushing continued for 72 h and photos of the fluorescence emission from the column under the black lamps were taken these photos were overlapped with a transparent grid film and the area where the fluorescence emission disappeared was estimated the column effluent was collected in a flask containing a pre determined volume of extraction solvent methylene chloride to measure the mass of n decane washed out of the column during mnb flushing after completion of the flushing process the weight of the column was measured the column was flushed using de gassed di water for re saturation tracer tests were conducted to measure n decane saturations before and after the air mnb flushing the flushing experiment mnb 3 using o3 mnb followed the same procedure as that of the air mnb experiment except the gas fed to the mnb generator was ozone after mnb 2 and mnb 3 experiments were completed the column weight changes were measured for the final gas saturations the h2o2 solution was applied for experiment mnb 4 during the o3 mnb flushing experiment h2o2 solution was injected using the pump p 2 and the valve v 4 while the o3 mnb solution was introduced into the column the injection rates of h2o2 and o3 mnb solutions were 0 50 ml min and 2 0 ml min respectively resulting in the total flow rate of 2 50 ml min the h2o2 concentration in the column was estimated to be 0 81 g l tracer tests were conducted before and after the flushing experiments as previously described table 1 lists the experimental conditions used in this study the final masses of n decane after the flushing experiments of mnb 2 mnb 3 and mnb 4 were measured using the same methods as mnb 1 all mnb experiments including the control mnb 1 were duplicated the methylene chloride extracts of the column after experiments mnb 3 and mnb 4 were analyzed using a gc ms 7890d 5977msd agilent technologies co to investigate any oxidative products formed in the napl phase during mnb flushing a capillary column ua 5 30 m frontier lab co japan was used for the gc analysis at the oven temperature of 150 250 c 5 c min ramping rate ms scan range was set to 10 800 m z 2 3 3 napl removal ozone sparging experiment mnb 5 the ozone sparging experiment mnb 5 was conducted ozone containing gas same gas used for mnb 3 and mnb 4 generated by the ozone generator was injected directly into the n decane loaded column at the gas flow rate of 2 0 ml min the same experimental procedure was used as for mnb flushing experiments except that ozone gas was introduced to the column instead of mnb solution the column packing process tracer tests for the n decane saturation before and after the sparging experiment and the analytical process for the methylene chloride extract of the column after the sparging process were the same as for the mnb flushing experiments described in the previous section 3 results and discussion 3 1 gas saturation change during mnb flushing fig 2 a shows the air saturation change during the mnb flushing process for the column with no napl present the air saturation increased at a constant rate up to approximately ten pore volumes and stabilized monotonic increase in the air saturation during the first few pore volumes suggests that all the bubbles were caught in the coarse medium due to the finer glass bead layer installed at the end of the column the accumulation of gas bubbles in the porous medium reported by hamamoto et al 2017 showed a similar pattern for the increase in the gas saturation s g volume of gas total void volume during mnb injection into homogeneous media when the s g in the column reached at a critical level 0 16 0 19 the gas started to migrate through the fine glass bead layer resulting in a stable overall trapped gas saturation in the column during the steady state condition no change in s g the aqueous solution flow rate decreased slightly from the set flow rate of 2 0 ml min due to gas bubbles in the column effluent the slopes of the linear increase up to 8 pore volumes are 0 0183 0 0180 and 0 0151 for o3 o2 and air mnb flushing respectively which correspond to gas contents mlgas mlsolution of 1 83 1 80 and 1 51 in the o3 o2 and air mnb solutions respectively using the mean diameter 4 9 3 3 μm of the bubbles o2 mnb estimated from the microscope observation fig s 1 in supplementary material the concentrations of bubbles for o3 o2 and air mnb solutions were 2 8 108 2 7 108 and 2 3 108 bubbles mlsolution respectively which are similar to those reported by wan et al 2001 but higher than for other studies i e hamamoto et al 2017 the difference in the bubble generation mechanism is considered to be responsible for the different bubble concentrations the s g at steady state was slightly different depending on the gas species in the bubbles fig 2 b it is obvious that the different gas contents in the mnb solutions were responsible for the different s g in the column however the reason for the higher gas content in the o3 mnb solution than other mnb solutions is not clear the s g values for columns with napl n decane present were higher than those measured for columns without napl fig 2 b with n decane blobs occupying pore space the size of the cross section available for flow was reduced resulting in more trapping of gas bubbles in the region packed with coarse glass beads as measured by hamamoto et al 2017 significantly lower zeta potential for o2 mnb note that the majority of gas content in o3 mnb is oxygen causes stronger repulsive force at the surface of the glass beads which excludes the volume of aqueous phase available for bubble transport the negative charge of the bubbles likely restricts bubble mobility through negatively charged media thus o3 mnbs with a lower zeta potential were trapped to a great extent in the interstices of the porous media than air mnbs increasing s g further in addition to the effect of narrowed flow paths due to n decane ganglia 3 2 changes in the fluorescence emission oxidation reaction in the napl phase since the fluorescence agent used in this study is soluble in n decane and loses its fluorescence emitting capability quickly when ozone is applied it is a good indicator of the oxidative condition in the oil phase no changes in the fluorescence emission were observed for the control experiment mnb 1 fig 3 a thus the water used in this study had little oxidative capability the fluorescence emission from the columns during experiments mnb 2 and mnb 4 decreased slightly over time fig 3 b and d the rates of fluorescence reduction during mnb 2 and mnb 4 were approximately the same fig 4 about 30 loss of fluorescence emission at the end of flushing 72 h the mass of n decane flushed out of the column during air mnb flushing mnb 2 is considered to be most responsible for the loss of fluorescence emission about 15 of the n decane was estimated to be washed out of the column based on the analysis of column effluent also n decane blobs might be mobilized particularly at the inlet side of the column due to the mnb solution flow leaving the n decane free zone fig 3 b air accumulation in front of the finer glass bead might force the n decane blobs out of the column in addition to the mass loss due to mobilization during the mnb 2 hydroxyl free radicals formed possibly due to the collapse of bubbles might also affect the degradation of the fluorescence agent takahashi et al 2007 lower changes in the fluorescence emission during o3 mnb h2o2 flushing mnb 4 were observed than anticipated fig 3 d with h2o2 solution mixed with the o3 mnb solution hydroxyl free radicals formed by the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and dissolved ozone peroxone process were expected to react with the fluorescence tracer considering the reactivity of hydroxyl free radicals fast decay of fluorescence was expected which did not take place in this study since the radicals are very short lived in the aqueous phase and very reactive and hydrophilic they may not have been able to diffuse into the n decane phase thus it is very likely that only organic molecules at the surface of n decane blobs reacted with the hydroxyl radicals while most fluorescence tracer molecules dissolved in the bulk napl did not react with the radical molecules the reduction of fluorescence during mnb 4 is considered to be the result of n decane mobilization 5 n decane flushed as estimated from column effluent analysis and oxidative reaction occurred primarily at the surface of the n decane phase when the column was flushed with the o3 mnb solution mnb 3 a faster decay of fluorescence emission loss of fluorescence over time was observed compared to mnb 2 and mnb 4 fig 3 c ozone is more soluble in n decane than in water bin 2006 and thus it is likely that aqueous ozone molecules partitioned into the n decane phase reacting with fluorescence tracer fluorescence emission during the ozone sparging process mnb 5 decreased at the highest rate among the experiments conducted in this study the direct supply of ozone gas into the column resulted in high s g 0 54 0 06 and likely more ozone dissolution into the n decane phase a rapid accumulation of ozone containing gas in the medium was observed particularly below the fine glass bead zone the gas saturation in the coarse glass bead region below the fine glass bead zone was expected to be even higher than the average s g 0 54 meaning more ozone mass flux to the n decane phase resulting in faster decay in the fluorescence emission in this region although it was expected that the ozone sparging process would be more efficient for maintaining oxidative conditions in the napl than other experiments performed in this study o3 mnb solution flushing could be a feasible remedial option based on the observation made in this study of diminishing fluorescence in the napl 3 3 oxidative mass removal of n decane fig 5 shows the n decane mass removal during the mnb solution flushing experiments mnb 2 to mnb 4 and ozone sparging mnb 5 note that the mass removal was estimated based on the n decane mass removal only by oxidative degradation excluding the mass flushed out of the column about 6 or 0 17 g of the n decane mass was estimated to be degraded during 72 h of the air mnb flushing experiment mnb 2 since the mass recovery of the control experiment mnb 1 was 103 1 1 not shown in fig 5 the mass removal ratio of mnb 2 was considered as marginal hydroxyl free radicals formed during the collapse of mnbs in the bulk water could be the cause of oxidative degradation during the air mnb flushing experiment mnb 2 the generation of hydroxyl free radicals during mnb 2 might be very limited because of the ph range of the mnb solution which was controlled at 7 0 0 5 note that acidic conditions are favorable for the generation of hydroxyl free radicals during mnb collapse takahashi et al 2007 the n decane mass removal percentages 27 6 and 26 0 for experiments mnb 3 and mnb 4 respectively were nearly identical whereas the mass 0 86 g removed during mnb 4 o3 mnb and h2o2 flushing was about 20 higher than mnb 3 this discrepancy between the removal ratio and mass removed comes from the difference in the initial n decane mass applied to the column oxidative degradation due to ozone molecules can be better evaluated by using napl with a low vapor pressure and low aqueous solubility e g n decane studies on ozone containing mnb often used dense napl e g trichloroethylene of which the high solubility and vapor pressure are mostly responsible for the mass removal during mnb flushing sung et al 2017 the n decane mass removal achieved in this study mnb 3 and mnb 4 is considered to be significant because it is comparable to that of mnb 5 ozone sparging as already mentioned in the previous section the oxidative reaction of ozone molecules partitioned into the n decane phase was confirmed by the reduction of fluorescence thus it is reasonable to conclude that n decane molecules reacted with ozone resulting in mass reduction the mechanism for the n decane mass removal during mnb 4 might be considerably different from that of mnb 3 hydrogen peroxide molecules introduced into the inlet of the column during mnb 4 reacted with ozone molecules peroxone process in the aqueous phase producing hydroxyl free radicals mitani et al 2002 weiss 1935 o 3 oh o 2 ho 2 o 2 o 3 h 2o 2 ho ho o 3 h o 2 o 2 due to the extremely high reactivity of hydroxyl free radical e0 2 73 v armstrong et al 2013 weiss 1935 they readily react with organic compounds with high rate constants nimmer et al 2000 the short lifetime of hydroxyl free radicals in the aqueous phase very likely kept them from partitioning into the n decane phase limiting the oxidation reaction only to the air napl interface since the rate of fluorescence emission change during mnb 4 was much lower than that of mnb 3 it is a reasonable argument that the majority of the oxidation reaction occurred at the napl water interface leaving the bulk napl unoxidized the difference in the reaction characteristics between mnb 3 and mnb 4 suggests a different remedial strategy for the use of micro nano bubbles when napl droplets spread out with large specific napl water interfacial area m2 m3 the addition of hydrogen peroxide during mnb flushing could induce fast oxidative degradation of napl whereas applying o3 mnb might be a better option for aquifers contaminated with large ganglia of napl since ozone is known to partition more into the organic liquid phase than water bin 2006 introducing ozone rather than hydroxyl free radical might be a better choice for the degradation of bulk napl based on the mass removal 1 14 g in 72 h of n decane during mnb 5 ozone sparging the o3 mnb flushing processes mnb 3 and mnb 4 were fairly efficient for the oxidative removal of n decane even though a small amount of ozone gas 1 5 1 8 by volume was applied during the mnb solution flushing experiments the n decane removal for mnb 3 and mnb 4 was almost 60 75 of that achieved by the ozone sparging process mnb 5 which used 100 gas flow with no liquid flow the n decane mass removal per unit volume of ozone gas g ml for mnb 3 and mnb 4 were 4 5 10 3 g ml and 5 5 10 3 g ml respectively which are much larger than that of mnb 5 1 3 10 5 g ml confirming the efficiency of the mnb application dissolved ozone in the aqueous phase during mnb flushing supplied additional ozone molecules for the oxidation reaction since mnb solutions are supposed to behave like aqueous solutions applying ozone as an oxidizing agent for the napl in mnb solutions could be advantageous under many field conditions 3 4 changes in the chemical composition during oxidation reaction the n decane saturations s n volume of n decane total void volume in the column at the end of 72 h of mnb flushing and sparging experiment were estimated using a partitioning tracer test the breakthrough curves for tracers before and after the experiments are shown in fig s 2 fig s 6 supplementary material the retardation factors r t of the partitioning tracer dmp were calculated and are shown in the figures the s n was estimated based on the r t values and the partitioning coefficient of n decane 11 5 thal jr et al 2007 fig 6 shows s n values estimated from the tracer tests and the mass extraction analyses after the flushing or sparging experiments were completed for mnb 4 s n from the tracer test is in good agreement with that from the mass extraction data however there was a substantial discrepancy between the values of s n estimated for mnb 3 the mass of n decane was overestimated by the tracer test which was due to the changes in the chemical composition in the napl phase as the oxidation reaction proceeded in the napl phase less hydrophobic reaction products were formed the reduction of napl hydrophobicity increased the tracer dmp partition and retardation factor resulting in higher s n this observation of a changing partitioning coefficient for dmp and napl due to changes in the napl chemical composition agrees with a previous study cho et al 2003 the effect of increased oxidized chemicals in the napl during mnb 5 was even more significant the r t after the sparging was larger than the initial value fig s 6 supplementary material this implies that the reduction of r t value due to the decreased napl volume during ozone sparging was overcome by the increased partitioning due to the increased fraction of more hydrophilic oxidants in the napl fig 7 shows the gc ms chromatogram of napl left after the mnb flushing experiments mnb 3 and mnb 4 few oxidized compounds were found for the sample methylene chloride extract of napl after flushing from mnb 4 meaning the majority of the oxidative reaction might have occurred at the napl water interface on the other hand several oxidized compounds were found for the extract sample from mnb 3 figs 7 a and 8 a also additional oxidized chemical species were found in the extract sample from mnb 5 fig 8 b it is reasonable to assume that these hydrophilic compounds e g nonanoic acid were produced in the napl during mnb 3 and some of them were washed out of the column during flushing no aqueous flow for mnb 5 left oxidation products in the napl whereas chemicals sufficiently oxidized to small molecular weights might be vaporized out of the napl and from the column this evidence indicates that the location of the redox reaction was different depending on the kind of active oxidizing agent hydroxyl free radical ozone and how it was applied aqueous phase gas phase analysis of pathways for the oxidative reaction was not attempted here which is considered beyond the scope of this study 4 summary bench scale experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of o3 mnb flushing on the removal of n decane napl from porous media it was found that significant removal of n decane was achieved by applying an aqueous solution of o3 mnb more mass of n decane was removed when hydrogen peroxide and thus hydroxyl free radicals was applied during the o3 mnb flushing process although the oxidative degradation of n decane was not as fast as that of ozone sparging at the same fluid mnb solution ozone gas flow rate mnb flushing can be an attractive option for the remediation of contaminated aquifers due to the liquid like physical characteristics of mnb solution depending on the physical state of ozone applied to the media ozone sparging o3 mnb flushing the location of the actual oxidative reaction was different with hydroxyl free radical peroxone process the reaction took place mostly at the napl water interface whereas ozone molecules partitioned in the napl during ozone sparging and o3 mnb flushing reacted with organic chemicals declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

during o3 mnb application was effective in increasing the n decane mass removal by 22 compared to the o3 mnb experiment the rate of napl removal during o3 mnb flushing was significant although slower than ozone sparging during o3 mnb application fast decay of fluorescence was observed whereas during co injection of h2o2 and o3 mnb solutions only a slight change in the fluorescence was observed this indicates that oxidative degradation of napl during h2o2 and o3 mnb injection takes place only at the napl water interface due to the reactivity of hydroxyl free radical whereas ozone diffusion into napl induced the decay of the fluorescence tracer in the bulk napl the removal characteristics during mnb application and ozone gas sparging were investigated based on the analysis of napl using mass spectrophotometer when o3 mnb and h2o2 were co injected only n decane was detected in the napl while when o3 mnb was used for flushing oxidative products were found in the napl more hydrophilic compounds were found in the napl after ozone sparging this implies different removal mechanisms depending on the kind of oxidation agent and the state of oxidizing fluid based on the findings in this study the application of o3 mnb could be a feasible option for cleaning up napl contaminated aquifers keywords aquifer remediation micro nano bubbles napl ozone oxidation 1 introduction the subsurface environment can be contaminated by non aqueous phase liquids napls due to accidental releases from napl processing facilities once stabilized in an aquifer or the vadose zone they tend to persist at the location for extended periods of time serving as a contaminant source zones the fate of napls in the source zones differs depending on their physicochemical properties and the hydrogeological conditions napls include a wide spectrum of petroleum products with different aqueous solubility density microbial availability viscosity interfacial properties making it challenging to remove napl from the subsurface environment a number of subsurface remediation technologies have been developed depending on the nature of contaminants and hydrogeological conditions one practice for in situ napl removal is the application of chemicals to the source zone for oxidative contaminant degradation krembs et al 2010 this approach targets contaminants with low aqueous solubility low vapor pressure and being recalcitrant to biodegradation oxidizing agents include chemicals with high oxidizing potential oxygen and ozone are common gases that can be used for this purpose alcantara garduno et al 2008 kim et al 2013 nimmer et al 2000 water dissolved oxidizing agents are also used permanganate percarbonate and persulfate are examples of aqueous oxidizing agents kao et al 2008 the more powerful oxidizing agent hydroxyl free radical is often generated in situ by the mixing of chemicals e g ozone and hydrogen peroxide zero valent iron and hydrogen peroxide to degrade napl constituents in the source zone watts and teel 2005 tawabini 2014 the direct injection of gaseous oxidizing agent e g ozone is effective only in the radius of influence where the ozone containing gas is in contact with the napl the size of the radius of influence in the aquifer during gas sparging is very limited to the vicinity of the injection points mccray and falta 1996 although the radius of influence may be extended using surfactants kim et al 2004 the gas flow is still confined to a limited region at the same time the gas flows through higher permeable regions in the aquifer resulting in significant preferential flow leaving lower permeable regions un impacted tomlinson et al 2003 tsai 2007 in contrast aqueous phase oxidizing agents may flow through the aquifer sweeping both low and high permeable regions sung et al 2017 however water soluble oxidizing agents often contain heavy metals e g manganese which may be toxic to ecosystems or decomposes quickly in the aqueous solution limiting their potential for degradation of contaminants micro nano bubble mnb solutions may be a feasible option for the continuous introduction of gaseous oxidizing agents e g ozone to aquifers recently mnb solutions have received attention in the field of groundwater remediation due to its potential as an effective carrier of gaseous compounds in aqueous solutions mnbs are gas bubbles in the diameter range from sub micrometer to a few micrometers and are known to be stable in liquids at high internal gas pressures for substantial periods of time e g several days ushikubo et al 2010 early studies on mnbs focused on their generation characterization and physical properties in aqueous solutions alheshibri et al 2016 kwan and borden 2010 liu et al 2013 mnb solutions show typical properties of colloidal suspensions scattering light in aqueous solutions they shrink and disappear over time due to high gas pressures in the bubbles and the associated gas transfer to the bulk phase before they coagulate and float up to the water surface ozonation processes using mnbs containing gaseous ozone were found to significantly increase the degradation rate of a wide range of organic compounds in bulk solutions ikeura et al 2011 khuntia et al 2012 li et al 2009 takahashi et al 2012 yasuda and ban 2012 the transport study of mnb solutions through porous media confirmed that the solution flows in a plug flow manner when the bubbles are at micrometer scale choi et al 2008 other studies detected significant analogies to the transport of colloidal solutions such as the retention of mnbs in the interstices of porous media particles hamamoto et al 2017 2018 wan et al 2001 moreover mnb transport is affected by chemical properties i e zeta potential as well as the size of bubbles hamamoto et al 2018 introducing tiny air or oxygen bubbles into groundwater was also studied for their potential to enhance dissolved oxygen levels which may help to stimulate microbial communities for bioremediation li et al 2014 mnbs containing air or oxygen could be used to introduce oxygen into the aquifer over extended temporal and spatial scales at high concentrations for bioremediation of a napl contaminated source zone li et al 2014 whereas ozone containing mnbs o3 mnbs are generated in aqueous solution and applied for the more aggressive chemical treatment of napl agarwal et al 2016 hu and xia 2018 sung et al 2017 the overall mass transfer rate of ozone from mnbs to bulk water was increased and faster degradation of organic chemicals e g water soluble dye was also observed hu and xia 2018 only limited applications of mnbs at the field scale have been reported scheffer and van de ven 2010 despite its promising potential for degrading organic contaminants only a few studies have been performed on the effectiveness of o3 mnb solutions providing limited quantitative information for the remediation of napl contaminated porous media the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the mass removal of napl n decane from porous media glass beads using an o3 mnb solution a one dimensional bench scale column packed with glass beads of different sizes was used for the napl removal experiments the mass removal of napl from the column under different flushing conditions including air containing mnb solution o3 mnb and h2o2 mixture solution and bulk water was estimated and compared with that from an o3 mnb solution flushing experiment the purpose of using a mixture of o3 mnb and h2o2 solutions was to evaluate the effect of hydroxyl free radicals formed by the reaction of h2o2 and o3 molecules on napl removal the degradation of napl due to ozone gas sparging for the same experimental setting was also evaluated and compared to that from the mnb solution flushing experiments the characteristics of the oxidative reactions and the locations of those reactions during the o3 mnb the mixture of o3 mnb and h2o2 solution flushing and ozone gas sparging were investigated based on the gc ms analysis of the napl following treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials two different glass bead types 0 75 1 0 mm 0 05 0 15 mm diameter were used as the

shows a schematic of the experimental set up used in this study the water in the mnb solution reservoir was fed into the mnb generator ket 1 korea emb technology co ltd incheon city korea the mnb solution was circulated while a constant volume 50 l of mnb solution was maintained the fraction of mnb solution in the reservoir was replaced with fresh tap water at the rate of 1 0 l min while the solution was drained at the same rate to maintain constant temperature at 25 c gases were introduced to the mnb generator by control valves v 1 v 2 and v 3 an ozone generator model lab2b ozonia co was installed between the oxygen gas reservoir and mnb generator to produce the o3 mnb solution the ozone concentration in the gas effluent from the ozone generator was 43 5 0 2 g nm3 measured by the standard iodometric method provided by the international ozone association two black lamps were installed close to the column these lamps emit long wave uv light uv a which activated the fluorescence of the dye added to the n decane a reservoir of h2o2 solution was connected to the column by operating the peristaltic pump p 2 and the valve v 4 the h2o2 solution was introduced to the column the lower inlet part of the column 12 0 cm was packed with coarse glass beads 0 75 1 0 mm whereas the top 3 0 cm of the column outlet was packed with fine glass beads 0 05 0 15 mm the overall porosity of the column was 0 40 the column was connected to a peristaltic pump p 1 by which a constant flow of aqueous solution through the column was achieved all experiments were conducted at 25 2 c 2 3 experimental procedure 2 3 1 gas saturation change during mnb flushing the dry packed glass bead column described in the previous section was flushed with de gassed di water to achieve complete water saturation the water saturated column was then installed in the flow system fig 1 and flushed with air containing mnb air mnb solution the air mnb solution was generated using air fed to the mnb generator at the rate of 2 0 l min the air mnb solution was injected into the column using a peristaltic pump p 1 at the rate of 2 0 ml min the gas air saturation of the column was estimated based on the weight of the column each column was weighed at the beginning water saturated condition during mnb flushing and when the flushing experiment was completed upon completion of the air mnb flushing experiment the column was re saturated with di water by flushing the column with de gassed di water the re saturated column was then flushed with oxygen containing mnb o2 mnb solution the feed oxygen gas bypassed the ozone generator and was introduced directly to the mnb generator from the compressed oxygen reservoir the gas content in the column was estimated by the weight change of the column after the o2 mnb flushing experiment was completed the o3 mnb flushing experiment was conducted the experimental procedure was the same except ozone was fed to the mnb generator to produce ozone the oxygen reservoir was connected to the ozone generator at the flow rate of 2 0 l min all experiments were conducted in triplicate to measure the maximum air saturations 2 3 2 napl removal mnb flushing experiments mnb 1 4 the dry packed glass bead column was saturated by flushing the column with sufficient amount at least 10 pore volumes of de gassed di water about 10 ml of n decane solution containing 200 mg l fluorescence dye was injected into the column through the inlet at the bottom of the column using a glass syringe followed by flushing with di water at the rate of 10 ml min for 2 min the column was then flushed with di water at the rate of 2 ml min for 30 min leaving n decane at the residual saturation a series of partitioning tracer tests were conducted to evaluate the n decane saturation about 0 25 pore volume pv of the tracer solution containing dmp 830 mg l and bromide 30 mg l was injected into the column at the flowrate of 1 0 ml min using a high precision pump

available in previous studies e g jin et al 1995 the column was then installed in the mnb flushing system fig 1 for the control experiment mnb 1 table 1 the tap water in the water reservoir no mnb applied was introduced into the column at the flow rate of 2 0 ml min the flushing continued for 72 h photos of the fluorescence emission were taken during flushing with the black lamps on upon the completion of water flushing the column was weighed and flushed using degassed di water another set of tracer tests were conducted to evaluate the napl saturation after the flushing process after the flushing experiment and the tracer test the column was dismantled and the n decane left in the column was extracted using 100 ml of methylene chloride followed by gc analysis as previously described for the air mnb flushing experiment mnb 2 compressed air was fed into the mnb generator 2 0 l min the air mnb solution was introduced to the column in the same manner as described previously section 2 3 1 the mnb solution flushing continued for 72 h and photos of the fluorescence emission from the column under the black lamps were taken these photos were overlapped with a transparent grid film and the area where the fluorescence emission disappeared was estimated the column effluent was collected in a flask containing a pre determined volume of extraction solvent methylene chloride to measure the mass of n decane washed out of the column during mnb flushing after completion of the flushing process the weight of the column was measured the column was flushed using de gassed di water for re saturation tracer tests were conducted to measure n decane saturations before and after the air mnb flushing the flushing experiment mnb 3 using o3 mnb followed the same procedure as that of the air mnb experiment except the gas fed to the mnb generator was ozone after mnb 2 and mnb 3 experiments were completed the column weight changes were measured for the final gas saturations the h2o2 solution was applied for experiment mnb 4 during the o3 mnb flushing experiment h2o2 solution was injected using the pump p 2 and the valve v 4 while the o3 mnb solution was introduced into the column the injection rates of h2o2 and o3 mnb solutions were 0 50 ml min and 2 0 ml min respectively resulting in the total flow rate of 2 50 ml min the h2o2 concentration in the column was estimated to be 0 81 g l tracer tests were conducted before and after the flushing experiments as previously described table 1 lists the experimental conditions used in this study the final masses of n decane after the flushing experiments of mnb 2 mnb 3 and mnb 4 were measured using the same methods as mnb 1 all mnb experiments including the control mnb 1 were duplicated the methylene chloride extracts of the column after experiments mnb 3 and mnb 4 were analyzed using a gc ms 7890d 5977msd agilent technologies co to investigate any oxidative products formed in the napl phase during mnb flushing a capillary column ua 5 30 m frontier lab co japan was used for the gc analysis at the oven temperature of 150 250 c 5 c min ramping rate ms scan range was set to 10 800 m z 2 3 3 napl removal ozone sparging experiment mnb 5 the ozone sparging experiment mnb 5 was conducted ozone containing gas same gas used for mnb 3 and mnb 4 generated by the ozone generator was injected directly into the n decane loaded column at the gas flow rate of 2 0 ml min the same experimental procedure was used as for mnb flushing experiments except that ozone gas was introduced to the column instead of mnb solution the column packing process tracer tests for the n decane saturation before and after the sparging experiment and the analytical process for the methylene chloride extract of the column after the sparging process were the same as for the mnb flushing experiments described in the previous section 3 results and discussion 3 1 gas saturation change during mnb flushing fig 2 a shows the air saturation change during the mnb flushing process for the column with no napl present the air saturation increased at a constant rate up to approximately ten pore volumes and stabilized monotonic increase in the air saturation during the first few pore volumes suggests that all the bubbles were caught in the coarse medium due to the finer glass bead layer installed at the end of the column the accumulation of gas bubbles in the porous medium reported by hamamoto et al 2017 showed a similar pattern for the increase in the gas saturation s g volume of gas total void volume during mnb injection into homogeneous media when the s g in the column reached at a critical level 0 16 0 19 the gas started to migrate through the fine glass bead layer resulting in a stable overall trapped gas saturation in the column during the steady state condition no change in s g the aqueous solution flow rate decreased slightly from the set flow rate of 2 0 ml min due to gas bubbles in the column effluent the slopes of the linear increase up to 8 pore volumes are 0 0183 0 0180 and 0 0151 for o3 o2 and air mnb flushing respectively which correspond to gas contents mlgas mlsolution of 1 83 1 80 and 1 51 in the o3 o2 and air mnb solutions respectively using the mean diameter 4 9 3 3 μm of the bubbles o2 mnb estimated from the microscope observation fig s 1 in supplementary material the concentrations of bubbles for o3 o2 and air mnb solutions were 2 8 108 2 7 108 and 2 3 108 bubbles mlsolution respectively which are similar to those reported by wan et al 2001 but higher than for other studies i e hamamoto et al 2017 the difference in the bubble generation mechanism is considered to be responsible for the different bubble concentrations the s g at steady state was slightly different depending on the gas species in the bubbles fig 2 b it is obvious that the different gas contents in the mnb solutions were responsible for the different s g in the column however the reason for the higher gas content in the o3 mnb solution than other mnb solutions is not clear the s g values for columns with napl n decane present were higher than those measured for columns without napl fig 2 b with n decane blobs occupying pore space the size of the cross section available for flow was reduced resulting in more trapping of gas bubbles in the region packed with coarse glass beads as measured by hamamoto et al 2017 significantly lower zeta potential for o2 mnb note that the majority of gas content in o3 mnb is oxygen causes stronger repulsive force at the surface of the glass beads which excludes the volume of aqueous phase available for bubble transport the negative charge of the bubbles likely restricts bubble mobility through negatively charged media thus o3 mnbs with a lower zeta potential were trapped to a great extent in the interstices of the porous media than air mnbs increasing s g further in addition to the effect of narrowed flow paths due to n decane ganglia 3 2 changes in the fluorescence emission oxidation reaction in the napl phase since the fluorescence agent used in this study is soluble in n decane and loses its fluorescence emitting capability quickly when ozone is applied it is a good indicator of the oxidative condition in the oil phase no changes in the fluorescence emission were observed for the control experiment mnb 1 fig 3 a thus the water used in this study had little oxidative capability the fluorescence emission from the columns during experiments mnb 2 and mnb 4 decreased slightly over time fig 3 b and d the rates of fluorescence reduction during mnb 2 and mnb 4 were approximately the same fig 4 about 30 loss of fluorescence emission at the end of flushing 72 h the mass of n decane flushed out of the column during air mnb flushing mnb 2 is considered to be most responsible for the loss of fluorescence emission about 15 of the n decane was estimated to be washed out of the column based on the analysis of column effluent also n decane blobs might be mobilized particularly at the inlet side of the column due to the mnb solution flow leaving the n decane free zone fig 3 b air accumulation in front of the finer glass bead might force the n decane blobs out of the column in addition to the mass loss due to mobilization during the mnb 2 hydroxyl free radicals formed possibly due to the collapse of bubbles might also affect the degradation of the fluorescence agent takahashi et al 2007 lower changes in the fluorescence emission during o3 mnb h2o2 flushing mnb 4 were observed than anticipated fig 3 d with h2o2 solution mixed with the o3 mnb solution hydroxyl free radicals formed by the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and dissolved ozone peroxone process were expected to react with the fluorescence tracer considering the reactivity of hydroxyl free radicals fast decay of fluorescence was expected which did not take place in this study since the radicals are very short lived in the aqueous phase and very reactive and hydrophilic they may not have been able to diffuse into the n decane phase thus it is very likely that only organic molecules at the surface of n decane blobs reacted with the hydroxyl radicals while most fluorescence tracer molecules dissolved in the bulk napl did not react with the radical molecules the reduction of fluorescence during mnb 4 is considered to be the result of n decane mobilization 5 n decane flushed as estimated from column effluent analysis and oxidative reaction occurred primarily at the surface of the n decane phase when the column was flushed with the o3 mnb solution mnb 3 a faster decay of fluorescence emission loss of fluorescence over time was observed compared to mnb 2 and mnb 4 fig 3 c ozone is more soluble in n decane than in water bin 2006 and thus it is likely that aqueous ozone molecules partitioned into the n decane phase reacting with fluorescence tracer fluorescence emission during the ozone sparging process mnb 5 decreased at the highest rate among the experiments conducted in this study the direct supply of ozone gas into the column resulted in high s g 0 54 0 06 and likely more ozone dissolution into the n decane phase a rapid accumulation of ozone containing gas in the medium was observed particularly below the fine glass bead zone the gas saturation in the coarse glass bead region below the fine glass bead zone was expected to be even higher than the average s g 0 54 meaning more ozone mass flux to the n decane phase resulting in faster decay in the fluorescence emission in this region although it was expected that the ozone sparging process would be more efficient for maintaining oxidative conditions in the napl than other experiments performed in this study o3 mnb solution flushing could be a feasible remedial option based on the observation made in this study of diminishing fluorescence in the napl 3 3 oxidative mass removal of n decane fig 5 shows the n decane mass removal during the mnb solution flushing experiments mnb 2 to mnb 4 and ozone sparging mnb 5 note that the mass removal was estimated based on the n decane mass removal only by oxidative degradation excluding the mass flushed out of the column about 6 or 0 17 g of the n decane mass was estimated to be degraded during 72 h of the air mnb flushing experiment mnb 2 since the mass recovery of the control experiment mnb 1 was 103 1 1 not shown in fig 5 the mass removal ratio of mnb 2 was considered as marginal hydroxyl free radicals formed during the collapse of mnbs in the bulk water could be the cause of oxidative degradation during the air mnb flushing experiment mnb 2 the generation of hydroxyl free radicals during mnb 2 might be very limited because of the ph range of the mnb solution which was controlled at 7 0 0 5 note that acidic conditions are favorable for the generation of hydroxyl free radicals during mnb collapse takahashi et al 2007 the n decane mass removal percentages 27 6 and 26 0 for experiments mnb 3 and mnb 4 respectively were nearly identical whereas the mass 0 86 g removed during mnb 4 o3 mnb and h2o2 flushing was about 20 higher than mnb 3 this discrepancy between the removal ratio and mass removed comes from the difference in the initial n decane mass applied to the column oxidative degradation due to ozone molecules can be better evaluated by using napl with a low vapor pressure and low aqueous solubility e g n decane studies on ozone containing mnb often used dense napl e g trichloroethylene of which the high solubility and vapor pressure are mostly responsible for the mass removal during mnb flushing sung et al 2017 the n decane mass removal achieved in this study mnb 3 and mnb 4 is considered to be significant because it is comparable to that of mnb 5 ozone sparging as already mentioned in the previous section the oxidative reaction of ozone molecules partitioned into the n decane phase was confirmed by the reduction of fluorescence thus it is reasonable to conclude that n decane molecules reacted with ozone resulting in mass reduction the mechanism for the n decane mass removal during mnb 4 might be considerably different from that of mnb 3 hydrogen peroxide molecules introduced into the inlet of the column during mnb 4 reacted with ozone molecules peroxone process in the aqueous phase producing hydroxyl free radicals mitani et al 2002 weiss 1935 o 3 oh o 2 ho 2 o 2 o 3 h 2o 2 ho ho o 3 h o 2 o 2 due to the extremely high reactivity of hydroxyl free radical e0 2 73 v armstrong et al 2013 weiss 1935 they readily react with organic compounds with high rate constants nimmer et al 2000 the short lifetime of hydroxyl free radicals in the aqueous phase very likely kept them from partitioning into the n decane phase limiting the oxidation reaction only to the air napl interface since the rate of fluorescence emission change during mnb 4 was much lower than that of mnb 3 it is a reasonable argument that the majority of the oxidation reaction occurred at the napl water interface leaving the bulk napl unoxidized the difference in the reaction characteristics between mnb 3 and mnb 4 suggests a different remedial strategy for the use of micro nano bubbles when napl droplets spread out with large specific napl water interfacial area m2 m3 the addition of hydrogen peroxide during mnb flushing could induce fast oxidative degradation of napl whereas applying o3 mnb might be a better option for aquifers contaminated with large ganglia of napl since ozone is known to partition more into the organic liquid phase than water bin 2006 introducing ozone rather than hydroxyl free radical might be a better choice for the degradation of bulk napl based on the mass removal 1 14 g in 72 h of n decane during mnb 5 ozone sparging the o3 mnb flushing processes mnb 3 and mnb 4 were fairly efficient for the oxidative removal of n decane even though a small amount of ozone gas 1 5 1 8 by volume was applied during the mnb solution flushing experiments the n decane removal for mnb 3 and mnb 4 was almost 60 75 of that achieved by the ozone sparging process mnb 5 which used 100 gas flow with no liquid flow the n decane mass removal per unit volume of ozone gas g ml for mnb 3 and mnb 4 were 4 5 10 3 g ml and 5 5 10 3 g ml respectively which are much larger than that of mnb 5 1 3 10 5 g ml confirming the efficiency of the mnb application dissolved ozone in the aqueous phase during mnb flushing supplied additional ozone molecules for the oxidation reaction since mnb solutions are supposed to behave like aqueous solutions applying ozone as an oxidizing agent for the napl in mnb solutions could be advantageous under many field conditions 3 4 changes in the chemical composition during oxidation reaction the n decane saturations s n volume of n decane total void volume in the column at the end of 72 h of mnb flushing and sparging experiment were estimated using a partitioning tracer test the breakthrough curves for tracers before and after the experiments are shown in fig s 2 fig s 6 supplementary material the retardation factors r t of the partitioning tracer dmp were calculated and are shown in the figures the s n was estimated based on the r t values and the partitioning coefficient of n decane 11 5 thal jr et al 2007 fig 6 shows s n values estimated from the tracer tests and the mass extraction analyses after the flushing or sparging experiments were completed for mnb 4 s n from the tracer test is in good agreement with that from the mass extraction data however there was a substantial discrepancy between the values of s n estimated for mnb 3 the mass of n decane was overestimated by the tracer test which was due to the changes in the chemical composition in the napl phase as the oxidation reaction proceeded in the napl phase less hydrophobic reaction products were formed the reduction of napl hydrophobicity increased the tracer dmp partition and retardation factor resulting in higher s n this observation of a changing partitioning coefficient for dmp and napl due to changes in the napl chemical composition agrees with a previous study cho et al 2003 the effect of increased oxidized chemicals in the napl during mnb 5 was even more significant the r t after the sparging was larger than the initial value fig s 6 supplementary material this implies that the reduction of r t value due to the decreased napl volume during ozone sparging was overcome by the increased partitioning due to the increased fraction of more hydrophilic oxidants in the napl fig 7 shows the gc ms chromatogram of napl left after the mnb flushing experiments mnb 3 and mnb 4 few oxidized compounds were found for the sample methylene chloride extract of napl after flushing from mnb 4 meaning the majority of the oxidative reaction might have occurred at the napl water interface on the other hand several oxidized compounds were found for the extract sample from mnb 3 figs 7 a and 8 a also additional oxidized chemical species were found in the extract sample from mnb 5 fig 8 b it is reasonable to assume that these hydrophilic compounds e g nonanoic acid were produced in the napl during mnb 3 and some of them were washed out of the column during flushing no aqueous flow for mnb 5 left oxidation products in the napl whereas chemicals sufficiently oxidized to small molecular weights might be vaporized out of the napl and from the column this evidence indicates that the location of the redox reaction was different depending on the kind of active oxidizing agent hydroxyl free radical ozone and how it was applied aqueous phase gas phase analysis of pathways for the oxidative reaction was not attempted here which is considered beyond the scope of this study 4 summary bench scale experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of o3 mnb flushing on the removal of n decane napl from porous media it was found that significant removal of n decane was achieved by applying an aqueous solution of o3 mnb more mass of n decane was removed when hydrogen peroxide and thus hydroxyl free radicals was applied during the o3 mnb flushing process although the oxidative degradation of n decane was not as fast as that of ozone sparging at the same fluid mnb solution ozone gas flow rate mnb flushing can be an attractive option for the remediation of contaminated aquifers due to the liquid like physical characteristics of mnb solution depending on the physical state of ozone applied to the media ozone sparging o3 mnb flushing the location of the actual oxidative reaction was different with hydroxyl free radical peroxone process the reaction took place mostly at the napl water interface whereas ozone molecules partitioned in the napl during ozone sparging and o3 mnb flushing reacted with organic chemicals declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

1551,mass transfer in porous media resulting from dispersion occurs in a wide variety of applications such as water treatment flow batteries flow in aquifers enhanced oil recovery and packed bed reactors the underlying mechanisms of dispersion are the molecular diffusion superimposed on the advective transport induced by the fluid flow modeling dispersion in pore networks can be performed at a much lower computational cost compared to that in direct numerical simulations dns such as finite element or the lattice boltzmann methods so it can be regarded as a suitable alternative provided its accuracy is sufficient the most common approach to model dispersion in network models is based on the first order upwind scheme despite its known limitations in terms of accuracy for certain flow and transport regimes in this study three alternative pore scale models for dispersion which are more accurate than the existing ones were derived and tested in pore network simulations these models were adopted from the cfd literature and are based on a spatial discretization of the advection diffusion equation using the hybrid and power law finite difference schemes and the exact solution of the one dimensional advection diffusion equation finally considering dispersion problems over arbitrary porous structures consisting of stick and ball geometries and different flow and mass transfer arrangements the developed models were validated validation was carried out through comparisons between results obtained with dns using a finite element solver and those from pore network simulations it is shown that under a wide range of dispersion regimes up to the onset of the dispersion power law regime the relative error with respect to dns results introduced by the power law and exact solution based models is consistently below 1 whereas the use of the upwind scheme leads to 10 of relative error depending on the dispersion regime all the dispersion models developed in this study

such as in electrochemical water treatment smith 2017 flow batteries kok et al 2018 contaminant transport in aquifers anderson et al 2015 emami meybodi et al 2015 carbon dioxide sequestration dashtian et al 2019 enhanced oil recovery miller et al 1998 fenwick and blunt 1998 reactive flow in packed bed reactors gunn 1987 viscous fingering rabbani et al 2018 drying and precipitation processes dashtian et al 2018 and many more the hydrodynamic dispersion or dispersion for brevity is a mixing process that occurs between two miscible fluids in contact which each other dispersion occurs in the presence of concentration and pressure gradients concentration gradients give rise to diffusion of solute in the solvent which can be described using fick s first law of diffusion in addition pressure gradients result in an additional mixing of the solute as the solvent flows through the porous medium also known as the convective mixing characterized by a nonuniform velocity field due to the internal structural disorder sahimi 2011 several approaches for modeling dispersion in porous media have been used in the literature among which one can cite the continuum approach plumb and whitaker 1988 dou et al 2018 the first passage time and random walk simulation hughes and sahimi 1982 sahimi et al 1986a sahimi et al 1986b sahimi 1987 sahimi and imdakm 1988 berkowitz and braester 1991 the lagrangian methods where the movement of solute particles is followed saffman 1960 haring and greenkorn 1970 and the probability propagation algorithm de arcangelis et al 1986 note that while probabilistic models such as the work of levy and berkowitz levy and berkowitz 2003 based on monte carlo simulations provide a convenient way for determining the dispersion coefficient for a given porous medium they are not feasible for conducting proper transport simulations at pore scale this is because these methods operate based on averaging out the results obtained from hundreds if not thousands of individual probabilistic simulations in the continuum approach different averaging techniques such as the ensemble averaging koch and brady 1985 and the volume averaging plumb and whitaker 1988 methods have been used to derive macroscopic averaged equations plumb and whitaker 1988 plumb and whitaker 1988 derived a large scale advection dispersion equation from the volume averaging of the microscopic advection diffusion equation under certain length scale constraints plumb and whitaker 1988 the obtained equation in terms of the volume averaged solute concentration c is given by 1 ε c t ε v c ε d c where ε is porosity t is time v is the fluid velocity vector and d is the dispersion coefficient tensor which depends on the molecular diffusion and on the hydrodynamic transport at pore scale accurate evaluation of this macroscopic tensor requires the solution of a pore scale closure problem that resembles the advection diffusion equation plumb and whitaker 1988 acharya et al 2007a this task is feasible at low computational costs when a geometrical model of the pore space is available however it appears that the solution of the closure problem is not easier than numerically solving the pore scale advection diffusion problem itself when the microscopic disorder does not allow the extraction of a numerically manageable geometrical model of the porous medium sahimi 2011 for these reasons the use of pore network models popular for their low computational costs has emerged as an alternative for those based on the continuum approach mehmani and tchelepi 2017 blunt et al 2002 sadeghi et al 2017 bultreys et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 de vries et al 2017 deterministic discrete pore scale models describing non reactive dispersion in a network model are generally based on the one dimensional 1d advection diffusion equation which is given in the continuum form as follows 2 c t v c d m c where c is the local concentration of the chemical species and d m is the molecular diffusion coefficient several models have been derived using eq 2 and the form of discrete conservation equations varies depending on the adopted discretization schemes however accurate models valid over a wide range of dispersion regimes are still lacking in the literature recently yang et al 2016 published an extensive comparison between different simulation methods considering pore scale flow and solute transport problems the methods used included the pore network modeling approach as well as various direct numerical simulation dns methods yang et al 2016 their results suggest that the network approach leads to more dispersive concentration profiles this error may be attributed to the mixed cell assumption which states that pores are considered as well mixed entities in terms of all physical quantities the same behavior was also reported before by oostrom et al 2016 in a study in which they compared the results from several pore scale continuum and pore network models with micromodel experiments oostrom et al 2016 in addition to the mixed cell assumption the error could also be due to numerical considerations which include the treatment of the advective term the pore scale model presented in this study helps to remedy the latter issue and is a forward step toward truly predictive pore network modeling the present study is focused on the pore scale discretization used in the pore network modeling mixed cell method and a special attention is given to the accuracy of the commonly used upwind scheme moreover other models that are theoretically more accurate than the existing ones are presented that are valid over a wide range of dispersion regimes diffusion transition and the onset of the power law regimes and their numerical implementation is as simple as the existing ones this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the background regarding dispersion modeling in pore networks is discussed with a focus on the most commonly used dispersion models in the mixed cell method approach and their limitations then in section 3 the derivation of three alternative and more accurate discrete pore scale models tailored for use in pore network models is presented the first two models are based on a discretization of the one dimensional advection diffusion equation using the hybrid and power law differencing schemes respectively the third and the most accurate one is based on the exact solution of the one dimensional advection diffusion problem subsequently the dispersion problems considered in this study for the validation of the developed models are defined in section 4 the detailed numerical implementation for solving these problems is also described in section 4 the results of the simulations of different dispersion problems are presented in section 5 the pore network results were compared with the most common approach in the literature that is based on the upwind discretization scheme in addition dns using the finite element method were also carried out and used as a reference for comparisons and error analysis it should be added that in this manuscript the term error is only used for convenience and actually it refers to the deviation of the results obtained from pore network modeling from those of the dns 2 background the pore network is a simplified representation of the real porous medium geometry which consists of a set of pores interconnected by imaginary throats idealized shapes are assigned to pores and throats for simplicity regarding the conservation equations to be considered most commonly pores and throats are represented by spheres and cylinders respectively whereas in the computational fluid dynamics cfd continuum approach conservation equations are commonly considered over discrete control volumes pores and throats are used in pore network modeling to enforce conservation of physical quantities it must be noted that generally only pores are considered for applying conservation equations in this study the pore network modeling mixed cell yang et al 2016 method is adopted this approach offers simplicity and computational efficiency thus enabling the pore scale simulation of a substantially sized domain in this method all the void volume of the porous medium is assigned to the pores and the throats are considered to have no volume note that assigning zero volume to throats is only a numerical workaround for transient simulations or for certain cases in the presence of source sink terms this is because the rate of mass accumulation is proportional to volume and since the mass balance is only written for pores assigning nonzero throat volumes leads to an overestimated mass accumulation in pores at any rate conservation equations are applied over the pores and perfect mixing of the solute in the pore is assumed this assumption of perfect mixing is robust at low péclet numbers i e pe 1 where diffusion is dominant compared to advection the péclet number defined later in this section is the ratio of advective to diffusive driving forces in some recent works yang et al 2016 mehmani and balhoff 2015 it was shown that for péclet numbers up to 257 the assumption of perfect mixing within pores has a negligible impact on longitudinal macroscopic dispersion in disordered sphere packs in these studies yang et al 2016 mehmani and balhoff 2015 the péclet number was defined as the ratio between the interstitial fluid velocity times the grain diameter and the molecular diffusion hence the use of the mixed cell method for modeling dispersion can be extended for moderate to high pe numbers in disordered porous media however for ordered porous structures the mixed cell method should be reserved only for situations where diffusion is dominant as confirmed by some micromodel experiments oostrom et al 2016 willingham et al 2008 moreover the mixed cell method ignores the impact of non uniform velocity profiles in pores and throats on the dispersion in a similar way to the perfect mixing assumption considering uniform velocity profiles was found to have a negligible effect on longitudinal dispersion in disordered media yang et al 2016 mehmani and balhoff 2015 this aspect is explored in the present work below in pore network modeling based on the mixed cell method two discrete dispersion pore scale models are commonly used in the literature these models both result from the discretization of the 1d form of the advection diffusion equation eq 2 over individual throats in the network the first method mehmani et al 2012 xiong et al 2015 2016 huang et al 2016 is based on the central differencing discretization scheme for the diffusive flux wherein the advective term is added as a correction term to the diffusive flux the species conservation equation at steady state for an arbitrary pore i is given under the following general form 3 j 1 n i g ij d q ij c i j 1 n i g ij d q ij c j 0 i 1 2 n p where i is the pore of interest j the neighboring pores n i the number of neighbor pores n p the total number of pores in the network c the local concentration of species g ij d the diffusive conductance of the pore throat pore assembly or conduit and q ij is the throat flow rate the diffusive conductance g ij d can be given from the linear resistor theory for resistors in series gostick et al 2007 by 4 g ij d 1 g i d 1 g ij d 1 g j d 1 with the pore diffusive conductance g i being 5 g i d a i d s l i such that a i is the cross section area of pore i l i its length here length of a pore is its radius and d s the open space diffusion coefficient the diffusive conductance of throat ij and pore j are computed in the same manner assuming an incompressible flow of a newtonian fluid under isothermal conditions in the viscous dominated regime the mass conservation equation over each pore i of the network is given by 6 j 1 n i g ij h p i p j 0 i 1 2 n p where p i is the pressure in pore i and g ij h is the hydraulic conductance of the pore throat pore assembly and is given by 7 g ij h 1 g i h 1 g ij h 1 g j h 1 such that g i h is the hydraulic conductance of pore i and can be calculated using the hagen poiseuille model sutera and skalak 1993 by 8 g i h π 128 μ d i 4 l i where μ is the fluid dynamic viscosity and d i is the diameter of pore i the hydraulic conductance of throat ij and pore j are computed in the same manner the flow rate q ij can then be calculated using the following equation 9 q ij g ij h p i p j the diffusive term in the pore balance presented in eq 3 is based on the second order central differencing discretization the advective term however is included as a correction to the diffusive conductance which is dubious since they do not share the same driving force although not based on a formal mathematical derivation this discretization has extensively been used in the literature mehmani et al 2012 xiong et al 2015 xiong et al 2016 huang et al 2016 it is well known that for advection diffusion problems the central differencing scheme is only stable for moderate péclet numbers where pe ij 2 versteeg and malalasekera 2007 we define the local péclet number for each pore throat pore assembly as follows 10 p e ij q ij g ij d on the other hand advection dominated dispersion where pe 2 is encountered in many situations for this reason different discretization schemes with better stability and accuracy than central differencing have been used to describe dispersion in network models several models in which the discretization of the advective term is purely based on the finite differencing upwind scheme or certain variations of it have been proposed or used in the literature mehmani and tchelepi 2017 acharya et al 2005 acharya et al 2007b raoof et al 2010 raoof et al 2012 li et al 2014 mehmani et al 2014 qin and hassanizadeh 2015 tansey and balhoff 2016 the species conservation equation resulting from an upwind discretization of the advective term of the advection diffusion equation can be given in the following general form 11 j 1 n i g ij d max q ij 0 c i j 1 n i g ij d max q ij 0 c j 0 this model overcomes the failure of those based on central differencing eq 3 in that it considers the flow direction however it is only first order accurate and is not generally suitable for accurate dispersion modeling in pore networks as will be shown in section 5 it is important to note that the false diffusion phenomenon commonly encountered in cfd simulations arising from the upwind scheme when the flow is not aligned with the computational grid is not encountered in network models as it is assumed that flow is parallel to the throats 3 models development in this section we present three alternative pore scale models that can more accurately describe dispersion in pore networks the discretization schemes used to derive these models were adopted from the cfd literature we demonstrate in section 5 that these models are more accurate than the commonly used one which is based on the first order upwind discretization scheme the generic mass balance equation for pore i in an arbitrary network model can be written as 12 j 1 n i m ij 0 i 1 2 n p where m ij is the mass flow rate from pore i to j and encompasses both the diffusive and advective fluxes the definition of m ij further discussed in each of the following subsections depends on the employed discretization scheme note that the pore mass balance is enforced within a volume bounded by an imaginary boundary that intersects the midpoints of adjacent throats to pore i therefore m ij needs to be evaluated at throats midpoints 3 1 hybrid scheme first we present the pore scale dispersion model obtained from a derivation based on the hybrid differencing scheme spalding 1972 the obtained pore scale model is a piecewise combination of the discretizations based on the central and upwind differencing schemes depending on the péclet number more specifically for moderate péclet numbers where pe ij 2 the central differencing scheme is used in this case for each throat the advective term is evaluated by averaging the concentrations of its adjacent pores to approximate the concentration at the throat midpoint hence q ij c q ij c i c j 2 which is second order accurate the division by 2 implies that the throat midpoint is equidistance relative to its adjacent pores which holds true only when a single pore size across the network is present a more accurate discretization of the advective flux for pe ij 2 can be given under the following form 13 q ij c q ij d i d j 2 ℓ ij d j ℓ ij 2 c i d i ℓ ij 2 c j in the preceding discretization the concentration at the throat midpoint is approximated by a weighted average of those of the adjacent pores with pore diameter being the weight although the naïve implementation of the hybrid scheme i e q ij c q ij c i c j 2 is only applicable to networks with a single pore size it can be relatively safely applied to a network with randomly and or normally distributed pores sizes since errors introduced by the single pore size assumption would cancel out for more complex pore size distributions such as weibull and log normal this might not be the case for advection dominated dispersion where pe ij 2 the advective flux in the hybrid based pore scale model is discretized using the upwind scheme which is only first order accurate but accounts for flow orientation on the other hand the diffusive contribution is neglected as the flow rate is sufficiently large compared to the diffusive flux the final discretized model is given by the following equation 14 j 1 n i max q ij g ij d q ij 2 0 c i j 1 n i max q ij g ij d q ij 2 0 c j 0 in eq 14 the maximum operator allows for both setting the discrete form of the transport equation depending on the péclet number and for considering the flow direction since q ij can be either positive or negative it can be shown that since pe ij q ij g ij d when pe ij 2 the coefficients in eq 14 reduce to max q ij 0 and to max q ij 0 for pore i and neighbor pores j respectively 3 2 power law scheme using the power law finite differencing scheme patankar 1980 we carried out another derivation of a dispersion pore scale model for the sake of comparison with other models the power law scheme is more accurate than the hybrid scheme as it approximates the concentration profile between adjacent pores with a fifth order polynomial expression versteeg and malalasekera 2007 accordingly the advective and diffusive fluxes can be calculated in the pore scale model obtained from this discretization diffusion is ignored when the flow is highly advective i e pe ij 10 and the upwind scheme is used for the discretization of the advective term on the other hand when pe ij 10 the mass m flux m ij is evaluated using a polynomial expression the final form of the discrete model can be given by the following equation 15 j 1 n i g ij d max 1 p e ij 10 5 0 max q ij 0 c i j 1 n i g ij d max 1 p e ij 10 5 0 max q ij 0 c j 0 from eq 15 it can be verified that for pe ij 10 the coefficients for the center pore i and those for neighbor pores j reduce to max q ij 0 and to max q ij 0 respectively likewise for pe ij 10 the fifth order polynomial fit is used 3 3 exponential scheme whereas the power law scheme is based on a fifth order polynomial fit on the exact solution the exponential scheme uses the exact solution of the 1d advection diffusion problem and is hence theoretically more accurate indeed it will be shown in section 5 that for all the considered dispersion problems the model based on the exponential scheme is the most accurate it is even appreciably more accurate than the power law scheme as it considers the concentration profile reasonably well its derivation is outlined here considering first the 1d steady state advection diffusion equation for an arbitrary conduit in the network model given by 16 d m d 2 c d y 2 u ij dc dy 0 with boundary conditions at both ends of the conduit being c 0 c i and c ℓ ij c j and y being the cartesian coordinate eq 16 can be solved to obtain the following expression for the concentration profile c y 17 c y c j c i exp p e ij 1 exp p e ij y ℓ ij c i exp p e ij c j exp p e ij 1 where pe ij is the local péclet number and as defined in eq 10 which for conduits with constant cross sectional area reduces to u ij ℓ ij d m subsequently the mass flux from pore i to j can be calculated as follows 18 m ij d dc dy u ij c y 0 u ij c i c i c j exp p e ij 1 finally substituting eq 18 in eq 12 gives the following discrete model 19 j 1 n i q ij 1 1 exp p e ij 1 c i j 1 n i q ij 1 exp p e ij 1 c j 0 note that when the péclet number approaches zero both terms in eq 19 become numerically indeterminate i e cannot be numerically evaluated this is a numerical artifact and the respective terms do in fact have finite limits when the péclet number approaches zero to avoid such complication an arbitrary small threshold value ε 10 10 was assumed and sufficiently small péclet numbers pe ε were clipped to this value in this procedure it is important to preserve the sign of the péclet numbers after clipping additionally the flow rates q ij associated with the clipped péclet numbers must be reevaluated with the new péclet number as q ij εg ij d 4 problem definition and implementation 4 1 network generation an in depth analysis of the accuracy of the dispersion pore scale models presented above was carried out considering two dimensional 2d networks which are easier to visualize than three dimensional 3d networks in addition 2d simulations have a lower computational cost compared to the 3d ones especially for the finite element simulations as the pore space needs to be meshed with a sufficiently fine grid however to verify the general generality of the conclusions drawn from the 2d simulations a single 3d dispersion problem was also considered results from the 3d finite element simulation confirmed the conclusions obtained from 2d simulations and for the sake of brevity are not discussed further in the 2d networks the pores and throats are assigned circular and rectangular shapes respectively for this reason when computing the diffusive conductance in 2d simulations the cross section area in eq 5 needs to be replaced with the diameter in addition eq 8 was derived for computing the hydraulic conductance in a cylindrical conduit which no longer applies in a 2d configuration for simulations over 2d networks eq 8 is reconsidered as follows 20 g i h d i 3 12 μ l i assuming a flow between parallel plates bird et al 2007 fig 1 shows representative 2d pore networks considered in the present study for 2d and 3d not shown here configurations the pore networks were constructed based on regular fully connected square coordination number is z 4 and cubic z 6 lattices respectively with a uniform lattice spacing of δ 1 μm boundary pores through which boundary conditions were applied were then added to the inlet and outlet faces as shown on fig 1 cubic networks with randomly reduced coordination to increase the heterogeneity of the domain were also used to test the discretizations proposed here but since similar trends were observed for brevity those results are not reported finally it is important to mention that although a network spacing of 1 μm was used throughout the entire study the results are independent of the network s spacing since the imposed flow boundary conditions are dimensionless i e the imposed péclet number a network spacing of 1 m would have led to the exact same results if the same boundary conditions in terms of the inlet péclet number have been used the only relevant parameter that affects the flow field but is independent of the péclet number is the network s topology which in cubic networks manifests itself in the number of pores of randomly varying size in each direction and this aspect is extensively studied in this study note that structural randomness is represented by employing the weibull probability distribution for assigning pore diameters given by the following formula 21 f x λ k k λ x λ k 1 e x λ k where k 3 λ 0 4 and x is an n p by 1 random vector uniform distribution with entries in the range 0 1 once pore diameters were generated the throat diameter was chosen equal to 60 of the diameter of the smallest pore of the considered pore throat pore assembly other geometrical properties were calculated by assuming spherical pores and cylindrical throats unit depth cylinders and parallel plates respectively in 2d finally as with any other modeling study one needs to verify the simulation results typically experimental data are used to for verification in our case if the experiments were to be performed on actual porous material with random internal structure it would require using a network extraction algorithm to generate the pore network models the network extraction step introduces another source of error which undermines the accuracy of comparisons between the different proposed numerical models conversely micromodels with controlled structure such as an ordered array of posts could be fabricated which eliminates the need for network extraction but in turn makes the simulations unrealistic oostrom et al 2016 therefore we chose to use dns to produce our reference solutions since the geometry on which dns was performed was digitally constructed directly using the pore throat shape information from the pore network model randomness could be maintained without the need to introduce the network extraction step 4 2 boundary value problem the pore scale problem under consideration is the dispersion of a dilute chemical species in a non deformable saturated porous structure the system is treated as being isothermal and operating in steady state the transport of chemical species is described by means of the microscopic advection diffusion equation given by eq 2 along with the associated boundary conditions described below using different discrete forms of the advection diffusion equation the resulting linear systems of equations were numerically solved to obtain the concentration fields the discrete forms used here consist of the ones developed and detailed in section 3 in addition to the one adopted from the literature and described in section 2 the incompressible single phase flow of a newtonian fluid associated with the dispersion problem was assumed to be within the stokes flow regime this flow was modeled using eqs 6 and 8 for 3d networks and using eqs 6 and 20 for 2d arrangements the porous structure was described using a network of pores as shown in fig 1 four boundaries were defined colored with red left green bottom and top and blue right in this figure to impose network scale concentration and pressure gradients respectively each of these boundaries consisted of a group of pores whose centers are coplanar on this fig 1 pe ℓ is the local péclet number computed using eq 10 and is imposed through the conduits connected to the inlet pores two dispersion configurations are reported on fig 1 detailed in what follows and used in the rest this work for brevity the co current network scale flow and imposed concentration gradient and the cross current network scale flow and imposed concentration gradient are referred to as the co current and the cross current configurations respectively for the simulations in considering the co current dispersion configuration a fixed concentration drop and a fixed inlet flow rate corresponding to a constant péclet number both along the y direction with the no flux condition at the top and bottom pores were chosen as boundary conditions these boundary conditions can be expressed by the following set of equations 22 c i 1 q i p e ℓ g ij d i left pores 23 c i 0 1 p i 0 i right pores where q i is the volumetric flow rate entering the left boundary pores note that each boundary pore has only one neighbor see fig 1 and therefore g ij d in eq 22 refers to the overall diffusive conductance associated with the left boundary throats as mentioned above to have precise control over the local péclet number at the inlet we imposed volumetric flow rates rather than pressure on the left boundary pores to this end eq 22 imposes the flow rates on each inlet pore such that all inlet conduits have the same fixed local péclet number note that in network models the no flux condition imposed to certain boundary pores as shown on fig 1 refers to an insulation condition this condition is implicitly imposed and may be explained by the existence of throats with an infinite resistance connecting the insulated pores to the space surrounding the system considered for modeling for the simulations with cross current configuration fig 1b we kept the same boundary conditions for the flow problem i e fixed flow rate at the left boundary pores followed by zero discharge pressure at the right boundary pores with the no flux condition imposed on the top and bottom boundary pores as for the dispersion problem described above we chose boundary conditions similar to those in the famous graetz problem graetz 1882 i e a flow with a fixed concentration of a chemical species enters the network at the left boundary pores and while traveling along the y direction toward the outlet at right boundary pores diffuses sideways toward the top and bottom boundary pores which themselves were kept at a different fixed concentration these set of boundary conditions can be mathematically expressed by the following equations 24 c i 1 q i p e ℓ g ij d i left pores 25 c i 0 1 i top bottom pores 26 dc dy i 0 p i 0 i right pores finally an outflow condition was imposed on the outlet whose implementation in network models will be explained next 4 3 outflow condition in network models consider the boundary pore i with n i neighbors in a network model the outflow boundary condition requires that the mass flux flowing outward from this pore has zero diffusive component therefore for the dispersion problem outflow condition requires that the total incoming mass flux to this pore which comes from the neighbor pores and consists of both diffusive and advective terms gets flushed out purely by advection therefore in mathematical terms the outflow condition for the dispersion problem requires 27 j 1 n i m ij d m ij a q i c i where m ij d and m ij a are the diffusive and advective components respectively of the mass molar flow rate from pore i to j and q i is the net volumetric flow rate exiting pore i and can be calculated by summing all the incoming volumetric flow rates from neighbor pores depending on the choice discretization upwind hybrid etc eq 27 can take different forms here we report the one based on the exponential discretization scheme which can be obtained by replacing the total mass flux term in the left hand side of eq 27 by the previously derived formula in eq 18 finally after simplification the final discretized form of the outflow boundary condition can be given by the following equation 28 j 1 n i c i c j exp p e ij 1 0 4 4 numerical considerations all the simulations presented in this study including those for network generation were performed using the open source pore network modeling package openpnm gostick et al 2016 to solve the dispersion problem in a network model throat volumetric flow rates q ij are required thus the flow problem must be solved first this is achieved by solving the system of linear equations arising from writing eq 6 i e the conservation of mass for every pore i of the network model once the pressure field is obtained eq 9 can be used to compute the throat volumetric flow rates note that the main assumption behind eq 6 is creeping flow i e the reynolds number below unity the reynolds number being re ij ρ q ij a ij d ij μ where d ij is the diameter of the throat and ρ is the fluid s density to this end the pressure gradients imposed on the network were chosen to always yield creeping flows for flows in the inertial regime agnaou et al 2016 agnaou et al 2017 a correction term needs to be adopted once the flow problem is solved and q ij values are obtained the dispersion problem can be solved similar to what was done for solving the flow problem one needs to build a system of linear equations considering the species conservation equation for every pore i of the network as described by the generic form given by eq 12 finally for solving the resulting linear system of equations we used the direct sparse solver of the open source math library scipy 4 5 direct numerical simulation dns the commercial finite element software comsol 5 3a was used to perform dns of dispersion on geometries exactly corresponding to the considered network models the obtained solutions were used as a reference for comparisons with the pore network modeling approach simulations using different pore scale discretizations for geometrical reconstruction of 3d the network models pores and throats were assumed to be spheres and cylinders respectively in the 2d case pores and throats were modeled as circles and rectangles respectively a combination of free triangular elements for the bulk and layered quadrilateral elements near the boundaries as shown in fig 2 were used for meshing the domain in the 2d case furthermore quadratic basis functions were used for interelement interpolations mesh dependency analysis was also performed to assert that the results are independent of the mesh size type in 2d simulations mesh independency was achieved when each pore on average was meshed with 200 to 500 triangular quadrilateral elements of a quasi uniform size the incompressible laminar flow module in comsol without the inertial and gravity terms was used to model the fluid flow and the transport of diluted species module was used to model the dispersion finally the resulting systems of linear equations were solved using the pardiso parallel direct solver the simulations were run on a workstation equipped with an intel xeon e5 1650 v3 processor with 6 cores running at 3 50 ghz and 16 gb ddr4 memory running at 2133 mhz fig 3 shows a representative concentration colormap obtained from finite element simulations of the cross current configuration in a 100 by 25 n y n z pore network model with boundary conditions specified as described in fig 1b the corresponding finite element model consists of almost two million 2d elements and the total runtime including both mesh generation and solving was about 2 h for comparison the computational runtime for the equivalent pore network model was 1 s 5 results and discussion first we consider the co current configuration in 2d network models and compare the accuracy of different discretizations with the results obtained from performing dns on the reconstructed geometry equivalent to the network model next we focus on the cross current configuration in the network model and repeat the simulations finally a 3d configuration was considered to confirm that the conclusions drawn from the results are not limited to 2d networks 5 1 co current dispersion configuration to enforce the co current dispersion configuration in the 2d network model one simply needs to apply a fixed pressure and concentration drop in the same direction along the y axis which can be done by setting the pressure and concentration at the boundary pores facing left and right however to have better control over parameters such as the local péclet number we imposed fixed volumetric flow rate rather than pressure at the left boundary pores and a fixed discharge pressure p 0 at the right boundary pores since the diffusive conductance of throats at inlet can be calculated prior to running simulations imposing a fixed volumetric flow rate at the inlet rather than a fixed pressure directly translates to a fixed local péclet number in addition the concentration boundary conditions c 1 and 0 1 mol m3 were applied to the left and right boundary pores respectively the reported error throughout this study are relative to the dns results produced by the comsol simulations and is defined as follows 29 e c pn c fe c fe where c pn and c fe refer to the solutions obtained from the pore network and finite element simulations respectively c fe was evaluated by interpolating the finite element solution at the pores centers note that the reported values for average error in this study were calculated without considering any weight factors alternatively one could define a weighted average based on individual pore volume given that no spatial correlation was imposed on the pore size distribution normalizing the error by the total number of pores rather than by their volume as the weight factor is sufficient for the present purposes typical results obtained from these simulations are presented in fig 4 the top row in this figure shows the concentration colormap for a 10 by 10 n y n z square lattice 2d network obtained using each of the discretization schemes with a constant local péclet number of pe ℓ 1 imposed at the left boundary for clarity the local relative error with respect to the finite element solution was also calculated and is shown in the bottom row of this figure based on the error colormap the local relative error for the upwind scheme can be as high as 20 whereas that for the power law and exponential schemes is well maintained below 1 all over the network an in depth analysis of the error as well as more discussions are presented in the following sections 5 1 1 effect of local péclet regime fig 5 shows the average relative error observed when using each of the discretization schemes versus the local péclet number denoted by pe ℓ for a 5 by 20 n y n z square lattice 2d network results reported in fig 5 were obtained considering the co current configuration detailed on fig 1a based on this figure for all reported local péclet numbers the discretization schemes can be ranked in terms of decreasing accuracy as follows exponential power law hybrid and upwind this is consistent with the theoretical predictions patankar 1980 furthermore in all discretization schemes see section 5 3 the average error is initially negligible increases until it peaks circa pe ℓ 1 and is followed by a decrease as the local péclet number further increases in this discussion it is assumed that numerical errors such as the round off error in pore network and finite element simulations are comparable and the main deviation observed between these simulations in terms of concentration is due to discretization errors also the error introduced by the well mixed cell assumption is neglected the total discretization error e t is the sum of the individual contributions of the discretized diffusion and advection terms denoted by e d and e a respectively when the local péclet number is relatively small the diffusion term is dominant and the advection error does not significantly contribute to the total error i e e t e d therefore the choice of the advection discretization scheme should not matter much fig 5 supports this claim since at pe ℓ 0 1 for instance the difference between the most and the least accurate schemes is only 0 4 furthermore the diffusion flux in network models is approximated assuming that concentration varies linearly between neighbor pores this assumption is valid especially in the low péclet regime where transport is close to pure diffusion therefore one expects the total error to be also negligible which is again supported by the results shown in fig 5 since at pe ℓ 0 1 the most erroneous scheme is only 0 6 inaccurate compared to the reference solution as the local péclet number increases toward intermediate values the magnitudes of the advection and diffusion terms become comparable accordingly the share of the advection term in the total error becomes more noticeable and therefore the total error is expected to increase furthermore because of the same reason the choice of the advection discretization scheme is likely to have a more pronounced impact fig 5 supports this claim since at pe ℓ 1 there is almost a 10 difference between the most and the least accurate schemes in terms of relative error finally at sufficiently high local péclet numbers the advection becomes the dominant term in this range péclet much higher than unity the upwind scheme as well as all other schemes becomes increasingly less inaccurate hence diminishing the advection discretization error therefore the total error is expected to decrease which is confirmed by the results shown in fig 5 a more intuitive way to interpret the trend of the upwind error against the local péclet number is to understand which terms are being approximated by means of the difference operators for the sake of argument we ignore that pores have volume and instead assume they are point like entities that are connected via cylindrical throats of constant cross sectional area also note that the mass balance in pore network models is typically written for an arbitrary control volume enclosing pore i of the network therefore all the incoming outgoing fluxes need to be evaluated at the pore boundary since the pore concentration is what is solved for there is no approximation involved in evaluating the advective term i e q ij c i and the only approximation concerns evaluating the diffusive term i e dc dy i for clarity the concentration profile across a single throat based on the exact solution of the 1d advection diffusion equation for different péclet numbers are plotted in fig 6 note that in the upwind scheme irrespective of the péclet number the diffusive term is linearly approximated as previously explained at low péclet numbers the transport is diffusion dominated and thus the linear approximation is valid leading to relative errors close to zero as the local péclet number increases a thick concentration boundary layer is formed forcing the linear profile to bend along the main flow direction see fig 6 consequently the linear approximation of dc dy at the pore boundary i e y 0 overpredicts the actual value of the derivative causing the relative error to increase however as the local péclet number further increases the dispersion becomes more advective dominated and the concentration gradient at the pore boundary approaches zero see fig 6 therefore how one approximates the derivative becomes less important as it does not contribute much to the total flux causing the relative error to eventually decrease at high péclet numbers extending this analysis from a single throat to a network it can be inferred that the regions in the network where there is a strong concentration gradient suffers the most from the upwind assumption in the sections that follow this explanation is used to further highlight under which circumstances the upwind scheme is most inaccurate and when it yields relatively more accurate solutions 5 1 2 impact of network size to examine how the discretization error behaves when the size of the network changes we performed simulations comparable to the ones presented in section 5 1 1 with the only difference being the network size along the main direction of the flow the results of these simulations are presented in fig 7 where the average relative error is plotted against the local péclet number for three square lattice 2d networks of sizes n y by 20 where n y 5 10 20 results reported on fig 7 reveal the following trend as the size of the network parallel to the main flow direction increases the average error decreases furthermore this decreasing trend is almost always independent of the local péclet number in fact given a fixed pe ℓ the average error monotonically decreases as the network gets longer along the main flow direction to explore the underlying reason consider two square lattice 2d networks that are 10 and 20 pores long respectively in the y direction see definition of directions in fig 1 also assume that the inlet flow rate in these networks is kept constant corresponding to a local péclet number of pe ℓ 1 fig 8 shows the plane averaged concentration profiles and the relative error colormaps for the upwind scheme for these two networks based on the error colormaps in fig 8 the relative error in both networks is negligible near the inlet gradually increases with x l and is followed by a marked increase near the outlet note that given a fixed flow rate as the network size in the main flow direction is increased despite the constant local péclet the physics of the dispersion approaches the advection dominated regime on network scale as opposed to pore scale since the local péclet number is still at 1 therefore one expects the high concentration gradient front to shrink in size which is qualitatively supported by the graphs in fig 8 from previous discussions the main source of errors from the use of the first order upwind scheme comes from the linear approximation of the concentration gradient as the network gets longer in terms of number of pores in the main flow direction the high concentration gradient front gets thinner and hence the portion of the network that does not experience a large concentration gradient expands as a result the first order upwind scheme is relatively accurate over an ever increasing area of the network and erroneous over a shrinking one thus we can conclude that given a fixed local péclet number or a fixed flow rate and concentration gradient as the network gets larger in terms of number of pores in the main flow direction the average relative error is expected to decrease hence explaining the decreasing trend observed in fig 7 it must be highlighted however that the local relative error remains important at the high concentration gradient front next we performed several simulations on various 2d networks with different lengths and various local péclet numbers such that the product n y pe ℓ remains constant then we plotted the plane averaged concentration profiles along the y axis and grouped the data points that correspond to unique n y pe ℓ values which are shown in fig 9 table 1 is a summary of the parameters used in these simulations note that n y pe ℓ can be considered as a measure of the relative strength of advective and diffusive driving forces along the main flow direction across the whole network as opposed to pe ℓ which is a measure of the relative strength of the two mechanisms across a single throat inlet throats in this case henceforth for convenience n y pe ℓ is referred to as the global péclet number in the y direction and is given by 30 p e g n y p e ℓ the data shown in fig 9 exposes yet another trend the overall shape of the concentration profile is primarily determined by the value of pe g or the global péclet number rather than the local péclet it is important to mention that this is valid while considering a constant pore to pore spacing when n y is increased and that the impact of other network configurations should be investigated in future works this trend is important in that it can be used to determine whether the error introduced by the upwind scheme is within an acceptable range as previously discussed the more the dispersion approaches the advection dominated regime the less erroneous the upwind scheme becomes based on the results presented in fig 9 for the co current configuration the concentration profile can be almost solely predicted by examining the global péclet number to further illustrate this point at a moderate local péclet number of pe ℓ 1 the average relative errors for different discretization schemes were plotted against the global péclet number which is shown in fig 10 based on fig 10 although the local péclet number is within the moderate regime where the error is expected to be relatively high the error varies from almost 10 at pe g 5 to approximately 2 at pe g 25 this confirms the above claim that the magnitude of the average error is rather controlled by the global péclet number note that while it appears that for relatively large networks the first order upwind error is getting smaller on a global scale the local error is still significant in other words the only reason that the average error is decreasing is that a nonzero concentration gradient is virtually nonexistent throughout most of the network it must be emphasized that for systems including chemical reactions concentration gradients exist all over the network and hence the upwind error becomes significant both locally and globally furthermore in systems that involve cross current dispersion configuration comparable the ones considered in this study which are discussed in section 5 2 we show that the upwind average error can be significant even in large networks and in the absence of chemical reactions 5 1 3 further analysis of upwind error in this section we further shed light on the dependence of the upwind scheme discretization error on the local and global péclet numbers for this the analytical solution of the 1d advection diffusion problem as described by eq 17 was used to derive an approximate formula for the average error that is introduced by the upwind scheme the derived average error is given by 31 e a δ c l p e ℓ 1 exp p e ℓ 2 where δc is the network scale concentration drop along the y axis imposed through the inlet and outlet boundary conditions the derivation details are provided in appendix a section a 1 based on eq 31 the discretization error not only depends on the local péclet number but also on the concentration gradient imposed through the network which is characterized by δc l y as the network gets larger along the main direction of the flow inevitably the concentration gradient will decrease hence decreasing the average discretization error which explains the decreasing trend observed in fig 7 for the case of a network with fixed size and hence a fixed concentration gradient it can be shown that eq 31 approaches zero at both extreme local péclet numbers i e either very low or very high values and that a maximum exists at some intermediate point which confirms the trend observed in fig 5 furthermore based on the obtained expression for the average error eq 31 it can be deduced that for any arbitrary local péclet number if the global péclet pe g is sufficiently large i e the network length in the main flow direction is sufficiently large the average discretization error would be sufficiently small which strengthens the points made regarding the results shown in fig 10 5 2 cross current dispersion configuration as described in section 4 2 we consider here the dispersion configuration described on fig 1b a flow field is enforced across the network with a main direction along the y axis this is done by imposing a fixed flow rate at the left boundary pores which corresponds to a certain local péclet number the flow exits the network at a discharge pressure of p 0 pa at the right boundary pores for this dispersion problem fig 1b there is no concentration gradient imposed along the main flow direction rather the chemical species enter the network at a fixed concentration of c 1 mol m3 and diffuse sideways toward the top and bottom boundary pores where a fixed concentration of c 0 1 mol m3 is enforced finally the outflow condition i e zero concentration gradient was enforced at the right boundary pores fig 11 shows typical concentration colormaps obtained from these simulations using the upwind and exponential schemes the local relative error colormap of the upwind scheme compared to the fem reference solution is also shown in this figure in fact one can observe that the upwind scheme underestimates the concentration front furthermore moving from the network s inlet toward the outlet the upwind error is increasing on average we mention that the relative error of the exponential scheme is perfectly negligible below 0 5 and is not included in fig 11 we performed several simulations on networks similar to the one on fig 11 varying the network s length by including different number of pores along the y direction n y the pore to pore spacing was kept constant the results of these simulations are shown in fig 12 in form of dimensionless plane averaged concentration against the dimensionless length of the network based on fig 12b irrespective of the network s length the exponential scheme has accurately predicted the concentration profile with an average relative error below 1 conversely the network simulations based on the upwind scheme have introduced average relative errors ranging from below 1 up to 10 depending on the network length there are two important features in this figure both seemingly contrary to what was observed in section 5 1 for the case of a co current dispersion configuration first based on fig 12b at network lengths similar to those used for the co current configuration ex n y 10 the upwind error is negligible second as the network length increases the upwind error also increases whereas for the case of the co current configuration increasing the length of the network caused the average upwind error to rapidly drop to zero both of these opposite behaviors can be explained by looking at the local concentration gradients in each of the simulations when the network length is relatively small i e n y 10 the network scale axial advective affects are dominant compared to the transverse diffusion and hence the concentration profile is almost flat indeed the constant concentration front imposed at the left boundary is advected to the whole therefore different discretizations particularly the upwind scheme are not expected to yield different solutions as the source of errors i e dc dy is close to zero throughout the entire domain as the length of the network increases the residence time of the mixture increases allowing the transverse diffusion to spread out the concentration front as a result a nonzero concentration gradient is formed throughout the entire domain which further grows as the length of the network increases under such circumstances one expects the upwind error to increase which is confirmed by the observations in fig 12 meanwhile note that the concentration boundary layer gets pushed away toward the inlet continually decreasing its thickness as the length of network further increases although the local concentration gradients are expected to increase their existence is only limited to the boundary layer the thickness of which rapidly decreases by increasing the network length therefore one expects the upwind error to eventually decrease as the network length gets large enough which is not observed in fig 12 however this apparent contradiction is because the maximum network length chosen in fig 12 is not large enough to address this issue we performed similar simulations under the same conditions on 2d networks that are up to 5000 pores long along the y direction fig 13 shows the plane averaged relative error for four networks that are 500 1000 2500 and 5000 pores long along the y axis as well as the local relative error colormap for each of the four networks based on this figure when the network gets large enough along the main flow direction the upwind error eventually decreases from the error colormaps it is apparent that as the network gets longer along the network scale flow direction the boundary layer in which most of the nonzero gradients occur progressively gets thinner which in turn causes the overall error to eventually decrease which is consistent with what we found for the co current configuration however one must be careful not to conflate this decreasing trend with the upwind scheme getting more accurate the only reason that the upwind error on a global scale decreases by increasing the network size is that the concentration profile becomes uniform and hence the choice of advection discretization scheme becomes irrelevant in real life scenarios such as the presence of chemical reactions the uniform concentration profile rarely occurs and hence the use of the upwind based network models should be avoided 5 3 statistical significance since pore size distribution in porous media is a rather stochastic parameter one needs to verify if the apparent trend in the results is consistent in multiple realizations accordingly all the results reported in this study are the average of 5 realizations and were obtained independently by varying the seed in the random number generator we also performed single factor anova to test the statistical significance of the results for instance to test whether the trend observed in the relative error against the local péclet is statistically significant for different discretizations the results of these analyses are not included in this manuscript for brevity however the key finding was that the trends observed in upwind and hybrid scheme are highly likely to be significant with a p value consistently less than 10 5 while those in power law and exponential schemes are not likely to be significant with p values consistently 0 1 for the power law and 0 5 for the exponential scheme this outcome might be explained by the fact that the relative error introduced by the power law and exponential schemes have been constantly below 1 and could fall within the accuracy of the finite element simulations used as the ground truth 5 4 taylor aris effect the above analyses were all carried out ignoring the taylor aris effect taylor 1953 aris 1956 it is however worth considering the impact of this effect on the accuracy the pore scale discretizations in network models the spread of the average solute concentration in the network s throats occurs due to the combination of axial advection diffusion and radial diffusion which results from the radially non uniform velocity profile in this regard the taylor aris effect accounts for the contribution of the radial diffusion this effect is built in to the direct numerical simulations since the throat velocity profiles are explicitly solved for however since pore averaged quantities are used in the network models accounting for the taylor aris effect requires correcting the effective diffusivity the following formula can be used to calculate the effective diffusivity 32 d eff d s 1 p e d 2 192 where d s is the open space molecular diffusivity and pe d is the péclet number based on the pore throat diameter and is a measure of the relative strength of axial advection to radial diffusivity note that although related the local péclet number denoted by pe ℓ must not be confused with pe d as the former signifies the ratio of the axial advection to the axial diffusivity the péclet number based on pore throat diameter is defined by the following expression 33 p e d ud d s where u is the average velocity and d is the diameter of the pore throat for which pe d is being calculated for an arbitrary conduit ij consisting of pore i throat ij and pore j since the flowrate q ij and the cross sectional area of each of the three entities are known pe d can be calculated direction e g pe d i 4q ij πd i d s for pore i once pe d is determined for each of the three entities eq 32 is used to calculate the effective diffusivity d eff to account for the taylor aris effect the values of diffusive conductance for all pores throats in the network are updated by replacing the open space diffusivity d s with the effective diffusivity d eff based on eq 32 the taylor aris effect is more pronounced at relatively large pe d values moreover it has been widely reported that radial diffusion enhances the axial dispersion when pe d is less than 192 and inhibits it at larger values bird et al 2007 using a methodology similar to that presented in sections 5 1 and 5 2 the relative errors with respect to the finite element simulations of power law and exponential schemes are negligible therefore it can be concluded that for the considered dispersion configurations and péclet regimes the taylor aris effect is insignificant to confirm this claim and investigate the taylor aris effect at higher péclet numbers we performed dispersion simulations for the co current configuration on a network of the size of 25 by 25 pores using different discretization schemes with and without considering the correction term for diffusivity subsequently the local relative error in concentration was calculated relative to the solution with corrected diffusivity hence the error is defined at a given pore i by 34 e i ta c i ta c i c i ta i 1 2 n p where c i ta and c i are the concentrations obtained with and without considering the taylor aris effect respectively fig 14 shows the average relative error versus the local péclet number for different discretization schemes in terms of average relative error values are always below 1 for the maximum relative error whereas the upwind scheme shows an error of up to 20 at pe ℓ 103 a negligible error of 2 is observed for all other discretizations schemes over the considered range of péclet numbers note that the previous analyses in section 5 1 and 5 2 were performed for péclet numbers in the range of pe ℓ 10 based on fig 14 the average relative error as a result of neglecting the taylor aris effect in this range of péclet numbers is below 0 3 for all considered discretization schemes therefore it can be concluded that the taylor aris effect had a negligible effect in the péclet regimes in this study for the hybrid discretization scheme the quasi zero error observed in fig 14 for local péclet numbers between 1 and 5 and higher can be explained by the fact that in this discretization the diffusive contribution is numerically ignored starting from pe 2 see eq 14 as for the power law and the exponential schemes although the relative error is also negligible the observed behavior is expected in fact the taylor aris effect appears to be more important at local péclet numbers less and larger than 192 finally fig 14 shows that the relative error for the upwind scheme is monotonically increasing with the local péclet number which is unlike the trend for other pore scale discretizations this can be explained by the fact that in the upwind scheme the advective contribution is decoupled from the changes in the effective diffusivity since the advection is expressed in terms of the flow rate and not the péclet number hence for any variation in the local péclet number the taylor aris effect will only impact the diffusive conductance on the other hand in discretizations where the advective flux is defined in terms of the péclet number a change in the local péclet number will impact the diffusive conductance which in turn will affect the péclet number and finally the advective flux finally note that in this figure the reported values close to 10 14 can effectively be considered as 0 as they have reached the machine precision i e ϵ 10 16 6 conclusions three different discretizations based on the well known hybrid power law and exponential schemes were adopted from the cfd literature and applied to model dispersion in pore networks the accuracy of the proposed schemes was tested against dns as well as the first order upwind discretization scheme which is widely used for dispersion modeling in the pore network modeling literature the upwind scheme was shown to introduce up to 20 local and 10 average relative error while those for two of the schemes developed in this study namely the power law and the exponential schemes were consistently below 1 for various local and global péclet numbers the simulations performed in this study were focused on co current and cross current network scale flow and imposed concentration gradient configurations in both cases the maximum deviation between the first order upwind scheme and the reference finite element solution occurs in the moderate local péclet regime i e pe ℓ 1 we report an important observation on the impact of the network size on the average relative error caused by using the upwind scheme for the co current configuration it was found that the upwind error is significant only when the length of the network along the main flow direction is 20 pores on the contrary for the cross current configuration we found that the upwind error is considerable only when the network is relatively large along the flow direction these two seemingly incompatible observations can be understood by noticing the relation between the upwind error and the extent to which the concentration profile has reached the fully developed state nevertheless while it might seem that in certain cases such as the co current configuration in relatively large networks the upwind error on a global scale is small it must be emphasized that the local error was still found to be high and the only reason for such low global error is that a nonzero concentration gradient is nonexistent throughout most of the network in many practical situations such as reactive systems a nonzero concentration gradient is most likely to be present all over the simulation domain hence signifying the unreliability of the upwind scheme for modeling dispersion the findings of this study emphasize the inaccuracy of the upwind discretization scheme in modeling dispersion and propose a practical solution to this problem by introducing novel and accurate alternatives future work could include how transient simulations affect the results an interesting test case is generating breakthrough curves and to investigate how the upwind scheme as well as the proposed discretizations perform in predicting the breakthrough time etc moreover evaluating the accuracy of the proposed dispersion models when applied to extracted networks rather than those with idealized pore throat shapes remains for future work all the introduced algorithms in this study have been implemented and tested in the open source pore network modeling software openpnm and are available for the public to use declaration of competing interest the authors have no conflicts of interest to report acknowledgment the authors would like to thank the natural science and engineering research council nserc of canada and ballard power systems for providing financial support for this project appendix a a 1 upwind error in network models for the co current configuration the mass flux from pore i to j is given by the following expression 35 m ij d dc dy uc evaluating the given expression at the middle of the conduit ij gives 36 m ij d δ c ij ℓ u c m where δc ij c i c j is the concentration drop across the conduit and c m is the concentration at the midpoint assuming a positive flow rate from pore i to j the upwind assumption dictates that c m c i using the analytical

1551,mass transfer in porous media resulting from dispersion occurs in a wide variety of applications such as water treatment flow batteries flow in aquifers enhanced oil recovery and packed bed reactors the underlying mechanisms of dispersion are the molecular diffusion superimposed on the advective transport induced by the fluid flow modeling dispersion in pore networks can be performed at a much lower computational cost compared to that in direct numerical simulations dns such as finite element or the lattice boltzmann methods so it can be regarded as a suitable alternative provided its accuracy is sufficient the most common approach to model dispersion in network models is based on the first order upwind scheme despite its known limitations in terms of accuracy for certain flow and transport regimes in this study three alternative pore scale models for dispersion which are more accurate than the existing ones were derived and tested in pore network simulations these models were adopted from the cfd literature and are based on a spatial discretization of the advection diffusion equation using the hybrid and power law finite difference schemes and the exact solution of the one dimensional advection diffusion equation finally considering dispersion problems over arbitrary porous structures consisting of stick and ball geometries and different flow and mass transfer arrangements the developed models were validated validation was carried out through comparisons between results obtained with dns using a finite element solver and those from pore network simulations it is shown that under a wide range of dispersion regimes up to the onset of the dispersion power law regime the relative error with respect to dns results introduced by the power law and exact solution based models is consistently below 1 whereas the use of the upwind scheme leads to 10 of relative error depending on the dispersion regime all the dispersion models developed in this study

dashtian et al 2018 and many more the hydrodynamic dispersion or dispersion for brevity is a mixing process that occurs between two miscible fluids in contact which each other dispersion occurs in the presence of concentration and pressure gradients concentration gradients give rise to diffusion of solute in the solvent which can be described using fick s first law of diffusion in addition pressure gradients result in an additional mixing of the solute as the solvent flows through the porous medium also known as the convective mixing characterized by a nonuniform velocity field due to the internal structural disorder sahimi 2011 several approaches for modeling dispersion in porous media have been used in the literature among which one can cite the continuum approach plumb and whitaker 1988 dou et al 2018 the first passage time and random walk simulation hughes and sahimi 1982 sahimi et al 1986a sahimi et al 1986b sahimi 1987 sahimi and imdakm 1988 berkowitz and braester 1991 the lagrangian methods where the movement of solute particles is followed saffman 1960 haring and greenkorn 1970 and the probability propagation algorithm de arcangelis et al 1986 note that while probabilistic models such as the work of levy and berkowitz levy and berkowitz 2003 based on monte carlo simulations provide a convenient way for determining the dispersion coefficient for a given porous medium they are not feasible for conducting proper transport simulations at pore scale this is because these methods operate based on averaging out the results obtained from hundreds if not thousands of individual probabilistic simulations in the continuum approach different averaging techniques such as the ensemble averaging koch and brady 1985 and the volume averaging plumb and whitaker 1988 methods have been used to derive macroscopic averaged equations plumb and whitaker 1988 plumb and whitaker 1988 derived a large scale advection dispersion equation from the volume averaging of the microscopic advection diffusion equation under certain length scale constraints plumb and whitaker 1988 the obtained equation in terms of the volume averaged solute concentration c is given by 1 ε c t ε v c ε d c where ε is porosity t is time v is the fluid velocity vector and d is the dispersion coefficient tensor which depends on the molecular diffusion and on the hydrodynamic transport at pore scale accurate evaluation of this macroscopic tensor requires the solution of a pore scale closure problem that resembles the advection diffusion equation plumb and whitaker 1988 acharya et al 2007a this task is feasible at low computational costs when a geometrical model of the pore space is available however it appears that the solution of the closure problem is not easier than numerically solving the pore scale advection diffusion problem itself when the microscopic disorder does not allow the extraction of a numerically manageable geometrical model of the porous medium sahimi 2011 for these reasons the use of pore network models popular for their low computational costs has emerged as an alternative for those based on the continuum approach mehmani and tchelepi 2017 blunt et al 2002 sadeghi et al 2017 bultreys et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 de vries et al 2017 deterministic discrete pore scale models describing non reactive dispersion in a network model are generally based on the one dimensional 1d advection diffusion equation which is given in the continuum form as follows 2 c t v c d m c where c is the local concentration of the chemical species and d m is the molecular diffusion coefficient several models have been derived using eq 2 and the form of discrete conservation equations varies depending on the adopted discretization schemes however accurate models valid over a wide range of dispersion regimes are still lacking in the literature recently yang et al 2016 published an extensive comparison between different simulation methods considering pore scale flow and solute transport problems the methods used included the pore network modeling approach as well as various direct numerical simulation dns methods yang et al 2016 their results suggest that the network approach leads to more dispersive concentration profiles this error may be attributed to the mixed cell assumption which states that pores are considered as well mixed entities in terms of all physical quantities the same behavior was also reported before by oostrom et al 2016 in a study in which they compared the results from several pore scale continuum and pore network models with micromodel experiments oostrom et al 2016 in addition to the mixed cell assumption the error could also be due to numerical considerations which include the treatment of the advective term the pore scale model presented in this study helps to remedy the latter issue and is a forward step toward truly predictive pore network modeling the present study is focused on the pore scale discretization used in the pore network modeling mixed cell method and a special attention is given to the accuracy of the commonly used upwind scheme moreover other models that are theoretically more accurate than the existing ones are presented that are valid over a wide range of dispersion regimes diffusion transition and the onset of the power law regimes and their numerical implementation is as simple as the existing ones this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the background regarding dispersion modeling in pore networks is discussed with a focus on the most commonly used dispersion models in the mixed cell method approach and their limitations then in section 3 the derivation of three alternative and more accurate discrete pore scale models tailored for use in pore network models is presented the first two models are based on a discretization of the one dimensional advection diffusion equation using the hybrid and power law differencing schemes respectively the third and the most accurate one is based on the exact solution of the one dimensional advection diffusion problem subsequently the dispersion problems considered in this study for the validation of the developed models are defined in section 4 the detailed numerical implementation for solving these problems is also described in section 4 the results of the simulations of different dispersion problems are presented in section 5 the pore network results were compared with the most common approach in the literature that is based on the upwind discretization scheme in addition dns using the finite element method were also carried out and used as a reference for comparisons and error analysis it should be added that in this manuscript the term error is only used for convenience and actually it refers to the deviation of the results obtained from pore network modeling from those of the dns 2 background the pore network is a simplified representation of the real porous medium geometry which consists of a set of pores interconnected by imaginary throats idealized shapes are assigned to pores and throats for simplicity regarding the conservation equations to be considered most commonly pores and throats are represented by spheres and cylinders respectively whereas in the computational fluid dynamics cfd continuum approach conservation equations are commonly considered over discrete control volumes pores and throats are used in pore network modeling to enforce conservation of physical quantities it must be noted that generally only pores are considered for applying conservation equations in this study the pore network modeling mixed cell yang et al 2016 method is adopted this approach offers simplicity and computational efficiency thus enabling the pore scale simulation of a substantially sized domain in this method all the void volume of the porous medium is assigned to the pores and the throats are considered to have no volume note that assigning zero volume to throats is only a numerical workaround for transient simulations or for certain cases in the presence of source sink terms this is because the rate of mass accumulation is proportional to volume and since the mass balance is only written for pores assigning nonzero throat volumes leads to an overestimated mass accumulation in pores at any rate conservation equations are applied over the pores and perfect mixing of the solute in the pore is assumed this assumption of perfect mixing is robust at low péclet numbers i e pe 1 where diffusion is dominant compared to advection the péclet number defined later in this section is the ratio of advective to diffusive driving forces in some recent works yang et al 2016 mehmani and balhoff 2015 it was shown that for péclet numbers up to 257 the assumption of perfect mixing within pores has a negligible impact on longitudinal macroscopic dispersion in disordered sphere packs in these studies yang et al 2016 mehmani and balhoff 2015 the péclet number was defined as the ratio between the interstitial fluid velocity times the grain diameter and the molecular diffusion hence the use of the mixed cell method for modeling dispersion can be extended for moderate to high pe numbers in disordered porous media however for ordered porous structures the mixed cell method should be reserved only for situations where diffusion is dominant as confirmed by some micromodel experiments oostrom et al 2016 willingham et al 2008 moreover the mixed cell method ignores the impact of non uniform velocity profiles in pores and throats on the dispersion in a similar way to the perfect mixing assumption considering uniform velocity profiles was found to have a negligible effect on longitudinal dispersion in disordered media yang et al 2016 mehmani and balhoff 2015 this aspect is explored in the present work below in pore network modeling based on the mixed cell method two discrete dispersion pore scale models are commonly used in the literature these models both result from the discretization of the 1d form of the advection diffusion equation eq 2 over individual throats in the network the first method mehmani et al 2012 xiong et al 2015 2016 huang et al 2016 is based on the central differencing discretization scheme for the diffusive flux wherein the advective term is added as a correction term to the diffusive flux the species conservation equation at steady state for an arbitrary pore i is given under the following general form 3 j 1 n i g ij d q ij c i j 1 n i g ij d q ij c j 0 i 1 2 n p where i is the pore of interest j the neighboring pores n i the number of neighbor pores n p the total number of pores in the network c the local concentration of species g ij d the diffusive conductance of the pore throat pore assembly or conduit and q ij is the throat flow rate the diffusive conductance g ij d can be given from the linear resistor theory for resistors in series gostick et al 2007 by 4 g ij d 1 g i d 1 g ij d 1 g j d 1 with the pore diffusive conductance g i being 5 g i d a i d s l i such that a i is the cross section area of pore i l i its length here length of a pore is its radius and d s the open space diffusion coefficient the diffusive conductance of throat ij and pore j are computed in the same manner assuming an incompressible flow of a newtonian fluid under isothermal conditions in the viscous dominated regime the mass conservation equation over each pore i of the network is given by 6 j 1 n i g ij h p i p j 0 i 1 2 n p where p i is the pressure in pore i and g ij h is the hydraulic conductance of the pore throat pore assembly and is given by 7 g ij h 1 g i h 1 g ij h 1 g j h 1 such that g i h is the hydraulic conductance of pore i and can be calculated using the hagen poiseuille model sutera and skalak 1993 by 8 g i h π 128 μ d i 4 l i where μ is the fluid dynamic viscosity and d i is the diameter of pore i the hydraulic conductance of throat ij and pore j are computed in the same manner the flow rate q ij can then be calculated using the following equation 9 q ij g ij h p i p j the diffusive term in the pore balance presented in eq 3 is based on the second order central differencing discretization the advective term however is included as a correction to the diffusive conductance which is dubious since they do not share the same driving force although not based on a formal mathematical derivation this discretization has extensively been used in the literature mehmani et al 2012 xiong et al 2015 xiong et al 2016 huang et al 2016 it is well known that for advection diffusion problems the central differencing scheme is only stable for moderate péclet numbers where pe ij 2 versteeg and malalasekera 2007 we define the local péclet number for each pore throat pore assembly as follows 10 p e ij q ij g ij d on the other hand advection dominated dispersion where pe 2 is encountered in many situations for this reason different discretization schemes with better stability and accuracy than central differencing have been used to describe dispersion in network models several models in which the discretization of the advective term is purely based on the finite differencing upwind scheme or certain variations of it have been proposed or used in the literature mehmani and tchelepi 2017 acharya et al 2005 acharya et al 2007b raoof et al 2010 raoof et al 2012 li et al 2014 mehmani et al 2014 qin and hassanizadeh 2015 tansey and balhoff 2016 the species conservation equation resulting from an upwind discretization of the advective term of the advection diffusion equation can be given in the following general form 11 j 1 n i g ij d max q ij 0 c i j 1 n i g ij d max q ij 0 c j 0 this model overcomes the failure of those based on central differencing eq 3 in that it considers the flow direction however it is only first order accurate and is not generally suitable for accurate dispersion modeling in pore networks as will be shown in section 5 it is important to note that the false diffusion phenomenon commonly encountered in cfd simulations arising from the upwind scheme when the flow is not aligned with the computational grid is not encountered in network models as it is assumed that flow is parallel to the throats 3 models development in this section we present three alternative pore scale models that can more accurately describe dispersion in pore networks the discretization schemes used to derive these models were adopted from the cfd literature we demonstrate in section 5 that these models are more accurate than the commonly used one which is based on the first order upwind discretization scheme the generic mass balance equation for pore i in an arbitrary network model can be written as 12 j 1 n i m ij 0 i 1 2 n p where m ij is the mass flow rate from pore i to j and encompasses both the diffusive and advective fluxes the definition of m ij further discussed in each of the following subsections depends on the employed discretization scheme note that the pore mass balance is enforced within a volume bounded by an imaginary boundary that intersects the midpoints of adjacent throats to pore i therefore m ij needs to be evaluated at throats midpoints 3 1 hybrid scheme first we present the pore scale dispersion model obtained from a derivation based on the hybrid differencing scheme spalding 1972 the obtained pore scale model is a piecewise combination of the discretizations based on the central and upwind differencing schemes depending on the péclet number more specifically for moderate péclet numbers where pe ij 2 the central differencing scheme is used in this case for each throat the advective term is evaluated by averaging the concentrations of its adjacent pores to approximate the concentration at the throat midpoint hence q ij c q ij c i c j 2 which is second order accurate the division by 2 implies that the throat midpoint is equidistance relative to its adjacent pores which holds true only when a single pore size across the network is present a more accurate discretization of the advective flux for pe ij 2 can be given under the following form 13 q ij c q ij d i d j 2 ℓ ij d j ℓ ij 2 c i d i ℓ ij 2 c j in the preceding discretization the concentration at the throat midpoint is approximated by a weighted average of those of the adjacent pores with pore diameter being the weight although the naïve implementation of the hybrid scheme i e q ij c q ij c i c j 2 is only applicable to networks with a single pore size it can be relatively safely applied to a network with randomly and or normally distributed pores sizes since errors introduced by the single pore size assumption would cancel out for more complex pore size distributions such as weibull and log normal this might not be the case for advection dominated dispersion where pe ij 2 the advective flux in the hybrid based pore scale model is discretized using the upwind scheme which is only first order accurate but accounts for flow orientation on the other hand the diffusive contribution is neglected as the flow rate is sufficiently large compared to the diffusive flux the final discretized model is given by the following equation 14 j 1 n i max q ij g ij d q ij 2 0 c i j 1 n i max q ij g ij d q ij 2 0 c j 0 in eq 14 the maximum operator allows for both setting the discrete form of the transport equation depending on the péclet number and for considering the flow direction since q ij can be either positive or negative it can be shown that since pe ij q ij g ij d when pe ij 2 the coefficients in eq 14 reduce to max q ij 0 and to max q ij 0 for pore i and neighbor pores j respectively 3 2 power law scheme using the power law finite differencing scheme patankar 1980 we carried out another derivation of a dispersion pore scale model for the sake of comparison with other models the power law scheme is more accurate than the hybrid scheme as it approximates the concentration profile between adjacent pores with a fifth order polynomial expression versteeg and malalasekera 2007 accordingly the advective and diffusive fluxes can be calculated in the pore scale model obtained from this discretization diffusion is ignored when the flow is highly advective i e pe ij 10 and the upwind scheme is used for the discretization of the advective term on the other hand when pe ij 10 the mass m flux m ij is evaluated using a polynomial expression the final form of the discrete model can be given by the following equation 15 j 1 n i g ij d max 1 p e ij 10 5 0 max q ij 0 c i j 1 n i g ij d max 1 p e ij 10 5 0 max q ij 0 c j 0 from eq 15 it can be verified that for pe ij 10 the coefficients for the center pore i and those for neighbor pores j reduce to max q ij 0 and to max q ij 0 respectively likewise for pe ij 10 the fifth order polynomial fit is used 3 3 exponential scheme whereas the power law scheme is based on a fifth order polynomial fit on the exact solution the exponential scheme uses the exact solution of the 1d advection diffusion problem and is hence theoretically more accurate indeed it will be shown in section 5 that for all the considered dispersion problems the model based on the exponential scheme is the most accurate it is even appreciably more accurate than the power law scheme as it considers the concentration profile reasonably well its derivation is outlined here considering first the 1d steady state advection diffusion equation for an arbitrary conduit in the network model given by 16 d m d 2 c d y 2 u ij dc dy 0 with boundary conditions at both ends of the conduit being c 0 c i and c ℓ ij c j and y being the cartesian coordinate eq 16 can be solved to obtain the following expression for the concentration profile c y 17 c y c j c i exp p e ij 1 exp p e ij y ℓ ij c i exp p e ij c j exp p e ij 1 where pe ij is the local péclet number and as defined in eq 10 which for conduits with constant cross sectional area reduces to u ij ℓ ij d m subsequently the mass flux from pore i to j can be calculated as follows 18 m ij d dc dy u ij c y 0 u ij c i c i c j exp p e ij 1 finally substituting eq 18 in eq 12 gives the following discrete model 19 j 1 n i q ij 1 1 exp p e ij 1 c i j 1 n i q ij 1 exp p e ij 1 c j 0 note that when the péclet number approaches zero both terms in eq 19 become numerically indeterminate i e cannot be numerically evaluated this is a numerical artifact and the respective terms do in fact have finite limits when the péclet number approaches zero to avoid such complication an arbitrary small threshold value ε 10 10 was assumed and sufficiently small péclet numbers pe ε were clipped to this value in this procedure it is important to preserve the sign of the péclet numbers after clipping additionally the flow rates q ij associated with the clipped péclet numbers must be reevaluated with the new péclet number as q ij εg ij d 4 problem definition and implementation 4 1 network generation an in depth analysis of the accuracy of the dispersion pore scale models presented above was carried out considering two dimensional 2d networks which are easier to visualize than three dimensional 3d networks in addition 2d simulations have a lower computational cost compared to the 3d ones especially for the finite element simulations as the pore space needs to be meshed with a sufficiently fine grid however to verify the general generality of the conclusions drawn from the 2d simulations a single 3d dispersion problem was also considered results from the 3d finite element simulation confirmed the conclusions obtained from 2d simulations and for the sake of brevity are not discussed further in the 2d networks the pores and throats are assigned circular and rectangular shapes respectively for this reason when computing the diffusive conductance in 2d simulations the cross section area in eq 5 needs to be replaced with the diameter in addition eq 8 was derived for computing the hydraulic conductance in a cylindrical conduit which no longer applies in a 2d configuration for simulations over 2d networks eq 8 is reconsidered as follows 20 g i h d i 3 12 μ l i assuming a flow between parallel plates bird et al 2007 fig 1 shows representative 2d pore networks considered in the present study for 2d and 3d not shown here configurations the pore networks were constructed based on regular fully connected square coordination number is z 4 and cubic z 6 lattices respectively with a uniform lattice spacing of δ 1 μm boundary pores through which boundary conditions were applied were then added to the inlet and outlet faces as shown on fig 1 cubic networks with randomly reduced coordination to increase the heterogeneity of the domain were also used to test the discretizations proposed here but since similar trends were observed for brevity those results are not reported finally it is important to mention that although a network spacing of 1 μm was used throughout the entire study the results are independent of the network s spacing since the imposed flow boundary conditions are dimensionless i e the imposed péclet number a network spacing of 1 m would have led to the exact same results if the same boundary conditions in terms of the inlet péclet number have been used the only relevant parameter that affects the flow field but is independent of the péclet number is the network s topology which in cubic networks manifests itself in the number of pores of randomly varying size in each direction and this aspect is extensively studied in this study note that structural randomness is represented by employing the weibull probability distribution for assigning pore diameters given by the following formula 21 f x λ k k λ x λ k 1 e x λ k where k 3 λ 0 4 and x is an n p by 1 random vector uniform distribution with entries in the range 0 1 once pore diameters were generated the throat diameter was chosen equal to 60 of the diameter of the smallest pore of the considered pore throat pore assembly other geometrical properties were calculated by assuming spherical pores and cylindrical throats unit depth cylinders and parallel plates respectively in 2d finally as with any other modeling study one needs to verify the simulation results typically experimental data are used to for verification in our case if the experiments were to be performed on actual porous material with random internal structure it would require using a network extraction algorithm to generate the pore network models the network extraction step introduces another source of error which undermines the accuracy of comparisons between the different proposed numerical models conversely micromodels with controlled structure such as an ordered array of posts could be fabricated which eliminates the need for network extraction but in turn makes the simulations unrealistic oostrom et al 2016 therefore we chose to use dns to produce our reference solutions since the geometry on which dns was performed was digitally constructed directly using the pore throat shape information from the pore network model randomness could be maintained without the need to introduce the network extraction step 4 2 boundary value problem the pore scale problem under consideration is the dispersion of a dilute chemical species in a non deformable saturated porous structure the system is treated as being isothermal and operating in steady state the transport of chemical species is described by means of the microscopic advection diffusion equation given by eq 2 along with the associated boundary conditions described below using different discrete forms of the advection diffusion equation the resulting linear systems of equations were numerically solved to obtain the concentration fields the discrete forms used here consist of the ones developed and detailed in section 3 in addition to the one adopted from the literature and described in section 2 the incompressible single phase flow of a newtonian fluid associated with the dispersion problem was assumed to be within the stokes flow regime this flow was modeled using eqs 6 and 8 for 3d networks and using eqs 6 and 20 for 2d arrangements the porous structure was described using a network of pores as shown in fig 1 four boundaries were defined colored with red left green bottom and top and blue right in this figure to impose network scale concentration and pressure gradients respectively each of these boundaries consisted of a group of pores whose centers are coplanar on this fig 1 pe ℓ is the local péclet number computed using eq 10 and is imposed through the conduits connected to the inlet pores two dispersion configurations are reported on fig 1 detailed in what follows and used in the rest this work for brevity the co current network scale flow and imposed concentration gradient and the cross current network scale flow and imposed concentration gradient are referred to as the co current and the cross current configurations respectively for the simulations in considering the co current dispersion configuration a fixed concentration drop and a fixed inlet flow rate corresponding to a constant péclet number both along the y direction with the no flux condition at the top and bottom pores were chosen as boundary conditions these boundary conditions can be expressed by the following set of equations 22 c i 1 q i p e ℓ g ij d i left pores 23 c i 0 1 p i 0 i right pores where q i is the volumetric flow rate entering the left boundary pores note that each boundary pore has only one neighbor see fig 1 and therefore g ij d in eq 22 refers to the overall diffusive conductance associated with the left boundary throats as mentioned above to have precise control over the local péclet number at the inlet we imposed volumetric flow rates rather than pressure on the left boundary pores to this end eq 22 imposes the flow rates on each inlet pore such that all inlet conduits have the same fixed local péclet number note that in network models the no flux condition imposed to certain boundary pores as shown on fig 1 refers to an insulation condition this condition is implicitly imposed and may be explained by the existence of throats with an infinite resistance connecting the insulated pores to the space surrounding the system considered for modeling for the simulations with cross current configuration fig 1b we kept the same boundary conditions for the flow problem i e fixed flow rate at the left boundary pores followed by zero discharge pressure at the right boundary pores with the no flux condition imposed on the top and bottom boundary pores as for the dispersion problem described above we chose boundary conditions similar to those in the famous graetz problem graetz 1882 i e a flow with a fixed concentration of a chemical species enters the network at the left boundary pores and while traveling along the y direction toward the outlet at right boundary pores diffuses sideways toward the top and bottom boundary pores which themselves were kept at a different fixed concentration these set of boundary conditions can be mathematically expressed by the following equations 24 c i 1 q i p e ℓ g ij d i left pores 25 c i 0 1 i top bottom pores 26 dc dy i 0 p i 0 i right pores finally an outflow condition was imposed on the outlet whose implementation in network models will be explained next 4 3 outflow condition in network models consider the boundary pore i with n i neighbors in a network model the outflow boundary condition requires that the mass flux flowing outward from this pore has zero diffusive component therefore for the dispersion problem outflow condition requires that the total incoming mass flux to this pore which comes from the neighbor pores and consists of both diffusive and advective terms gets flushed out purely by advection therefore in mathematical terms the outflow condition for the dispersion problem requires 27 j 1 n i m ij d m ij a q i c i where m ij d and m ij a are the diffusive and advective components respectively of the mass molar flow rate from pore i to j and q i is the net volumetric flow rate exiting pore i and can be calculated by summing all the incoming volumetric flow rates from neighbor pores depending on the choice discretization upwind hybrid etc eq 27 can take different forms here we report the one based on the exponential discretization scheme which can be obtained by replacing the total mass flux term in the left hand side of eq 27 by the previously derived formula in eq 18 finally after simplification the final discretized form of the outflow boundary condition can be given by the following equation 28 j 1 n i c i c j exp p e ij 1 0 4 4 numerical considerations all the simulations presented in this study including those for network generation were performed using the open source pore network modeling package openpnm gostick et al 2016 to solve the dispersion problem in a network model throat volumetric flow rates q ij are required thus the flow problem must be solved first this is achieved by solving the system of linear equations arising from writing eq 6 i e the conservation of mass for every pore i of the network model once the pressure field is obtained eq 9 can be used to compute the throat volumetric flow rates note that the main assumption behind eq 6 is creeping flow i e the reynolds number below unity the reynolds number being re ij ρ q ij a ij d ij μ where d ij is the diameter of the throat and ρ is the fluid s density to this end the pressure gradients imposed on the network were chosen to always yield creeping flows for flows in the inertial regime agnaou et al 2016 agnaou et al 2017 a correction term needs to be adopted once the flow problem is solved and q ij values are obtained the dispersion problem can be solved similar to what was done for solving the flow problem one needs to build a system of linear equations considering the species conservation equation for every pore i of the network as described by the generic form given by eq 12 finally for solving the resulting linear system of equations we used the direct sparse solver of the open source math library scipy 4 5 direct numerical simulation dns the commercial finite element software comsol 5 3a was used to perform dns of dispersion on geometries exactly corresponding to the considered network models the obtained solutions were used as a reference for comparisons with the pore network modeling approach simulations using different pore scale discretizations for geometrical reconstruction of 3d the network models pores and throats were assumed to be spheres and cylinders respectively in the 2d case pores and throats were modeled as circles and rectangles respectively a combination of free triangular elements for the bulk and layered quadrilateral elements near the boundaries as shown in fig 2 were used for meshing the domain in the 2d case furthermore quadratic basis functions were used for interelement interpolations mesh dependency analysis was also performed to assert that the results are independent of the mesh size type in 2d simulations mesh independency was achieved when each pore on average was meshed with 200 to 500 triangular quadrilateral elements of a quasi uniform size the incompressible laminar flow module in comsol without the inertial and gravity terms was used to model the fluid flow and the transport of diluted species module was used to model the dispersion finally the resulting systems of linear equations were solved using the pardiso parallel direct solver the simulations were run on a workstation equipped with an intel xeon e5 1650 v3 processor with 6 cores running at 3 50 ghz and 16 gb ddr4 memory running at 2133 mhz fig 3 shows a representative concentration colormap obtained from finite element simulations of the cross current configuration in a 100 by 25 n y n z pore network model with boundary conditions specified as described in fig 1b the corresponding finite element model consists of almost two million 2d elements and the total runtime including both mesh generation and solving was about 2 h for comparison the computational runtime for the equivalent pore network model was 1 s 5 results and discussion first we consider the co current configuration in 2d network models and compare the accuracy of different discretizations with the results obtained from performing dns on the reconstructed geometry equivalent to the network model next we focus on the cross current configuration in the network model and repeat the simulations finally a 3d configuration was considered to confirm that the conclusions drawn from the results are not limited to 2d networks 5 1 co current dispersion configuration to enforce the co current dispersion configuration in the 2d network model one simply needs to apply a fixed pressure and concentration drop in the same direction along the y axis which can be done by setting the pressure and concentration at the boundary pores facing left and right however to have better control over parameters such as the local péclet number we imposed fixed volumetric flow rate rather than pressure at the left boundary pores and a fixed discharge pressure p 0 at the right boundary pores since the diffusive conductance of throats at inlet can be calculated prior to running simulations imposing a fixed volumetric flow rate at the inlet rather than a fixed pressure directly translates to a fixed local péclet number in addition the concentration boundary conditions c 1 and 0 1 mol m3 were applied to the left and right boundary pores respectively the reported error throughout this study are relative to the dns results produced by the comsol simulations and is defined as follows 29 e c pn c fe c fe where c pn and c fe refer to the solutions obtained from the pore network and finite element simulations respectively c fe was evaluated by interpolating the finite element solution at the pores centers note that the reported values for average error in this study were calculated without considering any weight factors alternatively one could define a weighted average based on individual pore volume given that no spatial correlation was imposed on the pore size distribution normalizing the error by the total number of pores rather than by their volume as the weight factor is sufficient for the present purposes typical results obtained from these simulations are presented in fig 4 the top row in this figure shows the concentration colormap for a 10 by 10 n y n z square lattice 2d network obtained using each of the discretization schemes with a constant local péclet number of pe ℓ 1 imposed at the left boundary for clarity the local relative error with respect to the finite element solution was also calculated and is shown in the bottom row of this figure based on the error colormap the local relative error for the upwind scheme can be as high as 20 whereas that for the power law and exponential schemes is well maintained below 1 all over the network an in depth analysis of the error as well as more discussions are presented in the following sections 5 1 1 effect of local péclet regime fig 5 shows the average relative error observed when using each of the discretization schemes versus the local péclet number denoted by pe ℓ for a 5 by 20 n y n z square lattice 2d network results reported in fig 5 were obtained considering the co current configuration detailed on fig 1a based on this figure for all reported local péclet numbers the discretization schemes can be ranked in terms of decreasing accuracy as follows exponential power law hybrid and upwind this is consistent with the theoretical predictions patankar 1980 furthermore in all discretization schemes see section 5 3 the average error is initially negligible increases until it peaks circa pe ℓ 1 and is followed by a decrease as the local péclet number further increases in this discussion it is assumed that numerical errors such as the round off error in pore network and finite element simulations are comparable and the main deviation observed between these simulations in terms of concentration is due to discretization errors also the error introduced by the well mixed cell assumption is neglected the total discretization error e t is the sum of the individual contributions of the discretized diffusion and advection terms denoted by e d and e a respectively when the local péclet number is relatively small the diffusion term is dominant and the advection error does not significantly contribute to the total error i e e t e d therefore the choice of the advection discretization scheme should not matter much fig 5 supports this claim since at pe ℓ 0 1 for instance the difference between the most and the least accurate schemes is only 0 4 furthermore the diffusion flux in network models is approximated assuming that concentration varies linearly between neighbor pores this assumption is valid especially in the low péclet regime where transport is close to pure diffusion therefore one expects the total error to be also negligible which is again supported by the results shown in fig 5 since at pe ℓ 0 1 the most erroneous scheme is only 0 6 inaccurate compared to the reference solution as the local péclet number increases toward intermediate values the magnitudes of the advection and diffusion terms become comparable accordingly the share of the advection term in the total error becomes more noticeable and therefore the total error is expected to increase furthermore because of the same reason the choice of the advection discretization scheme is likely to have a more pronounced impact fig 5 supports this claim since at pe ℓ 1 there is almost a 10 difference between the most and the least accurate schemes in terms of relative error finally at sufficiently high local péclet numbers the advection becomes the dominant term in this range péclet much higher than unity the upwind scheme as well as all other schemes becomes increasingly less inaccurate hence diminishing the advection discretization error therefore the total error is expected to decrease which is confirmed by the results shown in fig 5 a more intuitive way to interpret the trend of the upwind error against the local péclet number is to understand which terms are being approximated by means of the difference operators for the sake of argument we ignore that pores have volume and instead assume they are point like entities that are connected via cylindrical throats of constant cross sectional area also note that the mass balance in pore network models is typically written for an arbitrary control volume enclosing pore i of the network therefore all the incoming outgoing fluxes need to be evaluated at the pore boundary since the pore concentration is what is solved for there is no approximation involved in evaluating the advective term i e q ij c i and the only approximation concerns evaluating the diffusive term i e dc dy i for clarity the concentration profile across a single throat based on the exact solution of the 1d advection diffusion equation for different péclet numbers are plotted in fig 6 note that in the upwind scheme irrespective of the péclet number the diffusive term is linearly approximated as previously explained at low péclet numbers the transport is diffusion dominated and thus the linear approximation is valid leading to relative errors close to zero as the local péclet number increases a thick concentration boundary layer is formed forcing the linear profile to bend along the main flow direction see fig 6 consequently the linear approximation of dc dy at the pore boundary i e y 0 overpredicts the actual value of the derivative causing the relative error to increase however as the local péclet number further increases the dispersion becomes more advective dominated and the concentration gradient at the pore boundary approaches zero see fig 6 therefore how one approximates the derivative becomes less important as it does not contribute much to the total flux causing the relative error to eventually decrease at high péclet numbers extending this analysis from a single throat to a network it can be inferred that the regions in the network where there is a strong concentration gradient suffers the most from the upwind assumption in the sections that follow this explanation is used to further highlight under which circumstances the upwind scheme is most inaccurate and when it yields relatively more accurate solutions 5 1 2 impact of network size to examine how the discretization error behaves when the size of the network changes we performed simulations comparable to the ones presented in section 5 1 1 with the only difference being the network size along the main direction of the flow the results of these simulations are presented in fig 7 where the average relative error is plotted against the local péclet number for three square lattice 2d networks of sizes n y by 20 where n y 5 10 20 results reported on fig 7 reveal the following trend as the size of the network parallel to the main flow direction increases the average error decreases furthermore this decreasing trend is almost always independent of the local péclet number in fact given a fixed pe ℓ the average error monotonically decreases as the network gets longer along the main flow direction to explore the underlying reason consider two square lattice 2d networks that are 10 and 20 pores long respectively in the y direction see definition of directions in fig 1 also assume that the inlet flow rate in these networks is kept constant corresponding to a local péclet number of pe ℓ 1 fig 8 shows the plane averaged concentration profiles and the relative error colormaps for the upwind scheme for these two networks based on the error colormaps in fig 8 the relative error in both networks is negligible near the inlet gradually increases with x l and is followed by a marked increase near the outlet note that given a fixed flow rate as the network size in the main flow direction is increased despite the constant local péclet the physics of the dispersion approaches the advection dominated regime on network scale as opposed to pore scale since the local péclet number is still at 1 therefore one expects the high concentration gradient front to shrink in size which is qualitatively supported by the graphs in fig 8 from previous discussions the main source of errors from the use of the first order upwind scheme comes from the linear approximation of the concentration gradient as the network gets longer in terms of number of pores in the main flow direction the high concentration gradient front gets thinner and hence the portion of the network that does not experience a large concentration gradient expands as a result the first order upwind scheme is relatively accurate over an ever increasing area of the network and erroneous over a shrinking one thus we can conclude that given a fixed local péclet number or a fixed flow rate and concentration gradient as the network gets larger in terms of number of pores in the main flow direction the average relative error is expected to decrease hence explaining the decreasing trend observed in fig 7 it must be highlighted however that the local relative error remains important at the high concentration gradient front next we performed several simulations on various 2d networks with different lengths and various local péclet numbers such that the product n y pe ℓ remains constant then we plotted the plane averaged concentration profiles along the y axis and grouped the data points that correspond to unique n y pe ℓ values which are shown in fig 9 table 1 is a summary of the parameters used in these simulations note that n y pe ℓ can be considered as a measure of the relative strength of advective and diffusive driving forces along the main flow direction across the whole network as opposed to pe ℓ which is a measure of the relative strength of the two mechanisms across a single throat inlet throats in this case henceforth for convenience n y pe ℓ is referred to as the global péclet number in the y direction and is given by 30 p e g n y p e ℓ the data shown in fig 9 exposes yet another trend the overall shape of the concentration profile is primarily determined by the value of pe g or the global péclet number rather than the local péclet it is important to mention that this is valid while considering a constant pore to pore spacing when n y is increased and that the impact of other network configurations should be investigated in future works this trend is important in that it can be used to determine whether the error introduced by the upwind scheme is within an acceptable range as previously discussed the more the dispersion approaches the advection dominated regime the less erroneous the upwind scheme becomes based on the results presented in fig 9 for the co current configuration the concentration profile can be almost solely predicted by examining the global péclet number to further illustrate this point at a moderate local péclet number of pe ℓ 1 the average relative errors for different discretization schemes were plotted against the global péclet number which is shown in fig 10 based on fig 10 although the local péclet number is within the moderate regime where the error is expected to be relatively high the error varies from almost 10 at pe g 5 to approximately 2 at pe g 25 this confirms the above claim that the magnitude of the average error is rather controlled by the global péclet number note that while it appears that for relatively large networks the first order upwind error is getting smaller on a global scale the local error is still significant in other words the only reason that the average error is decreasing is that a nonzero concentration gradient is virtually nonexistent throughout most of the network it must be emphasized that for systems including chemical reactions concentration gradients exist all over the network and hence the upwind error becomes significant both locally and globally furthermore in systems that involve cross current dispersion configuration comparable the ones considered in this study which are discussed in section 5 2 we show that the upwind average error can be significant even in large networks and in the absence of chemical reactions 5 1 3 further analysis of upwind error in this section we further shed light on the dependence of the upwind scheme discretization error on the local and global péclet numbers for this the analytical solution of the 1d advection diffusion problem as described by eq 17 was used to derive an approximate formula for the average error that is introduced by the upwind scheme the derived average error is given by 31 e a δ c l p e ℓ 1 exp p e ℓ 2 where δc is the network scale concentration drop along the y axis imposed through the inlet and outlet boundary conditions the derivation details are provided in appendix a section a 1 based on eq 31 the discretization error not only depends on the local péclet number but also on the concentration gradient imposed through the network which is characterized by δc l y as the network gets larger along the main direction of the flow inevitably the concentration gradient will decrease hence decreasing the average discretization error which explains the decreasing trend observed in fig 7 for the case of a network with fixed size and hence a fixed concentration gradient it can be shown that eq 31 approaches zero at both extreme local péclet numbers i e either very low or very high values and that a maximum exists at some intermediate point which confirms the trend observed in fig 5 furthermore based on the obtained expression for the average error eq 31 it can be deduced that for any arbitrary local péclet number if the global péclet pe g is sufficiently large i e the network length in the main flow direction is sufficiently large the average discretization error would be sufficiently small which strengthens the points made regarding the results shown in fig 10 5 2 cross current dispersion configuration as described in section 4 2 we consider here the dispersion configuration described on fig 1b a flow field is enforced across the network with a main direction along the y axis this is done by imposing a fixed flow rate at the left boundary pores which corresponds to a certain local péclet number the flow exits the network at a discharge pressure of p 0 pa at the right boundary pores for this dispersion problem fig 1b there is no concentration gradient imposed along the main flow direction rather the chemical species enter the network at a fixed concentration of c 1 mol m3 and diffuse sideways toward the top and bottom boundary pores where a fixed concentration of c 0 1 mol m3 is enforced finally the outflow condition i e zero concentration gradient was enforced at the right boundary pores fig 11 shows typical concentration colormaps obtained from these simulations using the upwind and exponential schemes the local relative error colormap of the upwind scheme compared to the fem reference solution is also shown in this figure in fact one can observe that the upwind scheme underestimates the concentration front furthermore moving from the network s inlet toward the outlet the upwind error is increasing on average we mention that the relative error of the exponential scheme is perfectly negligible below 0 5 and is not included in fig 11 we performed several simulations on networks similar to the one on fig 11 varying the network s length by including different number of pores along the y direction n y the pore to pore spacing was kept constant the results of these simulations are shown in fig 12 in form of dimensionless plane averaged concentration against the dimensionless length of the network based on fig 12b irrespective of the network s length the exponential scheme has accurately predicted the concentration profile with an average relative error below 1 conversely the network simulations based on the upwind scheme have introduced average relative errors ranging from below 1 up to 10 depending on the network length there are two important features in this figure both seemingly contrary to what was observed in section 5 1 for the case of a co current dispersion configuration first based on fig 12b at network lengths similar to those used for the co current configuration ex n y 10 the upwind error is negligible second as the network length increases the upwind error also increases whereas for the case of the co current configuration increasing the length of the network caused the average upwind error to rapidly drop to zero both of these opposite behaviors can be explained by looking at the local concentration gradients in each of the simulations when the network length is relatively small i e n y 10 the network scale axial advective affects are dominant compared to the transverse diffusion and hence the concentration profile is almost flat indeed the constant concentration front imposed at the left boundary is advected to the whole therefore different discretizations particularly the upwind scheme are not expected to yield different solutions as the source of errors i e dc dy is close to zero throughout the entire domain as the length of the network increases the residence time of the mixture increases allowing the transverse diffusion to spread out the concentration front as a result a nonzero concentration gradient is formed throughout the entire domain which further grows as the length of the network increases under such circumstances one expects the upwind error to increase which is confirmed by the observations in fig 12 meanwhile note that the concentration boundary layer gets pushed away toward the inlet continually decreasing its thickness as the length of network further increases although the local concentration gradients are expected to increase their existence is only limited to the boundary layer the thickness of which rapidly decreases by increasing the network length therefore one expects the upwind error to eventually decrease as the network length gets large enough which is not observed in fig 12 however this apparent contradiction is because the maximum network length chosen in fig 12 is not large enough to address this issue we performed similar simulations under the same conditions on 2d networks that are up to 5000 pores long along the y direction fig 13 shows the plane averaged relative error for four networks that are 500 1000 2500 and 5000 pores long along the y axis as well as the local relative error colormap for each of the four networks based on this figure when the network gets large enough along the main flow direction the upwind error eventually decreases from the error colormaps it is apparent that as the network gets longer along the network scale flow direction the boundary layer in which most of the nonzero gradients occur progressively gets thinner which in turn causes the overall error to eventually decrease which is consistent with what we found for the co current configuration however one must be careful not to conflate this decreasing trend with the upwind scheme getting more accurate the only reason that the upwind error on a global scale decreases by increasing the network size is that the concentration profile becomes uniform and hence the choice of advection discretization scheme becomes irrelevant in real life scenarios such as the presence of chemical reactions the uniform concentration profile rarely occurs and hence the use of the upwind based network models should be avoided 5 3 statistical significance since pore size distribution in porous media is a rather stochastic parameter one needs to verify if the apparent trend in the results is consistent in multiple realizations accordingly all the results reported in this study are the average of 5 realizations and were obtained independently by varying the seed in the random number generator we also performed single factor anova to test the statistical significance of the results for instance to test whether the trend observed in the relative error against the local péclet is statistically significant for different discretizations the results of these analyses are not included in this manuscript for brevity however the key finding was that the trends observed in upwind and hybrid scheme are highly likely to be significant with a p value consistently less than 10 5 while those in power law and exponential schemes are not likely to be significant with p values consistently 0 1 for the power law and 0 5 for the exponential scheme this outcome might be explained by the fact that the relative error introduced by the power law and exponential schemes have been constantly below 1 and could fall within the accuracy of the finite element simulations used as the ground truth 5 4 taylor aris effect the above analyses were all carried out ignoring the taylor aris effect taylor 1953 aris 1956 it is however worth considering the impact of this effect on the accuracy the pore scale discretizations in network models the spread of the average solute concentration in the network s throats occurs due to the combination of axial advection diffusion and radial diffusion which results from the radially non uniform velocity profile in this regard the taylor aris effect accounts for the contribution of the radial diffusion this effect is built in to the direct numerical simulations since the throat velocity profiles are explicitly solved for however since pore averaged quantities are used in the network models accounting for the taylor aris effect requires correcting the effective diffusivity the following formula can be used to calculate the effective diffusivity 32 d eff d s 1 p e d 2 192 where d s is the open space molecular diffusivity and pe d is the péclet number based on the pore throat diameter and is a measure of the relative strength of axial advection to radial diffusivity note that although related the local péclet number denoted by pe ℓ must not be confused with pe d as the former signifies the ratio of the axial advection to the axial diffusivity the péclet number based on pore throat diameter is defined by the following expression 33 p e d ud d s where u is the average velocity and d is the diameter of the pore throat for which pe d is being calculated for an arbitrary conduit ij consisting of pore i throat ij and pore j since the flowrate q ij and the cross sectional area of each of the three entities are known pe d can be calculated direction e g pe d i 4q ij πd i d s for pore i once pe d is determined for each of the three entities eq 32 is used to calculate the effective diffusivity d eff to account for the taylor aris effect the values of diffusive conductance for all pores throats in the network are updated by replacing the open space diffusivity d s with the effective diffusivity d eff based on eq 32 the taylor aris effect is more pronounced at relatively large pe d values moreover it has been widely reported that radial diffusion enhances the axial dispersion when pe d is less than 192 and inhibits it at larger values bird et al 2007 using a methodology similar to that presented in sections 5 1 and 5 2 the relative errors with respect to the finite element simulations of power law and exponential schemes are negligible therefore it can be concluded that for the considered dispersion configurations and péclet regimes the taylor aris effect is insignificant to confirm this claim and investigate the taylor aris effect at higher péclet numbers we performed dispersion simulations for the co current configuration on a network of the size of 25 by 25 pores using different discretization schemes with and without considering the correction term for diffusivity subsequently the local relative error in concentration was calculated relative to the solution with corrected diffusivity hence the error is defined at a given pore i by 34 e i ta c i ta c i c i ta i 1 2 n p where c i ta and c i are the concentrations obtained with and without considering the taylor aris effect respectively fig 14 shows the average relative error versus the local péclet number for different discretization schemes in terms of average relative error values are always below 1 for the maximum relative error whereas the upwind scheme shows an error of up to 20 at pe ℓ 103 a negligible error of 2 is observed for all other discretizations schemes over the considered range of péclet numbers note that the previous analyses in section 5 1 and 5 2 were performed for péclet numbers in the range of pe ℓ 10 based on fig 14 the average relative error as a result of neglecting the taylor aris effect in this range of péclet numbers is below 0 3 for all considered discretization schemes therefore it can be concluded that the taylor aris effect had a negligible effect in the péclet regimes in this study for the hybrid discretization scheme the quasi zero error observed in fig 14 for local péclet numbers between 1 and 5 and higher can be explained by the fact that in this discretization the diffusive contribution is numerically ignored starting from pe 2 see eq 14 as for the power law and the exponential schemes although the relative error is also negligible the observed behavior is expected in fact the taylor aris effect appears to be more important at local péclet numbers less and larger than 192 finally fig 14 shows that the relative error for the upwind scheme is monotonically increasing with the local péclet number which is unlike the trend for other pore scale discretizations this can be explained by the fact that in the upwind scheme the advective contribution is decoupled from the changes in the effective diffusivity since the advection is expressed in terms of the flow rate and not the péclet number hence for any variation in the local péclet number the taylor aris effect will only impact the diffusive conductance on the other hand in discretizations where the advective flux is defined in terms of the péclet number a change in the local péclet number will impact the diffusive conductance which in turn will affect the péclet number and finally the advective flux finally note that in this figure the reported values close to 10 14 can effectively be considered as 0 as they have reached the machine precision i e ϵ 10 16 6 conclusions three different discretizations based on the well known hybrid power law and exponential schemes were adopted from the cfd literature and applied to model dispersion in pore networks the accuracy of the proposed schemes was tested against dns as well as the first order upwind discretization scheme which is widely used for dispersion modeling in the pore network modeling literature the upwind scheme was shown to introduce up to 20 local and 10 average relative error while those for two of the schemes developed in this study namely the power law and the exponential schemes were consistently below 1 for various local and global péclet numbers the simulations performed in this study were focused on co current and cross current network scale flow and imposed concentration gradient configurations in both cases the maximum deviation between the first order upwind scheme and the reference finite element solution occurs in the moderate local péclet regime i e pe ℓ 1 we report an important observation on the impact of the network size on the average relative error caused by using the upwind scheme for the co current configuration it was found that the upwind error is significant only when the length of the network along the main flow direction is 20 pores on the contrary for the cross current configuration we found that the upwind error is considerable only when the network is relatively large along the flow direction these two seemingly incompatible observations can be understood by noticing the relation between the upwind error and the extent to which the concentration profile has reached the fully developed state nevertheless while it might seem that in certain cases such as the co current configuration in relatively large networks the upwind error on a global scale is small it must be emphasized that the local error was still found to be high and the only reason for such low global error is that a nonzero concentration gradient is nonexistent throughout most of the network in many practical situations such as reactive systems a nonzero concentration gradient is most likely to be present all over the simulation domain hence signifying the unreliability of the upwind scheme for modeling dispersion the findings of this study emphasize the inaccuracy of the upwind discretization scheme in modeling dispersion and propose a practical solution to this problem by introducing novel and accurate alternatives future work could include how transient simulations affect the results an interesting test case is generating breakthrough curves and to investigate how the upwind scheme as well as the proposed discretizations perform in predicting the breakthrough time etc moreover evaluating the accuracy of the proposed dispersion models when applied to extracted networks rather than those with idealized pore throat shapes remains for future work all the introduced algorithms in this study have been implemented and tested in the open source pore network modeling software openpnm and are available for the public to use declaration of competing interest the authors have no conflicts of interest to report acknowledgment the authors would like to thank the natural science and engineering research

1552,the correct characterization of macro scale contaminant transport and transformation rates is an important issue for modeling reactive transport in heterogeneous aquifers while previous studies have investigated field scale heterogeneity of transport and biochemical properties the effects of local transverse dispersion on macro scale transport and transformation rates have not been well understood in this paper the process of oxygen limited biodegradation in a stratified aquifer is analysed by spectral perturbation approach and longitudinal macrodispersivity effective biodegradation rate effective retardation factor and effective velocity are derived for the coupled transport equations of a system consisting of a contaminant and an oxidizing agent oxygen the effects of local transverse dispersion on these macro scale coefficients are studied it is shown that local transverse dispersion can smooth the heterogeneity in biodegradation and sorption processes and enlarge effective biodegradation rate and retardation factor the local transverse dispersion can also limit the effects of heterogeneity in biodegradation process on longitudinal macrodispersivities and effective velocities for the contaminant and dissolved oxygen but the effects of heterogeneity in sorption process on the contaminant macrodispersivity is likely to be magnified by local transverse dispersion keywords contaminant transport biodegradation sorption heterogeneity effective coeffcients local transverse dispersion 1 introduction due to the spatial variability of physical and biochemical properties of natural aquifers transport and degradation of contaminant plumes are complicated behaviors characterizing the impacts of these heterogeneities is critical to describe

chrysikopoulos 2018 up scaled quantities that characterize the complex interplay between transport and sorption biodegradation processes at lower scale are obtained however local dispersion which is considered to be negligible for conservative solute transport at field scale gelhar and axness 1983 is also treated as an insignificant process for multi component biodegradable solutes transport in some analytical works e g miralles wilhelm et al 1997 miralles wilhelm and gelhar 2000 the importance of local dispersion has been received recognition e g kitanidis 1994 cirpka and kitanidis 2001 cirpka et al 2012 ye et al 2015a b local dispersion represents the local scale heterogeneity and consists of two components molecular diffusion of solute and the tortuous flow paths of water at the local scale in other words local dispersion is the macro scale quantity for local scale transport and mixing behavior without local dispersion there will be no microscale mixing of reaction partners e g electron donors and acceptors for microbially mediated redox reactions and dilution of one species at the local scale chiogna et al 2011 and the local scale is also where reactions take place therefore local dispersion is identified to be a critical process for overall contaminant degradation many works have addressed the local dispersive mixing especially local transverse dispersive mixing by using numerical modeling and experiment e g chiogna et al 2009 2011 rolle et al 2009 2012 cirpka et al 2015 acharya et al 2007 ballarini et al 2012 rahman et al 2005 klenk and grathwohl 2002 stenback et al 2004 knutson et al 2007 dentz et al 2011 le borgne et al 2011 most of them focusing on pore scale or laboratory scale these works generally indicate that the transverse dispersion components typically smaller than the longitudinal ones is a relevant process in the mixing of electron acceptors and electron donors in biodegrading groundwater plumes and constitutes an essential prerequisite for geochemical and biodegradation reactions particularly transverse dispersion represents a fundamental controlling factor for steady plumes meanwhile several notable works have shown that local transverse dispersion may also play a critical role in field scale biodegradation essaid et al 2015 prommer et al 2009 cirpka et al 1999 chu et al 2005 oya and valocchi 1998 janssen et al 2006 fernàndez garcia et al 2008 for example oya and valocchi 1998 studied nonlinear biodegradation in stratified aquifers and derived a simple expression for the long term pollutant biodegradation rate they showed that local transverse dispersion was critical to the establishment of the asymptotic transport janssen et al 2006 investigated the nonlinear biodegradation of a contaminant in heterogeneous aquifers by the stochastic convective and the advective dispersive stream tube approaches they found that the error caused by neglecting local dispersion increase with time fernàndez garcia et al 2008 studied instantaneous precipitation dissolution in stratified aquifers and derived closed form analytical solutions for statistical moments of reaction rates for the particular case of negligible transverse dispersion they showed that transverse dispersion is a critical process in large travel times despite this progress the effects of local transverse dispersion on the macro scale transport behavior of multicomponent reactive solutes remain in most cases not fully understood the present paper contributes to investigating the role of local transverse dispersion in controlling the transport and biodegradation of contaminant in physical hydraulic conductivity and biochemical microorganisms and retardation factor heterogeneous formations by developing analytical results of macro scale coefficients a simplified stratified formation is considered here although the stratified formations is a simplification of reality it constitutes a convenient case for investigating complicated scenarios and continues to be academic interests for its prospectiveness for practical formations e g gelhar et al 1979 matheron and de marsily 1980 oya and valocchi 1998

multicomponent reactive transport in stratified formations are derived by the spectral perturbation approach miralles wilhelm and gelhar 2000 the influence of local transverse dispersion to macro scale transport and transformation behaviors in stratified formations with various heterogeneities is revealed local transverse dispersion may generally relieve the oxygen deficiency and enlarge the effective biodegradation rate it is expected that this study can deepen the understanding of the complex interaction between convection dispersion sorption and biodegradation in natural heterogeneous porous media and the derived effective coefficients can be used to preliminarily assess the impact of local transverse dispersion on macro scale transport and transformation the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 recapitulates the derivation of effective parameters section 3 gives numerical results of effective parameters and a brief discussion of the results new findings different from previous works are underlined finally section 4 concludes the paper 2 methodology fig 1 depicts the setup of the stratified formation heterogeneities are mainly attributed to the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity the activity of microbial biomass biodegradation rate and retardation factor they only vary in the vertical direction z the domain is considered as infinite so that the presence of boundaries does not influence solute transport three transport regimes depending on travel time were discussed by dagan 2012 i for td t l 2 1 where d t stands for the local transverse dispersion coefficient and l vertical integral scale ii for td t l 2 1 but td t l 2 1 where l is the formation thickness and iii td t l 2 1 due to the assumed unbounded formation we focus on the second regime the contaminant is injected across the layers over a line whose extent is large compared to the integral scale of the layers conductivity the dissolved oxygen acts as the background component in the aquifer the deviation begins from the local transport equations for the contaminant and dissolved oxygen the two equations are coupled by the biodegradation sink term which is given by the dual monod expression the local dispersion is also considered as spatially variable 2 1 governing equations 2 1 1 steady flow field the groundwater flow in a stratified formation consists of unidirectional flow parallel to the stratification fig 1 for such steady flow the magnitude of groundwater velocity u is found by darcy s law 1 u z k z j n where k is the hydraulic conductivity j is the negative constant hydraulic gradient in x direction and n is the constant porosity 2 1 2 contaminant and oxygen transport the local transport equations of the contaminant and oxygen constitute a system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations besides the advection and dispersion process the contaminant undergoes sorption and degradation processes the linear sorption isotherm is used to model the sorption process and the monod type model is adopted for the biodegradation process then the local transport equation for an organic contaminant in stratified aquifers is 2 r c d t u c d x d l 2 c d x 2 d t 2 c d z 2 r c d c a c bio where r is the local retardation factor c d is the concentration of the contaminant c a is the dissolved oxygen concentration d l and d t are the local longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients r is the biodegradation sink term c bio is the active microbial biomass concentration notice that the local transverse dispersion in our two dimensional case is the vertical transverse dispersion in a three dimensional formation similarly the local transport equation for the dissolved oxygen is 3 c a t u c a x d l 2 c

biodegradation source term of dual monod type in eqs 2 and 3 is described by 4 r c d c a c bio c a k a c a c d k d c d μ max c bio where μ max represents the maximum specific biodegradation rate of the contaminant k a and k d are the half saturation constants for the dissolved oxygen and the contaminant oxygen is a limiting factor for microbial growth the active microbial population is assumed in steady state and only space variant namely the microbial mass is considered to be only space variant and time invariant which means c bio t 0 miralles wilhelm et al 1997 this assumption has also been introduced in other previous studies in biodegradation e g rifai and bedient 1990 odencrantz et al 1990 2 2 random fields physical heterogeneity in the subsurface material is generally represented by a spatially variable hydraulic conductivity field the variation of groundwater velocity is related to hydraulic conductivity through eq 1 biochemical heterogeneity is represented by spatially variable microbial mass concentration c bio and maximum specific biodegradation rate of a contaminant μ max in this study a spatially variable retardation factor is considered as geochemical heterogeneity these spatially variable parameters control the temporal and spatial distribution of contaminant and dissolved oxygen concentration through eqs 2 and 3 respectively consequently the contaminant concentration and the dissolved oxygen concentration are also random fields 2 2 1 physical heterogeneity the hydraulic conductivity k is modeled as a stochastic process and decomposed into its ensemble mean and a small perturbation k as 5 k z k k z the perturbation k is assumed to be a statistically homogeneous random field with the spectrum gelhar et al 1979 6 s kk r 8 σ k 2 l 5 r 4 3 π 1 l 2 r 2 3 which is the spectrum of the following covariance 7 r kk s σ k 2 1 5 s 3 l 1 s 2 3 l 2 e s l s 0 where l is the correlation length in the z direction σ k 2 is the variance of the k field and r is the wave number of spectral space note that the impact of the chosen spectrum of eq 6 is discussed by matheron and de marsily 1980 analogously groundwater velocity is decomposed as 8 u u u u u k k j n k and the perturbation in the groundwater velocity field u is related to the perturbation of hydraulic conductivity k through darcy s law then the local longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients can be written as 9 d l a l u d t a t u where a l is the average local longitudinal dispersivity a t is the average local transverse dispersivity due to the velocity fluctuations the local dispersion coefficients are also random fields and their decomposition is as follows 10 d l d l d l d t d t d t the perturbation of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d l can be related to the perturbation of hydraulic conductivity k through relationship gelhar et al 1979 11 d l 3 d l 2 k k 2 2 2 biochemical heterogeneities it is reasonable to expect that there may be some relationship between the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity and a heterogeneous biodegradation rate since different hydrogeologic facies may induce different biodegradation rates due to different biological populations and lead to a correlation between hydraulic conductivity and reactivity atchley et al 2014 following the work of miralles wilhelm et al 1997 the parameter μ max c bio in eq 4 are lumped into a single random field of the form 12 w μ max c bio w w and a partial linear correlation between parameter w and hydraulic conductivity is assumed 13 w a 1 b 1 k δ w a 1 b 1 k w b 1 k δ where a 1 and b 1 are the intercept and slope of the linear correlation w k and δ is a random uncorrelated residual introduced to account for the possibility of an imperfect correlation 2 2 3 geochemical heterogeneities the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and sorption coefficient has been investigated in many works e g allen king et al 1998 bellin and rinaldo 1995 metzger et al 1996 since both parameters are correlated with sedimentary facies allen king et al 1998 the assumption of partial correlation between retardation factor and hydraulic conductivity is legitimate following the approach presented by miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996a the retardation factor r is assumed to be partially correlated with the hydraulic conductivity k 14 r a 2 b 2 k η r a 2 b 2 k r b 2 k η where a 2 and b 2 are the intercept and slope of the linear correlation r k and η is a random uncorrelated residual introduced to account for the possibility of an imperfect correlation the concentrations c a and c d can also be decomposed into their respective means and perturbations as 15 c a c a x t c a x z t c d c d x t c d x z t note that the mean concentration is considered to be independent of z in a stratified formation gelhar et al 1979 güven et al 1984 2 3 development of cross correlation terms the sink term in eqs 2 and 3 is expressed as a function of mean and

approach which has been proven useful in analyzing the problem of transport and biodegradation in the heterogeneous aquifer miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996b 2000 is used here the approach considers biodegradation as the only cause of concentration perturbation variation in time and introduces a new frame of reference that follow the plume in time then the variation in time of the concentration

after substituting eqs a 1 a 7 into eqs 23 24 and retaining second order derivatives of mean concentrations the mean equations are expressed in the original coordinate systems as 44 r r d i 1 w r c d

transport equations namely both species have the same biodegradation rate as 46 w d w a μ e c bio w nr a i 1 w w r d i 1 w w where μ e is the effective maximum specific biodegradation rate for the contaminant and the dissolved oxygen notice that this rate should be multiplied by the stoichiometric factor n for describing the biodegradation of dissolved oxygen then the effective maximum specific

1997 our derivation includes the local transverse dispersion the characteristics of these macro coefficients under effects of local transverse dispersion will be presented and discussed in the following section it should be noted that the term l 1 and l 2 in eqs 52 and 53 which comes from the perturbation of local longitudinal dispersion has limited effects on macro dispersivity zhou et al 2019 and is neglected in following quantity analysis 3 results and discussion to evaluate the macro coefficients the effective biodegradation coefficients effective retardation factors macro dispersivities effective velocities from the previous analytical calculations the hypothetical parameters based in part on the field scale tracer test at the borden site sudicky 1986 is used following the work of miralles wilhelm et al 1997 the parameters r μ m k a and k d are taken from macquarrie et al 1990 and macquarrie and sudicky 1990 table 1 lists the used parameters in the following evaluations specifically the hydrologic parameters l k n and u are taken from sudicky 1986 for the borden site and σ k 2 is decided by following gelhar et al 1979 the different values of the correlations and residual variances presented in table 1 are determined by fixing a coefficient of variation for the sorption and biodegradation process respectively the coefficient of variation for retardation and biodegradation is set as 25 50 and 75 only negative correlations b 1 b 2 0 are considered because finer porous material has larger surface areas and tends to exhibit greater sorptive capacity and microbial activity or reactivity cvetkovic and shapiro 1990 barber ii et al 1992 miralles wilhelm et al 1997 cvetkovic et al 1998 seeboonruang and ginn 2006 atchley et al 2014 the local transverse dispersivity is set as 0 0001 m 0 001 m 0 01 m and 0 1 m note that the largest value 0 1 m of local transverse dispersivity is rare in reality klenk and grathwohl 2002 zech et al 2019 under the influence of local transverse dispersion these field coefficients display many interesting features of the interaction between the hydrologic sorption and biodegradation processes in groundwater 3 1 effective biodegradation rate fig 2 presents the results obtained for the effective biodegradation rate influenced by the concentration of the dissolved oxygen under different magnitudes of local transverse dispersivity fig 3 displays the impacts of variability in biodegradation rate on effective biodegradation rate as an overview of both figures the effective biodegradation rate is generally decreased from the mean biodegradation rate 0 5 day 1 the decreases are mainly owing to the heterogeneously spatial distribution of the biodegradation rate this general result has been illustrated in previous analytical works e g miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996b miralles wilhelm et al 1997 zhou et al 2019 some numerical simulations and experiments illustrated similar results e g yan et al 2017 hunt et al 2015 green et al 2010 molins et al 2012 the general result indicates that using the mean biodegradation rate in the practical application may overestimate the biodegradation of contaminant another overall result from both figures is that the effective biodegradation rate is gradually enhanced to approaching the mean biodegradation rate with increasing local transverse dispersivity this result is comprehensible since large local transverse dispersion facilitates the transverse mixing and hence accelerates the biochemical reaction between the contaminant and dissolved oxygen cirpka et al 2015 chiogna et al 2011 this general result is also revealed in a simpler system consisting of a single species undergoing a first order decay process zhou et al 2019 for practical applications it reminds that ignoring local transverse dispersion may underestimate the effective biodegradation of contaminant in field scale in fig 2 when the local transverse dispersivity is generally small the curves vary differently for high and low dissolved oxygen regimes namely deviations of the effective biodegradation rate from the mean for a coefficient of variation of 75 are noteworthy and variable generally the deviations decrease and the curves become smooth with increasing of local transverse dispersivity specifically for low mean dissolved oxygen concentration c a 0 001 and 0 01 mg l the biodegradation process is limited and hence the effective biodegradation rates decrease with increasing mean contaminant concentration while for high mean dissolved oxygen concentration c a 1 and 10 mg l the effective biodegradation rates increase with increasing contaminant concentration and the disparity between the effective biodegradation rates for the two different concentration of dissolved oxygen decrease with increasing local transverse dispersivity seeing fig 2a d these results imply that large local transverse dispersion can relieve the effects of different magnitudes of mean dissolved oxygen concentration on effective biodegradation rate by facilitating the mixing between the contaminant and dissolved oxygen in fig 3 higher variability of biodegradation rate produces a higher deviation of the effective biodegradation rate from the mean value which has been illustrated by miralles wilhelm et al 1997 a new finding is that the disparities between deviations of the three variabilities of biodegradation rate diminish with increasing local transverse dispersivity specifically the diminishing effects become strong for sufficient contaminant concentration c d 1 mg l this finding reveals that increasing local transverse dispersion can alleviate the decreasing effects of the heterogeneity in biodegradation rate especially for sufficient reactants of biodegradation for practical applications this finding shows that local transverse dispersion may decrease the error of using the mean biodegradation rate to estimate the contaminant degradation in heterogeneous formations especially when concentrations of reactants are sufficient for degradation 3 2 effective retardation factor the sensitivity of effective retardation factor to the mean dissolved oxygen concentration the sorption process variability in retardation factor and the biodegradation process variability in biodegradation rate for different magnitudes of local transverse dispersivity are illustrated in figs 4 5 and 6 respectively the three figures display two common features one is that the effective retardation for the contaminant is moderately decreased from the mean value r 1 4 for all the various scenarios this general result has been revealed by miralles wilhelm et al 1997 the decrease is caused by the correlation terms between the retardation factor and the biodegradation rate in the mean equation for the contaminant eq 49 due to the assumption of the negatively correlated with k for the retardation factor and the biodegradation rate b 1 b 2 0 the retardation factor is positively correlated with the maximum specific biodegradation rate and thus have similar decreasing effects to the maximum specific biodegradation rate miralles wilhelm et al 1997 if biodegradation is not occurring the effective retardation factor is equal to the mean garabedian et al 1988 the other is that the effective retardation factors of all the variable cases gradually enhanced to approach the mean value with increasing local transverse dispersivity for practical applications this result implies that ignoring local transverse dispersion may underestimate the sorption process of contaminant in field scale fig 4 shows that the decrease is relatively pronounced in the high concentration regimes of the dissolved oxygen c a 1 and 10 mg l this because a high concentration of the dissolved oxygen generally introduces strong biodegradation process for small local transverse dispersivity fig 4a when the concentration of the contaminant is low c d 0 1 mg l the effective retardation factors for the two high concentration regimes of the dissolved oxygen c a 1 and 10 mg l are nearly equal because the biodegradation is mainly limited by the contaminant concentration and the two effective biodegradation rates of corresponding concentration regimes of the dissolved oxygen c a 1 and 10 mg l are also equal fig 2a the two roughly equal effective biodegradation rates indicate approximately identical decreasing effects with the increasing contaminant concentration in fig 4a 0 1 c d 10 mg l the disparity between the two effective retardation factors c a 1 and 10 mg l increases which is consistent with the increasing differences of the two effective biodegradation rates in fig 2a finally c d 10 mg l these two effective retardation factors approach the mean value because the decreasing effects of the biodegradation disappear with redundant contaminant concentration in comparison to fig 4a the disparity between the effective retardation factors of the two high concentration regimes of the dissolved oxygen c a 1 and 10 mg l decreases with increasing local transverse dispersivity in fig 4b and c this decrease is consistent with the changes in effective biodegradation rates for the two concentration regimes of the dissolved oxygen in fig 2 while for the low concentration regimes of the dissolved oxygen c a 0 001 and 0 01 mg l in fig 4 a relatively high dissolved oxygen concentration c a 0 01 mg l brings a relatively small effective retardation factor when the contaminant concentration is low c d 0 1 mg l this because the low dissolved oxygen concentration limits the biodegradation process and relatively higher dissolved oxygen concentration results in lower contaminant concentration in general increasing local transverse dispersivity can also relieve the effects of variable concentration regimes of dissolved oxygen on effective retardation factor in fig 5 the large variability of retardation factor enlarge the deviation from the mean value which has been reported in the work of miralles wilhelm et al 1997 the new finding is that increasing local transverse dispersivity reduces the differences between effective retardation factors of the three coefficients of variation of retardation factor this finding reveals that local transverse dispersion can weaken the effects of variability of retardation factor on effective retardation factor from fig 6 it can be seen that higher variability in the maximum specific biodegradation rate produces a higher deviation of the effective retardation factor from the mean value comparing fig 6a b and c a more interesting finding is that the deviations between effective retardation factors of the three coefficients of variation of maximum specific biodegradation rate enlarge with increasing local transverse dispersivity before approaching the mean value as displayed in fig 6d since strong biodegradation process can enhance the deviation of effective retardation factor from the mean value increasing local transverse dispersivity may accelerate the biodegradation process and then magnify the impact of the variability of maximum specific biodegradation rate on effective retardation factor however the effects of maximum specific biodegradation rate variability are generally insignificant the deviation of the effective retardation factor for a coefficient of variation of 25 from the effective retardation factor for a coefficient of variation of 75 is less than 2 of the mean at the most for practical applications this result shows that the effects of variability in the maximum specific biodegradation rate on field scale retardation factor may be neglected for stratified aquifers 3 3 macro dispersivity fig 7 displays the influence of the mean dissolved oxygen concentration on longitudinal macrodispersivities for the contaminant and the dissolved oxygen under different magnitudes of local transverse dispersivity as indicated in gelhar et al 1979 and matheron and de marsily 1980 longitudinal macro dispersivity can be dramatically changed by the local transverse dispersion in stratified formations the mechanism of biodegradation produces the concentration dependence in the macrodispersivities and the effects of the biodegradation variability results in decreasing of the macrodispersivities for both the contaminant and the dissolved oxygen from nonbiodegradation values miralles wilhelm et al 1997 the macrodispersivity for the contaminant is generally higher than the macrodispersivity for the dissolved oxygen because the variability in contaminant sorption can cause significant increases in macrodispersivity garabedian et al 1988 for small local transverse dispersivity in fig 7a the macrodispersivities for the contaminant and dissolved oxygen differ and vary significantly with increasing mean contaminant concentration in the case of the contaminant its macrodispersivity increases with increasing mean contaminant concentration and decreases with increasing mean dissolved oxygen concentration for relatively large mean dissolved oxygen concentration c a 1 and 10 mg l lower contaminant concentrations result in smaller macrodispersivity because most of the contaminant mass is biodegraded with increasing contaminant concentrations more contaminant is reserved and dispersed when the concentration of dissolved oxygen is limited which enlarge macrodispersivity for the relatively low dissolved oxygen concentration c a 0 01 and 0 001 mg l the biodegradation is limited at a large scale with the scarcity of the dissolved oxygen and then most of the contaminant disperses the macrodispersivity for the dissolved oxygen has a similar rationale increasing in mean concentration of dissolved oxygen will enlarge the macrodispersivity for the dissolved oxygen while higher mean concentration of contaminant will reduce the macrodispersivity for the dissolved oxygen this rationale of macrodispersivities for the contaminant and the dissolved oxygen based on negligible local transverse dispersion has been revealed in the work of miralles wilhelm et al 1997 for increasing local transverse dispersivity as displayed in fig 7b c and d the deviations of macrodispersivities from the nonbiodegradation values decrease both for the contaminant and the dissolved oxygen the effects of variability in the mean concentration of dissolved oxygen are also limited this because large local transverse dispersion can attenuate the effects of the variability of biodegradation process as stated in section 3 1 this result reveals that local transverse dispersion may produce an influence on macrodispersion by affecting the biodegradation process fig 8 shows the sensitivity of the macrodispersivities to variability in the maximum specific biodegradation rate for different magnitudes of local transverse dispersivity generally higher variability of maximum specific biodegradation rate results in greater variation of macrodispersivities with the contaminant concentration miralles wilhelm et al 1997 for the macrodispersivity of the dissolved oxygen the deviations between macrodispersivities for different coefficients of variation of maximum specific biodegradation rate fade with increasing local transverse dispersivity because the local transverse dispersion can weaken the effects of variability of the biodegradation process as previously mentioned this finding implies that neglecting local transverse dispersion may magnify the effects of maximum specific biodegradation rate variability on the dissolved oxygen macrodispersivity however for the contaminant macrodispersivity the deviations between macrodispersivities for different coefficients of variation of maximum specific biodegradation rate enlarge with increasing local transverse dispersivity before approaching the nonbiodegradation value this finding indicates that the impact of the maximum specific biodegradation rate variability on the contaminant macrodispersivity increases with increasing local transverse dispersivity the reason may be that large local transverse dispersion can enhance the impact of maximum specific biodegradation rate variability on the sorption process fig 6 which may significantly change the contaminant macrodispersivity this finding reveals an interaction between the biodegradation sorption and dispersion processes for the contaminant and has important practical implication without considering local transverse dispersion the effects of maximum specific biodegradation rate variability on macrodispersivity for adsorbable solute may be underestimated fig 9 shows the results for the contaminant macrodispersivity influenced by retardation factor variability under different magnitudes of local transverse dispersivity with the assumption of negative correlation between retardation factor and conductivity the higher coefficient of variation of retardation factor produces higher macrodispersivities garabedian et al 1988 and miralles wilhelm et al 1997 described similar effects for a negative correlation between a linear distribution coefficient and log hydraulic conductivity for low contaminant concentration c d 1 mg l the gaps between macrodispersivities for different coefficients of variation of retardation factor increase with increasing local transverse dispersivity because most of the contaminant mass in solution is biodegraded while for high contaminant concentration c d 1 mg l the gaps between macrodispersivities keep unchanged with increasing local transverse dispersivity this because the contaminant mass in solution is in excess for the biodegradation process generally the increasing local transverse dispersivity smoothes the variation of contaminant macrodispersivities with contaminant concentration this finding reveals that local transverse dispersion may magnify the effects of retardation factor variability on macrodispersivity for the biodegradable contaminant while for a conservative contaminant the effects of retardation factor variability on macrodispersivity may not be affected by the local transverse dispersion it should be noted that neither the dissolved oxygen macrodispersivity nor the effective biodegradation rate are affected by this variability in retardation 3 4 effective velocity fig 10 shows the influence of the mean dissolved oxygen concentration on effective velocities for the contaminant and the dissolved oxygen with concentrations under different magnitudes of local transverse dispersivity the heterogeneous biodegradation process produces the concentration dependence in v d and v a due to the assumption of negative correlation between biodegradation rate and hydraulic conductivity heterogeneous biodegradation of reactants make effective velocities increase from the mean values miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996b zhou et al 2019 in the case of the contaminant effective velocities decrease with increasing mean contaminant concentration and increase with increasing mean dissolved oxygen concentration for high mean dissolved oxygen concentration c a 10 mg l and 1 mg l lower contaminant concentrations result in larger effective velocity because most of the contaminant mass is biodegraded with increasing contaminant concentrations more contaminant is reserved which reduces the effective velocity to the mean value while for low dissolved oxygen concentration c a 0 001 mg l and 0 01 mg l the biodegradation is limited at a large scale with the scarcity of the dissolved oxygen which makes the effective velocity approach the mean value the effective velocity for the dissolved oxygen has a similar rationale it decreases to the mean value for increasing mean dissolved oxygen concentration and it increases for higher mean contaminant concentrations particularly when the local transverse dispersivity is relatively small fig 10a and b the effective velocities for the contaminant and the dissolved oxygen differ and vary significantly for large local transverse dispersivity fig 10c and d the variations of both effective velocities are limited and all the effective velocities approach the mean value this because local transverse dispersion can smooth the heterogeneity in biodegradation as previously illustrated fig 11 shows the sensitivity of the effective velocities to variability in the maximum specific biodegradation rate for different magnitudes of local transverse dispersivity the higher variability of maximum specific biodegradation rate produces higher effective velocities for both the contaminant and the dissolved oxygen however the effects of variability in maximum specific biodegradation rate on effective velocity are insignificant the deviation between effective velocities for 25 coefficient of variation and 75 coefficient of variation is less than 4 of the mean this finding implies that the effects of maximum specific biodegradation rate variability on effective velocity may be negligible 4 summary and conclusions two component reactive transport in a stratified aquifer with various physical and biochemical heterogeneities is analytically studied field scale transport and transformation coefficients effective retardation factor longitudinal macrodispersivity effective velocity and effective biodegradation rate are derived particular attention has been placed on the effects of local transverse dispersion which are not fully understood in such complex heterogeneities our results comprehensively revealed the effects of local transverse dispersion upon the macro scale transport and transformation coefficients under various heterogeneities the primary findings of our study are the following 1 local transverse dispersion can smooth the effects of heterogeneous biodegradation process and make field scale biodegradation rate increase to the mean value especially when reactants are sufficient for degradation this finding implies that neglecting local transverse dispersion may magnify the deviation of using the mean biodegradation rate to predict biodegradation process at the field scale 2 local transverse dispersion may enlarge the effective retardation factor and weaken the effects of variability in retardation factor and variation of mean dissolved oxygen concentration this finding reveals that neglecting local transverse dispersion may underestimate the sorption effects the effects of biodegradation rate variability on effective retardation factor are negligible regardless of the local transverse dispersion 3 the multi heterogeneity has strong effects on the longitudinal macrodispersivity for the contaminant and the dissolved oxygen the heterogeneities and the nonlinear biodegradation mechanism makes the longitudinal macrodispersivity change significantly with mean solute concentration it seems that local transverse dispersion may limit the effects of variation of mean dissolved oxygen concentration on macrodispersivities because local transverse dispersion can smooth the variability of the biodegradation process the effects of maximum specific biodegradation rate variability on macrodispersivities for the dissolved oxygen also could be attenuated for the same reason as the variation of mean dissolved oxygen concentration however local transverse dispersion is likely to magnify the effects of maximum specific biodegradation rate variability on the contaminant macrodispersivity because of the sorption effects the effects of retardation factor variability on the contaminant macrodispersivity also can be enlarged by local transverse dispersion 4 local transverse dispersion can decrease the deviation of effective velocities from the mean by smoothing the heterogeneities in the biodegradation process the effects of maximum specific biodegradation rate variability on effective velocity are generally insignificant it must be stressed that the stratified formation considered in this study is highly simplified real aquifers are heterogeneous in three dimensions the assumptions of partial linear biodegradation conductivity correlation and retardation conductivity correlation are adopted as many previous studies e g miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996b garabedian et al 1988 cunningham and fadel 2007 atchley et al 2014 and have not been fully validated by experiments but it is noted that bauer et al 2009 have shown experimentally an enhancement of organic contaminant biodegradation in high permeability zones the assumption of steady state biomass is also unrealistic although it has been proven tolerable for the derivation of effective field scale transport coefficients miralles wilhelm and gelhar 2000 the analytical developments are based on a locally stationary and small perturbation approximation and hence the derived asymptotic results may be valid only for unrealistically large travel times and moderate heterogeneity problems however understanding the role of local transverse dispersion is essential for analyzing field scale transport of reactive contaminants although the results of this study are not directly applicable to actual field conditions they nevertheless provide important insights into the role of local transverse dispersion for macro scale transport and transformation coefficients in heterogeneous formations neglecting local transverse dispersion is a frequently used simplification in field scale models for simulating the reactive solute transport e g loschko et al 2016 2018 the results of this investigation reveal the possible consequences of the simplification for reactive transport in chemically and hydraulically heterogeneous aquifers the derived expressions can also serve as a guide tool for evaluating the influence of local transverse dispersion on field scale coefficients in the sense that it indicates whether the local transverse dispersion should be

1552,the correct characterization of macro scale contaminant transport and transformation rates is an important issue for modeling reactive transport in heterogeneous aquifers while previous studies have investigated field scale heterogeneity of transport and biochemical properties the effects of local transverse dispersion on macro scale transport and transformation rates have not been well understood in this paper the process of oxygen limited biodegradation in a stratified aquifer is analysed by spectral perturbation approach and longitudinal macrodispersivity effective biodegradation rate effective retardation factor and effective velocity are derived for the coupled transport equations of a system consisting of a contaminant and an oxidizing agent oxygen the effects of local transverse dispersion on these macro scale coefficients are studied it is shown that local transverse dispersion can smooth the heterogeneity in biodegradation and sorption processes and enlarge effective biodegradation rate and retardation factor the local transverse dispersion can also limit the effects of heterogeneity in biodegradation process on longitudinal macrodispersivities and effective velocities for the contaminant and dissolved oxygen but the effects of heterogeneity in sorption process on the contaminant macrodispersivity is likely to be magnified by local transverse dispersion keywords contaminant transport biodegradation sorption heterogeneity effective coeffcients local transverse dispersion 1 introduction due to the spatial variability of physical and biochemical properties of natural aquifers transport and degradation of contaminant plumes are complicated behaviors characterizing the impacts of these heterogeneities is critical to describe contaminant transport and natural attenuation in subsurface environments for the conservative solute transport the influence of physical heterogeneity which is usually referred to as spatially variable hydraulic conductivity has been extensively studied e g gelhar and axness 1983 dagan 1984 1988 2012 rubin 1990 gelhar 1993 fiori et al 2015 2016 2017 zech et al 2015 the up scaled parameter macrodispersivity is derived to quantify the significant physical heterogeneity along with the physical heterogeneity variation of hydraulic conductivity biochemical heterogeneities such as spatially variable abiotic degradation rate sorption coefficient and microbial activity have also been investigated through analytical analysis or numerical simulation for reactive solute transport e g chrysikopoulos et al 1990 1992a 1992b cvetkovic and dagan 1994 dagan and cvetkovic 1993 bellin et al 1993 hu et al 1995 1997 valocchi 1989 garabedian et al 1988 kabala and sposito 1991 1994 robin et al 1991 burr et al 1994 miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996a miralles wilhelm et al 1997 miralles wilhelm and gelhar 2000 oya and valocchi 1998 xin and zhang 1998 kaluarachchi et al 2000 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2018 up scaled quantities that characterize the complex interplay between transport and sorption biodegradation processes at lower scale are obtained however local dispersion which is considered to be negligible for conservative solute transport at field scale gelhar and axness 1983 is also treated as an insignificant process for multi component biodegradable solutes transport in some analytical works e g miralles wilhelm et al 1997 miralles wilhelm and gelhar 2000 the importance of local dispersion has been received recognition e g kitanidis 1994 cirpka and kitanidis 2001 cirpka et al 2012 ye et al 2015a b local dispersion represents the local scale heterogeneity and consists of two components molecular diffusion of solute and the tortuous flow paths of water at the local scale in other words local dispersion is the macro scale quantity for local scale transport and mixing behavior without local dispersion there will be no microscale mixing of reaction partners e g electron donors and acceptors for microbially mediated redox reactions and dilution of one species at the local scale chiogna et al 2011 and the local scale is also where reactions take place therefore local dispersion is identified to be a critical process for overall contaminant degradation many works have addressed the local dispersive mixing especially local transverse dispersive mixing by using numerical modeling and experiment e g chiogna et al 2009 2011 rolle et al 2009 2012 cirpka et al 2015 acharya et al 2007 ballarini et al 2012 rahman et al 2005 klenk and grathwohl 2002 stenback et al 2004 knutson et al 2007 dentz et al 2011 le borgne et al 2011 most of them focusing on pore scale or laboratory scale these works generally indicate that the transverse dispersion components typically smaller than the longitudinal ones is a relevant process in the mixing of electron acceptors and electron donors in biodegrading groundwater plumes and constitutes an essential prerequisite for geochemical and biodegradation reactions particularly transverse dispersion represents a fundamental controlling factor for steady plumes meanwhile several notable works have shown that local transverse dispersion may also play a critical role in field scale biodegradation essaid et al 2015 prommer et al 2009 cirpka et al 1999 chu et al 2005 oya and valocchi 1998 janssen et al 2006 fernàndez garcia et al 2008 for example oya and valocchi 1998 studied nonlinear biodegradation in stratified aquifers and derived a simple expression for the long term pollutant biodegradation rate they showed that local transverse dispersion was critical to the establishment of the asymptotic transport janssen et al 2006 investigated the nonlinear biodegradation of a contaminant in heterogeneous aquifers by the stochastic convective and the advective dispersive stream tube approaches they found that the error caused by neglecting local dispersion increase with time fernàndez garcia et al 2008 studied instantaneous precipitation dissolution in stratified aquifers and derived closed form analytical solutions for statistical moments of reaction rates for the particular case of negligible transverse dispersion they showed that transverse dispersion is a critical process in large travel times despite this progress the effects of local transverse dispersion on the macro scale transport behavior of multicomponent reactive solutes remain in most cases not fully understood the present paper contributes to investigating the role of local transverse dispersion in controlling the transport and biodegradation of contaminant in physical hydraulic conductivity and biochemical microorganisms and retardation factor heterogeneous formations by developing analytical results of macro scale coefficients a simplified stratified formation is considered here although the stratified formations is a simplification of reality it constitutes a convenient case for investigating complicated scenarios and continues to be academic interests for its prospectiveness for practical formations e g gelhar et al 1979 matheron and de marsily 1980 oya and valocchi 1998 fiori and dagan 2002 fernàndez garcia et al 2008 bolster et al 2011 macro scale coefficients of retardation dispersion velocity and biodegradation containing local transverse dispersion for multicomponent reactive transport in stratified formations are derived by the spectral perturbation approach miralles wilhelm and gelhar 2000 the influence of local transverse dispersion to macro scale transport and transformation behaviors in stratified formations with various heterogeneities is revealed local transverse dispersion may generally relieve the oxygen deficiency and enlarge the effective biodegradation rate it is expected that this study can deepen the understanding of the complex interaction between convection dispersion sorption and biodegradation in natural heterogeneous porous media and the derived effective coefficients can be used to preliminarily assess the impact of local transverse dispersion on macro scale transport and transformation the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 recapitulates the derivation of effective parameters section 3 gives numerical results of effective parameters and a brief discussion of the results new findings different from previous works are underlined finally section 4 concludes the paper 2 methodology fig 1 depicts the setup of the stratified formation heterogeneities are mainly attributed to the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity the activity of microbial biomass biodegradation rate and retardation factor they only vary in the vertical direction z the domain is considered as infinite so that the presence of boundaries does not influence solute transport three transport regimes depending on travel time were discussed by dagan 2012 i for td t l 2 1 where d t stands for the local transverse dispersion coefficient and l vertical integral scale ii for td t l 2 1 but td t l 2 1 where l is the formation thickness and iii td t l 2 1 due to the assumed unbounded formation we focus on the second regime the contaminant is injected across the layers over a line whose extent is large compared to the integral scale of the layers conductivity the dissolved oxygen acts as the background component in the aquifer the deviation begins from the local transport equations for the contaminant and dissolved oxygen the two equations are coupled by the biodegradation sink term which is given by the dual monod expression the local dispersion is also considered as spatially variable 2 1 governing equations 2 1 1 steady flow field the groundwater flow in a stratified formation consists of unidirectional flow parallel to the stratification fig 1 for such steady flow the magnitude of groundwater velocity u is found by darcy s law 1 u z k z j n where k is the hydraulic conductivity j is the negative constant hydraulic gradient in x direction and n is the constant porosity 2 1 2 contaminant and oxygen transport the local transport equations of the contaminant and oxygen constitute a system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations besides the advection and dispersion process the contaminant undergoes sorption and degradation processes the linear sorption isotherm is used to model the sorption process and the monod type model is adopted for the biodegradation process then the local transport equation for an organic contaminant in stratified aquifers is 2 r c d t u c d x d l 2 c d x 2 d t 2 c d z 2 r c d c a c bio where r is the local retardation factor c d is the concentration of the contaminant c a is the dissolved oxygen concentration d l and d t are the local longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients r is the biodegradation sink term c bio is the active microbial biomass concentration notice that the local transverse dispersion in our two dimensional case is the vertical transverse dispersion in a three dimensional formation similarly the local transport equation for the dissolved oxygen is 3 c a t u c a x d l 2 c a x 2 d t 2 c a z 2 n r c d c a c bio it is noted that there is no sorption term oxygen is not sorbed and a stoichiometric factor n as a ration of oxygen to contaminant consumed is included the biodegradation source term of dual monod type in eqs 2 and 3 is described by 4 r c d c a c bio c a k a c a c d k d c d μ max c bio where μ max represents the maximum specific biodegradation rate of the contaminant k a and k d are the half saturation constants for the dissolved oxygen and the contaminant oxygen is a limiting factor for microbial growth the active microbial population is assumed in steady state and only space variant namely the microbial mass is considered to be only space variant and time invariant which means c bio t 0 miralles wilhelm et al 1997 this assumption has also been introduced in other previous studies in biodegradation e g rifai and bedient 1990 odencrantz et al 1990 2 2 random fields physical heterogeneity in the subsurface material is generally represented by a spatially variable hydraulic conductivity field the variation of groundwater velocity is related to hydraulic conductivity through eq 1 biochemical heterogeneity is represented by spatially variable microbial mass concentration c bio and maximum specific biodegradation rate of a contaminant μ max in this study a spatially variable retardation factor is considered as geochemical heterogeneity these spatially variable parameters control the temporal and spatial distribution of contaminant and dissolved oxygen concentration through eqs 2 and 3 respectively consequently the contaminant concentration and the dissolved oxygen concentration are also random fields 2 2 1 physical heterogeneity the hydraulic conductivity k is modeled as a stochastic process and decomposed into its ensemble mean and a small perturbation k as 5 k z k k z the perturbation k is assumed to be a statistically homogeneous random field with the spectrum gelhar et al 1979 6 s kk r 8 σ k 2 l 5 r 4 3 π 1 l 2 r 2 3 which is the spectrum of the following covariance 7 r kk s σ k 2 1 5 s 3 l 1 s 2 3 l 2 e s l s 0 where l is the correlation length in the z direction σ k 2 is the variance of the k field and r is the wave number of spectral space note that the impact of the chosen spectrum of eq 6 is discussed by matheron and de marsily 1980 analogously groundwater velocity is decomposed as 8 u u u u u k k j n k and the perturbation in the groundwater velocity field u is related to the perturbation of hydraulic conductivity k through darcy s law then the local longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients can be written as 9 d l a l u d t a t u where a l is the average local longitudinal dispersivity a t is the average local transverse dispersivity due to the velocity fluctuations the local dispersion coefficients are also random fields and their decomposition is as follows 10 d l d l d l d t d t d t the perturbation of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d l can be related to the perturbation of hydraulic conductivity k through relationship gelhar et al 1979 11 d l 3 d l 2 k k 2 2 2 biochemical heterogeneities it is reasonable to expect that there may be some relationship between the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity and a heterogeneous biodegradation rate since different hydrogeologic facies may induce different biodegradation rates due to different biological populations and lead to a correlation between hydraulic conductivity and reactivity atchley et al 2014 following the work of miralles wilhelm et al 1997 the parameter μ max c bio in eq 4 are lumped into a single random field of the form 12 w μ max c bio w w and a partial linear correlation between parameter w and hydraulic conductivity is assumed 13 w a 1 b 1 k δ w a 1 b 1 k w b 1 k δ where a 1 and b 1 are the intercept and slope of the linear correlation w k and δ is a random uncorrelated residual introduced to account for the possibility of an imperfect correlation 2 2 3 geochemical heterogeneities the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and sorption coefficient has been investigated in many works e g allen king et al 1998 bellin and rinaldo 1995 metzger et al 1996 since both parameters are correlated with sedimentary facies allen king et al 1998 the assumption of partial correlation between retardation factor and hydraulic conductivity is legitimate following the approach presented by miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996a the retardation factor r is assumed to be partially correlated with the hydraulic conductivity k 14 r a 2 b 2 k η r a 2 b 2 k r b 2 k η where a 2 and b 2 are the intercept and slope of the linear correlation r k and η is a random uncorrelated residual introduced to account for the possibility of an imperfect correlation the concentrations c a and c d can also be decomposed into their respective means and perturbations as 15 c a c a x t c a x z t c d c d x t c d x z t note that the mean concentration is considered to be independent of z in a stratified formation gelhar et al 1979 güven et al 1984 2 3 development of cross correlation terms the sink term in eqs 2 and 3 is expressed as a function of mean and perturbation concentrations with a taylor series expansion centered on the mean concentrations 16 r c a c d w r r a c a r d c d r aa c a 2 r dd c d 2 r ad c a c d w with 17 r 1 w r c a c d w c a k a c

analysis decomposing the random fields in eq 2 and eq 3 into means and small perturbations and taking the expectation of the equation and retaining terms to second order in perturbations yield the mean transport equations 18 r c d t t r c d u c d x x u c d d l 2 c d x 2 2 x 2 d l c d e 2 z 2 d t c d f ψ c d c a 19 c a t u c a x x u c a d l 2 c a x 2 2 x 2 d l c a g 2 z 2 d t c a h nψ c d c a

direct applicability of previous approximations gelhar and axness 1983 gelhar 1987 to solve the perturbation transport equation is excluded to obtain solutions of eqs 30 and 31 the time scaling approach which has been proven useful in analyzing the problem of transport and biodegradation in the heterogeneous aquifer miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996b 2000 is used here the approach considers biodegradation as the only cause of concentration perturbation variation in time and introduces a new frame of reference that follow the plume in time then the variation in time of the concentration perturbation becomes negligible at large times these variables are scaled in time by solving the following intermediate simplified equations miralles wilhelm et al 1997 miralles wilhelm and gelhar

decreased from the mean biodegradation rate 0 5 day 1 the decreases are mainly owing to the heterogeneously spatial distribution of the biodegradation rate this general result has been illustrated in previous analytical works e g miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996b miralles wilhelm et al 1997 zhou et al 2019 some numerical simulations and experiments illustrated similar results e g yan et al 2017 hunt et al 2015 green et al 2010 molins et al 2012 the general result indicates that using the mean biodegradation rate in the practical application may overestimate the biodegradation of contaminant another overall result from both figures is that the effective biodegradation rate is gradually enhanced to approaching the mean biodegradation rate with increasing local transverse dispersivity this result is comprehensible since large local transverse dispersion facilitates the transverse mixing and hence accelerates the biochemical reaction between the contaminant and dissolved oxygen cirpka et al 2015 chiogna et al 2011 this general result is also revealed in a simpler system consisting of a single species undergoing a first order decay process zhou et al 2019 for practical applications it reminds that ignoring local transverse dispersion may underestimate the effective biodegradation of contaminant in field scale in fig 2 when the local transverse dispersivity is generally small the curves vary differently for high and low dissolved oxygen regimes namely deviations of the effective biodegradation rate from the mean for a coefficient of variation of 75 are noteworthy and variable generally the deviations decrease and the curves become smooth with increasing of local transverse dispersivity specifically for low mean dissolved oxygen concentration c a 0 001 and 0 01 mg l the biodegradation process is limited and hence the effective biodegradation rates decrease with increasing mean contaminant concentration while for high mean dissolved oxygen concentration c a 1 and 10 mg l the effective biodegradation rates increase with increasing contaminant concentration and the disparity between the effective biodegradation rates for the two different concentration of dissolved oxygen decrease with increasing local transverse dispersivity seeing fig 2a d these results imply that large local transverse dispersion can relieve the effects of different magnitudes of mean dissolved oxygen concentration on effective biodegradation rate by facilitating the mixing between the contaminant and dissolved oxygen in fig 3 higher variability of biodegradation rate produces a higher deviation of the effective biodegradation rate from the mean value which has been illustrated by miralles wilhelm et al 1997 a new finding is that the disparities between deviations of the three variabilities of biodegradation rate diminish with increasing local transverse dispersivity specifically the diminishing effects become strong for sufficient contaminant concentration c d 1 mg l this finding reveals that increasing local transverse dispersion can alleviate the decreasing effects of the heterogeneity in biodegradation rate especially for sufficient reactants of biodegradation for practical applications this finding shows that local transverse dispersion may decrease the error of using the mean biodegradation rate to estimate the contaminant degradation in heterogeneous formations especially when concentrations of reactants are sufficient for degradation 3 2 effective retardation factor the sensitivity of effective retardation factor to the mean dissolved oxygen concentration the sorption process variability in retardation factor and the biodegradation process variability in biodegradation rate for different magnitudes of local transverse dispersivity are illustrated in figs 4 5 and 6 respectively the three figures display two common features one is that the effective retardation for the contaminant is moderately decreased from the mean value r 1 4 for all the various scenarios this general result has been revealed by miralles wilhelm et al 1997 the decrease is caused by the correlation terms between the retardation factor and the biodegradation rate in the mean equation for the contaminant eq 49 due to the assumption of the negatively correlated with k for the retardation factor and the biodegradation rate b 1 b 2 0 the retardation factor is positively correlated with the maximum specific biodegradation rate and thus have similar decreasing effects to the maximum specific biodegradation rate miralles wilhelm et al 1997 if biodegradation is not occurring the effective retardation factor is equal to the mean garabedian et al 1988 the other is that the effective retardation factors of all the variable cases gradually enhanced to approach the mean value with increasing local transverse dispersivity for practical applications this result implies that ignoring local transverse dispersion may underestimate the sorption process of contaminant in field scale fig 4 shows that the decrease is relatively pronounced in the high concentration regimes of the dissolved oxygen c a 1 and 10 mg l this because a high concentration of the dissolved oxygen generally introduces strong biodegradation process for small local transverse dispersivity fig 4a when the concentration of the contaminant is low c d 0 1 mg l the effective retardation factors for the two high concentration regimes of the dissolved oxygen c a 1 and 10 mg l are nearly equal because the biodegradation is mainly limited by the contaminant concentration and the two effective biodegradation rates of corresponding concentration regimes of the dissolved oxygen c a 1 and 10 mg l are also equal fig 2a the two roughly equal effective biodegradation rates indicate approximately identical decreasing effects with the increasing contaminant concentration in fig 4a 0 1 c d 10 mg l the disparity between the two effective retardation factors c a 1 and 10 mg l increases which is consistent with the increasing differences of the two effective biodegradation rates in fig 2a finally c d 10 mg l these two effective retardation factors approach the mean value because the decreasing effects of the biodegradation disappear with redundant contaminant concentration in comparison to fig 4a the disparity between the effective retardation factors of the two high concentration regimes of the dissolved oxygen c a 1 and 10 mg l decreases with increasing local transverse dispersivity in fig 4b and c this decrease is consistent with the changes in effective biodegradation rates for the two concentration regimes of the dissolved oxygen in fig 2 while for the low concentration regimes of the dissolved oxygen c a 0 001 and 0 01 mg l in fig 4 a relatively high dissolved oxygen concentration c a 0 01 mg l brings a relatively small effective retardation factor when the contaminant concentration is low c d 0 1 mg l this because the low dissolved oxygen concentration limits the biodegradation process and relatively higher dissolved oxygen concentration results in lower contaminant concentration in general increasing local transverse dispersivity can also relieve the effects of variable concentration regimes of dissolved oxygen on effective retardation factor in fig 5 the large variability of retardation factor enlarge the deviation from the mean value which has been reported in the work of miralles wilhelm et al 1997 the new finding is that increasing local transverse dispersivity reduces the differences between effective retardation factors of the three coefficients of variation of retardation factor this finding reveals that local transverse dispersion can weaken the effects of variability of retardation factor on effective retardation factor from fig 6 it can be seen that higher variability in the maximum specific biodegradation rate produces a higher deviation of the effective retardation factor from the mean value comparing fig 6a b and c a more interesting finding is that the deviations between effective retardation factors of the three coefficients of variation of maximum specific biodegradation rate enlarge with increasing local transverse dispersivity before approaching the mean value as displayed in fig 6d since strong biodegradation process can enhance the deviation of effective retardation factor from the mean value increasing local transverse dispersivity may accelerate the biodegradation process and then magnify the impact of the variability of maximum specific biodegradation rate on effective retardation factor however the effects of maximum specific biodegradation rate variability are generally insignificant the deviation of the effective retardation factor for a coefficient of variation of 25 from the effective retardation factor for a coefficient of variation of 75 is less than 2 of the mean at the most for practical applications this result shows that the effects of variability in the maximum specific biodegradation rate on field scale retardation factor may be neglected for stratified aquifers 3 3 macro dispersivity fig 7 displays the influence of the mean dissolved oxygen concentration on longitudinal macrodispersivities for the contaminant and the dissolved oxygen under different magnitudes of local transverse dispersivity as indicated in gelhar et al 1979 and matheron and de marsily 1980 longitudinal macro dispersivity can be dramatically changed by the local transverse dispersion in stratified formations the mechanism of biodegradation produces the concentration dependence in the macrodispersivities and the effects of the biodegradation variability results in decreasing of the macrodispersivities for both the contaminant and the dissolved oxygen from nonbiodegradation values miralles wilhelm et al 1997 the macrodispersivity for the contaminant is generally higher than the macrodispersivity for the dissolved oxygen because the variability in contaminant sorption can cause significant increases in macrodispersivity garabedian et al 1988 for small local transverse dispersivity in fig 7a the macrodispersivities for the contaminant and dissolved oxygen differ and vary significantly with increasing mean contaminant concentration in the case of the contaminant its macrodispersivity increases with increasing mean contaminant concentration and decreases with increasing mean dissolved oxygen concentration for relatively large mean dissolved oxygen concentration c a 1 and 10 mg l lower contaminant concentrations result in smaller macrodispersivity because most of the contaminant mass is biodegraded with increasing contaminant concentrations more contaminant is reserved and dispersed when the concentration of dissolved oxygen is limited which enlarge macrodispersivity for the relatively low dissolved oxygen concentration c a 0 01 and 0 001 mg l the biodegradation is limited at a large scale with the scarcity of the dissolved oxygen and then most of the contaminant disperses the macrodispersivity for the dissolved oxygen has a similar rationale increasing in mean concentration of dissolved oxygen will enlarge the macrodispersivity for the dissolved oxygen while higher mean concentration of contaminant will reduce the macrodispersivity for the dissolved oxygen this rationale of macrodispersivities for the contaminant and the dissolved oxygen based on negligible local transverse dispersion has been revealed in the work of miralles wilhelm et al 1997 for increasing local transverse dispersivity as displayed in fig 7b c and d the deviations of macrodispersivities from the nonbiodegradation values decrease both for the contaminant and the dissolved oxygen the effects of variability in the mean concentration of dissolved oxygen are also limited this because large local transverse dispersion can attenuate the effects of the variability of biodegradation process as stated in section 3 1 this result reveals that local transverse dispersion may produce an influence on macrodispersion by affecting the biodegradation process fig 8 shows the sensitivity of the macrodispersivities to variability in the maximum specific biodegradation rate for different magnitudes of local transverse dispersivity generally higher variability of maximum specific biodegradation rate results in greater variation of macrodispersivities with the contaminant concentration miralles wilhelm et al 1997 for the macrodispersivity of the dissolved oxygen the deviations between macrodispersivities for different coefficients of variation of maximum specific biodegradation rate fade with increasing local transverse dispersivity because the local transverse dispersion can weaken the effects of variability of the biodegradation process as previously mentioned this finding implies that neglecting local transverse dispersion may magnify the effects of maximum specific biodegradation rate variability on the dissolved oxygen macrodispersivity however for the contaminant macrodispersivity the deviations between macrodispersivities for different coefficients of variation of maximum specific biodegradation rate enlarge with increasing local transverse dispersivity before approaching the nonbiodegradation value this finding indicates that the impact of the maximum specific biodegradation rate variability on the contaminant macrodispersivity increases with increasing local transverse dispersivity the reason may be that large local transverse dispersion can enhance the impact of maximum specific biodegradation rate variability on the sorption process fig 6 which may significantly change the contaminant macrodispersivity this finding reveals an interaction between the biodegradation sorption and dispersion processes for the contaminant and has important practical implication without considering local transverse dispersion the effects of maximum specific biodegradation rate variability on macrodispersivity for adsorbable solute may be underestimated fig 9 shows the results for the contaminant macrodispersivity influenced by retardation factor variability under different magnitudes of local transverse dispersivity with the assumption of negative correlation between retardation factor and conductivity the higher coefficient of variation of retardation factor produces higher macrodispersivities garabedian et al 1988 and miralles wilhelm et al 1997 described similar effects for a negative correlation between a linear distribution coefficient and log hydraulic conductivity for low contaminant concentration c d 1 mg l the gaps between macrodispersivities for different coefficients of variation of retardation factor increase with increasing local transverse dispersivity because most of the contaminant mass in solution is biodegraded while for high contaminant concentration c d 1 mg l the gaps between macrodispersivities keep unchanged with increasing local transverse dispersivity this because the contaminant mass in solution is in excess for the biodegradation process generally the increasing local transverse dispersivity smoothes the variation of contaminant macrodispersivities with contaminant concentration this finding reveals that local transverse dispersion may magnify the effects of retardation factor variability on macrodispersivity for the biodegradable contaminant while for a conservative contaminant the effects of retardation factor variability on macrodispersivity may not be affected by the local transverse dispersion it should be noted that neither the dissolved oxygen macrodispersivity nor the effective biodegradation rate are affected by this variability in retardation 3 4 effective velocity fig 10 shows the influence of the mean dissolved oxygen concentration on effective velocities for the contaminant and the dissolved oxygen with concentrations under different magnitudes of local transverse dispersivity the heterogeneous biodegradation process produces the concentration dependence in v d and v a due to the assumption of negative correlation between biodegradation rate and hydraulic conductivity heterogeneous biodegradation of reactants make effective velocities increase from the mean values miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996b zhou et al 2019 in the case of the contaminant effective velocities decrease with increasing mean contaminant concentration and increase with increasing mean dissolved oxygen concentration for high mean dissolved oxygen concentration c a 10 mg l and 1 mg l lower contaminant concentrations result in larger effective velocity because most of the contaminant mass is biodegraded with increasing contaminant concentrations more contaminant is reserved which reduces the effective velocity to the mean value while for low dissolved oxygen concentration c a 0 001 mg l and 0 01 mg l the biodegradation is limited at a large scale with the scarcity of the dissolved oxygen which makes the effective velocity approach the mean value the effective velocity for the dissolved oxygen has a similar rationale it decreases to the mean value for increasing mean dissolved oxygen concentration and it increases for higher mean contaminant concentrations particularly when the local transverse dispersivity is relatively small fig 10a and b the effective velocities for the contaminant and the dissolved oxygen differ and vary significantly for large local transverse dispersivity fig 10c and d the variations of both effective velocities are limited and all the effective velocities approach the mean value this because local transverse dispersion can smooth the heterogeneity in biodegradation as previously illustrated fig 11 shows the sensitivity of the effective velocities to variability in the maximum specific biodegradation rate for different magnitudes of local transverse dispersivity the higher variability of maximum specific biodegradation rate produces higher effective velocities for both the contaminant and the dissolved oxygen however the effects of variability in maximum specific biodegradation rate on effective velocity are insignificant the deviation between effective velocities for 25 coefficient of variation and 75 coefficient of variation is less than 4 of the mean this finding implies that the effects of maximum specific biodegradation rate variability on effective velocity may be negligible 4 summary and conclusions two component reactive transport in a stratified aquifer with various physical and biochemical heterogeneities is analytically studied field scale transport and transformation coefficients effective retardation factor longitudinal macrodispersivity effective velocity and effective biodegradation rate are derived particular attention has been placed on the effects of local transverse dispersion which are not fully understood in such complex heterogeneities our results comprehensively revealed the effects of local transverse dispersion upon the macro scale transport and transformation coefficients under various heterogeneities the primary findings of our study are the following 1 local transverse dispersion can smooth the effects of heterogeneous biodegradation process and make field scale biodegradation rate increase to the mean value especially when reactants are sufficient for degradation this finding implies that neglecting local transverse dispersion may magnify the deviation of using the mean biodegradation rate to predict biodegradation process at the field scale 2 local transverse dispersion may enlarge the effective retardation factor and weaken the effects of variability in retardation factor and variation of mean dissolved oxygen concentration this finding reveals that neglecting local transverse dispersion may underestimate the sorption effects the effects of biodegradation rate variability on effective retardation factor are negligible regardless of the local transverse dispersion 3 the multi heterogeneity has strong effects on the longitudinal macrodispersivity for the contaminant and the dissolved oxygen the heterogeneities and the nonlinear biodegradation mechanism makes the longitudinal macrodispersivity change significantly with mean solute concentration it seems that local transverse dispersion may limit the effects of variation of mean dissolved oxygen concentration on macrodispersivities because local transverse dispersion can smooth the variability of the biodegradation process the effects of maximum specific biodegradation rate variability on macrodispersivities for the dissolved oxygen also could be attenuated for the same reason as the variation of mean dissolved oxygen concentration however local transverse dispersion is likely to magnify the effects of maximum specific biodegradation rate variability on the contaminant macrodispersivity because of the sorption effects the effects of retardation factor variability on the contaminant macrodispersivity also can be enlarged by local transverse dispersion 4 local transverse dispersion can decrease the deviation of effective velocities from the mean by smoothing the heterogeneities in the biodegradation process the effects of maximum specific biodegradation rate variability on effective velocity are generally insignificant it must be stressed that the stratified formation considered in this study is highly simplified real aquifers are heterogeneous in three dimensions the assumptions of partial linear biodegradation conductivity correlation and retardation conductivity correlation are adopted as many previous studies e g miralles wilhelm and gelhar 1996b garabedian et al 1988 cunningham and fadel 2007 atchley et al 2014 and have not been fully validated by experiments but it is noted that bauer et al 2009 have shown experimentally an enhancement of organic contaminant biodegradation in high permeability zones the assumption of steady state biomass is also unrealistic although it has been proven tolerable for the derivation of effective field scale transport coefficients miralles wilhelm and gelhar 2000 the analytical developments are based on a locally stationary and small perturbation approximation and hence the derived asymptotic results may be valid only for unrealistically large travel times and moderate heterogeneity problems however understanding the role of local transverse dispersion is essential for analyzing field scale transport of reactive contaminants although the results of this study are not directly applicable to actual field conditions they nevertheless provide important insights into the role of local transverse dispersion for macro scale transport and transformation coefficients in heterogeneous formations neglecting local transverse dispersion is a frequently used simplification in field scale models for simulating the reactive solute transport e g loschko et al 2016 2018 the results of this investigation reveal the possible consequences of the simplification for reactive transport in chemically and hydraulically heterogeneous aquifers the derived expressions can also serve as a guide tool for evaluating the influence of local transverse dispersion on field scale coefficients in the sense that it indicates whether the local transverse dispersion should be

1553,this study assessed the long term effectiveness of bioremediation as a remedial strategy for a chlorinated ethene dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl source area consisting of a higher and a lower permeability zone at alameda point california the evaluation was performed over 3 7 years after cessation of active source area bioremediation using passive flux meters pfms push pull tracer tests and soil cores pfms showed that total chlorinated ethene molar discharge emanating from the source area remained relatively unchanged pre and post bioremediation but molar discharge compositions shifted from trichloroethene tce and cis 1 2 dichloroethene cis dce to vinyl chloride vc and ethene dominated during post remedial monitoring first order rate constants derived from pfm data at the edge of the source area and describing the complete dechlorination of tce at 3 7 years following active bioremediation were approximately 1 05 yr 1 which was over three times lower than the rate 3 6 yr 1 determined using compound stable isotope analysis csia soil cores and push pull tracer test data showed that dnapl volume estimates were relatively unchanged pre and post bioremediation due to the remaining presence of dnapl in the lower permeability zone these data suggest biotransformation processes are continuing in the higher permeability zone whereas dnapl in the lower permeability zone continues to serve as a significant source of groundwater contamination the results suggest that it will take many years under current conditions to attain the united states environmental

the equilibrium streamtube model est an exponential decay type model alvarez and illman 2006 annable et al 2014 these types of models can lead to reliable estimates of how mass discharge leaving the source area responds to removal of dnapl mass and ultimately predict site closure time frames the overall objective of this study was to assess the long term effectiveness of trichloroethene tce dnapl removal using enhanced bioremediation in a highly characterized overburdened dnapl source area the specific objectives were to 1 determine the impacts of biotreatment on contaminant flux from the source area 2 assess the impacts of biotreatment on dnapl mass removal in the source area 3 estimate post remediation biotic rates of reductive dechlorination using a flux based approach and 4 identify the practical limits of treatment effectiveness e g attainment of maximum contaminant levels mcls vs a reduction in mass discharge emanating from a source area a series of techniques were used to assess the overall long term evolution of both the dnapl source area and near source plume before and approximately 2 to 3 7 years following active bioremediation 2 methods the long term treatment impacts with respect to groundwater quality dnapl mass contaminant flux and reductive dechlorination were assessed using pfms soil cores and push pull tracers before and after source area

the mean groundwater flow direction annable et al 2005 hatfield et al 2004 additionally water and contaminant mass fluxes at wells within the source area and the plume both before and after remediation were examined to determine the change in water and contaminant mass flux resulting from remediation push pull tracer tests and soil cores were collected within the source area to estimate how much dnapl remained schaefer et al 2018 wang et al 2014 ssfs were applied to characterize the long term impact of assumed biological driven dnapl dissolution dynamics and understand the relationships between dnapl source mass removal and contaminant mass discharges 2 1 field site background details of the site history and source area treatment were previously reported by wang et al

of sand schaefer et al 2018 wang et al 2014 the tce dnapl mass estimated in the higher permeability zone prior to implementing bioremediation was approximately 15 kg although another 58 to 150 kg of dnapl may be present in the lower permeability zone wang et al 2014 note the reported concentration of dissolved equivalent tce in this study includes degradation products tce cis 1 2 dichloroethene

bioremediation activities pfms were deployed in the transect immediately downgradient of the suspected dnapl source area in wells pew 01 through 04 from may 13 to may 23 2014 10 days a second round of pfms was deployed from april 28 to may 19 2015 21 days in wells pew 01 through 04 in plume monitoring wells mwp 1 and 2 and in source area wells spw 1 spw 2 spw 3 1 spw 3 2 and spw 4 pfms were deployed one final time from august 17 to september 9 2016 23 days in transect wells pew 01 through 04 plume monitoring wells mwp 1 through 2 and source area wells spw 1 and spw 3 1 four source area soil cores dpc 20 through 4 1 dpc 20 fig 2 were collected on april 27 and 28 2015 and analyzed as described by schaefer et al 2018 soil cores were obtained by woodward drilling company rio vista ca using a direct push technology drill rig both tce and cis dce were observed at each location but the dpc 20 soil core concentration was indicative of residual tce dnapl implying remaining dnapl is tce dominated the dpc 20 soil core was collected adjacent to monitoring well spw 3 2 fig 2 where a soil core was previously collected in april 2010 wang et al 2014 both soil cores contained similar chloroethene concentrations suggesting that only a portion of dnapl was removed from this location schaefer et al 2018 wang et al 2014 push pull tracer tests were conducted from december 5 to 8 2016 in wells spw 3 1 and spw 4 which are suspected of being in the source area and which were used to characterize the source area prior to enhanced dissolution wang et al 2014 for spw 3 1 and spw 4 the well diameters were 3 8 cm with no gravel pack see table 1 methanol and bromide were used as nonpartitioning tracers see table 2 and n hexanol and 2 octanol were used as partitioning tracers see table 2 a volume of 0 100 m3 and 0 144 m3 of tracer solution was injected in wells spw 3 1 and spw 4 respectively over an 8 h period with an estimated tracer penetration radius of 0 56 m and 1 1 m respectively the injectant was recovered over a period of 2 25 days with average pumping rates of 0 196 m3 day and 0 691 m3 day for spw 3 1 and spw 4 respectively tracer sampling was conducted hourly for the first 12 h followed by two hour sampling for the next 24 h then less frequently for the remainder of the testing the injection tracer concentrations were chosen based on a linear partitioning relationship between tce and water wang et al 2014 2 3 source strength functions ssfs based on pfm data this study on the effectiveness of source area bioremediation described here is based upon a previous investigation by wang et al 2014 where both est and plm were used to examine enhanced dissolution of the dnapl source area at plume 4 1 site in operable unit 2b installation restoration site 4 alameda point ca the same approach was employed here the est model described by wang et al 2014 as eq 1 was modified using the initial mass discharge md o mt 1 to replace fccs 1 m t 1 2 m d o 1 erf ln t μ ln τ σ ln τ 2 where m t is the mass discharge concentration leaving the source area ml 1 τ is the reactive travel time that combines the travel time t and the trajectory average dnapl content s

τ and σlnτ is the standard deviation of the log normal variable ln τ note travel time t and s n are assumed to be log normal variables annable et al 2005 jawitz et al 2005 wang et al 2014 wang et al 2104 classified alameda plume 4 1 site as a middle stage site which indicates that most of the dnapl mass is in the plume rather than the source area chen and jawitz 2009 thus it is reasonable to assume that the special case plm applies and the plm fitting parameter γ is 1 annable et al 2014 falta et al 2005a falta et al 2005b itrc 2011 wang et al 2014 zhu and sykes 2004 the plm presented by wang et al 2014 as eq 3 has been modified using md o to replace fccs 2 m t m d o e m d o m o t where mo is the initial mass in the source area m 2 4 dnapl volume estimations the volume of dnapl present in the source area is needed to estimate the source strength functions ssfs and to assess the amount of dnapl removed by bioremediation soil cores were collected and push pull tracer tests were conducted within the source area and each method was used to determine the extent to which the dnapl sources had been treated 2 4 1 method 1 soil core data schaefer et al 2018 presented soil core data collected near spw 3 2 on april 27 and 28 2015 to determine the amount of dnapl present 2 4 years after enhanced source area bioremediation cessation these data were compared with soil core data obtained from spw 3 2 as described in wang et al 2014 that was collected in november 2010 prior to both enhanced dissolution and enhanced source area bioremediation the total dnapl volume vn was determined using feenstra 2003 schaefer et al 2018 3 v n ρ b v soil c ρ dnapl where vn is the volume of dnapl l3 ρbulk is the assumed soil bulk density 1 67 103 kg m3 ρdnapl is dnapl density ml 3 vsoil is the volume of soil l3 c is the average concentration on the entire high resolution soil core profile at spw 3 2 mg kg wang et al 2014 the tce concentration within the minimum and maximum were assumed to be the same as the average concentration at spw 3 2 as previously done by wang et al 2014 the suspected source area volume was determined prior to enhanced aqueous dissolution and bioremediation as described by wang et al 2014 and was determined to range from 4 0 m3 to 40 m3 2 4 2 method 2 single well push pull partitioning tracer tests as shown in the results the separation between the partitioning and nonpartitioning tracers for the push pull tracer tests was minimal such limited tracer separation precludes the use of the approach described by schroth et al 2000 for estimating the dnapl mass thus an alternate approach which consisted of using the push pull nonpartitioning tracer data coupled with the contaminant dissolution data during the pull portion of the push pull tracer tests was used to estimate dnapl mass by scaling each data set providing relative concentrations this approach is described in detail by wang et al 2014 and is summarized as follows 4 c np 1 c np c o np 5 c c c peak where c np is the normalized nonpartitioning tracer concentration ml 3 cnp is the nonpartitioning tracer concentration during the push pull tracer test ml 3 co np is input tracer concentration ml 3 and c is tce concentration scaled to the maximum concentration cpeak during the push pull tracer test ml 3 wang et al 2014 scaled nonpartitioning tracer data were fit using the est model to determine the mean μlnt and standard deviation σlnt of the log normal variable ln t by assuming no dnapl μlnτ μlnt σlnτ σlnt wang et al 2014 the first moment of the t distribution m1 t was calculated using wang et al 2014 6 m 1 t e μ lnt σ lnt 2 2 the peak scaled tce dissolution data was fit using eq 1 to determine μlnτ σlnτ and fc and was then used to calculate the first moment of the τ distribution m1 τ wang et al 2014 7 m 1 τ e μ lnτ σ lnτ 2 2 the first moment of the s distribution m 1 s is described by basu et al 2008a wang et al 2014 8 m 1 s m 1 τ k w m 1 t where kw ρn cs is the ratio of the dnapl density ρn ml 3 to the aqueous solubility cs ml 3 note ρn and cs for tce was 1460 mg l and 1100 mg l respectively epa 2001 from here the volume of dnapl in the source area vn l3 can be estimated by wang et al 2014 9 v n f c v s m 1 s where vs is the swept volume within the immediate vicinity of the test well l3 note the push pull tracer test vs is smaller than vsoil 0 45 m3 versus 1 2 to 12 m3 and porosity for the site was assumed to be 0 3 since the aquifer is dominated by sandy soil 2 5 passive flux meter approach the experimental basis theoretical basis and field performance data validating the pfm have been previously described and the reader is referred to these for more detail annable et al 2005 basu et al 2006 basu et al 2009 brooks et al 2008 clark et al 2005 hatfield et al 2004 klammler et al 2007 briefly the pfm is a self contained permeable active carbon cartridge installed in wells and boreholes that provides simultaneous in situ time averaged measurements of contaminant mass flux jc and water flux q under ambient hydraulic gradients annable et al 2005 hatfield et al 2004 the activated carbon serves to intercept and retain dissolved hydrophobic organic contaminants present in groundwater flow through the well the activated carbon is also impregnated with known amounts of water soluble tracers these tracers are leached from the sorbent at rates proportional to the fluid flux direct estimation of qo from pfms is obtained from annable et al 2005 10 q 2 rθ r d 1 sin π m r 2 ξ 1 ξ 2 2 1 2 t where r is the radius of the pfm cartridge θ is the water content in the pfm rd is the retardation of the resident tracer on the sorbent mr is the relative mass of tracer remaining in the pfm sorbent at the particular well depth ξ is the dimensionless cumulative volume of water and t is the sampling duration for mr values 0 3 the equation simplifies to annable et al 2005 11 q 2 rθ r d 1 m r t jc can be calculated using annable et al 2005 12 j c q m c π r 2 l 1 m rc θ r dc where mc is the mass of contaminant sorbed m l is the length of the sorbent matrix or the vertical thickness of aquifer interval sampled l rdc is the retardation of contaminant on the sorbent and mrc is the relative mass of a resident tracer retained m after time period t where the tracer has the same retardation as rdc after a specified period of exposure to groundwater flow the pfm is removed from the well screen next the sorbent is carefully extracted to quantify the mass of all organic contaminants intercepted by the pfm and the remaining masses of all resident tracers the contaminant masses are used to calculate time averaged contaminant mass fluxes while residual resident tracer masses are used to calculate time averaged water flux depth variations of fluxes can be measured by vertically segmenting the exposed sorbent at specified depth intervals retardation factors for soluble tracer impregnated onto silver impregnated granular activated carbon si gac are presented in annable et al 2005 the pfm flux data can then be used to estimate the flux averaged contaminant concentration cf ml 3 over the well screen interval pfm sorbent section using basu et al 2006 13 c f j ddz q ddz cf is independent of groundwater fluxes meaning it is not subject to effects of flow convergence towards or divergence around the pfm cf represents a time averaged contaminant concentration estimate over the deployment period whereas traditional groundwater sampling techniques yield an instantaneous contaminant concentration that is estimated only at the time the groundwater samples were collected basu et al 2006 2009 2 6 analytical methods the deployment and retrieval of the pfms and analyses of the si gac sorbent were done following the protocols outlined in hatfield et al 2004 the samples were shipped to the university of florida and underwent extraction procedures upon arrival briefly a pre weighed amount of pfm deployed si gac sample was placed in 10 ml of chloromethane and allowed to rotate for approximately 24 h on a glass col rotator chlorinated ethenes ethene and five resident tracers methanol ethanol isopropyl alcohol tert butyl alcohol and 2 4 dimethyl 3 pentanol were analyzed using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector gc fid and autosampler perkin elmer the column was a 60 m by 0 53 mm db 624 column j w scientific germany the detection limit for the gc fid was 100 μg l for chlorinated ethenes ethene and resident tracers methanol preserved soil core samples were analyzed for chlorinated compounds including vc cis dce tce and perchloroethene pce by gas chromatography gc with mass spectrometry ms detection agilent gc 5890 ms 5971 with reported detection limits of 5 μg l for all chlorinated ethenes the reported push pull tracer ion bromide was analyzed by ion chromatography on a dionex ics 2000 ic chromatograph using a 2 mm dionex as18 column and a dionex ds6 conductivity detector using u s epa method 300 0 pfaff 1993 the reported detection limit of bromide was 0 2 mg l all chemicals obtained were reagent grade si gac used was 989 12 30 barnebey sutcliffe corp columbus oh 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater and contaminant fluxes darcy flows were obtained through pfm testing at the four extractions wells pew 01 through pew 04 shown in fig 4 results show that the groundwater flows varied over the duration of monitoring from before bioremediation to nearly 3 7 years following active bioremediation this variability was likely due to changes in hydrologic conditions including precipitation and or tidal influences it is also possible that excessive bacterial growth may have occurred which would have resulted in aquifer clogging ultimately decreasing groundwater flows all water fluxes collected during the four sampling points were averaged over the lower and higher permeability zones to yield a darcy velocity of 8 4 cm day for the transect located immediately downgradient of the source area results showing total chlorinated ethene and ethene molar discharge md measured at a transect located immediately downgradient of the source area wells pew 01 through pew 04 are shown in fig 5 these data provide a reasonable estimate of the dissolved contaminant md emanating from the source area there was a 64 molar reduction in total chloroethene tce cis dce vc md emanating from the source area to the plume when comparing pre 12 07 2011 with third round 09 07 2016 post bioremediation data after bioremediation the molar fraction of ethene decreased from 0 64 to 0 22 and then increased to 0 56 suggesting a chloroethene back diffusion like response from the lower to the higher permeability zone table 3 these data are consistent with dnapl source multi level sampling wells smls presented by schaefer et al 2018 where substantial rebound occurred at smls 4 upgradient of pew 02 fig 2 such rebound was expected since dnapl in the lower permeability zone persisted after treatment schaefer et al 2018 wang et al 2014 for the pew wells these molar fractions of ethene measured using pfms were greater than measured in groundwater e g 0 069 for pew 02 0 097 for pew 03 by schaefer et al 2018 suggesting more dechlorination occurred within the source area than was previously suspected pfm data suggest that complete dechlorination of tce cis dce and vc occurred in the higher permeability zone of the source area which is in agreement with both csia and groundwater data presented in schaefer et al 2018 it is possible more enhanced reductive dechlorination occurred due to the presence of pfms which contain water soluble tracers such as methanol and ethanol annable et al 2005 water soluble tracers from the pfms may have served as substrates for fermenters who fermented these tracers to h2 which may have promoted faster and more complete dechlorination bondehagen 2010 mccarty 1997 it is important to note that the molar flux at pew 02 was much larger than at the other three extractions wells so the data shown in fig 5 primarily reflects results at pew 02 which is downgradient of a persistent dnapl source and had the highest reported darcy velocity of the post remedial pfm data see supplemental fig s7 a total of eleven groundwater wells have been monitored in the suspected source area the source area transect and the plume using pfms to determine the practical limits of treatment effectiveness tce cis dce and vc are regulated in drinking and groundwater with maximum contaminant levels of 5 μg l 70 μg l and 2 μg l respectively epa 2009 prior to bioremediation tce concentrations in the treatment areas were up to 4 orders of magnitude above federal regulatory levels tables 4 6 present the maximum detected chlorinated ethenes pfm flux averaged groundwater concentrations both pre and post bioremediation within the source area the transect and the plume the flux averaged concentration and darcy velocity profiles are provided in the supporting information see supplemental fig s4 to s14 the data show the transect wells pew 01 pew 03 and pew 4 may have achieved mcls for tce but not pew 02 soil cores as described by schaefer et al 2018 and push pull tracer test data described later in this paper suggest that no dnapl is present upgradient of pew 03 and 04 soil core data at dpc 21 through 23 suggest little to no dnapl remains upgradient of pew 03 and 04 schaefer et al 2018 soil core data collected 2 5 years after cessation of active source area bioremediation at dpc 20 near spw 3 1 was compared to cores taken prior to enhanced aqueous dissolution and showed that dnapl volume estimates did not change much schaefer et al 2018 it is unlikely that free phase dnapl is upgradient of pew 01 since it is outside the boundary of the suspected source area the data show that mcls were not met for cis dce or vc in pew 01 and 02 but mcls may have been met for pew 03 and 04 source area wells spw 1 spw 3 1 and spw 3 2 show mcls were not achieved suggesting that under the conditions of this site 3 7 years post bioremediation may not be enough time for the complete removal of dnapl from the source area additionally these data suggest that mcls may not be reasonable metrics in the short term to appropriately assess the risk reduction for the dnapl source area treated using bioremediation however spw 2 and spw 4 may have met mcls since tce cis dce and vc were below detection which has been observed in both soil cores and geochemical data as described by schaefer et al 2018 push pull tracer data for spw 4 see supplemental fig s17 discussed later suggests dnapl is not present or present at trace levels at this location however it is unclear if bioremediation or enhanced dissolution were responsible for the removal of the free phase dnapl located within the vicinity of these wells as the source area did not likely reach equilibrium when pfms were deployed in wells pew 01 through 04 approximately six months after the end of the enhanced dissolution test schaefer et al 2018 wang et al 2014 bioremediation was conducted 16 months after enhanced dissolution suggesting that dissolution processes likely resulted in the depletion of most of the free phase dnapl located within the vicinity of the wells however bioremediation processes likely removed any residual free phase dnapl in the higher permeability zone since chlorinated ethene concentrations continued to decrease and ethene concentrations increased at transect wells during the post treatment monitoring period additionally the source area and the near field plume have not met mcls but generally show declining concentrations 3 2 source strength functions to assess the long term impact of source area bioremediation contaminant mass discharge emanating from the source area ssfs were fit to pfm mass discharge data collected at the transect composed by pew 01 to 04 wells post bioremediation an est model fit to enhanced aqueous phase dissolution data initially predicting 11 l of dnapl present in the source area prior to any treatment was extended to match ssfs pfm post bioremediation predictions to determine how mass discharge emanating from the source area would have behaved if no bioremediation had occurred at the site wang et al 2014 the predicted results for the plm special case γ 1 and est are provided in fig 6 along with the post bioremediation pfm data and enhanced bioremediation data md o was estimated by wang et al 2014 to be to be 0 45 mol day at the start of active bioremediation a best fit using solver could not be obtained for the plm and the fit shown was manually determined by trial and error by changing mo the plm model parameters are mo 100 mol with a coefficient of efficiency e of 0 97 solver was used to obtain a best fit for the est model and parameters were determined to be σlnτ 2 90 μlnτ 2 44 with a coefficient of efficiency of 0 97 both the est and plm generated by wang et al 2014 over predicted the pfm data at the end of the monitoring period 09 07 2016 by a factor of 23 and 20 respectively these over predictions suggest bioremediation on a mass flux basis was effective at reducing the mass discharge of chlorinated ethenes from the source area the plm suggests that discharge from the source area has nearly stopped whereas the est model suggests mass discharge has significantly decreased and bioremediation had an effect on reducing mass discharge from the source area pfms conducted under natural gradient fig 5 flow after the enhanced bioremediation were scaled up to match and provide a direct comparison with the enhanced dissolution mass discharge where the average darcy velocity during the enhanced dissolution in the lower permeability zone was about 11 times higher than that under natural gradient flow as previously described by wang et al 2014 3 3 dnapl estimates based on soil cores dpc 20 fig 7 was the only soil core to suggest the presence of dnapl schaefer et al 2018 schaefer et al 2018 detected high concentrations of equivalent tce within the core section length between 5 8 and 6 6 m bgs with a composition composed of 4 pce 83 tce 11 cis dce and 2 vc high concentrations of tce were also detected from 5 8 to 6 4 m as described by wang et al 2014 these soil cores were located adjacent to spw 3 2 and were used to delineate the minimum and maximum extent of dnapl in the suspected source area wang et al 2014 the tce extent was delineated and the estimated dnapl volume ranged from 2 l to 24 l similar to what was previously reported by wang et al 2014 it should be noted that the size of the source area was estimated to be between 4 and 40 m3 wang et al 2014 this analysis is qualitative at best since dnapl source areas exhibit significant small scale spatial variability in chemical concentrations as a result of the variable pathways that dnapl can migrate through heterogeneous media brewster et al 1995 3 4 dnapl source area estimates based on push pull tracer tests extraction breakthrough curves see supplemental fig s15 and s16 for push pull tracer tests at both spw 3 1 and spw 4 showed that separation between the partitioning and nonpartitioning tracers were not distinct enough to directly estimate dnapl mass and there was likely no free phase dnapl present in the higher permeability zone it is possible that the short residence time of the tracers in the aquifer may have prevented detection of low levels of residual dnapl however enhanced dissolution recovery data suggest dnapl is likely present in the lower permeability zone which is consistent with soil core data and past dnapl recovery data presented in wang et al 2014 tce cis dce was recovered relatively quickly in spw 3 1 compared to spw 4 the rapid increase in tce cis dce in spw 3 1 is likely due to the presence of a nearby dnapl source whereas the lower recovery of cis dce in spw 4 suggests that limited or minimal dnapl sources are present or that they are hydraulically inaccessible within the tracer swept zone and may actually be pulled from the plume peak tce and cis dce concentration observed in spw 3 1 was 17 9 mg l and 49 6 mg l respectively which is a combined equivalent tce of 84 8 mg l fig 8 in well spw 4 no tce was measured in the extracted water and only 0 4 mg l of cis dce was recovered see supplemental fig s17 extraction phase breakthrough curves btc for wells spw 3 1 fig 9 and spw 4 see supplemental fig s18 model fits were done to estimate dnapl present in the source area table 7 nonpartitioning tracer and equivalent tce dissolution data were used to estimate μlnτ and σlnτ by fitting the data to the est model wang et al 2014 both models fit the nonpartitioning and enhanced dissolution data well with the nash sutcliffe model coefficient e 0 89 legates and mccabe 1999 the estimation computed from the mean squared difference between simulated and observed breakthrough curves ranged from 3 to 10 is similar to previously reported error of 10 to 20 for push pull tracer tests data istok et al 2002 thus computed dnapl saturations for each tracer also have errors of 10 to 20 since dissolution data from spw 3 1 suggest dnapl is present and spw 4 data does not well spw 3 1 was used as a proxy to estimate dnapl remaining in the lower permeability zone in the source area sn was estimated to be 2 4 10 4 which is slightly lower than the sn value of 3 0 10 4 value wang et al 2014 estimated for a similar push pull tracer test conducted in 2010 wang et al 2014 estimated the entire source area volume to be 12 m3 which resulted in an estimate of 3 7 l of dnapl remaining following the same approach a dnapl volume of 2 9 l was estimated which is 22 lower than the estimate derived by wang et al 2014 however the estimated dnapl volume in the tested volume surrounding spw 3 1 is less than the 0 1 of the estimated pore volume during the push pull tracer test meaning precise quantification of dnapl volume present in the subsurface may be difficult to determine the dnapl dissolution data collected from the 2016 push pull tracer test suggest the presence of a cis dce dominated dnapl consisting of 80 cis dce and 20 tce push pull tracer test data collected prior to enhanced dissolution suggested the presence of a tce dominated dnapl consisting of 80 tce and 20 cis dce wang et al 2014 these results are not directly consistent with the soil core data collected in 2015 which suggest the presence of a tce dominated dnapl schaefer et al 2018 there are several potential reasons for the discrepancy it is possible that rapid transformation of tce to cis dce may have occurred in the dissolved phase during the tracer test however the csia data indicated that the bioremediation rate in the higher permeability zone was 3 6 yr 1 which is too low to explain this rapid transformation it could be possible that microbes introduced during enhanced source area bioremediation were able to degrade tce to cis dce at the interface of the lower and higher permeability zones and the cis dce partitioned back into the dnapl located in the lower permeability zone this could have resulted in a thin dnapl layer possibly not detectable by cores in the upper portion of the lower permeability zone primarily consisting of cis dce whereas dnapl in the lower portion of the lower permeability zone remained predominantly as tce due to inaccessibility of the microorganisms to the dnapl soil core data presented by schaefer et al 2018 support this finding since there is more cis dce than tce in the upper portion of the lower permeability zone additionally cis dce is also almost three times as soluble as tce thus during tracer test recovery extraction more cis dce could have been recovered compared to tce due to its higher solubility greater dissolution enhancement and the potential enrichment of cis dce in the upper portion of the lower permeability zone tce could have also been more readily absorbed to aquifer solids than cis dce limiting its transport in the source area which would have resulted in underestimating the amount of tce and dnapl present within the source area thus dnapl volume estimates are likely to exhibit significant uncertainty due to an often limited swept volume compared to the entire source area and determination of dnapl composition is difficult to assess using this method due to the significant variability that is inherent in such complex dnapl source systems 3 5 attenuation rate estimates csia chloroethene concentration and pfm data suggest that microbial enhanced complete reductive dechlorination had occurred within the source area up to 3 7 years following termination of active source area bioremediation soil core and push pull tracer test data suggest residual tce dnapl remains located within the lower permeability zone and is present near well spw 3 2 in the lower permeability zone schaefer et al 2018 used groundwater and csia data to calculate a first order bulk attenuation rate constant k t 1 of 3 6 yr 1 which was based on the change in concentration from upgradient to downgradient to compare a first order bulk attenuation rate k t 1 was calculated using pfm md measurements bockelmann et al 2003 14 k ln m d x m d o v x x where md x is the molar discharge mt 1 as a function of distance traveled from the source x l md o is the molar discharge at the source and vx lt 1 is the porewater velocity md was measured at transect wells pew 01 to 04 and it was assumed that all ethene md measured at these wells were generated along the flow path from well spw 3 1 to wells pew 01 to 04 as such the ratio of ethene to total chlorinated ethenes tce cis dce vc and ethene was determined to be 0 56 table 3 which was a proxy for md x md o based on our previously described assumption vx through the higher permeability zone was previously calculated to be 0 013 m day schaefer et al 2018 the x from spw 3 1 to wells pew 1 to 04 is 2 6 m given these values the k was estimated to be 1 06 yr 1 which was over three times lower than the k 3 6 yr 1 determined via csia schaefer et al 2018 the discrepancy between the rate estimates is likely caused by the aerobic transformation of vc and ethene and the heterogeneity of the aquifer system ottosen et al 2019 flux averaged concentrations of ethene at spw 3 1 were reported to be 520 μg l compared to a concentration of 24 μg l at transect well pew 02 supporting the observation made by schaefer et al 2018 that vc and ethene were undergoing aerobic transformation a ptt was not conducted post bioremediation because injection wells siw 01 to 03 showed a 75 decrease in permeability likely due to bio fouling which would limit groundwater flow pfms were deployed for 21 days and a decrease in flux due to bio clogging and aerobic oxidation of vc and ethene would have resulted in an underestimation of the attenuation rates determined using pfms additionally the first order rate constant calculated by schaefer et al 2018 was based on plume multi level sampling wells pmls which were 3 4 m further downgradient from the pew wells where pfm first order rate constant was determined the maximum flux averaged concentrations of tce cis dce and vc detected in the source area were determined to be an equivalent tce concentration of 41 300 μg l in order to meet mcl based remediation goals the time t required for the decay of these dissolved contaminants as they move downgradient of the source area was calculated using naidu et al 2012 15 t ln c mcl c start k c where cmcl is the mcl value for a specific contaminant and cstart is the concentration at the starting point using a cstart of 41 300 μg l an mcl of 5 μg l and a kc of 1 05 yr 1 calculated using pfm ethene flux data t is estimated to be 8 5 yr using a kc of 3 6 yr 1 as reported in schaefer et al 2018 t is estimated to be 2 5 yr the distance l that the chlorinated ethenes will travel as they are decaying can be estimated using naidu et al 2012 16 l v x t r using a vx of 4 75 m yr 0 013 m d an r of 1 and t values of 8 5 yr and 2 5 yr the chlorinated ethenes travel distances of 40 m and 12 m respectively before the remediation goal is reached thus both pfm and csia approaches show that groundwater contaminant concentrations should decline below the drinking water guideline values before the water discharges into the san francisco bay which is approximately 400 m away from the source these data show that restoration of dnapl contaminated groundwater to mcl is not achieved in the source area but is achievable immediately downgradient of the source although better in situ measurement of model parameters would provide more confidence in these results this semi quantitative analysis demonstrates that reductive dechlorination is occurring in the higher permeability zone of the aquifer taken together both csia and pfm data predictions suggest the site could likely transition to monitored natural attenuation mna 4 conclusions this study indicates that enhanced biotic reductive dechlorination continues to occur 3 7 years after cessation of active source area biotreatment while molar discharge at pew transect wells for total chlorinated ethenes remained relatively unchanged pre and post bioremediation molar discharge composition changed from tce and cis dce to vc and ethene dominated indicating complete reductive dechlorination had occurred within the higher permeability zone of the source area source strength function bioremediation estimates were lower than pre bioremediation estimates suggesting partial removal of free phase dnapl within the higher permeability zone at the interface of the lower and higher permeability zone may have occurred which ultimately resulted in a decrease in contaminant mass discharge emanating from the source area soil core and push pull tracer data collected post bioremediation and compared to data collected prior to the enhanced dissolution and bioremediation demonstrates that dnapl volumes remained relatively unchanged and dnapl compositions within the lower permeability zone remained comprised predominately of tce throughout the time of treatment the estimated attenuation rate of 1 05 yr 1 based on pfm data was over three times lower than the attenuation rate of 3 6 yr 1 determined using csia data suggesting that biotic dechlorination may be slower than previously thought but remains fast enough to mitigate downgradient migration of chlorinated ethenes leaving the source area regardless of the estimated rates restoration of dnapl contaminated groundwater to mcls was not achieved in either the source area or the plume suggesting more time may be needed to attain mcl based cleanup objectives under current conditions and dnapl entrapped in the lower permeability zone continues to serve as a long term source of groundwater contamination vadose zone monitoring of the source area should be included in future monitoring events in order to quantify vertical mass fluxes accounting for mass removal due to volatilization the techniques employed in this study to evaluate contamination mass fluxes mass discharges determine attenuation rates and dnapl evolution are useful parameters for assessing the long term performance of dnapl source area bioremediation such techniques can be used to develop better conceptual models which will improve long term monitoring and remediation strategies ultimately leading to reduced site closure

1553,this study assessed the long term effectiveness of bioremediation as a remedial strategy for a chlorinated ethene dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl source area consisting of a higher and a lower permeability zone at alameda point california the evaluation was performed over 3 7 years after cessation of active source area bioremediation using passive flux meters pfms push pull tracer tests and soil cores pfms showed that total chlorinated ethene molar discharge emanating from the source area remained relatively unchanged pre and post bioremediation but molar discharge compositions shifted from trichloroethene tce and cis 1 2 dichloroethene cis dce to vinyl chloride vc and ethene dominated during post remedial monitoring first order rate constants derived from pfm data at the edge of the source area and describing the complete dechlorination of tce at 3 7 years following active bioremediation were approximately 1 05 yr 1 which was over three times lower than the rate 3 6 yr 1 determined using compound stable isotope analysis csia soil cores and push pull tracer test data showed that dnapl volume estimates were relatively unchanged pre and post bioremediation due to the remaining presence of dnapl in the lower permeability zone these data suggest biotransformation processes are continuing in the higher permeability zone whereas dnapl in the lower permeability zone continues to serve as a significant source of groundwater contamination the results suggest that it will take many years under current conditions to attain the united states environmental protection agency epa maximum contaminant levels mcls cleanup objectives keywords tce bioremediation dnapl source area dissolution passive flux meter 1 introduction the bioenhanced dissolution of dense nonaqueous phase liquids dnapls in groundwater is a highly complex process due to the spatial distribution of dnapl the heterogeneous subsurface hydrogeology and the difficulty of promoting dechlorination in situ wei and finneran 2013 bioenhanced dissolution has been shown to be an effective treatment strategy for chloroethene contaminated sites containing highly permeable material ellis

borden 2017 the use of bioremediation strategies at lower permeability sites can be challenging but long term monitoring suggests sufficient removal of contaminant mass is possible chambon et al 2010 lemming et al 2010 manoli et al 2012 schaefer et al 2018 scheutz et al 2010 a longer time frame may be needed to achieve the same mass reduction in a lower permeability zone as compared to a higher permeability zone aulenta et al 2007 dugat bony et al 2012 schaefer et al 2018 extended contact time bioavailable electron donor and requisite microbial populations are needed for sufficient removal of dnapl contaminant mass from the source area which would likely result in a reduction of mass discharge emanating from the source area damgaard et al 2013 an understanding of the relationship between the dnapl source area and down gradient plume responses is critical for evaluating the performance of remedial technologies basu et al 2006 brusseau et al 2007 cai et al 2012 johnston et al 2013 mateas et al 2017 soga et al 2004 wang et al 2014 zhu and sun 2016 concentration data in groundwater withdrawn from monitoring wells are controlled partly by the transfer of mass to flowing water from other phases 1 mass sorbed to aquifer solids 2 free phase dnapl and or 3 mass trapped in lower permeability materials resulting in an inaccurate estimation of contaminant concentrations annable et al 2014 however contaminant mass discharge from a source area directly quantifies the contaminant mass released from a source per unit time and is recognized as a more pragmatic measure of risk itrc 2010 achievement of mcls both within the source area and plume in the near term are difficult and the mass discharge approach has become a key metric for assessing both risk reduction and remediation performance brusseau and guo 2014 hadley and newell 2012 johnston et al 2014 wang et al 2014 contaminant fluxes can be measured using a variety of methods including passive flux meters pfms which are self contained permeable units installed in groundwater wells klammler et al 2012 this technology has the advantage that profiles of water mass flux can be collected leading to improved site conceptual models and identification of where contaminant degradation is occurring annable et al 2005 simple analytical solutions that describe temporal dnapl dissolution processes in groundwater systems have been developed to characterize the long term effects of dissolution dynamics basu et al 2008a b christ et al 2006 2010 difilippo and brusseau 2008 falta et al 2005a b fure et al 2006 jawitz et al 2003 2005 parker and falta 2008 parker et al 2010 parker and park 2004 soga et al 2004 wang et al 2014 zhu and sykes 2004 these relationships comprise only a couple of integrated parameters and focus on relating aqueous phase concentrations to dnapl mass removal the most commonly used analytical solutions also known as source strength functions ssfs are power law model plm and the equilibrium streamtube model est an exponential decay type model alvarez and illman 2006 annable et al 2014 these types of models can lead to reliable estimates of how mass discharge leaving the source area responds to removal of dnapl mass and ultimately predict site closure time frames the overall objective of this study was to assess the long term effectiveness of trichloroethene tce dnapl removal using enhanced bioremediation in a highly characterized overburdened dnapl source area the specific objectives were to 1 determine the impacts of biotreatment on contaminant flux from the source area 2 assess the impacts of biotreatment on dnapl mass removal in the source area 3 estimate post remediation biotic rates of reductive dechlorination using a flux based approach and 4 identify the practical limits of treatment effectiveness e g attainment of maximum contaminant levels mcls vs a reduction in mass discharge emanating from a source area a series of techniques were used to assess the overall long term evolution of both the dnapl source area and near source plume before and approximately 2 to 3 7 years following active bioremediation 2 methods the long term treatment impacts with respect to groundwater quality dnapl mass contaminant flux and reductive dechlorination were assessed using pfms soil cores and push pull tracers before and after source area bioremediation treatment groundwater fluxes q lt 1 also known as darcy velocity and contaminant fluxes j ml 2 t 1 were measured using pfms which enable simultaneous characterization of the depth variations in q and j along the well screen molar discharge md estimates were then quantified by spatially integrating the contaminant fluxes measured in four wells along a transect perpendicular to the mean groundwater flow direction annable et al 2005 hatfield et al 2004 additionally water and contaminant mass fluxes at wells within the source area and the plume both before and after remediation were examined to determine the change in water and contaminant mass flux resulting from remediation push pull tracer tests and soil cores were collected within the source area to estimate how much dnapl remained schaefer et al 2018 wang et al 2014 ssfs were applied to characterize the long term impact of assumed biological driven dnapl dissolution dynamics and understand the relationships between dnapl source mass removal and contaminant mass discharges 2 1 field site background details of the site history and source area treatment were previously reported by wang et al 2014 and schaefer et al 2018 but a summary is provided here fig 1 site 4 1 is located in alameda point on the western tip of alameda island california on the eastern margin of the san francisco bay and west of oakland the delineated source area has an area fig 2 of approximately 11 8 m2 with tce dnapl located in the lower permeability zone fig 3 low flow zone as described in wang et al 2014 4 6 to 6 1 m below ground surface bgs consisting of 85 sand and 15 silt the higher permeability zone fig 3 high flow zone as described in wang et al 2014 is 6 1 m to 7 6 m bgs consisting almost entirely of sand schaefer et al 2018 wang et al 2014 the tce dnapl mass estimated in the higher permeability zone prior to implementing bioremediation was approximately 15 kg although another 58 to 150 kg of dnapl may be present in the lower permeability zone wang et al 2014 note the reported concentration of dissolved equivalent tce in this study includes degradation products tce cis 1 2 dichloroethene cis dce and vinyl chloride vc in june 2010 prior to enhanced dissolution by recirculation and carbon treatment of the extracted water pfms were installed in wells spw 1 spw 2 spw 3 1 spw 3 2 and spw 4 table 1 fig 2 which were screened in intervals over both the lower and higher permeability zones wang et al 2014 push pull tracer tests were then conducted in august 2010 in wells spw 3 1 spw 4 and mw1a1 wang et al 2014 soil cores were collected in november 2010 within and downgradient of the source area at locations siw 02 mls 1 mls 2 and pew 03 in february of 2011 pfms were installed in pew 01 through 04 which formed a transect immediately downgradient of the suspected source area an enhanced aqueous recirculation dissolution test and a partitioning tracer test ptt were conducted over a period of 37 days from april to may 2011 following enhanced aqueous dissolution pfms were deployed in pew 01 through 04 in december 2011 approximately six months after enhanced dissolution was terminated source area enhanced bioremediation was conducted from july 18 2012 to november 19 2012 which consisted of intermittent delivery of lactate and nutrients distributed via the injection and extraction wells shown in fig 2 schaefer et al 2018 bioremediation using an injection of a commercially available microbial consortium containing dehalococcoides mccartyi was performed in september 2012 schaefer et al 2018 initial monitoring showed decreases in chloroethene concentration and increases in ethene production suggesting active bioremediation had been successful 2 2 post bioremediation activities pfms were deployed in the transect immediately downgradient of the suspected dnapl source area in wells pew 01 through 04 from may 13 to may 23 2014 10 days a second round of pfms was deployed from april 28 to may 19 2015 21 days in wells pew 01 through 04 in plume monitoring wells mwp 1 and 2 and in source area wells spw 1 spw 2 spw 3 1 spw 3 2 and spw 4 pfms were deployed one final time from august 17 to september 9 2016 23 days in transect wells pew 01 through 04 plume monitoring wells mwp 1 through 2 and source area wells spw 1 and spw 3 1 four source area soil cores dpc 20 through 4 1 dpc 20 fig 2 were collected on april 27 and 28 2015 and analyzed as described by schaefer et al 2018 soil cores were obtained by woodward drilling company rio vista ca using a direct push technology drill rig both tce and cis dce were observed at each location but the dpc 20 soil core concentration was indicative of residual tce dnapl implying remaining dnapl is tce dominated the dpc 20 soil core was collected adjacent to monitoring well spw 3 2 fig 2 where a soil core was previously collected in april 2010 wang et al 2014 both soil cores contained similar chloroethene concentrations suggesting that only a portion of dnapl was removed from this location schaefer et al 2018 wang et al 2014 push pull tracer tests were conducted from december 5 to 8 2016 in wells spw 3 1 and spw 4 which are suspected of being in the source area and which were used to characterize the source area prior to enhanced dissolution wang et al 2014 for spw 3 1 and spw 4 the well diameters were 3 8 cm with no gravel pack see table 1 methanol and bromide were used as nonpartitioning tracers see table 2 and n hexanol and 2 octanol were used as partitioning tracers see table 2 a volume of 0 100 m3 and 0 144 m3 of tracer solution was injected in wells spw 3 1 and spw 4 respectively over an 8 h period with an estimated tracer penetration radius of 0 56 m and 1 1 m respectively the injectant was recovered over a period of 2 25 days with average pumping rates of 0 196 m3 day and 0 691 m3 day for spw 3 1 and spw 4 respectively tracer sampling was conducted hourly for the first 12 h followed by two hour sampling for the next 24 h then less frequently for the remainder of the testing the injection tracer concentrations were chosen based on a linear partitioning relationship between tce and water wang et al 2014 2 3 source strength functions ssfs based on pfm data this study on the effectiveness of source area bioremediation described here is based upon a previous investigation by wang et al 2014 where both est and plm were used to examine enhanced dissolution of the dnapl source area at plume 4 1 site in operable unit 2b installation restoration site 4 alameda point ca the same approach was employed here the est model described by wang et al 2014 as eq 1 was modified using the initial mass discharge md o mt 1 to replace fccs 1 m t 1 2 m d o 1 erf ln t μ ln τ σ ln τ 2 where m t is the mass discharge concentration leaving the source area ml 1 τ is the reactive travel time that combines the travel time t and the trajectory average dnapl content s s s n η θ w where s n is the trajectory averaged dnapl saturation along a streamline l3 l 3 η is the porosity l3 l 3 and θw is the water content l3 l 3 μ lnτ is the mean of the log normal variable ln τ and σlnτ is the standard deviation of the log normal variable ln τ note travel time t and s n are assumed to be log normal variables annable et al 2005 jawitz et al 2005 wang et al 2014 wang et al 2104 classified alameda plume 4 1 site as a middle stage site which indicates that most of the dnapl mass is in the plume rather than the source area chen and jawitz 2009 thus it is reasonable to assume that the special case plm applies and the plm fitting parameter γ is 1 annable et al 2014 falta et al 2005a falta et al 2005b itrc 2011 wang et al 2014 zhu and sykes 2004 the plm presented by wang et al 2014 as eq 3 has been modified using md o to replace fccs 2 m t m d o e m d o m o t where mo is the initial mass in the source area m 2 4 dnapl volume estimations the volume of dnapl present in the source area is needed to estimate the source strength functions ssfs and to assess the amount of dnapl removed by bioremediation soil cores were collected and push pull tracer tests were conducted within the source area and each method was used to determine the extent to which the dnapl sources had been treated 2 4 1 method 1 soil core data schaefer et al 2018 presented soil core data collected near spw 3 2 on april 27 and 28 2015 to determine the amount of dnapl present 2 4 years after enhanced source area bioremediation cessation these data were compared with soil core data obtained from spw 3 2 as described in wang et al 2014 that was collected in november 2010 prior to both enhanced dissolution and enhanced source area bioremediation the total dnapl volume vn was determined using feenstra 2003 schaefer et al 2018 3 v n ρ b v soil c ρ dnapl where vn is the volume of dnapl l3 ρbulk is the assumed soil bulk density 1 67 103 kg m3 ρdnapl is dnapl density ml 3 vsoil is the volume of soil l3 c is the average concentration on the entire high resolution soil core profile at spw 3 2 mg kg wang et al 2014 the tce concentration within the minimum and maximum were assumed to be the same as the average concentration at spw 3 2 as previously done by wang et al 2014 the suspected source area volume was determined prior to enhanced aqueous dissolution and bioremediation as described by wang et al 2014 and was determined to range from 4 0 m3 to 40 m3 2 4 2 method 2 single well push pull partitioning tracer tests as shown in the results the separation between the partitioning and nonpartitioning tracers for the push pull tracer tests was minimal such limited tracer separation precludes the use of the approach described by schroth et al 2000 for estimating the dnapl mass thus an alternate approach which consisted of using the push pull nonpartitioning tracer data coupled with the contaminant dissolution data during the pull portion of the push pull tracer tests was used to estimate dnapl mass by scaling each data set providing relative concentrations this approach is described in detail by wang et al 2014 and is summarized as follows 4 c np 1 c np c o np 5 c c c peak where c np is the normalized nonpartitioning tracer concentration ml 3 cnp is the nonpartitioning tracer concentration during the push pull tracer test ml 3 co np is input tracer concentration ml 3 and c is tce concentration scaled to the maximum concentration cpeak during the push pull tracer test ml 3 wang et al 2014 scaled nonpartitioning tracer data were fit using the est model to determine the mean μlnt and standard deviation σlnt of the log normal variable ln t by assuming no dnapl μlnτ μlnt σlnτ σlnt wang et al 2014 the first moment of the t distribution m1 t was calculated using wang et al 2014 6 m 1 t e μ lnt σ lnt 2 2 the peak scaled tce dissolution data was fit using eq 1 to determine μlnτ σlnτ and fc and was then used to calculate the first moment of the τ distribution m1 τ wang et al 2014 7 m 1 τ e μ lnτ σ lnτ 2 2 the first moment of the s distribution m 1 s is described by basu et al 2008a wang et al 2014 8 m 1 s m 1 τ k w m 1 t where kw ρn cs is the ratio of the dnapl density ρn ml 3 to the aqueous solubility cs ml 3 note ρn and cs for tce was 1460 mg l and 1100 mg l respectively epa 2001 from here the volume of dnapl in the source area vn l3 can be estimated by wang et al 2014 9 v n f c v s m 1 s where vs is the swept volume within the immediate vicinity of the test well l3 note the push pull tracer test vs is smaller than vsoil 0 45 m3 versus 1 2 to 12 m3 and porosity for the site was assumed to be 0 3 since the aquifer is dominated by sandy soil 2 5 passive flux meter approach the experimental basis theoretical basis and field performance data validating the pfm have been previously described and the reader is referred to these for more detail annable et al 2005 basu et al 2006 basu et al 2009 brooks et al 2008 clark et al 2005 hatfield et al 2004 klammler et al 2007 briefly the pfm is a self contained permeable active carbon cartridge installed in wells and boreholes that provides simultaneous in situ time averaged measurements of contaminant mass flux jc and water flux q under ambient hydraulic gradients annable et al 2005 hatfield et al 2004 the activated carbon serves to intercept and retain dissolved hydrophobic organic contaminants present in groundwater flow through the well the activated carbon is also impregnated with known amounts of water soluble tracers these tracers are leached from the sorbent at rates proportional to the fluid flux direct estimation of qo from pfms is obtained from annable et al 2005 10 q 2 rθ r d 1 sin π m r 2 ξ 1 ξ 2 2 1 2 t where r is the radius of the pfm cartridge θ is the water content in the pfm rd is the retardation of the resident tracer on the sorbent mr is the relative mass of tracer remaining in the pfm sorbent at the particular well depth ξ is the dimensionless cumulative volume of water and t is the sampling duration for mr values 0 3 the equation simplifies to annable et al 2005 11 q 2 rθ r d 1 m r t jc can be calculated using annable et al 2005 12 j c q m c π r 2 l 1 m rc θ r dc where mc is the mass of contaminant sorbed m l is the length of the sorbent matrix or the vertical thickness of aquifer interval sampled l rdc is the retardation of contaminant on the sorbent and mrc is the relative mass of a resident tracer retained m after time period t where the tracer has the same retardation as rdc after a specified period of exposure to groundwater flow the pfm is removed from the well screen next the sorbent is carefully extracted to quantify the mass of all organic contaminants intercepted by the pfm and the remaining masses of all resident tracers the contaminant masses are used to calculate time averaged contaminant mass fluxes while residual resident tracer masses are used to calculate time averaged water flux depth variations of fluxes can be measured by vertically segmenting the exposed sorbent at specified depth intervals retardation factors for soluble tracer impregnated onto silver impregnated granular activated carbon si gac are presented in annable et al 2005 the pfm flux data can then be used to estimate the flux averaged contaminant concentration cf ml 3 over the well screen interval pfm sorbent section using basu et al 2006 13 c f j ddz q ddz cf is independent of groundwater fluxes meaning it is not subject to effects of flow convergence towards or divergence around the pfm cf represents a time averaged contaminant concentration estimate over the deployment period whereas traditional groundwater sampling techniques yield an instantaneous contaminant concentration that is estimated only at the time the groundwater samples were collected basu et al 2006 2009 2 6 analytical methods the deployment and retrieval of the pfms and analyses of the si gac sorbent were done following the protocols outlined in hatfield et al 2004 the samples were shipped to the university of florida and underwent extraction procedures upon arrival briefly a pre weighed amount of pfm deployed si gac sample was placed in 10 ml of chloromethane and allowed to rotate for approximately 24 h on a glass col rotator chlorinated ethenes ethene and five resident tracers methanol ethanol isopropyl alcohol tert butyl alcohol and 2 4 dimethyl 3 pentanol were analyzed using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector gc fid and autosampler perkin elmer the column was a 60 m by 0 53 mm db 624 column j w scientific germany the detection limit for the gc fid was 100 μg l for chlorinated ethenes ethene and resident tracers methanol preserved soil core samples were analyzed for chlorinated compounds including vc cis dce tce and perchloroethene pce by gas chromatography gc with mass spectrometry ms detection agilent gc 5890 ms 5971 with reported detection limits of 5 μg l for all chlorinated ethenes the reported push pull tracer ion bromide was analyzed by ion chromatography on a dionex ics 2000 ic chromatograph using a 2 mm dionex as18 column and a dionex ds6 conductivity detector using u s epa method 300 0 pfaff 1993 the reported detection limit of bromide was 0 2 mg l all chemicals obtained were reagent grade si gac used was 989 12 30 barnebey sutcliffe corp columbus oh 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater and contaminant fluxes darcy flows were obtained through pfm testing at the four extractions wells pew 01 through pew 04 shown in fig 4 results show that the groundwater flows varied over the duration of monitoring from before bioremediation to nearly 3 7 years following active bioremediation this variability was likely due to changes in hydrologic conditions including precipitation and or tidal influences it is also possible that excessive bacterial growth may have occurred which would have resulted in aquifer clogging ultimately decreasing groundwater flows all water fluxes collected during the four sampling points were averaged over the lower and higher permeability zones to yield a darcy velocity of 8 4 cm day for the transect located immediately downgradient of the source area results showing total chlorinated ethene and ethene molar discharge md measured at a transect located immediately downgradient of the source area wells pew 01 through pew 04 are shown in fig 5 these data provide a reasonable estimate of the dissolved contaminant md emanating from the source area there was a 64 molar reduction in total chloroethene tce cis dce vc md emanating from the source area to the plume when comparing pre 12 07 2011 with third round 09 07 2016 post bioremediation data after bioremediation the molar fraction of ethene decreased from 0 64 to 0 22 and then increased to 0 56 suggesting a chloroethene back diffusion like response from the lower to the higher permeability zone table 3 these data are consistent with dnapl source multi level sampling wells smls presented by schaefer et al 2018 where substantial rebound occurred at smls 4 upgradient of pew 02 fig 2 such rebound was expected since dnapl in the lower permeability zone persisted after treatment schaefer et al 2018 wang et al 2014 for the pew wells these molar fractions of ethene measured using pfms were greater than measured in groundwater e g 0 069 for pew 02 0 097 for pew 03 by schaefer et al 2018 suggesting more dechlorination occurred within the source area than was previously suspected pfm data suggest that complete dechlorination of tce cis dce and vc occurred in the higher permeability zone of the source area which is in agreement with both csia and groundwater data presented in schaefer et al 2018 it is possible more enhanced reductive dechlorination occurred due to the presence of pfms which contain water soluble tracers such as methanol and ethanol annable et al 2005 water soluble tracers from the pfms may have served as substrates for fermenters who fermented these tracers to h2 which may have promoted faster and more complete dechlorination bondehagen 2010 mccarty 1997 it is important to note that the molar flux at pew 02 was much larger than at the other three extractions wells so the data shown in fig 5 primarily reflects results at pew 02 which is downgradient of a persistent dnapl source and had the highest reported darcy velocity of the post remedial pfm data see supplemental fig s7 a total of eleven groundwater wells have been monitored in the suspected source area the source area transect and the plume using pfms to determine the practical limits of treatment effectiveness tce cis dce and vc are regulated in drinking and groundwater with maximum contaminant levels of 5 μg l 70 μg l and 2 μg l respectively epa 2009 prior to bioremediation tce concentrations in the treatment areas were up to 4 orders of magnitude above federal regulatory levels tables 4 6 present the maximum detected chlorinated ethenes pfm flux averaged groundwater concentrations both pre and post bioremediation within the source area the transect and the plume the flux averaged concentration and darcy velocity profiles are provided in the supporting information see supplemental fig s4 to s14 the data show the transect wells pew 01 pew 03 and pew 4 may have achieved mcls for tce but not pew 02 soil cores as described by schaefer et al 2018 and push pull tracer test data described later in this paper suggest that no dnapl is present upgradient of pew 03 and 04 soil core data at dpc 21 through 23 suggest little to no dnapl remains upgradient of pew 03 and 04 schaefer et al 2018 soil core data collected 2 5 years after cessation of active source area bioremediation at dpc 20 near spw 3 1 was compared to cores taken prior to enhanced aqueous dissolution and showed that dnapl volume estimates did not change much schaefer et al 2018 it is unlikely that free phase dnapl is upgradient of pew 01 since it is outside the boundary of the suspected source area the data show that mcls were not met for cis dce or vc in pew 01 and 02 but mcls may have been met for pew 03 and 04 source area wells spw 1 spw 3 1 and spw 3 2 show mcls were not achieved suggesting that under the conditions of this site 3 7 years post bioremediation may not be enough time for the complete removal of dnapl from the source area additionally these data suggest that mcls may not be reasonable metrics in the short term to appropriately assess the risk reduction for the dnapl source area treated using bioremediation however spw 2 and spw 4 may have met mcls since tce cis dce and vc were below detection which has been observed in both soil cores and geochemical data as described by schaefer et al 2018 push pull tracer data for spw 4 see supplemental fig s17 discussed later suggests dnapl is not present or present at trace levels at this location however it is unclear if bioremediation or enhanced dissolution were responsible for the removal of the free phase dnapl located within the vicinity of these wells as the source area did not likely reach equilibrium when pfms were deployed in wells pew 01 through 04 approximately six months after the end of the enhanced dissolution test schaefer et al 2018 wang et al 2014 bioremediation was conducted 16 months after enhanced dissolution suggesting that dissolution processes likely resulted in the depletion of most of the free phase dnapl located within the vicinity of the wells however bioremediation processes likely removed any residual free phase dnapl in the higher permeability zone since chlorinated ethene concentrations continued to decrease and ethene concentrations increased at transect wells during the post treatment monitoring period additionally the source area and the near field plume have not met mcls but generally show declining concentrations 3 2 source strength functions to assess the long term impact of source area bioremediation contaminant mass discharge emanating from the source area ssfs were fit to pfm mass discharge data collected at the transect composed by pew 01 to 04 wells post bioremediation an est model fit to enhanced aqueous phase dissolution data initially predicting 11 l of dnapl present in the source area prior to any treatment was extended to match ssfs pfm post bioremediation predictions to determine how mass discharge emanating from the source area would have behaved if no bioremediation had occurred at the site wang et al 2014 the predicted results for the plm special case γ 1 and est are provided in fig 6 along with the post bioremediation pfm data and enhanced bioremediation data md o was estimated by wang et al 2014 to be to be 0 45 mol day at the start of active bioremediation a best fit using solver could not be obtained for the plm and the fit shown was manually determined by trial and error by changing mo the plm model parameters are mo 100 mol with a coefficient of efficiency e of 0 97 solver was used to obtain a best fit for the est model and parameters were determined to be σlnτ 2 90 μlnτ 2 44 with a coefficient of efficiency of 0 97 both the est and plm generated by wang et al 2014 over predicted the pfm data at the end of the monitoring period 09 07 2016 by a factor of 23 and 20 respectively these over predictions suggest bioremediation on a mass flux basis was effective at reducing the mass discharge of chlorinated ethenes from the source area the plm suggests that discharge from the source area has nearly stopped whereas the est model suggests mass discharge has significantly decreased and bioremediation had an effect on reducing mass discharge from the source area pfms conducted under natural gradient fig 5 flow after the enhanced bioremediation were scaled up to match and provide a direct comparison with the enhanced dissolution mass discharge where the average darcy velocity during the enhanced dissolution in the lower permeability zone was about 11 times higher than that under natural gradient flow as previously described by wang et al 2014 3 3 dnapl estimates based on soil cores dpc 20 fig 7 was the only soil core to suggest the presence of dnapl schaefer et al 2018 schaefer et al 2018 detected high concentrations of equivalent tce within the core section length between 5 8 and 6 6 m bgs with a composition composed of 4 pce 83 tce 11 cis dce and 2 vc high concentrations of tce were also detected from 5 8 to 6 4 m as described by wang et al 2014 these soil cores were located adjacent to spw 3 2 and were used to delineate the minimum and maximum extent of dnapl in the suspected source area wang et al 2014 the tce extent was delineated and the estimated dnapl volume ranged from 2 l to 24 l similar to what was previously reported by wang et al 2014 it should be noted that the size of the source area was estimated to be between 4 and 40 m3 wang et al 2014 this analysis is qualitative at best since dnapl source areas exhibit significant small scale spatial variability in chemical concentrations as a result of the variable pathways that dnapl can migrate through heterogeneous media brewster et al 1995 3 4 dnapl source area estimates based on push pull tracer tests extraction breakthrough curves see supplemental fig s15 and s16 for push pull tracer tests at both spw 3 1 and spw 4 showed that separation between the partitioning and nonpartitioning tracers were not distinct enough to directly estimate dnapl mass and there was likely no free phase dnapl present in the higher permeability zone it is possible that the short residence time of the tracers in the aquifer may have prevented detection of low levels of residual dnapl however enhanced dissolution recovery data suggest dnapl is likely present in the lower permeability zone which is consistent with soil core data and past dnapl recovery data presented in wang et al 2014 tce cis dce was recovered relatively quickly in spw 3 1 compared to spw 4 the rapid increase in tce cis dce in spw 3 1 is likely due to the presence of a nearby dnapl source whereas the lower recovery of cis dce in spw 4 suggests that limited or minimal dnapl sources are present or that they are hydraulically inaccessible within the tracer swept zone and may actually be pulled from the plume peak tce and cis dce concentration observed in spw 3 1 was 17 9 mg l and 49 6 mg l respectively which is a combined equivalent tce of 84 8 mg l fig 8 in well spw 4 no tce was measured in the extracted water and only 0 4 mg l of cis dce was recovered see supplemental fig s17 extraction phase breakthrough curves btc for wells spw 3 1 fig 9 and spw 4 see supplemental fig s18 model fits were done to estimate dnapl present in the source area table 7 nonpartitioning tracer and equivalent tce dissolution data were used to estimate μlnτ and σlnτ by fitting the data to the est model wang et al 2014 both models fit the nonpartitioning and enhanced dissolution data well with the nash sutcliffe model coefficient e 0 89 legates and mccabe 1999 the estimation computed from the mean squared difference between simulated and observed breakthrough curves ranged from 3 to 10 is similar to previously reported error of 10 to 20 for push pull tracer tests data istok et al 2002 thus computed dnapl saturations for each tracer also have errors of 10 to 20 since dissolution data from spw 3 1 suggest dnapl is present and spw 4 data does not well spw 3 1 was used as a proxy to estimate dnapl remaining in the lower permeability zone in the source area sn was estimated to be 2 4 10 4 which is slightly lower than the sn value of 3 0 10 4 value wang et al 2014 estimated for a similar push pull tracer test conducted in 2010 wang et al 2014 estimated the entire source area volume to be 12 m3 which resulted in an estimate of 3 7 l of dnapl remaining following the same approach a dnapl volume of 2 9 l was estimated which is 22 lower than the estimate derived by wang et al 2014 however the estimated dnapl volume in the tested volume surrounding spw 3 1 is less than the 0 1 of the estimated pore volume during the push pull tracer test meaning precise quantification of dnapl volume present in the subsurface may be difficult to determine the dnapl dissolution data collected from the 2016 push pull tracer test suggest the presence of a cis dce dominated dnapl consisting of 80 cis dce and 20 tce push pull tracer test data collected prior to enhanced dissolution suggested the presence of a tce dominated dnapl consisting of 80 tce and 20 cis dce wang et al 2014 these results are not directly consistent with the soil core data collected in 2015 which suggest the presence of a tce dominated dnapl schaefer et al 2018 there are several potential reasons for the discrepancy it is possible that rapid transformation of tce to cis dce may have occurred in the dissolved phase during the tracer test however the csia data indicated that the bioremediation rate in the higher permeability zone was 3 6 yr 1 which is too low to explain this rapid transformation it could be possible that microbes introduced during enhanced source area bioremediation were able to degrade tce to cis dce at the interface of the lower and higher permeability zones and the cis dce partitioned back into the dnapl located in the lower permeability zone this could have resulted in a thin dnapl layer possibly not detectable by cores in the upper portion of the lower permeability zone primarily consisting of cis dce whereas dnapl in the lower portion of the lower permeability zone remained predominantly as tce due to inaccessibility of the microorganisms to the dnapl soil core data presented by schaefer et al 2018 support this finding since there is more cis dce than tce in the upper portion of the lower permeability zone additionally cis dce is also almost three times as soluble as tce thus during tracer test recovery extraction more cis dce could have been recovered compared to tce due to its higher solubility greater dissolution enhancement and the potential enrichment of cis dce in the upper portion of the lower permeability zone tce could have also been more readily absorbed to aquifer solids than cis dce limiting its transport in the source area which would have resulted in underestimating the amount of tce and dnapl present within the source area thus dnapl volume estimates are likely to exhibit significant uncertainty due to an often limited swept volume compared to the entire source area and determination of dnapl composition is difficult to assess using this method due to the significant variability that is inherent in such complex dnapl source systems 3 5 attenuation rate estimates csia chloroethene concentration and pfm data suggest that microbial enhanced complete reductive dechlorination had occurred within the source area up to 3 7 years following termination of active source area bioremediation soil core and push pull tracer test data suggest residual tce dnapl remains located within the lower permeability zone and is present near well spw 3 2 in the lower permeability zone schaefer et al 2018 used groundwater and csia data to calculate a first order bulk attenuation rate constant k t 1 of 3 6 yr 1 which was based on the change in concentration from upgradient to downgradient to compare a first order bulk attenuation rate k t 1 was calculated using pfm md measurements bockelmann et al 2003 14 k ln m d x m d o v x x where md x is the molar discharge mt 1 as a function of distance traveled from the source x l md o is the molar discharge at the source and vx lt 1 is the porewater velocity md was measured at transect wells pew 01 to 04 and it was assumed that all ethene md measured at these wells were generated along the flow path from well spw 3 1 to wells pew 01 to 04 as such the ratio of ethene to total chlorinated ethenes tce cis dce vc and ethene was determined to be 0 56 table 3 which was a proxy for md x md o based on our previously described assumption vx through the higher permeability zone was previously calculated to be 0 013 m day schaefer et al 2018 the x from spw 3 1 to wells pew 1 to 04 is 2 6 m given these values the k was estimated to be 1 06 yr 1 which was over three times lower than the k 3 6 yr 1 determined via csia schaefer et al 2018 the discrepancy between the rate estimates is likely caused by the aerobic transformation of vc and ethene and the heterogeneity of the aquifer system ottosen et al 2019 flux averaged concentrations of ethene at spw 3 1 were reported to be 520 μg l compared to a concentration of 24 μg l at transect well pew 02 supporting the observation made by schaefer et al 2018 that vc and ethene were undergoing aerobic transformation a ptt was not conducted post bioremediation because injection wells siw 01 to 03 showed a 75 decrease in permeability likely due to bio fouling which would limit groundwater flow pfms were deployed for 21 days and a decrease in flux due to bio clogging and aerobic oxidation of vc and ethene would have resulted in an underestimation of the attenuation rates determined using pfms additionally the first order rate constant calculated by schaefer et al 2018 was based on plume multi level sampling wells pmls which were 3 4 m further downgradient from the pew wells where pfm first order rate constant was determined the maximum flux averaged concentrations of tce cis dce and vc detected in the source area were determined to be an equivalent tce concentration of 41 300 μg l in order to meet mcl based remediation goals the time t required for the decay of these dissolved contaminants as they move downgradient of the source area was calculated using naidu et al 2012 15 t ln c mcl c start k c where cmcl is the mcl value for a specific contaminant and cstart is the concentration at the starting point using a cstart of 41 300 μg l an mcl of 5 μg l and a kc of 1 05 yr 1 calculated using pfm ethene flux data t is estimated to be 8 5 yr using a kc of 3 6 yr 1 as reported in schaefer et al 2018 t is estimated to be 2 5 yr the distance l that the chlorinated ethenes will travel as they are decaying can be estimated using naidu et al 2012 16 l v x t r using a vx of 4 75 m yr 0 013 m d an r of 1 and t values of 8 5 yr and 2 5 yr the chlorinated ethenes travel distances of 40 m and 12 m respectively before the remediation goal is reached thus both pfm and csia approaches show that groundwater contaminant concentrations should decline below the drinking water guideline values before the water discharges into the san francisco bay which is approximately 400 m away from the source these data show that restoration of dnapl contaminated groundwater to mcl is not achieved in the source area but is achievable immediately downgradient of the source although better in situ measurement of model parameters would provide more confidence in these results this semi quantitative analysis demonstrates that reductive dechlorination is occurring in the higher permeability zone of the aquifer taken together both csia and pfm data predictions suggest the site could likely transition to monitored natural attenuation mna 4 conclusions this study indicates that enhanced biotic reductive dechlorination continues to occur 3 7 years after cessation of active source area biotreatment while molar discharge at pew transect wells for total chlorinated ethenes remained relatively unchanged pre and post bioremediation molar discharge composition changed from tce and cis dce to vc and ethene dominated indicating complete reductive dechlorination had occurred within the higher permeability zone of the source area source strength function bioremediation estimates were lower than pre bioremediation estimates suggesting partial removal of free phase dnapl within the higher permeability zone at the interface of the lower and higher permeability zone may have occurred which ultimately resulted in a decrease in contaminant mass discharge emanating from the source area soil core and push pull tracer data collected post bioremediation and compared to data collected prior to the enhanced dissolution and bioremediation demonstrates that dnapl volumes remained relatively unchanged and dnapl compositions within the lower permeability zone remained comprised predominately of tce throughout the time of treatment the estimated attenuation rate of 1 05 yr 1 based on pfm data was over three times lower than the attenuation rate of 3 6 yr 1 determined using csia data suggesting that biotic dechlorination may be slower than previously thought but remains fast enough to mitigate downgradient migration of chlorinated ethenes leaving the source area regardless of the estimated rates restoration of dnapl contaminated groundwater to mcls was not achieved in either the source area or the plume suggesting more time may be needed to attain mcl based cleanup objectives under current conditions and dnapl entrapped in the lower permeability zone continues to serve as a long term source of groundwater contamination vadose zone monitoring of the source area should be included in future monitoring events in order to quantify vertical mass fluxes accounting for mass removal due to volatilization the techniques employed in this study to evaluate contamination mass fluxes mass discharges determine attenuation rates and dnapl evolution are useful parameters for assessing the long term performance of dnapl source area bioremediation such techniques can be used to develop better conceptual models which will improve long term monitoring and remediation strategies ultimately leading to reduced site closure

1554,in this study silica and functionalized silica materials 3 aminopropyl and 3 mercapto derivatives were successfully used for the removal of the pesticides bentazone and imazapyc from aqueous solutions adsorbent materials were characterized by bet isotherms and ft ir spectroscopy confirming the functionalization and their equilibrium adsorption capacity was evaluated at different ionic strengths it is observed that the maximum adsorption capacities decrease in the order 3 aminopropyl derivative silica 3 mercaptopropyl derivative an increase in ionic strength produces an enhancement in the removal of pesticides all isotherms are ib type and follow the langmuir model suggesting a monolayer physical adsorption process keywords adsorption functionalized silica bentazone imazapyc computational analysis 1 introduction every year tons of pesticides synthesized for use in agriculture are discharged into the environment in an inappropriate manner generating serious environmental problems among these substances bentazone and imazapyc are used in big scale bentazone is a broad spectrum post emergency contact herbicide that belongs to the chemical group of benzothiadiazinones it is generally applied at rates of 1 0 to 2 2 kgha 1 in a variety of crops such as alfalfa rice corn peanuts potatoes beans soybeans sorghum fruit trees and others as it is a contact herbicide it affects the parts of the plant where it is applied romero et al 1996 bentazone is slightly soluble in water and very resistant to hydrolysis not being susceptible to abiotic degradation although it does undergo photodegradation both in soil and in water bruzzoniti et al 2016 due to its low binding affinity to the soil and its relatively high mobility huber and otto 1994 bentazone has been frequently detected in surface and groundwater at a concentration above the allowed limit causing a potential risk to aquatic organisms and people li et al 2003 world health organization 2014 this pesticide has been classified as a group e carcinogen evidence of non carcinogenicity to humans by the office of pesticide programs opp on the other hand imazapyc belongs to the imidazolinones chemical family this group of herbicides which includes polar and ionizable members has been reported as one of the most frequently detected in surface and ground water battaglin et al 2000 these herbicides are applied for control of a wide spectrum of grass and broad leaved weeds on non arable land pastures forests etc and on many crops such as wheat canola rapeseed and sunflower tan et al 2005 schirmer et al 2016 tozzi et al 2016 it can be used as a pre emergent or post emergent herbicide and can also be formulated as ammonium salt its high solubility in water and its relatively low acid dissociation constant increase its potential leaching imazapyc can be transported quickly through all the regions of a plant including edible portions such as seeds leaves and fruits accumulating in actively growing tissues and therefore it is not suitable for food crops the average life of imazapyc in soil oscillates between 31 and 233 days depending on soil characteristics and environmental conditions not volatilizing when applied in the field among the general procedures for taking pesticides off water adsorption on several adsorbents has been widely tested the most common adsorbents that have been studied are activated carbons and siliceous materials reichenberger et al 2007 commercial silica is a material that is generally characterized as mesoporous with a mainly amorphous structure and a large volume distribution of pores larger than 20 å the nature of the surface of silica which is generally a network with siloxane groups si o si and silanols si oh is of great importance superficial silanols are sites where physical adsorption of water or other polar molecules may occur the silanol groups on the surface of silica can be chemically modified producing a covalent bond that affects its chemical and physical properties anbia and salehi 2012 makavipour and pashley 2015 sharma and gupta 2015 producing modifications on its adsorption capacity there are two main processes for surface modification or functionalization of silica using organic groups a post synthetic where the modification is carried out by functionalizing a pre synthesized silica using the corresponding organosilane reagent and b co condensation by means of a hydrolysis process where the organic groups are added to a silica precursor in the presence of a surfactant howarter and youngblood 2006 pasternack et al 2008 crudden et al 2005 zhao and lu 1998 in this work three different types of silica materials are tried out as low cost adsorbent for the removal of pesticides bentazone and imazapyc from aqueous solutions 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorbates technical grade bentazone 3 isopropyl 1h 2 1 3 benzothiadiazin 4 3h one 2 2 dioxide cas 25057 89 0 and imazapyc 2 4

pesticides are shown in scheme 1 2 2 adsorbents 2 2 1 standard procedure of functionalization commercial silica gel grade 62 purchased from grace davison was used before the functionalization process and the adsorption experiments the amorphous silica was activated briefly 100 g of the material were placed in a 250 ml round bottom flask and they were put in contact with 200 ml of hcl solution 37 w v the mixture was kept under magnetic stirring for 24 h then the solid was filtered and thoroughly washed with deionized water until reaching neutral ph finally the silica was dried up to constant weight in a vacuum oven at 110 c and 30 torr functionalization of silica was carried out following the post synthetic method najafia et al 2012 li et al 2008 ossenkamp et al 2002 where a new material is generated from amorphous silica in a 100 ml round bottomed flask 20 0 g of activated silica 70 0 ml of dry toluene and 5 0 ml of the derivatizing reagent 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane sigma aldrich bp 217 c δ 0 946 gml 1 or 3 mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane sigma aldrich bp 214 c δ 1 057 gml 1 were heated to 110 c with magnetic stirring for 72 h fig 1 after this time the product obtained was filtered and dried at 40 c and 30 torr from now on silica materials derivatized with 3 aminopropyl and 3 mercaptopropyl radicals will be named as si nh2 and si sh respectively 2 2 2 adsorbent characterization the textural characterization of the solids was carried out by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms in an automated physisorption equipment micromeritics asap 2020 at 77 k the specific surface area and pore size values were determined by using bet equation from n2 adsorption isotherm data the total pore volume was calculated from the amount of n2 adsorbed at p p0 0 95 while the micropore volume was estimated by the dubinin radushkevich method the mesopore volume was also obtained from the n2 adsorption isotherm in the range of relative pressures p p0 from 0 40 to 0 95 assuming that the molar volume of liquid nitrogen is 35 mlmol 1 likewise the medium pore size of the materials was obtained by using the density functional theory dft and barrett joyner and halenda bjh method barrett et al 1951 galarneau et al 2014 attending to explore the surface chemistry of the materials ft ir spectra of the solids were recorded in a thermo nicolet spectrophotometer within the range of 400 4000 cm 1 using the kbr pellet technique 2 3 adsorption experiment batch adsorption studies were carried out by adding 2 0 mg of adsorbent material si oh si nh2 or si sh into 25 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 20 0 ml of different initial concentrations 5 40 mgl 1 of pesticides in aqueous solution at different ionic strengths nacl 0 010 0 50 and 1 0 moll 1 deionized water was used in all the experiments and no buffer solutions were used in order to avoid possible formation of precipitates or competition with the solute in the adsorption process the samples were shaken for 72 h finding that the adsorption equilibrium was achieved within this time under all the tested operation conditions bentazone and imazapyc concentrations were measured in a double beam uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 1203 at 252 and 265 nm respectively the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe mgg 1 was calculated according the eq 1 1 q e c o c e v w where c0 and ce mgl 1 are the liquid phase concentrations of pesticide at initial and at equilibrium time respectively v l is the solution volume and w g is the weight of the adsorbent each adsorption test was performed in duplicate the ph values of all solutions were measured always falling into a relatively neutral range 6 5 7 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbents characterization the textural properties i e specific surface area pore volumes and medium pore size of the tested adsorbents are collected in table 1 where sbet is the total surface calculated bybet method sext and smicro are the external and micropore areas respectively c is an non dimensional constant related to the n2 adsorbent interaction vpore and vmicro stand for pore and micropore volume respectively and l0 is the medium pore size it can be seen that after functionalization si nh2 has not suffered significant reduction in sext nor in smicro they are 4 and 3 lower than those of silica while si sh shows a more pronounced reduction in sext and smicro respecting to silica values 7 and 24 respectively it can also be withdrawn from table 1 that functionalization process has caused a reduction in total pore volume vpore and an increase in micropore volume vmicro in both adsorbents si nh2 and si sh an increased concentration of organic groups in the network can lead to a decreased degree of mesoscopic order and a reduction in the pore diameter pore volume and specific surface areas table 1 shows the bet surface area for silica that it is 263 7 m2 g 1 and the amine and thiol functionalized silica showed decreased surface area of 255 8 m2 g 1 and 205 3 m2 g 1 due to the filling of pores by the silane coupling agents the decrease of the specific surface and the porosity of the materials have been observed in other adsorbent materials as shown in the literature li et al n d thamilselvi and vedhaiyan radha 2017 macquarrie et al 1999 saeung and boonamnuayvitaya 2008 this confirms the presence of nh2 and sh groups inside the silica channels fig 2 shows ft ir spectrum of silica and the two functionalized solids it is observed that the spectra of amorphous silica and the derivatized silica are similar except for small peaks due to characteristic functional groups highlighted with arrows in fig 2 the ir spectrum of silica shows a series of peaks that have been already analyzed in literature as follows the peak between 480 and 500 cm 1 can be assigned to the vibration of the union sio bonds bell et al 1968 at 800 cm 1 the bending type vibration of the si oh bonds occurs in the region of 970 980 cm 1 si oh stretching occurs morrow and mcfarlan 1992 also bands around 2400 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 are observed due to distortions in the si oh stretch at 1090 cm 1 the steepest peak corresponding to the flexion of the si o si bond is observed llansolaportolés et al 2009 between 3400 and 3500 cm 1 the peaks corresponding to the vibrations of the si oh bonds can be observed all the peaks referred above appear in the ir spectra of si nh2 and si sh too since the three materials share the internal and part of the external structure with silica however small but clear additional peaks and distortions are observed in the spectra of sinh2 and sish with respect to silica ir spectrum and they have been assigned to molecular vibrations by comparing them with similar compounds pretsch et al 2009 the spectra of both adsorbents show a series of peaks in the region from 3000 to 2800 cm 1 they can be assigned to the asymmetric stretching of the ch bond due to the organic groups covalently bound to the silica three small peaks appear at 680 1490 and 1560 cm 1 in the spectra of si nh2 and they can be assigned to nh2 deformations the ir spectrum of si sh shows a peak at 700 cm 1 which would corresponds to cs tension another confirmation of a successful functionalization is the reduction in relative intensity of the bands corresponding to vibration of oh groups i e the ones at 3400 3500 2400 and 1600 cm 1 which diminish or even disappear in the ir spectra of si nh2 and si sh the decrease or disappearance of the bands at 400 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 due to distortions in the si oh stretch is notorious and a decrease in the intensity of the bands due to the si oh vibrations is clearly observed it is important to remark at this point that some bands that should be present in the spectra of the functionalized materials do not actually appear and this is understandable supposing that they are masked by stronger peaks due to the silica framework for example any ir absorption due to the vibration modes assigned to the si o c bonds is masked by the strong absorption signals of si o si at 1100 cm 1 concentration of amino groups was also determined by acid base titration batches of the samples 10 mg were treated with a 0 025 m hcl solution 20 ml for 24 h afterwards the precipitates were filtered and the filtrate was titrated with 0 025 m naoh in the presence of the methyl orange indicator the concentration of amino groups was estimated from the difference in the content of protons in the solution before and after sorption concentration of mercaptan group was estimated owned the same synthesis procedure was followed to obtain si sh material for si nh2 the total amount of amine group after functionalization with silane reagents was 2 375 mmolg 1 because the functionalization process for inserting nh2 and sh groups is identical and the reagents are structurally similar it can be predicted that the concentration of sh groups is comparable to that of nh2 3 2 adsorption experiments 3 2 1 bentazone bentazone shows the acid base equilibria in aqueous solution shown in scheme 2 caldas et al 2015 regarding the pka value of this pesticide it can be assumed that bentazone exists mainly as an anion at neutral ph figs 3 4 and 5 show adsorption isotherms of bentazone at different ionic strength values 0 010 0 50 and 1 0 on amorphous and functionalized silica at room temperature 298 k all isotherms are ib type according to iupac classification sing et al 1985 maximum adsorption capacities i e the qe value of the plateau in each isotherm clearly decrease in the order si nh2 si oh si sh at the three ionic strengths in fig 3 si nh2 maximum qe shows an increment of approximately 5 with respect to silica while for si sh it is reduced in 65 these changes in adsorption cannot be attributed to changes in specific surface but to changes in the surface of the adsorbent according to pka values of the functional groups in the three adsorbents it is expected that at neutral ph silica and si sh surfaces remain neutral while si nh2 surface has a mainly cationic nature it would be actually sinh3 bentazone which exists in anionic form at neutral ph shows electrostatic interaction with sinh2 in the case of silica the main adsorbent adsorbate interaction should be the hydrogen bond the attraction is expected to be weaker in the case of si sh on the other hand an increase in ionic strength generates an increase of the adsorption capacity of bentazone on the adsorbent materials for instance when passing from 0 010 to 0 50 ionic strength maximum adsorption capacities rise 40 for si oh 60 for si nh2 and over 300 for si sh a possible explanation to this fact is that high salt concentration generates a decrease in the solubility of organic compounds in aqueous media this effect known as salting out endo et al 2012 causes reduction in bentazone solubility and hence shifts adsorption equilibrium and makes more pesticide molecules settle on the surface of the solid in solutions bearing 5 to 20 mgl 1 of initial concentration si nh2 removes between 50 and 70 of bentazone from the liquid phase at 0 010 and 1 0 ionic strengths respectively 3 2 2 imazapyc imazapyc shows the acid base equilibria in aqueous solution shown in scheme 3 de oliveira arias et al 2014 regarding the pka values of this pesticide it can be assumed that imazapyc exists mainly as a double ion at neutral ph adsorption isotherms of imazapyc at ionic strengths of 0 010 0 50 and 1 0 on amorphous and functionalized silica at 298 k are shown in figs 6 7 and 8 all isotherms are ib type according to iupac classification the isotherms obtained by adsorption of imazapyc show the same pattern observed in the case of bentazone 1 maximum qe becomes greater in the order si sh si oh si nh2 and 2 an increase in ionic strengths causes an increase in maximum qe the explanations to these facts are analogous to those exposed in the case of bentazone in the case of imazapyc it can be observed how the adsorbed amounts are lower compared to those obtained in bentazone removal experiments this can be explained regarding that imazapyc has higher solubility in aqueous phase 2230 mgl 1 vs570 mgl 1 for bentazone at 298 k and a greater molecular volume 0 415 nm3 for imazapyc vs 0 217 nm3 for bentazone in solutions bearing 10 to 20 mgl 1 of initial concentration si nh2 removed between 40 and 50 of imazapyc from the liquid phase at 0 010 and 1 0 ionic strengths respectively 3 3 computational analysis density functional theory dft hohenberg and

and a complementary bader charge analysis bader 1990 tang et al 2009 the search for the lowest energy configurations for the imazapyc adsorbed on si oh si nh2 and si sh materials was performed from the optimization of all the geometries the decrease in the adsorption energy of the imazapyc herbicide on the materials studied is in the order si nh2 si oh si sh and this is in agreement with the experimental results in table 2 and fig 9 it can be seen the relative adsorption energies between the different materials the electronic structure supplies additional data about the adsorbate substrate interaction and electronic exchange can be considered to understand more about the adsorption process according the partial changes on atom when imazapyc adsorbs on si oh si nh2 and si sh materials are calculated dft calculations show that the electronic charges mainly happen at the interface between imazapyc rings and functional groups closest to the molecule when imazapyc is adsorbed on the materials the molecule presents the charge showed in the table 3 after adsorption it is present a rearrangement of the electronic charge in the molecule in consequence changes in partial charge occur the result shows that major changes are presented and more atoms of imazapyc are involved in the interactions when the molecule adsorbs on si nh2 it is in agreement with the most favorable adsorption energy obtained for this material 3 4 modeling the isotherms obtained for both pesticides at 0 010 ionic strength on the three materials figs 3 and 6 were parametrized according to langmuir

isotherms shown in figs 3 8 were parametrized according to langmuir model isotherm parameters are shown in table 5 4 conclusion siliceous materials were synthesized from the post synthetic method adding amino and thiol groups on the surface of the amorphous silica the synthesis could be corroborated from the ft ir analysis of the different materials comparing with the starting material adsorption equilibrium of bentazone and imazapyc pesticides on three different siliceous materials si oh si nh2 and si sh was studied the effect of increasing the ionic strength on the adsorption capacity of the synthesized materials was also analyzed concluding that an increase in the concentration of nacl generates an increase in the amount of pesticide adsorbed the adsorption experiments on amorphous silica and functionalized silica showed that its adsorption capacity is suitable for the removal of these toxic substances the highest capacities were achieved with amino functionalized material si nh2 reaching a value of 90 and 55 mgg 1 at an ionic strength of 0 010 for bentazone and imazapyc respectively rising to 280 and 138 mgg 1 at an ionic strength of 1 0 these values render an efficiency of 50 70 in the removal of bentazone and 40 50 in the removal of imazapyc from solutions containing initial pesticide concentration of 10 to 20 mgl 1 becoming si nh2 a possible material for

1554,in this study silica and functionalized silica materials 3 aminopropyl and 3 mercapto derivatives were successfully used for the removal of the pesticides bentazone and imazapyc from aqueous solutions adsorbent materials were characterized by bet isotherms and ft ir spectroscopy confirming the functionalization and their equilibrium adsorption capacity was evaluated at different ionic strengths it is observed that the maximum adsorption capacities decrease in the order 3 aminopropyl derivative silica 3 mercaptopropyl derivative an increase in ionic strength produces an enhancement in the removal of pesticides all isotherms are ib type and follow the langmuir model suggesting a monolayer physical adsorption process keywords adsorption functionalized silica bentazone imazapyc computational analysis 1 introduction every year tons of pesticides synthesized for use in agriculture are discharged into the environment in an inappropriate manner generating serious environmental problems among these substances bentazone and imazapyc are used in big scale bentazone is a broad spectrum post emergency contact herbicide that belongs to the chemical group of benzothiadiazinones it is generally applied at rates of 1 0 to 2 2 kgha 1 in a variety of crops such as alfalfa rice corn peanuts potatoes beans soybeans sorghum fruit trees and others as it is a contact herbicide it affects the parts of the plant where it is applied romero et al 1996 bentazone is slightly soluble in water and very resistant to hydrolysis not being susceptible to abiotic degradation although it does undergo photodegradation both in soil and in water bruzzoniti et al 2016 due to its low binding affinity to the soil and its relatively high mobility huber and otto 1994 bentazone has been frequently detected in surface and groundwater at a concentration above the allowed limit causing a potential risk to aquatic organisms and people li et al 2003 world health organization 2014 this pesticide has been classified as a group e carcinogen evidence of non carcinogenicity to humans by the office of pesticide programs opp on the other hand imazapyc belongs to the imidazolinones chemical family this group of herbicides which includes polar and ionizable members has been reported as one of the most frequently detected in surface and ground water battaglin et al 2000 these herbicides are applied for control of a wide spectrum of grass and broad leaved weeds on non arable land pastures forests etc and on many crops such as wheat canola rapeseed and sunflower tan et al 2005 schirmer et al 2016 tozzi et al 2016 it can be used as a pre emergent or post emergent herbicide and can also be formulated as ammonium salt its high solubility in water and its relatively low acid dissociation constant increase its potential leaching imazapyc can be transported quickly through all the regions of a plant including edible portions such as seeds leaves and fruits accumulating in actively growing tissues and therefore it is not suitable for food crops the average life of imazapyc in soil oscillates between 31 and 233 days depending on soil characteristics and environmental conditions not volatilizing when applied in the field among the general procedures for taking pesticides off water adsorption on several adsorbents has been widely tested the most common adsorbents that have been studied are activated carbons and siliceous materials reichenberger et al 2007 commercial silica is a material that is generally characterized as mesoporous with a mainly amorphous structure and a large volume distribution of pores larger than 20 å the nature of the surface of silica which is generally a network with siloxane groups si o si and silanols si oh is of great importance superficial silanols are sites where physical adsorption of water or other polar molecules may occur the silanol groups on the surface of silica can be chemically modified producing a covalent bond that affects its chemical and physical properties anbia and salehi 2012 makavipour and pashley 2015 sharma and gupta 2015 producing modifications on its adsorption capacity there are two main processes for surface modification or functionalization of silica using organic groups a post synthetic where the modification is carried out by functionalizing a pre synthesized silica using the corresponding organosilane reagent and b co condensation by means of a hydrolysis process where the organic groups are added to a silica precursor in the presence of a surfactant howarter and youngblood 2006 pasternack et al 2008 crudden et al 2005 zhao and lu 1998 in this work three different types of silica materials are tried out as low cost adsorbent for the removal of pesticides bentazone and imazapyc from aqueous solutions 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorbates technical grade bentazone 3 isopropyl 1h 2 1 3 benzothiadiazin 4 3h one 2 2 dioxide cas 25057 89 0 and imazapyc 2 4 5 dihydro 4 methyl 4 1 methylethyl 5 oxo 1h imidazol 2 yl 5 acidmethyl 3 pyridinecarboxylic acid cas 104098 48 8 of 99 9 purity each were supplied by sigma aldrich molecular structures of these pesticides are shown in scheme 1 2 2 adsorbents 2 2 1 standard procedure of functionalization commercial silica gel grade 62 purchased from grace davison was used before the functionalization process and the adsorption experiments the amorphous silica was activated briefly 100 g of the material were placed in a 250 ml round bottom flask and they were put in contact with 200 ml of hcl solution 37 w v the mixture was kept under magnetic stirring for 24 h then the solid was filtered and thoroughly washed with deionized water until reaching neutral ph finally the silica was dried up to constant weight in a vacuum oven at 110 c and 30 torr functionalization of silica was carried out following the post synthetic method najafia et al 2012 li et al 2008 ossenkamp et al 2002 where a new material is generated from amorphous silica in a 100 ml round bottomed flask 20 0 g of activated silica 70 0 ml of dry toluene and 5 0 ml of the derivatizing reagent 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane sigma aldrich bp 217 c δ 0 946 gml 1 or 3 mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane sigma aldrich bp 214 c δ 1 057 gml 1 were heated to 110 c with magnetic stirring for 72 h fig 1 after this time the product obtained was filtered and dried at 40 c and 30 torr from now on silica materials derivatized with 3 aminopropyl and 3 mercaptopropyl radicals will be named as si nh2 and si sh respectively 2 2 2 adsorbent characterization the textural characterization of the solids was carried out by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms in an automated physisorption equipment micromeritics asap 2020 at 77 k the specific surface area and pore size values were determined by using bet equation from n2 adsorption isotherm data the total pore volume was calculated from the amount of n2 adsorbed at p p0 0 95 while the micropore volume was estimated by the dubinin radushkevich method the mesopore volume was also obtained from the n2 adsorption isotherm in the range of relative pressures p p0 from 0 40 to 0 95 assuming that the molar volume of liquid nitrogen is 35 mlmol 1 likewise the medium pore size of the materials was obtained by using the density functional theory dft and barrett joyner and halenda bjh method barrett et al 1951 galarneau et al 2014 attending to explore the surface chemistry of the materials ft ir spectra of the solids were recorded in a thermo nicolet spectrophotometer within the range of 400 4000 cm 1 using the kbr pellet technique 2 3 adsorption experiment batch adsorption studies were carried out by adding 2 0 mg of adsorbent material si oh si nh2 or si sh into 25 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 20 0 ml of different initial concentrations 5 40 mgl 1 of pesticides in aqueous solution at different ionic strengths nacl 0 010 0 50 and 1 0 moll 1 deionized water was used in all the experiments and no buffer solutions were used in order to avoid possible formation of precipitates or competition with the solute in the adsorption process the samples were shaken for 72 h finding that the adsorption equilibrium was achieved within this time under all the tested operation conditions bentazone and imazapyc concentrations were measured in a double beam uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 1203 at 252 and 265 nm respectively the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe mgg 1 was calculated according the eq 1 1 q e c o c e v w where c0 and ce mgl 1 are the liquid phase concentrations of pesticide at initial and at equilibrium time respectively v l is the solution volume and w g is the weight of the adsorbent each adsorption test was performed in duplicate the ph values of all solutions were measured always falling into a relatively neutral range 6 5 7 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbents characterization the textural properties i e specific surface area pore volumes and medium pore size of the tested adsorbents are collected in table 1 where sbet is the total surface calculated bybet method sext and smicro are the external and micropore areas respectively c is an non dimensional constant related to the n2 adsorbent interaction vpore and vmicro stand for pore and micropore volume respectively and l0 is the medium pore size it can be seen that after functionalization si nh2 has not suffered significant reduction in sext nor in smicro they are 4 and 3 lower than those of silica while si sh shows a more pronounced reduction in sext and smicro respecting to silica values 7 and 24 respectively it can also be withdrawn from table 1 that functionalization process has caused a reduction in total pore volume vpore and an increase in micropore volume vmicro in both adsorbents si nh2 and si sh an increased concentration of organic groups in the network can lead to a decreased degree of mesoscopic order and a reduction in the pore diameter pore volume and specific surface areas table 1 shows the bet surface area for silica that it is 263 7 m2 g 1 and the amine and thiol functionalized silica showed decreased surface area of 255 8 m2 g 1 and 205 3 m2 g 1 due to the filling of pores by the silane coupling agents the decrease of the specific surface and the porosity of the materials have been observed in other adsorbent materials as shown in the literature li et al n d thamilselvi and vedhaiyan radha 2017 macquarrie et al 1999 saeung and boonamnuayvitaya 2008 this confirms the presence of nh2 and sh groups inside the silica channels fig 2 shows ft ir spectrum of silica and the two functionalized solids it is observed that the spectra of amorphous silica and the derivatized silica are similar except for small peaks due to characteristic functional groups highlighted with arrows in fig 2 the ir spectrum of silica shows a series of peaks that have been already analyzed in literature as follows the peak between 480 and 500 cm 1 can be assigned to the vibration of the union sio bonds bell et al 1968 at 800 cm 1 the bending type vibration of the si oh bonds occurs in the region of 970 980 cm 1 si oh stretching occurs morrow and mcfarlan 1992 also bands around 2400 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 are observed due to distortions in the si oh stretch at 1090 cm 1 the steepest peak corresponding to the flexion of the si o si bond is observed llansolaportolés et al 2009 between 3400 and 3500 cm 1 the peaks corresponding to the vibrations of the si oh bonds can be observed all the peaks referred above appear in the ir spectra of si nh2 and si sh too since the three materials share the internal and part of the external structure with silica however small but clear additional peaks and distortions are observed in the spectra of sinh2 and sish with respect to silica ir spectrum and they have been assigned to molecular vibrations by comparing them with similar compounds pretsch et al 2009 the spectra of both adsorbents show a series of peaks in the region from 3000 to 2800 cm 1 they can be assigned to the asymmetric stretching of the ch bond due to the organic groups covalently bound to the silica three small peaks appear at 680 1490 and 1560 cm 1 in the spectra of si nh2 and they can be assigned to nh2 deformations the ir spectrum of si sh shows a peak at 700 cm 1 which would corresponds to cs tension another confirmation of a successful functionalization is the reduction in relative intensity of the bands corresponding to vibration of oh groups i e the ones at 3400 3500 2400 and 1600 cm 1 which diminish or even disappear in the ir spectra of si nh2 and si sh the decrease or disappearance of the bands at 400 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 due to distortions in the si oh stretch is notorious and a decrease in the intensity of the bands due to the si oh vibrations is clearly observed it is important to remark at this point that some bands that should be present in the spectra of the functionalized materials do not actually appear and this is understandable supposing that they are masked by stronger peaks due to the silica framework for example any ir absorption due to the vibration modes assigned to the si o c bonds is masked by the strong absorption signals of si o si at 1100 cm 1 concentration of amino groups was also determined by acid base titration batches of the samples 10 mg were treated with a 0 025 m hcl solution 20 ml for 24 h afterwards the precipitates were filtered and the filtrate was titrated with 0 025 m naoh in the presence of the methyl orange indicator the concentration of amino groups was estimated from the difference in the content of protons in the solution before and after sorption concentration of mercaptan group was estimated owned the same synthesis procedure was followed to obtain si sh material for si nh2 the total amount of amine group after functionalization with silane reagents was 2 375 mmolg 1 because the functionalization process for inserting nh2 and sh groups is identical and the reagents are structurally similar it can be predicted that the concentration of sh groups is comparable to that of nh2 3 2 adsorption experiments 3 2 1 bentazone bentazone shows the acid base equilibria in aqueous solution shown in scheme 2 caldas et al 2015 regarding the pka value of this pesticide it can be assumed that bentazone exists mainly as an anion at neutral ph figs 3 4 and 5 show adsorption isotherms of bentazone at different ionic strength values 0 010 0 50 and 1 0 on amorphous and functionalized silica at room temperature 298 k all isotherms are ib type according to iupac classification sing et al 1985 maximum adsorption capacities i e the qe value of the plateau in each isotherm clearly decrease in the order si nh2 si oh si sh at the three ionic strengths in fig 3 si nh2 maximum qe shows an increment of approximately 5 with respect to silica while for si sh it is reduced in 65 these changes in adsorption cannot be attributed to changes in specific surface but to changes in the surface of the adsorbent according to pka values of the functional groups in the three adsorbents it is expected that at neutral ph silica and si sh surfaces remain neutral while si nh2 surface has a mainly cationic nature it would be actually sinh3 bentazone which exists in anionic form at neutral ph shows electrostatic interaction with sinh2 in the case of silica the main adsorbent adsorbate interaction should be the hydrogen bond the attraction is expected to be weaker in the case of si sh on the other hand an increase in ionic strength generates an increase of the adsorption capacity of bentazone on the adsorbent materials for instance when passing from 0 010 to 0 50 ionic strength maximum adsorption capacities rise 40 for si oh 60 for si nh2 and over 300 for si sh a possible explanation to this fact is that high salt concentration generates a decrease in the solubility of organic compounds in aqueous media this effect known as salting out endo et al 2012 causes reduction in bentazone solubility and hence shifts adsorption equilibrium and makes more pesticide molecules settle on the surface of the solid in solutions bearing 5 to 20 mgl 1 of initial concentration si nh2 removes between 50 and 70 of bentazone from the liquid phase at 0 010 and 1 0 ionic strengths respectively 3 2 2 imazapyc imazapyc shows the acid base equilibria in aqueous solution shown in scheme 3 de oliveira arias et al 2014 regarding the pka values of this pesticide it can be assumed that imazapyc exists mainly as a double ion at neutral ph adsorption isotherms of imazapyc at ionic strengths of 0 010 0 50 and 1 0 on amorphous and functionalized silica at 298 k are shown in figs 6 7 and 8 all isotherms are ib type according to iupac classification the isotherms obtained by adsorption of imazapyc show the same pattern observed in the case of bentazone 1 maximum qe becomes greater in the order si sh si oh si nh2 and 2 an increase in ionic strengths causes an increase in maximum qe the explanations to these facts are analogous to those exposed in the case of bentazone in the case of imazapyc it can be observed how the adsorbed amounts are lower compared to those obtained in bentazone removal experiments this can be explained regarding that imazapyc has higher solubility in aqueous phase 2230 mgl 1 vs570 mgl 1 for bentazone at 298 k and a greater molecular volume 0 415 nm3 for imazapyc vs 0 217 nm3 for bentazone in solutions bearing 10 to 20 mgl 1 of initial concentration si nh2 removed between 40 and 50 of imazapyc from the liquid phase at 0 010 and 1 0 ionic strengths respectively 3 3 computational analysis density functional theory dft hohenberg and kohn 1964 kohn and sham 1965 is a computational quantum mechanical modeling method used in physics chemistry and materials science to investigate the structural and electronic properties of many body systems in particular atoms molecules and the condensed phases dft calculations can provide a useful tool for prediction of the interactions between molecules and surfaces with satisfactory accuracy
