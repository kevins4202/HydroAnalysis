18160,eutrophication and climate warming cause macrophytes to spread rapidly in shallow lakes the accumulation of excess decayed litter in lake water can improve the particulate organic matter content and lead to ecological deterioration while decomposition of macrophyte litters in aquatic ecosystems is generally assumed to be biologically driven photodegradation has been largely overlooked in this study the potential contribution of photodegradation to the decomposition of organic matter from macrophyte litter in a shallow lake was investigated under two types of light radiation laboratory incubation light and natural solar radiation results showed that the combined photo and biodegradation treatment removed more litter mass compared to solely photodegradation or biodegradation for over 108 days more reactive oxygen species ros were produced during litter degradation in lake water under the combined photo and biodegradation treatments in comparison to other treatments removal efficiency of litter was doubled in the presence of ros compared when ros were captured additionally nmr analysis revealed that lignin guaiacyl units were preferentially lost and the litter became more refractory under the combined photo oxidation and microbial degradation after 108 days high throughput sequencing analysis further indicated that solar irradiation stimulates the growth of bacteria treponema and magnetospirillum and fungi aspergillus that have the ability to degrade aromatic compounds altogether both ros and specific microorganisms played important role in promoting litter degradation in lake water under light irradiation therefore the role of solar radiation in particulate organic matter decomposition needs to be considered for a more accurate prediction of carbon dynamics in aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image 1 keywords particulate organic matter photodegradation biodegradation reactive oxygen species lignin aquatic ecosystem 1 introduction lake eutrophication and climate warming are two of the major ecological concerns of the 21st century chen et al 2011 mccrackin et al 2017 in aquatic ecosystems especially for shallow lakes eutrophication is often caused by excessive loading of nutrient such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p it usually triggers instability in the ecosystems then the altered systems can easily be invaded by aquatic plants bajer et al 2016 moreover rising contents of greenhouse gases mainly co2 have led to an increase of 0 56 c in the earth s surface temperature during the past 150 years carrillo et al 2015 the climate warming could also cause macrophytes to spread rapidly in aquatic ecosystem since rising water temperature creates a favorable growing condition for most aquatic vascular plants gillard et al 2017 once the plants are decayed parts of the dead plant tissues could settle into lakes as litter with an increase in particular organic matter pom content decomposition of excess litter may generate a series of negative influences on the receiving water first some nutrients i e organics matter n and p in the plant litter could be released into water environment during the whole decomposition process and result in the deterioration of water quality and secondary pollution wu et al 2017 second as the refractory lignocelluloses are the major component of plants it is thus responsible for increasing the sediment layer reducing lake area damaging animal habitats and accelerating lake swamping kuehn et al 2000 li et al 2013 furthermore the accumulation and decomposition of dead litter consume oxygen and generate greenhouse such as methane and hydrogen sulfide carmichael et al 2018 when this occurs many fish species and macroinvertebrates could be suffocated meanwhile immobile bottom dwelling species can die off completely diaz and rosenberg 2008 nyenje et al 2010 therefore investigation of the decomposition process of organic matter in macrophyte litter is essential to the control of pollution resulting from litter decomposition in aquatic ecosystems litter decomposition is traditionally considered a biotic process and is influenced by many environmental variables such as litter chemical quality temperature and nutrient availability romaní et al 2006 song et al 2013 the degradation microorganisms are mainly diverse bacterial and fungal species which produce a wide range of cellulolytic ligninolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes under aerobic or anaerobic conditions cortes tolalpa et al 2016 nevertheless few recent studies indicate that organic matter decomposition in shallow lake water can also be enhanced through exposure to light liu et al 2014 2016 cuassolo et al 2016 and yet the mechanism behind is still unknown until now the influences of photodegradation on plant litter decomposition have mainly been focused on natural arid and semi arid ecosystems brandt et al 2009 gallo et al 2009 huang et al 2017 direct and indirect photolysis has long been recognized as the primary pathways that affect litter loss in these ecosystems direct photodegradation is the process by which solar irradiance directly breaks down the compounds of organic matter to ch4 co2 and other gases which leads to direct mass loss rutledge et al 2010 light radiation also has important indirect influences on microbial decomposition by altering microbial community composition and selecting functionally specific species johnson 2003 pancotto et al 2003 also indirect photolysis is able to lead to depolymerization of photosensitive organic molecule in this case a photosentizer absorbs photons to reach an excited state and then could produce reactive oxygen species ros appiani and mcneill 2015 vione et al 2014 ros are important players in the biogeochemistry of an aquatic system where they serve a critical role in carbon cycling hansel et al 2016 the major source of ros in natural waters was previously thought to be abiotic sunlight induced photooxidation of organic compounds in the surface layer rose et al 2008 particularly oh 1o2 and 3cdom are of prime importance for their contribution to organic fate in sunlit aquifers al housari et al 2010 however biologically produced extracellular ros have been observed in cultures of various marine phytoplankton taxa including diatoms raphidophytes and cyanobacteria hansel et al 2016 moreover ros have even been directly produced from culture bacteria diaz et al 2013 and fungi hansel et al 2012 recent evidence indicates that biological ros production may in some cases dominate photochemical production in some marine and freshwater systems learman et al 2011 in fact the real effects of ros production on litter degradation remain unclear the objective of this study was to determine how solar radiation i e uv and visible light exposure affects litter degradation in an aquatic ecosystem a series of controlled experiments under both artificial radiation and natural conditions were conducted to measure the degradation of litter from submerged macrophytes in this work the formation rates of oh 1o2 and 3cdom changing the microbial composition and chemical structure of macrophytes were measured during the litter degradation upon irradiation in lake water this study contributes to a more in depth understanding of the photodegradation effects and underlying mechanisms in aquatic ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and preparation taihu lake 31 10 n 120 24 e is the third largest freshwater lake in china its surface area is approximately 2338 km2 and a mean depth of 1 9 m song et al 2013 the maximum depth in eastern taihu bay 31 10 n 120 25 e was just less than 1 5 m even less than 0 8 m possibly due to swamping and sufficient light can reach the bottom of eastern taihu lake hu et al 2006 in this research water samples 100 l surface water were collected into several acid rinsed polyethylene containers in july 2016 from eastern taihu bay unlike the western of taihu lake eastern taihu bay is fully covered by submersed macrophyte communities which comprised mainly of potamogeton spp vallisneria spiralis and hydrilla verticillata the water samples were taken in the growth period of macrophytes in taihu lake and the plant residues in water were mainly the broken grass with large particles so after sampling lake water was first filtered using a 45 μm mesh to remove large detritus and zooplankton and then was filtered using a 2 μm pore size waterman gf f glass fiber membranes to remove smaller particles meanwhile the aggregated and dispersed microorganisms were retained in lake water as reported previously shade et al 2012 the microbial community in lake water was disturbed during sampling so the filtered water sample was stored in the acid rinsed borosilicate glass bottles for 3 days in the dark at 25 c which might allow the microbial community adaptation to the new environment potamogeton malaianus p malaianus is one of the dominant submerged plants in taihu lake the plants were collected randomly throughout the summer litter was then air dried at 60 c then cut into about 2 cm length for the next decomposition experiments the litter chemistry characterization included determination of the initial concentrations of carbon 31 5 nitrogen 1 23 cellulose 37 2 hemicellulose 21 7 and lignin 16 3 liu et al 2016 2 2 experimental design the experiments including two light radiation treatments laboratory incubation light radiation and natural solar radiation were designed the laboratory studies were better at identifying to what extent the radiation effect is caused by direct microbial facilitation or photooxidation 2 2 1 laboratory incubation and light radiation the laboratory incubation light radiation experiment were divided into mainly three types which contained seven treatments type i solely abiotic decomposition including the following three treatments uv radiation visible light radiation uv visible uv radiation uv and visible light radiation visible type ii combined abiotic and biotic decomposition including the following three treatments uv radiation visible light radiation microbial degradation uv visible microbe uv radiation microbial degradation uv microbe and visible light radiation microbial degradation visible microbe type iii solely biotic decomposition restricted to a microbial degradation treatment microbe dark and sterile controls were set by wrapping the microcosms with aluminum foil schemes of experimental setup were shown in fig s1a in supporting information si plant litter was decomposed in quartz glass microcosms 20 cm in height and 10 cm in diameter 500 ml lake water and 1 g litter were added in the microcosm as the plant litter could not access to light adequately once sinking to the bottom of microcosm each microcosm was stirred 30 min every 2 h using the electromagnetic stirrer ct 1at asone china the concentrations of dissolved oxygen do in each microcosm were about 9 mg l 1 with stirring and 7 mg l 1 without stirring respectively fig s2 formation rate of oh 1o2 and 3cdom were determined during litter degradation in order to determine the contribution of ros to litter degradation three additional microcosms were set up and added three kinds of radical scavengers 2 4 6 trimethyphenol tmp the catcher of 3cdom furfuryl alcohol ffa the catcher of 1o2 and benzene the catcher of oh probe detailed description is shown in si litter was sterilized by autoclaving at 121 c for 30 min the sterilized litter was used in each treatment to ensure that litter samples in all of the treatments including photodegradation biodegradation and control had the same initial properties in the abiotic radiation treatments the lake water collected from taihu lake was initially autoclaved three consecutive times at 121 c and 1 1 atm to reduce the diversity and abundance of naturally occurring biota and biocide 0 25 mm zinc chloride was added in order to inhibit microbial activities aarestrup and hasman 2004 to determine the effectiveness of autoclaving over about three months bacterial and fungal colonization were determined at the end of the experiments 1 ml lake water was extracted from different treatments and put into 9 ml sterile deionized water followed by oscillation for 30 min then the undiluted and serial diluted samples were plated on lb agar that contained either a fungicide cyclopoly pen or bactericide novobiocin at the end of the experiments neither bacteria nor fungi were observed in abiotic radiation treatments even after 108 days also flow cytometry was used to differentiate live and dead bacteria amor et al 2002 and it was found that there were only very few dead cells at the end of the abiotic experiments fig s3 three fully enclosed exposure areas consisting of aluminum coated reflective building paper and metal framing were established the areas were ensured that samples received radiation only from uv or visible light radiation sources and to prevent back reflection of radiation the artificial source of light consisted of uv lamps uva 340 light tubes with wavelength 340 nm 40 w zhongke instruments beijing china or cool white fluorescent lights which provided the visible light cool white fluorescent light tubes with wavelength 400 750 nm 40 w philips tl5 beijing china or one uv lamp and one visible light lamp microcosms were placed 5 cm under the lamps all the lamps worked from 8 00 to 20 00 h for 108 days uv and visible light radiation were measured using a uv light meter uv int160 germany and a visible light sensor apogee instruments logan utah usa respectively all the treatments were put in a 25 c greenhouse the uv and visible light intensities on samples were around 0 18 0 27 w cm 2 three microcosms from each treatment were retrieved for further analysis on days 10 32 52 78 98 and 108 throughout the experiment the position of each microcosm under uv or visible light treatments was randomized to ensure that each microcosm received the same light exposure during the period of the whole experiment the litter was dried 60 c to a constant mass and was further measured to determine the removal efficiencies of cellulose hemicellulose lignin and dry mass 10 ml samples were preserved with filter sterilized glutaraldehyde 2 v v at 4 c for later bacterial and fungal abundance analysis a 0 22 μm pore size polycarbonate filter was used to harvest 100 ml samples and then preserved at 80 c for later extraction of microbial genomic dna 2 2 2 natural solar radiation the natural solar radiation tests were conducted outdoor the treatments were the same as those in the laboratory incubation experiments and detailed descriptions were shown in si with the scheme of experimental setup in fig s1b the uv radiation treatment was performed using uv transparent acrylic fluoropolymer films solacryl suvt stamford connecticut usa which allowed 90 of uv a and uv b radiation uv filtering treatment was implemented using acrylic sheets plexiglass 2458 china which could resist below 380 nm radiation these sheets tolerated 85 of solar radiation and 400 nm to pass in order to avoid changing their optical properties the materials were changed every one month once damaged they must be immediately replaced to ensure whether the uv and visible light treatments were effective the transmission of uv and visible light were measured using the uv light meter and visible light sensor through the screens at various times of the day the samples were uncovered during the day between 08 00 a m to 18 00 p m and covered with waterproof cloth at night all samples were covered using a 3 mm thick quartz glass plate when it was raining during the 108 days of the whole outdoor experiment there were about 15 rainy days based on the time of sunrise and sunset the actual irradiation time was about 1341 h three microcosms from each treatment were retrieved for further analysis after 10 49 84 and 108 days methods and sample testing indices were the same as those described in laboratory experiment 2 3 chemical analysis formation rates of ros oh 1o2 and 3cdom were indirectly measured through irradiation experiments de laurentiis et al 2013 briefly water samples 10 ml aliquots were spiked with 1 mm tmp the probe of 3cdom 1 mm ffa the probe of 1o2 or 2 mm benzene the oh probe each sample was then irradiated from the top under the same lighting condition as before the total organic carbon content toc was determined using toc analyzer shimadzu corporation japan information regarding the carbon functional groups of macrophyte litter was obtained by solid state 13c cross polarization four pulse total suppression of sidebands cp toss using a bruker avance 600 spectrometer nmr bruker biospin germany at the 100 6 mhz frequency of 13c wang et al 2012 detailed measurement and calculation of ros and nmr are described in si litter composition including cellulose hemicellulose and lignin was measured using a sequential extraction technique ververis et al 2007 two microcosms of every treatment in the laboratory experiment were linked to a microoxygen respirometer columbus instruments oh usa and co2 accumulation was measured every 5 h for 108 days the 14 channel system was calibrated and checked for leakages before the onset of experiment 2 4 bacterial and fungal biomass and composition analysis when determining the bacterial biomass the fixed cells were stained with the stain sybr green i

165 482 fungal reads were finally obtained 2 5 calculation and statistical analysis the litter detritus decomposition rates in lake water were modeled exponentially according to first order kinetics olson 1963 1 wt w0e kt where w 0 represents the initial litter content of macrophyte w t represents the litter mass at time t k represents the first order rate constant of the reaction day 1 and t represents the time days the half life t 1 2 for litter was calculated by 2 t1 2 ln2 k the statistical significance of differences was estimated by a one way anova using spss software ibm spss statistics 19 the levels p 0 05 and p 0 01 were considered significant and highly significant respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 photo and biodegradation of plant litter in aquatic ecosystems when ros were present in lake water during litter degradation the removal efficiencies of litter mass ranged from 39 3 to 79 4 for the laboratory experiments and from 42 3 to 67 4 for the natural solar radiation under different experimental conditions after 108 days fig 1 a b in the laboratory experiments on day 10 the microbial degradation microbe showed significantly higher removal efficiencies 28 4 compared to the abiotic treatments from 23 6 to 11 8 one way anova p 0 001 nevertheless it was further found that photodegradation gradually played an important role in the removal of litter mass from day 10 to the end of the experiments the same change tendencies were found in the natural solar radiation condition fig 1b however when there was no ros in lake water during litter degradation the removal efficiencies were significantly reduced fig s4 during the laboratory experiment co2 production was also apparently enhanced under uv visible microbe treatment fig 1c the decomposition constant k values were calculated according to the data of remaining litter mass in lake water under different treatments during 108 days of experiments fig s5 the k values significantly higher compared to those when there were no ros existed during litter degradation especially for the indoor experiments table 1 the lowest half lives t 1 2 were under the uv visible microbe treatment during the laboratory incubation experiment doc concentrations reached the maximum values on day 10 in all treatments and then decreased fig s6 both in the indoor and outdoor experiments cellulose degradation efficiency was the highest and cellulose content in litter was almost completely removed 99 at the end of experiments hemicellulose and cellulose removal showed similar changing tendencies on day 10 the visible group showed much lower removal efficiency one way anova p 0 01 and there was no significant difference among the other treatments fig 2 a and b after that remove efficiencies of cellulose and hemicellulose were especially susceptible by the different kinds of light radiation and there were higher in the combined bio and photodegradation compared to the only photodegradation treatment some different changing tendencies were found during lignin removal during initial 52 days of experiments removal efficiencies of lignin was significantly higher under the treatments of light degradation compared to the corresponding abiotic and biotic decomposition one way anova p 0 05 0 017 however after 52 days removal efficiencies of lignin under the combined abiotic and biotic treatments were higher compared to the corresponding only photodegradation treatment although removing efficiencies of every component were lower in the outdoor experiments the same change tendencies were also found fig s7 this study revealed that combined photo and biodegradation can have a positive effect on litter decomposition rates in lake water especially speed up the lignin removal figs 1 and 2 these findings are consistent with the previous studies brandt et al 2009 huang et al 2017 which just focused on the arid and semi arid regions lignin is traditionally considered to be a recalcitrant compound to microbial decomposition and only some specialized biota predominantly fungi are able to synthesize extracellular enzymes to depolymerize lignin austin et al 2016 until now white rot fungi are considered to be the best degraders for lignin as they could secrete highly efficient degrading enzymes peroxidases and laccases pérez et al 2002 however lignin can absorb light radiation and undergo photomineralization as it is photoactive so the previous mechanism of photodegradation involves that photodegradation could reduce the structural bottleneck induced by lignin in secondary cell walls and enhance subsequent biotic degradation austin et al 2016 however the removal efficiencies of litter under combined photo and biodegradation were not just a sum of biodegradation and photodegradation it was highly possible that aquatic plant includes compounds which were susceptible to both photochemical and biological degradations then there existed competition between biodegradation and photodegradation for both photolabile and biolabile pools so the degradation efficiency in the combined treatment would be lower than a sum of degradation efficiencies in biodegradation treatment and in photodegradation treatment obernosterer and benner 2004 bittar et al 2015 3 2 production of ros in water during litter degradation among different kinds of ros oh 1o2 and 3cdom are well known to be involved in the degradation of various biorefractory components ruiz gonzalez et al 2013 from the laboratory and outdoor experiment it was found that formation rates of all the three kinds of ros in lake water samples had the similar changing tendencies and showed a downward trend fig 3 and fig s8 on the whole much quicker ros were produced under the treatments of uv visible microbe uv visible uv microbe and uv the possible produced mechanisms during litter degradation in lake water were that 1 the photosensitive organic e g lignin and inorganic e g no2 no3 molecules absorb photons and then produce ros appiani and mcneill 2015 scholes et al 2019 2 dom was released during the degradation of plant residues then light absorbing dom rapidly evolved into an excited triplet state triplet state of chromophores might interact with molecular oxygen to produce 1o2 via energy transfer also irradiated chromophores could generate hydrated electron e aq through electron transfer which reacts with molecular oxygen to form superoxide anions o2 then generating hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and oh wang et al 2018 3 litter may reduce o2 directly on the litter surface via reductase enzymes and dissolved organic matter dom released into lake water may reduce o2 to some of the ros during the whole experiments the microbe treatment also produced the three kinds of ros although the formation rates were lower compared to the relative light radiation treatments it was recently reported that microorganisms themselves could really produce ros diaz et al 2013 in addition laccase enzyme in basidiomycete fungi was found to produce ros huang et al 2017 therefore two production pathways photocatalytic production and microbial production promoted the generation of more ros in the combined photo and biodegradation treatment it was further found that removal efficiencies of litter mass and litter components were closed positively related to cumulative production of ros concentrations r 2 0 594 0 818 fig 4 these results further confirmed that ros play an important role in litter degradation in aquatic ecosystems among the three kinds of ros oh radical concentrations were the highest and they were correlated more strongly to the removal efficiencies of different kinds of litter organic matter this phenomenon confirms that oh radicals are the most reactive transients they have unselective character and ability to target recalcitrant contaminants lee et al 2013 among the four kinds of litter organic matter removal efficiencies of lignin were found correlated more strongly to the three kinds of ros r 2 0 658 0 818 a prerequisite for a molecule to experience photolysis is its ability to absorb sunlight as shown in the investigation of lignin the lignin losses were very noticeable under both laboratory uv radiation and natural solar radiation experiments solar radiation effects on lignin degradation mainly focuses on two aspects lambie et al 2014 1 ros attacking lignin combined with photooxidation result in the formation of small molecular weight water soluble products what can be easily used by microorganisms 2 considering that a large fraction of cellulose are protected by lignin in lignocellulose structure lignin photooxidation can help decomposers more accessible to relatively labile compounds such as cellulose 3 3 nmr spectra analysis the 13c cp toss nmr spectra of the initial and decomposed litter at the end of the laboratory experiments are shown in fig 5 and fig s9 the predominance components in the original litter were cellulose and hemicellulose as well as the presence of a small amount of proteins and lignin the spectra of the initial sample showed strong signals from o alkyl carbons fig 5a after 108 day decomposition residual litter showed a decrease of o alkyl accompanied by an increase of alkyl and aromatic carbons aromatic c c h and aromatic c o especially under the uv visible microbe and uv visible treatments the ratio of o alkyl alkyl and aromaticity can be used as indices of decomposition dynamics fig 5b the o alkyl alkyl ratio decreased according to this order visible visible microbe uv uv visible uv visible microbe but aromaticity showed the opposite trend this study further found that combined photo and biodegradation also affects the decomposition of plant litter by altering the chemical characteristics of the plant material fig 5 alkyl carbons are found to be the photo resistant compounds so they could resist photochemical degradation process after the 108 day decomposition an increasing in the alkyl c region was found in samples under photodegradation treatments it was possibly due to either the selective preservation of resistant aliphatic biomacromolecules or an increase in cross linking of the long chain alkyl compounds while the aromaticity of organic matter especially the dom after photodegradation decreased morris and hargreaves 1997 du et al 2016 xue et al 2016 this study showed that the relative content of aromatic carbon increased with degradation of plant residues actually degradation of bromus diandrus wheat and maize straw under photodegradation also corresponded with an increase in aromaticity argyropoulos and sun 1996 lin et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 it might be due to that photodegrade and photocouple occurred simultaneously in plant litter structure during irradiation argyropoulos and sun 1996 some aromatic compounds in plant residues undergone photodegradation meanwhile parts of the structure were changed to more condensed components such as the c5 related condensed phenolic units in lignin structure argyropoulos and sun 1996 it was also found that abundance of guaiacyl units decreased but lignin syringyl and p hydroxyphenyl units increased during litter degradation even under the uv irradiation lin et al 2015 indeed producing reactive transients such as ros by light exposure indirectly influences the litter chemical structure during light exposure as revealed by information recorded for carbon functional groups zhou et al 2015 3 4 biological parameters 3 4 1 changes of microbial biomass during the laboratory incubation experiments an abundance of bacteria in the water increased rapidly from about 1 5 106 ml 1 to about 2 5 106 ml 1 during initial 10 days fig s10a followed by a decline and then maintenance of a stable level until the end of the experiments the same changing tendency was found on fungi abundance and just increased during initial 10 days fig s10b it was previously reported that photochemical transformation of organic matter might have either negative effects by producing substances that inhibit microbes calza et al 2008 or positive effects by the transformation of recalcitrant dom into more easily degradable forms that promote microbe growth abboudi et al 2008 some differently this study showed that abundances of bacteria and fungus were not significantly influenced during periods of light exposure fig s10 3 4 2 bacteria diversity and community composition the good s coverages were from 86 to 93 table 2 meaning that the sequences depth can recover most of bacterial communities on day 108 the observed otus number observed species and shannon diversity index decreased under the light radiation and especially under the uv radiation table 2 at the bacterial phylum level bacteroidetes 59 8 proteobacteria 16 0 and actinobacteria 11 9 were the most abundant phyla in the initial sample fig 6 a but the bacterial communities changed markedly among different treatments after 52 days of incubation the abundance of proteobacteria showed a decline trend while the abundance of bacteroidetes increased after 108 days of incubation the dominant bacteria in the lake water were well known c degradation microbes such as proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes cleveland et al 2007 mann et al 2013 most of the proteobacteria belonged to alphaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria fig s11 bacterial communities were further analyzed based at the genus level fig 6b sphingobacteriales 16 6 flavobacterium 9 3 and bacteroide 5 3 were the main bacteria in the initial lake water on both days 52 and 108 more abundant magnetospirillum bacteroide and treponema strains were found in the light radiation in the following order of greatest to least uv visible microbe treatment uv microbe treatment visible microbe treatment these results revealed that light radiation promoted the growth of genera which utilized the more recalcitrant carbon pool such as the acidogenic bacteria treponema and magnetospirillum which have been shown to be involved in aromatic ring cleavage for lignin degradation lucey and leadbetter 2014 tian et al 2014 nmds was used to compare the bacterial communities fig 6c compared to the samples on day 52 bacterial communities on day 108 were more dispersed 3 4 3 fungal diversity and community composition during the indoor experiments lake water on days 52 and 108 were also sampled for its sequencing the good s coverages were from 84 to 91 table 2 also meaning that the sequences depth can recover most of fungal communities the observed species and shannon indices were lower in the combined light and microbial treatments especially the uv added treatments table 2 evaluation at the phylum level for fungi showed that more unidentified fungi were found in the initial lake water 97 9 fig 6d after 52 days of incubation the relative abundance of ascomycota increased among the four treatments and the most content was found in the uv visible microbe treatment after 108 days of incubation most of the fungi belonged to ascomycete phylum fig 6d the basidiomycota phylum count was also higher in the light radiation treatments 1 6 10 9 the dominant class of basidiomycota phylum was cystobasidiomycetes especially in the light radiation treatments fig s12 light radiation could also affect lignocellulosic fungi as some litter decomposing fungi were found to be sensitive to uv radiation moody et al 2001 it had been confirmed that some aquatic ascomycete had the ability to degrade large polymers one of the mechanisms was the production of ligninolytic enzymes the other was acted as a catalyst for ros production rojas jimenez et al 2017 fungi from the basidiomycot phylum were found to be more prevalent under the light radiation which was important to results of plant residue degradation especially in litter with high lignin content blackwood et al 2007 the genus level characterization further illustrates variations in the fungal community on day 108 aspergillus 24 0 75 4 and lecythophora 13 1 84 0 were the two dominant genera among the four treatments a greater abundance of aspergillus was found in the light radiation treatments while a greater abundance of lecythophora 84 0 was found in the sole microbe treatment fig 6e the aspergillus genus belongs to the ascomycota phylum which can degrade phenolic and polysaccharide components in lignin carbohydrate complexes by hydroxylating demethylating and cleaving aromatic rings guerriero et al 2015 freshwater ascomycetes was able to transform complex organic compounds such as humic substances rojas jimenez et al 2017 although bacterial and fungal diversity decreased table 2 their ability to produce ros was found to increase during the experiments the phenomenon suggested that microbes could defense against damage from ros yu 1994 compared to the samples on day 52 fungal communities were more grouped on day 108 fig 6f which was different from the results found for bacterial communities overall the positive photo priming effects on microbial decomposition are considered another important reason for enhanced mass loss under light radiation 3 5 implications the results from the laboratory and natural solar radiation experiments suggest that photodegradation was an important driver of c cycling in aquatic systems through phototransformation of the litter chemical structure to biolabile substrates and change of the microbial community structure the two organic matter mineralization pathways photochemical and microbial in water are essentially interactional and competitive the common terrestrializaiton of shallow freshwater lakes can induce substantial macrophyte litter photo processing when drawn to the surface and exposed to sunlight the combined photo and biodegradation of macrophyte litter could produce more ros although these reactive species are very short lived they play a key role in many biologically and abiotic mediated redox reactions in natural waters especially ros is able to take part in degradation of pollutants such as pesticides pharmaceuticals and trace organic contaminants lee et al 2013 ruggeri et al 2013 more interesting photodegradation promoted the production of special bacteria and fungi which could degrade the more recalcitrant substances such as lignin also solar radiation has different effects on the species composition of benthic organisms and zooplankton in aquatic ecosystems häder et al 2015 and then affects their habits such as accracting the plant litter therefore further research is also needed to determine how the solar radiation influences the combined action of aquatic microorganism and zooplankton on the degradation of aquatic plant litter this study thus helps us to understand the c biochemical pathway in natural water and is also important for the pollution prevention considering the combined role of ros and special microorganism during litter degradation 4 conclusions the results showed that combined photo and biodegradation significantly accelerated litter decomposition compared to solely photo and solely microbe treatments while photo or biodegradation alone could produce ros the combined treatments promoted more ros production during litter degradation furthermore photodegradation affected microbial communities and cultured the specific bacteria and fungi which could degrade the more recalcitrant substances as a result both ros and specific microorganisms promoted litter degradation in lake water under light irradiation these results could provide new clue to better understand quantify and model the processes of particulate organic matter decomposition in aquatic ecosystems

18160,eutrophication and climate warming cause macrophytes to spread rapidly in shallow lakes the accumulation of excess decayed litter in lake water can improve the particulate organic matter content and lead to ecological deterioration while decomposition of macrophyte litters in aquatic ecosystems is generally assumed to be biologically driven photodegradation has been largely overlooked in this study the potential contribution of photodegradation to the decomposition of organic matter from macrophyte litter in a shallow lake was investigated under two types of light radiation laboratory incubation light and natural solar radiation results showed that the combined photo and biodegradation treatment removed more litter mass compared to solely photodegradation or biodegradation for over 108 days more reactive oxygen species ros were produced during litter degradation in lake water under the combined photo and biodegradation treatments in comparison to other treatments removal efficiency of litter was doubled in the presence of ros compared when ros were captured additionally nmr analysis revealed that lignin guaiacyl units were preferentially lost and the litter became more refractory under the combined photo oxidation and microbial degradation after 108 days high throughput sequencing analysis further indicated that solar irradiation stimulates the growth of bacteria treponema and magnetospirillum and fungi aspergillus that have the ability to degrade aromatic compounds altogether both ros and specific microorganisms played important role in promoting litter degradation in lake water under light irradiation therefore the role of solar radiation in particulate organic matter decomposition needs to be considered for a more accurate prediction of carbon dynamics in aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image 1 keywords particulate organic matter photodegradation biodegradation reactive oxygen species lignin aquatic ecosystem 1 introduction lake eutrophication and climate warming are two of the major ecological concerns of the 21st century chen et al 2011 mccrackin et al 2017 in aquatic ecosystems especially for shallow lakes eutrophication is often caused by excessive loading of nutrient such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p it usually triggers instability in the ecosystems then the altered systems can easily be invaded by aquatic plants bajer et al 2016 moreover rising contents of greenhouse gases mainly co2 have led to an increase of 0 56 c in the earth s surface temperature during the past 150 years carrillo et al 2015 the climate warming could also cause macrophytes to spread rapidly in aquatic ecosystem since rising water temperature creates a favorable growing condition for most aquatic vascular plants gillard et al 2017 once the plants are decayed parts of the dead plant tissues could settle into lakes as litter with an increase in particular organic matter pom content decomposition of excess litter may generate a series of negative influences on the receiving water first some nutrients i e organics matter n and p in the plant litter could be released into water environment during the whole decomposition process and result in the deterioration of water quality and secondary pollution wu et al 2017 second as the refractory lignocelluloses are the major component of plants it is thus responsible for increasing the sediment layer reducing lake area damaging animal habitats and accelerating lake swamping kuehn et al 2000 li et al 2013 furthermore the accumulation and decomposition of dead litter consume oxygen and generate greenhouse such as methane and hydrogen sulfide carmichael et al 2018 when this occurs many fish species and macroinvertebrates could be suffocated meanwhile immobile bottom dwelling species can die off completely diaz and rosenberg 2008 nyenje et al 2010 therefore investigation of the decomposition process of organic matter in macrophyte litter is essential to the control of pollution resulting from litter decomposition in aquatic ecosystems litter decomposition is traditionally considered a biotic process and is influenced by many environmental variables such as litter chemical quality temperature and nutrient availability romaní et al 2006 song et al 2013 the degradation microorganisms are mainly diverse bacterial and fungal species which produce a wide range of cellulolytic ligninolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes under aerobic or anaerobic conditions cortes tolalpa et al 2016 nevertheless few recent studies indicate that organic matter decomposition in shallow lake water can also be enhanced through exposure to light liu et al 2014 2016 cuassolo et al 2016 and yet the mechanism behind is still unknown until now the influences of photodegradation on plant litter decomposition have mainly been focused on natural arid and semi arid ecosystems brandt et al 2009 gallo et al 2009 huang et al 2017 direct and indirect photolysis has long been recognized as the primary pathways that affect litter loss in these ecosystems direct photodegradation is the process by which solar irradiance directly breaks down the compounds of organic matter to ch4 co2 and other gases which leads to direct mass loss rutledge et al 2010 light radiation also has important indirect influences on microbial decomposition by altering microbial community composition and selecting functionally specific species johnson 2003 pancotto et al 2003 also indirect photolysis is able to lead to depolymerization of photosensitive organic molecule in this case a photosentizer absorbs photons to reach an excited state and then could produce reactive oxygen species ros appiani and mcneill 2015 vione et al 2014 ros are important players in the biogeochemistry of an aquatic system where they serve a critical role in carbon cycling hansel et al 2016 the major source of ros in natural waters was previously thought to be abiotic sunlight induced photooxidation of organic compounds in the surface layer rose et al 2008 particularly oh 1o2 and 3cdom are of prime importance for their contribution to organic fate in sunlit aquifers al housari et al 2010 however biologically produced extracellular ros have been observed in cultures of various marine phytoplankton taxa including diatoms raphidophytes and cyanobacteria hansel et al 2016 moreover ros have even been directly produced from culture bacteria diaz et al 2013 and fungi hansel et al 2012 recent evidence indicates that biological ros production may in some cases dominate photochemical production in some marine and freshwater systems learman et al 2011 in fact the real effects of ros production on litter degradation remain unclear the objective of this study was to determine how solar radiation i e uv and visible light exposure affects litter degradation in an aquatic ecosystem a series of controlled experiments under both artificial radiation and natural conditions were conducted to measure the degradation of litter from submerged macrophytes in this work the formation rates of oh 1o2 and 3cdom changing the microbial composition and chemical structure of macrophytes were measured during the litter degradation upon irradiation in lake water this study contributes to a more in depth understanding of the photodegradation effects and underlying mechanisms in aquatic ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and preparation taihu lake 31 10 n 120 24 e is the third largest freshwater lake in china its surface area is approximately 2338 km2 and a mean depth of 1 9 m song et al 2013 the maximum depth in eastern taihu bay 31 10 n 120 25 e was just less than 1 5 m even less than 0 8 m possibly due to swamping and sufficient light can reach the bottom of eastern taihu lake hu et al 2006 in this research water samples 100 l surface water were collected into several acid rinsed polyethylene containers in july 2016 from eastern taihu bay unlike the western of taihu lake eastern taihu bay is fully covered by submersed macrophyte communities which comprised mainly of potamogeton spp vallisneria spiralis and hydrilla verticillata the water samples were taken in the growth period of macrophytes in taihu lake and the plant residues in water were mainly the broken grass with large particles so after sampling lake water was first filtered using a 45 μm mesh to remove large detritus and zooplankton and then was filtered using a 2 μm pore size waterman gf f glass fiber membranes to remove smaller particles meanwhile the aggregated and dispersed microorganisms were retained in lake water as reported previously shade et al 2012 the microbial community in lake water was disturbed during sampling so the filtered water sample was stored in the acid rinsed borosilicate glass bottles for 3 days in the dark at 25 c which might allow the microbial community adaptation to the new environment potamogeton malaianus p malaianus is one of the dominant submerged plants in taihu lake the plants were collected randomly throughout the summer litter was then air dried at 60 c then cut into about 2 cm length for the next decomposition experiments the litter chemistry characterization included determination of the initial concentrations of carbon 31 5 nitrogen 1 23 cellulose 37 2 hemicellulose 21 7 and lignin 16 3 liu et al 2016 2 2 experimental design the experiments including two light radiation treatments laboratory incubation light radiation and natural solar radiation were designed the laboratory studies were better at identifying to what extent the radiation effect is caused by direct microbial facilitation or photooxidation 2 2 1 laboratory incubation and light radiation the laboratory incubation light radiation experiment were divided into mainly three types which contained seven treatments type i solely abiotic decomposition including the following three treatments uv radiation visible light radiation uv visible uv radiation uv and visible light radiation visible type ii combined abiotic and biotic decomposition including the following three treatments uv radiation visible light radiation microbial degradation uv visible microbe uv radiation microbial degradation uv microbe and visible light radiation microbial degradation visible microbe type iii solely biotic decomposition restricted to a microbial degradation treatment microbe dark and sterile controls were set by wrapping the microcosms with aluminum foil schemes of experimental setup were shown in fig s1a in supporting information si plant litter was decomposed in quartz glass microcosms 20 cm in height and 10 cm in diameter 500 ml lake water and 1 g litter were added in the microcosm as the plant litter could not access to light adequately once sinking to the bottom of microcosm each microcosm was stirred 30 min every 2 h using the electromagnetic stirrer ct 1at asone china the concentrations of dissolved oxygen do in each microcosm were about 9 mg l 1 with stirring and 7 mg l 1 without stirring respectively fig s2 formation rate of oh 1o2 and 3cdom were determined during litter degradation in order to determine the contribution of ros to litter degradation three additional microcosms were set up and added three kinds of radical scavengers 2 4 6 trimethyphenol tmp the catcher of 3cdom furfuryl alcohol ffa the catcher of 1o2 and benzene the catcher of oh probe detailed description is shown in si litter was sterilized by autoclaving at 121 c for 30 min the sterilized litter was used in each treatment to ensure that litter samples in all of the treatments including photodegradation biodegradation and control had the same initial properties in the abiotic radiation treatments the lake water collected from taihu lake was initially autoclaved three consecutive times at 121 c and 1 1 atm to reduce the diversity and abundance of naturally occurring biota and biocide 0 25 mm zinc chloride was added in order to inhibit microbial activities aarestrup and hasman 2004 to determine the effectiveness of autoclaving over about three months bacterial and fungal colonization were determined at the end of the experiments 1 ml lake water was extracted from different treatments and put into 9 ml sterile deionized water followed by oscillation for 30 min then the undiluted and serial diluted samples were plated on lb agar that contained either a fungicide cyclopoly pen or bactericide novobiocin at the end of the experiments neither bacteria nor fungi were observed in abiotic radiation treatments even after 108 days also flow cytometry was used to differentiate live and dead bacteria amor et al 2002 and it was found that there were only very few dead cells at the end of the abiotic experiments fig s3 three fully enclosed exposure areas consisting of aluminum coated reflective building paper and metal framing were established the areas were ensured that samples received radiation only from uv or visible light radiation sources and to prevent back reflection of radiation the artificial source of light consisted of uv lamps uva 340 light tubes with wavelength 340 nm 40 w zhongke instruments beijing china or cool white fluorescent lights which provided the visible light cool white fluorescent light tubes with wavelength 400 750 nm 40 w philips tl5 beijing china or one uv lamp and one visible light lamp microcosms were placed 5 cm under the lamps all the lamps worked from 8 00 to 20 00 h for 108 days uv and visible light radiation were measured using a uv light meter uv int160 germany and a visible light sensor apogee instruments logan utah usa respectively all the treatments were put in a 25 c greenhouse the uv and visible light intensities on samples were around 0 18 0 27 w cm 2 three microcosms from each treatment were retrieved for further analysis on days 10 32 52 78 98 and 108 throughout the experiment the position of each microcosm under uv or visible light treatments was randomized to ensure that each microcosm received the same light exposure during the period of the whole experiment the litter was dried 60 c to a constant mass and was further measured to determine the removal efficiencies of cellulose hemicellulose lignin and dry mass 10 ml samples were preserved with filter sterilized glutaraldehyde 2 v v at 4 c for later bacterial and fungal abundance analysis a 0 22 μm pore size polycarbonate filter was used to harvest 100 ml samples and then preserved at 80 c for later extraction of microbial genomic dna 2 2 2 natural solar radiation the natural solar radiation tests were conducted outdoor the treatments were the same as those in the laboratory incubation experiments and detailed descriptions were shown in si with the scheme of experimental setup in fig s1b the uv radiation treatment was performed using uv transparent acrylic fluoropolymer films solacryl suvt stamford connecticut usa which allowed 90 of uv a and uv b radiation uv filtering treatment was implemented using acrylic sheets plexiglass 2458 china which could resist below 380 nm radiation these sheets tolerated 85 of solar radiation and 400 nm to pass in order to avoid changing their optical properties the materials were changed every one month once damaged they must be immediately replaced to ensure whether the uv and visible light treatments were effective the transmission of uv and visible light were measured using the uv light meter and visible light sensor through the screens at various times of the day the samples were uncovered during the day between 08 00 a m to 18 00 p m and covered with waterproof cloth at night all samples were covered using a 3 mm thick quartz glass plate when it was raining during the 108 days of the whole outdoor experiment there were about 15 rainy days based on the time of sunrise and sunset the actual irradiation time was about 1341 h three microcosms from each treatment were retrieved for further analysis after 10 49 84 and 108 days methods and sample testing indices were the same as those described in laboratory experiment 2 3 chemical analysis formation rates of ros oh 1o2 and 3cdom were indirectly measured through irradiation experiments de laurentiis et al 2013 briefly water samples 10 ml aliquots were spiked with 1 mm tmp the probe of 3cdom 1 mm ffa the probe of 1o2 or 2 mm benzene the oh probe each sample was then irradiated from the top under the same lighting condition as before the total organic carbon content toc was determined using toc analyzer shimadzu corporation japan information regarding the carbon functional groups of macrophyte litter was obtained by solid state 13c cross polarization four pulse total suppression of sidebands cp toss using a bruker avance 600 spectrometer nmr bruker biospin germany at the 100 6 mhz frequency of 13c wang et al 2012 detailed measurement and calculation of ros and nmr are described in si litter composition including cellulose hemicellulose and lignin was measured using a sequential extraction technique ververis et al 2007 two microcosms of every treatment in the laboratory experiment were linked to a microoxygen respirometer columbus instruments oh usa and co2 accumulation was measured every 5 h for 108 days the 14 channel system was calibrated and checked for leakages before the onset of experiment 2 4 bacterial and fungal biomass and composition analysis when determining the bacterial biomass the fixed cells were stained with the stain sybr green i

165 482 fungal reads were finally obtained 2 5 calculation and statistical analysis the litter detritus decomposition rates in lake water were modeled exponentially according to first order kinetics olson 1963 1 wt w0e kt where w 0 represents the initial litter content of macrophyte w t represents the litter mass at time t k represents the first order rate constant of the reaction day 1 and t represents the time days the half life t 1 2 for litter was calculated by 2 t1 2 ln2 k the statistical significance of differences was estimated by a one way anova using spss software ibm spss statistics 19 the levels p 0 05 and p 0 01 were considered significant and highly significant respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 photo and biodegradation of plant litter in aquatic ecosystems when ros were present in lake water during litter degradation the removal efficiencies of litter mass ranged from 39 3 to 79 4 for the laboratory experiments and from 42 3 to 67 4 for the natural solar radiation under different experimental conditions after 108 days fig 1 a b in the laboratory experiments on day 10 the microbial degradation microbe showed significantly higher removal efficiencies 28 4 compared to the abiotic treatments from 23 6 to 11 8 one way anova p 0 001 nevertheless it was further found that photodegradation gradually played an important role in the removal of litter mass from day 10 to the end of the experiments the same change tendencies were found in the natural solar radiation condition fig 1b however when there was no ros in lake water during litter degradation the removal efficiencies were significantly reduced fig s4 during the laboratory experiment co2 production was also apparently enhanced under uv visible microbe treatment fig 1c the decomposition constant k values were calculated according to the data of remaining litter mass in lake water under different treatments during 108 days of experiments fig s5 the k values significantly higher compared to those when there were no ros existed during litter degradation especially for the indoor experiments table 1 the lowest half lives t 1 2 were under the uv visible microbe treatment during the laboratory incubation experiment doc concentrations reached the maximum values on day 10 in all treatments and then decreased fig s6 both in the indoor and outdoor experiments cellulose degradation efficiency was the highest and cellulose content in litter was almost completely removed 99 at the end of experiments hemicellulose and cellulose removal showed similar changing tendencies on day 10 the visible group showed much lower removal efficiency one way anova p 0 01 and there was no significant difference among the other treatments fig 2 a and b after that remove efficiencies of cellulose and hemicellulose were especially susceptible by the different kinds of light radiation and there were higher in the combined bio and photodegradation compared to the only photodegradation treatment some different changing tendencies were found during lignin removal during initial 52 days of experiments removal efficiencies of lignin was significantly higher under the treatments of light degradation compared to the corresponding abiotic and biotic decomposition one way anova p 0 05 0 017 however after 52 days removal efficiencies of lignin under the combined abiotic and biotic treatments were higher compared to the corresponding only photodegradation treatment although removing efficiencies of every component were lower in the outdoor experiments the same change tendencies were also found fig s7 this study revealed that combined photo and biodegradation can have a positive effect on litter decomposition rates in lake water especially speed up the lignin removal figs 1 and 2 these findings are consistent with the previous studies brandt et al 2009 huang et al 2017 which just focused on the arid and semi arid regions lignin is traditionally considered to be a recalcitrant compound to microbial decomposition and only some specialized biota predominantly fungi are able to synthesize extracellular enzymes to depolymerize lignin austin et al 2016 until now white rot fungi are considered to be the best degraders for lignin as they could secrete highly efficient degrading enzymes peroxidases and laccases pérez et al 2002 however lignin can absorb light radiation and undergo photomineralization as it is photoactive so the previous mechanism of photodegradation involves that photodegradation could reduce the structural bottleneck induced by lignin in secondary cell walls and enhance subsequent biotic degradation austin et al 2016 however the removal efficiencies of litter under combined photo and biodegradation were not just a sum of biodegradation and photodegradation it was highly possible that aquatic plant includes compounds which were susceptible to both photochemical and biological degradations then there existed competition between biodegradation and photodegradation for both photolabile and biolabile pools so the degradation efficiency in the combined treatment would be lower than a sum of degradation efficiencies in biodegradation treatment and in photodegradation treatment obernosterer and benner 2004 bittar et al 2015 3 2 production of ros in water during litter degradation among different kinds of ros oh 1o2 and 3cdom are well known to be involved in the degradation of various biorefractory components ruiz gonzalez et al 2013 from the laboratory and outdoor experiment it was found that formation rates of all the three kinds of ros in lake water samples had the similar changing tendencies and showed a downward trend fig 3 and fig s8 on the whole much quicker ros were produced under the treatments of uv visible microbe uv visible uv microbe and uv the possible produced mechanisms during litter degradation in lake water were that 1 the photosensitive organic e g lignin and inorganic e g no2 no3 molecules absorb photons and then produce ros appiani and mcneill 2015 scholes et al 2019 2 dom was released during the degradation of plant residues then light absorbing dom rapidly evolved into an excited triplet state triplet state of chromophores might interact with molecular oxygen to produce 1o2 via energy transfer also irradiated chromophores could generate hydrated electron e aq through electron transfer which reacts with molecular oxygen to form superoxide anions o2 then generating hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and oh wang et al 2018 3 litter may reduce o2 directly on the litter surface via reductase enzymes and dissolved organic matter dom released into lake water may reduce o2 to some of the ros during the whole experiments the microbe treatment also produced the three kinds of ros although the formation rates were lower compared to the relative light radiation treatments it was recently reported that microorganisms themselves could really produce ros diaz et al 2013 in addition laccase enzyme in basidiomycete fungi was found to produce ros huang et al 2017 therefore two production pathways photocatalytic production and microbial production promoted the generation of more ros in the combined photo and biodegradation treatment it was further found that removal efficiencies of litter mass and litter components were closed positively related to cumulative production of ros concentrations r 2 0 594 0 818 fig 4 these results further confirmed that ros play an important role in litter degradation in aquatic ecosystems among the three kinds of ros oh radical concentrations were the highest and they were correlated more strongly to the removal efficiencies of different kinds of litter organic matter this phenomenon confirms that oh radicals are the most reactive transients they have unselective character and ability to target recalcitrant contaminants lee et al 2013 among the four kinds of litter organic matter removal efficiencies of lignin were found correlated more strongly to the three kinds of ros r 2 0 658 0 818 a prerequisite for a molecule to experience photolysis is its ability to absorb sunlight as shown in the investigation of lignin the lignin losses were very noticeable under both laboratory uv radiation and natural solar radiation experiments solar radiation effects on lignin degradation mainly focuses on two aspects lambie et al 2014 1 ros attacking lignin combined with photooxidation result in the formation of small molecular weight water soluble products what can be easily used by microorganisms 2 considering that a large fraction of cellulose are protected by lignin in lignocellulose structure lignin photooxidation can help decomposers more accessible to relatively labile compounds such as cellulose 3 3 nmr spectra analysis the 13c cp toss nmr spectra of the initial and decomposed litter at the end of the laboratory experiments are shown in fig 5 and fig s9 the predominance components in the original litter were cellulose and hemicellulose as well as the presence of a small amount of proteins and lignin the spectra of the initial sample showed strong signals from o alkyl carbons fig 5a after 108 day decomposition residual litter showed a decrease of o alkyl accompanied by an increase of alkyl and aromatic carbons aromatic c c h and aromatic c o especially under the uv visible microbe and uv visible treatments the ratio of o alkyl alkyl and aromaticity can be used as indices of decomposition dynamics fig 5b the o alkyl alkyl ratio decreased according to this order visible visible microbe uv uv visible uv visible microbe but aromaticity showed the opposite trend this study further found that combined photo and biodegradation also affects the decomposition of plant litter by altering the chemical characteristics of the plant material fig 5 alkyl carbons are found to be the photo resistant compounds so they could resist photochemical degradation process after the 108 day decomposition an increasing in the alkyl c region was found in samples under photodegradation treatments it was possibly due to either the selective preservation of resistant aliphatic biomacromolecules or an increase in cross linking of the long chain alkyl compounds while the aromaticity of organic matter especially the dom after photodegradation decreased morris and hargreaves 1997 du et al 2016 xue et al 2016 this study showed that the relative content of aromatic carbon increased with degradation of plant residues actually degradation of bromus diandrus wheat and maize straw under photodegradation also corresponded with an increase in aromaticity argyropoulos and sun 1996 lin et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 it might be due to that photodegrade and photocouple occurred simultaneously in plant litter structure during irradiation argyropoulos and sun 1996 some aromatic compounds in plant residues undergone photodegradation meanwhile parts of the structure were changed to more condensed components such as the c5 related condensed phenolic units in lignin structure argyropoulos and sun 1996 it was also found that abundance of guaiacyl units decreased but lignin syringyl and p hydroxyphenyl units increased during litter degradation even under the uv irradiation lin et al 2015 indeed producing reactive transients such as ros by light exposure indirectly influences the litter chemical structure during light exposure as revealed by information recorded for carbon functional groups zhou et al 2015 3 4 biological parameters 3 4 1 changes of microbial biomass during the laboratory incubation experiments an abundance of bacteria in the water increased rapidly from about 1 5 106 ml 1 to about 2 5 106 ml 1 during initial 10 days fig s10a followed by a decline and then maintenance of a stable level until the end of the experiments the same changing tendency was found on fungi abundance and just increased during initial 10 days fig s10b it was previously reported that photochemical transformation of organic matter might have either negative effects by producing substances that inhibit microbes calza et al 2008 or positive effects by the transformation of recalcitrant dom into more easily degradable forms that promote microbe growth abboudi et al 2008 some differently this study showed that abundances of bacteria and fungus were not significantly influenced during periods of light exposure fig s10 3 4 2 bacteria diversity and community composition the good s coverages were from 86 to 93 table 2 meaning that the sequences depth can recover most of bacterial communities on day 108 the observed otus number observed species and shannon diversity index decreased under the light radiation and especially under the uv radiation table 2 at the bacterial phylum level bacteroidetes 59 8 proteobacteria 16 0 and actinobacteria 11 9 were the most abundant phyla in the initial sample fig 6 a but the bacterial communities changed markedly among different treatments after 52 days of incubation the abundance of proteobacteria showed a decline trend while the abundance of bacteroidetes increased after 108 days of incubation the dominant bacteria in the lake water were well known c degradation microbes such as proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes cleveland et al 2007 mann et al 2013 most of the proteobacteria belonged to alphaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria fig s11 bacterial communities were further analyzed based at the genus level fig 6b sphingobacteriales 16 6 flavobacterium 9 3 and bacteroide 5 3 were the main bacteria in the initial lake water on both days 52 and 108 more abundant magnetospirillum bacteroide and treponema strains were found in the light radiation in the following order of greatest to least uv visible microbe treatment uv microbe treatment visible microbe treatment these results revealed that light radiation promoted the growth of genera which utilized the more recalcitrant carbon pool such as the acidogenic bacteria treponema and magnetospirillum which have been shown to be involved in aromatic ring cleavage for lignin degradation lucey and leadbetter 2014 tian et al 2014 nmds was used to compare the bacterial communities fig 6c compared to the samples on day 52 bacterial communities on day 108 were more dispersed 3 4 3 fungal diversity and community composition during the indoor experiments lake water on days 52 and 108 were also sampled for its sequencing the good s coverages were from 84 to 91 table 2 also meaning that the sequences depth can recover most of fungal communities the observed species and shannon indices were lower in the combined light and microbial treatments especially the uv added treatments table 2 evaluation at the phylum level for fungi showed that more unidentified fungi were found in the initial lake water 97 9 fig 6d after 52 days of incubation the relative abundance of ascomycota increased among the four treatments and the most content was found in the uv visible microbe treatment after 108 days of incubation most of the fungi belonged to ascomycete phylum fig 6d the basidiomycota phylum count was also higher in the light radiation treatments 1 6 10 9 the dominant class of basidiomycota phylum was cystobasidiomycetes especially in the light radiation treatments fig s12 light radiation could also affect lignocellulosic fungi as some litter decomposing fungi were found to be sensitive to uv radiation moody et al 2001 it had been confirmed that some aquatic ascomycete had the ability to degrade large polymers one of the mechanisms was the production of ligninolytic enzymes the other was acted as a catalyst for ros production rojas jimenez et al 2017 fungi from the basidiomycot phylum were found to be more prevalent under the light radiation which was important to results of plant residue degradation especially in litter with high lignin content blackwood et al 2007 the genus level characterization further illustrates variations in the fungal community on day 108 aspergillus 24 0 75 4 and lecythophora 13 1 84 0 were the two dominant genera among the four treatments a greater abundance of aspergillus was found in the light radiation treatments while a greater abundance of lecythophora 84 0 was found in the sole microbe treatment fig 6e the aspergillus genus belongs to the ascomycota phylum which can degrade phenolic and polysaccharide components in lignin carbohydrate complexes by hydroxylating demethylating and cleaving aromatic rings guerriero et al 2015 freshwater ascomycetes was able to transform complex organic compounds such as humic substances rojas jimenez et al 2017 although bacterial and fungal diversity decreased table 2 their ability to produce ros was found to increase during the experiments the phenomenon suggested that microbes could defense against damage from ros yu 1994 compared to the samples on day 52 fungal communities were more grouped on day 108 fig 6f which was different from the results found for bacterial communities overall the positive photo priming effects on microbial decomposition are considered another important reason for enhanced mass loss under light radiation 3 5 implications the results from the laboratory and natural solar radiation experiments suggest that photodegradation was an important driver of c cycling in aquatic systems through phototransformation of the litter chemical structure to biolabile substrates and change of the microbial community structure the two organic matter mineralization pathways photochemical and microbial in water are essentially interactional and competitive the common terrestrializaiton of shallow freshwater lakes can induce substantial macrophyte litter photo processing when drawn to the surface and exposed to sunlight the combined photo and biodegradation of macrophyte litter could produce more ros although these reactive species are very short lived they play a key role in many biologically and abiotic mediated redox reactions in natural waters especially ros is able to take part in degradation of pollutants such as pesticides pharmaceuticals and trace organic contaminants lee et al 2013 ruggeri et al 2013 more interesting photodegradation promoted the production of special bacteria and fungi which could degrade the more recalcitrant substances such as lignin also solar radiation has different effects on the species composition of benthic organisms and zooplankton in aquatic ecosystems häder et al 2015 and then affects their habits such as accracting the plant litter therefore further research is also needed to determine how the solar radiation influences the combined action of aquatic microorganism and zooplankton on the degradation of aquatic plant litter this study thus helps us to understand the c biochemical pathway in natural water and is also important for the pollution prevention considering the combined role of ros and special microorganism during litter degradation 4 conclusions the results showed that combined photo and biodegradation significantly accelerated litter decomposition compared to solely photo and solely microbe treatments while photo or biodegradation alone could produce ros the combined treatments promoted more ros production during litter degradation furthermore photodegradation affected microbial communities and cultured the specific bacteria and fungi which could degrade the more recalcitrant substances as a result both ros and specific microorganisms promoted litter degradation in lake water under light irradiation these results could provide new clue to better understand quantify and model the processes of particulate organic matter decomposition in aquatic ecosystems

18161,in this study the effects of free nitrous acid fna pre treatment on the rheological properties of digested sludge were investigated at a pilot scale along with the improvement in volatile solids vs destruction and biogas production two pilot scale anaerobic sludge digesters were operated for one year one receiving thickened waste activated sludge twas without pre treatment control and one receiving twas pre treated for 24 h at an fna concentration of 4 9 6 1 mgn l nitrite 250 mgn l ph 5 0 t 22 30 c the results confirmed the enhancing effect of fna pre treatment on methane production 37 1 consistent with previous laboratory studies equally importantly fna pre treatment substantially reduced the shear viscosity of twas by 51 8 at 100 s 1 and 49 7 at 250 s 1 likely due to the solubilization of the twas 11 1 0 8 similarly fna pre treatment also reduced these viscosity parameters of the digested sludge by 80 4 and 78 4 respectively caused by both enhanced vs destruction and disintegration of the digested sludge the dewaterability of digested sludge assessed by dewatered solids content capillary suction time and specific resistance to filtration was not improved by fna pre treatment the polymer requirement for dewatering was reduced by 24 0 6 due to the lower solids concentration in the digested sludge achieved with fna pre treatment the changes to sludge rheological properties revealed in this study further enhances the business case for the fna pre treatment technology graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion free nitrous acid pilot scale viscosity rheological properties 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad of waste activated sludge was is an important step in contemporary wastewater treatment plants wwtps the main aim of anaerobic sludge digestion is to reduce sludge production and to recover renewable energy from the sludge abelleira pereira et al 2015 zuo et al 2019 however the application of anaerobic sludge digestion in wwtps still faces challenges one challenge is the low biodegradability of was with the methane production of 110 145 ml gvssadded in general gossett and belser 1981 bougrier et al 2006 furthermore the low hydrolysis rate of was known to be the rate limiting step of the anaerobic sludge digestion process requires a long hydraulic retention time hrt l5 days or longer for the digester miron et al 2000 thermal hydrolysis pre treatment thp has found wide applications due to its significant improvement to biogas production by both enhancing the sludge biodegradability and hydrolysis rate wilson and novak 2009 also thp can improve the rheological properties and dewaterability of the digested sludge zhang et al 2018 however the thp process requires high capital investment and also requires significant energy input recently sludge pre treatment using free nitrous acid fna hno2 has been investigated as a promising process for enhancing anaerobic sludge digestion wang et al 2013 zahedi et al 2016 2017 wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 wang et al 2013 demonstrated that with fna pre treatment of full scale thickened was twas for 24 h methane production was enhanced by 20 50 analyzed using biochemical methane production bmp tests this effect was confirmed in a recent laboratory study involving the use of two continuously operated ad reactors wei et al 2018 in addition to enhancing the methane production fna pre treatment also improved the hydrolysis rate of twas model based analysis of bmp data estimated that the sludge hydrolysis rate k was increased from 0 15 0 19 d 1 to 0 23 0 32 d 1 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 the improvement to the sludge hydrolysis rate led to the hypothesis that with fna pre treatment an anaerobic sludge digester could be operated at much reduced hrt there was recently demonstrated in zhang et al 2019 which showed that a continuous ad reactor operated at an hrt of 7 5 days with fna based pretreatment of twas could achieve 35 improvement to volatile solids vs destruction and methane production in comparison to the control reactor without pre treatment running at an hrt of 15 days in both of the studies involved the use of continuously operated ad reactors wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the fna pre treatment was carried out in a well mixed reactor operated at ambient temperature and pressure with a short hrt of 1 day also free nitrous acid the chemical agent required can be produced from the anaerobic sludge digestion liquor law et al 2015 preliminary analysis has shown the cost effectiveness of this process in reducing sludge production and in enhancing biogas production however this process has so far only been demonstrated in laboratory scale 1 l anaerobic sludge digesters pilot scale investigations are clearly required before its full scale application among other potential complications involved in up scaling hydrodynamic behavior has a major influence on the transfer of substrates and heat to microorganisms and consequently on the treatment efficiency of anaerobic digesters heertjes et al 1982 karim et al 2005 these aspects could not be adequately assessed in laboratory studies among other limitations magnetic mixers were used in previous laboratory studies which unlikely produced shear forces similar to those in a full scale digester rheological properties of activated sludge are a critical factor influencing the performance and economics of an anaerobic sludge digester the rheology describes the flow of matter under the influence of mechanical stress which is considered to play a key role in activated sludge treatment processes karim et al 2005 viscosity as the basic rheological parameter has been demonstrated to be a crucial parameter in heat and mass transfer in anaerobic digestion systems verma et al 2007 miryahyaei et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 reported that the apparent viscosity of thp treated sludge is approximately 20 that of untreated sludge liu et al 2016 found that the microwave pre treatment also reduced the apparent viscosity of activated sludge though the microwave pre treatment did not significantly improve the methane production potential at low temperature lower than 40 c kuglarz et al 2013 the viscosity reduction in an anaerobic digester means the digester can be operated at a higher solids concentration which is important for the design and operation of anaerobic digesters however there is little information available on the viscosity characteristic of was treated by fna or digested sludge with fna pre treatment the main aim of this study is to investigate the effect of fna pre treatment on the rheological properties of twas and digested sludge the study also aims to demonstrate the effect of fna pre treatment on vs destruction and methane production of an anaerobic digester at pilot scale 2 material and methods 2 1 pilot scale anaerobic sludge digesters two pilot scale semi continuous ad systems were established at the luggage point wastewater treatment plant lpwwtp brisbane australia the experimental system comprised a 35 l pre treatment reactor and an anaerobic digester with a working volume of 235 l while the control system only consisted of an identical anaerobic digester fig s1 in supplementary information si both digesters made of stainless steel were equipped with impeller agitators for mixing such mixers are commonly used in full scale digesters to provide adequate mixing of anaerobic digesters wu 2011 the reactors were flushed with nitrogen gas to remove oxygen before being sealed the temperature in both digesters was measured with an industrial thermometer and maintained at 37 c using an electric jacket outside the digesters controlled by a programmable logic controller plc the pre treatment unit in the experimental system was continually mixed with a radial impeller it was operated at ambient temperature which varied between 22 c and 30 c during the course of the study the ph in the pre treatment tank was monitored using a ph meter bpd17 rwt australia and controlled at a set point details in section 2 3 by the plc via dosing 1 0 m hcl the pre treatment tank was also equipped with a peristaltic pump controlled by the plc to deliver a pre designed amount of a nitrite stock solution nano2 at 10gn l details in section 2 3 to the pre treatment tank twice a day both the control and experimental lines were fed with 7 83 l twas collected from the full scale plant details in section 2 2 giving an hrt of 15 days in the digesters 235 l 7 83 2 simultaneously the same amount of digested sludge was wasted from each digester both the digesters and the pre treatment unit were monitored closely with a monitoring protocol to be described in section 2 4 2 2 sludge sources and inoculum the inoculum for the two ads was collected from an anaerobic sludge digester in the full scale plant which is a biological nutrient removal plant treating primarily domestic wastewater operated with an hrt of 15 days the feed twas was obtained from a dissolved air flotation thickener twas was manually collected every two to three days and stored in the feed tank in a refrigerator at 4 c the properties of the inoculum and feed sludge are presented in table 1 2 3 experimental design the two pilot scale systems were continuously operated for one year which was divided into two phases in the baseline phase days 0 204 the two systems were operated identically with no pre treatment in either system which allowed both reactors to reach similar anaerobic digestion performance steady state i as indicated by stable vs destruction and methane production as described in section 2 1 twas was fed to each reactor at a flow rate of 15 7 l day giving rise to an hrt of 15 days for both reactors in the experimental phase days 205 365 the control system was operated as in the baseline phase while the pre treatment was started for the experimental system twas fed to the experimental ad reactor was pre treated for 24 h at an fna concentration of approximately 4 9 6 1 mgn l ph 5 0 no2 n 250 mg l ambient temperature t 22 30 c in the pre treatment tank the fna concentration was calculated as per equation sno2 n k a 10ph where k a e 2300 273 t anthonisen et al 1976 2 4 monitoring protocol monitoring protocol for the feed sludge fna treated sludge and digested sludge in the control and experimental ad reactors are detailed in table s1 in summary biogas production and ph were measured online the biogas composition and the concentrations of total solids ts vs ammonium volatile fatty acids vfas total chemical oxygen demand tcod and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod were measured twice a week the dewaterability fecal coliforms abundance viscosity particle size distribution zeta potential and sludge morphology were measured every 1 2 weeks at the steady state of each phase the effect of solids concentration on the viscosity of sludge has been demonstrated in many studies eshtiaghi et al 2013 therefore in addition to the routine viscosity measurement summarized in table s1 the following additional viscosity measurements were also carried out in order to separate the effect of ts on viscosity from the inherent changes in viscosity 1 digested sludge from the control ad reactor which had a higher solids concentration than that in the experimental ad reactor see results and discussion was diluted to reach the experimental solids concentration the viscosity of the diluted sludge samples was then measured in triplicate the dilutions were achieved by adding a certain volume of solids free supernatant from the control ad which is calculated based on ts concentration in the digested sludge from both reactors the solids free supernatant from the control ad was collected by filtering the centrifuge supernatant through a 0 45 μm syringe filter 2 digested sludge from the experimental ad reactor was concentrated to reach the same solids concentration as in the control ad reactor the viscosity of the concentrated sludge was then measured in triplicate the concentrations were achieved by removing a certain volume of supernatant which is calculated based on ts concentration in the digested sludge from both reactors 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 routine analysis of chemical composition parameters ts and vs analyses were performed according to standard methods apha 2005 vs destruction was calculated using the mass balance equation vs destruction vsin vsout vsin 100 where vsin and vsout are the total vs concentrations in g l of feeding and digested sludge respectively switzenbaum et al 2003 cod including tcod and scod were measured using a thermoreactor merck spectroquant tr 320 and a photometer merck spectroquant prove 100 for the measurement of scod soluble kjeldahl nitrogen skn nh4 n no2 n and vfas the samples were filtered through a syringe filter 0 45 μm pore size prior to analysis skn was measured using inductivity coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes optima 7300 dv nh4 n and no2 n were analyzed with a lachat quik chem 8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wisconsin vfas were measured with a gas chromatograph agilent 7890a with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column the concentration of total vfas was calculated by aggregation of individual vfas all expressed as cod alkalinity were determined by a titration method to ph 4 3 biogas composition n2 o2 ch4 co2 was determined using a gas chromatograph agilent 7820a equipped with a thermal conductivity detector methane production rate was calculated based on the biogas production rate recorded by a diaphragm gas meter landis gyr model 750 and the methane fraction in biogas 2 5 2 viscosity sludge rheological behavior was measured with a rheometer anton paar physica mcr101 modular compact rheometer australia equipped with cup and four blade vane geometry of diameter 14 mm prior to each measurement 50 ml sludge sample was kept in the measuring cup where vane is immersed all measurements were carried out at 25 00 0 01 c the temperature was maintained by a peltier controller viscosity measurements were performed in triplicate for each sample for analysis of limiting viscosity at infinite shear rate hysteresis loop test was performed this test consisted of the following steps a the sludge was pre sheared at 5 s 1 for 2 min to minimize the stress history b the shear rate was linearly increased to the maximum shear rate 500 s 1 in 2 min up flow curve c sludge sample was sheared at the maximum shear rate for 1 min d shear rate was linearly decreased to 0 s 1 in 2 min down flow curve for analysis of apparent viscosity controlled shear rate csr tests were undertaken to investigate the changes in viscosity of samples when sheared under this test measurements were carried out in steady flow mode to obtain apparent viscosity η a and rheogram of sludge a the shear rate was increased linearly from 0 1 to 500 s 1 b the constant shear rate of 500 s 1 was applied for 30 s c the shear rate was decreased linearly from 500 to 0 1 s 1 likewise shear viscosity measurement as a function of time were carried out at different shear rates 100 s 1 and 250 s 1 in this study 2 5 3 dewaterability dewaterability of digested sludge was measured according to devlin et al 2011 polymeric aluminum chloride pac as polymer 7 89 g l or 0 789 was gradually added to a 25 ml sludge sample while mixed and stirred until coagulation occurred the volume of polymer added was noted once coagulated the sludge was drained into solids cake through a belt filter fabric then the solids cake was centrifuged in a centrifuge cup with the belt filter fabric at 3750 rpm for 10 min the solids content of the cake was determined after discharging the supernatant capillary suction time cst was measured with a cst instrument 304m triton uk equipped with a 10 mm diameter funnel specific resistance to filtration srf was measured using the method described in liu et al 2012 2 5 4 fecal coliforms measurement fecal coliforms was quantified using colilert 18 test kit from idexx laboratories devlin et al 2011 coelho et al 2011 according to the manufacturer s instructions sludge samples were first diluted to 100 ml using sterilized reverse osmosis water with the dilution times ranging from 103 to106 depending on the sludge samples colilert 18 reagents supplied by the test kit were dissolved in the 100 ml diluted samples afterwards the 100 ml mixed solution was transferred into the quanti tray 2000 and sealed by a quanti tray sealer the sealed quanti tray 2000 was subsequently incubated at 44 5 0 5 c and 100 rpm for 18 h the number of fecal coliform was attained based on the amount of positive yellow wells of the quanti tray 2000 and the most probable number mpn of fecal coliform can be checked from the idexx quanti tray 2000 mpn table http www idexx com au the method can provide 95 confidence limits comparable to the membrane filtration method 2 5 5 soluble protein and polysaccharide measurements the twas was first centrifuged in a 50 ml tube at 4000 g for 5 min and the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 mm zhang et al 2014 the protein concentration in the filtrate was analyzed with the bicinchoninic acid bca method with bovine serum albumin bsa as standard smith et al 1985 the polysaccharide concentration in the filtrate was measured with the anthrone method with glucose solution as standard raunkjaer et al 1994 2 5 6 other physico chemical properties zeta potential a surface characteristic of the sludge was analyzed using a zetasizer malvern nano zs90 uk particle size distribution psd of the sludge samples was measured using a particle size analyzer malvern mastersizer 2000 uk scanning electron microscopy sem jeol jsm 6610 america was employed to observe the morphology of sludge samples the color intensity of effluent from anaerobic digesters was recorded in platinum cobalt ptco units apha 2005 color standards ranging from 5 to 300 ptco units were prepared and the absorbance of each was measured with a spectrophotometer at 475 nm a calibration curve was constructed from the color standards and their corresponding absorbance values the sludge samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe filter and the filtrate was then measured with a spectrophotometer for its absorbance at a wavelength of 475 nm the absorbance was then converted to color units ptco using the calibration curve 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance of the anaerobic digesters fig 1 presents the methane production and vs destruction in the control and experimental anaerobic sludge digesters over the operational period and a summary of averaged methane production and vs destruction in the two systems at the two steady states in the baseline phase the two anaerobic systems reached similar performance after approximately 150 days operation as reflected by the stable and comparable methane production and vs destruction data in the experimental phase after inclusion of the fna pre treatment methane production and vs destruction in the experimental digester gradually exceeded that in the control digester between day 205 and 231 and then remained stable over the remaining period of the experimental phase methane production in the control and experimental ads in the baseline phase averaged 115 3 2 1 and 114 6 2 5 ml gvsadded fig 1c respectively with the vs destruction averaged 24 1 1 4 and 23 9 0 8 fig 1d respectively following the implementation of fna pre treatment in the experimental line biogas production in the experimental ad increased gradually to 157 2 2 5 ml gvsadded in the new steady state fig 1c 37 1 higher than that for the control ad which remained unchanged at 114 7 1 5 ml gvsadded similarly the vs destruction in the experimental ad also increased to 34 8 0 7 in the new steady state fig 1d with a relatively increase of 47 1 compared to the control ad 23 6 0 4 fna pre treatment significantly enhanced methane production with higher conversion of organic components to biogas this was likely because of the solubilization of vs during the fna pre treatment fig 2 which is consistent with previous laboratory studies wang et al 2013 wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 following the 24 h fna treatment the scod increased to 0 158 0 013 mg mgvs compared to the untreated twas at 0 019 0 001 mg mgvs fig 2a similarly skn increased from 0 001 0 0002 mg mgvs for the untreated twas to 0 018 0 0008 mg mgvs for the fna treated twas fig 2a the scod and skn release was likely due to cell lysis and or the solubilization of extracellular polymeric substances eps caused by fna treatment the soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide concentrations increased from 0 005 mg mgvs and 0 001 mg mgvs for untreated twas to 0 029 mg mgvs and 0 015 mg mgvs for the fna treated twas fig 2b further supporting cell lysis and eps solubilization the enhancement of sludge digestion by fna pre treatment is also supported the measurement of ammonium concentration and vs concentration in feed and effluent of the two ads see supporting information for details and fig s2 though the feed of the experimental digester was pre treated at ph 5 0 the ph in the control and experimental ads were comparable averaging 7 19 0 02 and 7 22 0 02 respectively which was in the favorable range for methanogens appels et al 2008 the residual nitrite concentration in the fna treated twas averaged 162 4 12 2 mgn l which was removed in the ad reactor due to nitrite reduction wang et al 2014 the alkalinity produced by nitrite reduction likely partially offset the acidity in the twas fed further the ammonium concentration in the experimental ad reactor was 22 higher than that in the control ad reactor fig s2 due to enhanced vs destruction which provided additional alkalinity to maintain the reactor ph at a neutral level despite of the acidic feed consistent with previous results obtained in lab scale studies duan et al 2018 wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 fna treatment reduced the mpn of fecal coliform in the twas however the anaerobic digester did not further reduce mpn of fecal coliform but increased the count see supporting information for details and fig s3 the results are different from that reported in wei et al 2018 where fna pre treatment reduced the fecal coliform both in twas and the digested sludge but are similar to the results reported in zhang et al 2019 it appears that pathogens inactivated during fna pre treatment were able to regrow in the anaerobic digester similarly riau et al 2010 also observed the recurrence of fecal coliforms in the temperature phased anaerobic digestion the fecal coliforms abundance decreased significantly by 4 logs in the first step thermophilic ad at an hrt of 5 or 15 days but increased in the second step mesophilic ad at an hrt of 15 days the mechanism of the regrowth is unclear at present and warrants further investigation it is possible that some viable pathogen cells could not grow in the 18 h test but are actually viable and managed to grow in the anaerobic digester in this case more optimal treatment conditions may be developed to more effectively inactivate pathogens furthermore the color of the ad liquor from the experimental reactor averaged 1667 27 mgptco l which was slightly 17 higher than that in the control ad liquor of 1433 27 mgptco l thp is known to produce an effluent with a high level dissolved nitrogen compounds leading to color problems with the thp operating temperature ranging from 140 c to 165 c the color of the ad liquor was in the range from 3800 to 8000 mgptco l dwyer et al 2008 while fna pretreatment has only a minor effect on the effluent color 3 2 viscosity the limiting viscosity and shear viscosity at 100 s 1 and 250 s 1 of twas fna treated twas and digested sludge from the two systems in the steady state of the experimental phase are summarized and compared in fig 3 fna pre treatment caused a significant reduction in the treated sludge viscosity compared to the un treated twas the limiting viscosity shear viscosity at 100 s 1 and 250 s 1 was reduced by 58 7 from 345 6 31 9 to 145 6 14 0 mpa s 51 8 from 813 1 106 5 to 398 3 39 2 mpa s and 49 7 from 387 5 40 1 to 198 4 21 3 mpa s respectively fig 3 the reduction in viscosity of the digested sludge was even higher the limiting viscosity and shear viscosity at 100 s 1 and 250 s 1 of the digested sludge from experimental system averaged 81 0 4 1 185 4 9 8 and 100 3 4 8 mpa s compared to the control system of 336 1 10 6 922 9 16 1 and 457 6 11 2 mpa s with the reduction of 76 4 80 4 and 78 4 respectively fig 3 fna pre treatment has been previously demonstrated to solubilize activated sludge wang et al 2013 wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 as is also confirmed in this study fig 2 this could have led to changes in the morphology of the sludge flocs leading to changed viscosity farno et al 2016 sem images provided further information on twas disintegration with fna treatment fig s4 it appears fna treatment ruptured the cell walls and destroyed the sludge surface which helped to release more extracellular and intracellular biopolymers from was flocs into the liquid phase reflected by the increase in soluble proteins and polysaccharides following fna treatment fig 2b furthermore the significant breakdown of macromolecules into small molecules in the soluble phase of twas or digested sludge after fna treatment has also been confirmed using molecular weight distribution analysis by gel permeation chromatography and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy zhang et al 2015 li et al 2020 particle size distribution of sludge samples was also measured in this study fig 4 as a key factor to evaluate the disintegration degree of twas kampas et al 2007 wang et al 2019 as summarized in fig 4 d10 d50 and d90 with dn representing particle size at the cumulative frequency of n of twas decreased substantially by 67 79 after fna treatment the particles sizes of the digested sludge from the experimental reactor were also slightly lower than those of the control ad for example d50 of the experimental sludge 59 0 2 μm was slightly lower than that of control sludge 65 1 μm n 15 p 0 05 also d90 of the experimental sludge averaged 148 1 μm which was lower than 157 2 μm of control sludge n 15 p 0 05 the particle size distribution data indeed indicate that fna pre treatment disintegrated sludge flocs which likely contributed to the reduced viscosity for treated twas and digested sludge the decrease of particle size was likely due to the breakdown of macromolecular organic matters in eps zhang et al 2018 which are considered to be an important factor in viscosity of activated sludge nagaoka et al 1996 the viscosity reduction for digested sludge was likely partially due to a lower solids concentration of the experimental ad sludge as a result of enhanced vs destruction figs 1b and d eshtiaghi et al 2013 to further confirm the mechanism of viscosity reduction for digested sludge with fna pre treatment the viscosities of the diluted control ad sludge to the same concentration as the experimental ad and the concentrated experimental ad sludge to the same concentration as the control ad were analyzed fig s5 as summarized in fig 5 a the limiting viscosity and shear viscosity at 100 s 1 and 250 s 1 of the diluted digested sludge from control system averaged 114 9 7 2 286 8 24 0 and 147 2 9 6 mpa s compared to these there were still 30 2 35 3 and 32 3 reductions in limiting viscosity shear viscosity at 100 s 1 and 250 s 1 for the digested sludge from the experimental system similarly when the experimental ad sludge was concentrated to the same solids concentration as the control ad sludge the limiting viscosity and shear viscosity at 100 s 1 and 250 s 1 were 244 8 16 7 690 6 49 3 and 334 9 20 4 mpa s fig 5b 27 3 25 3 and 27 2 respectively lower than the digested sludge from control system this suggests that fna pre treatment reduces the viscosity of the digested sludge not only through enhancing vs destruction thus leading to reduced viscosity due to reduced solids concentration but also through changing the inherent properties of the sludge fig s4 figs 4 and 5 the above results imply that with fna pretreatment the anaerobic digester can be operated at least at the same solids concentration as in the control system considering the higher vs destruction rate the feed sludge concentration can be at least 13 higher than that fed to the control ad see si for calculation details this would still yield a sludge viscosity that is 25 lower than that in the control ad the mixing energy consumption in a digester is reduced by reduction in viscosity tian et al 2014 and hence energy savings are also expected 3 3 dewateability and polymer consumption the dewaterability of the digested sludge in the two systems in both the baseline and experimental phases after both systems reached stable performance in each phase is compared in fig 6 there was no obvious difference in solids content of the dewatered cake between the two systems the dewatered solids content averaged 17 5 0 3 in the control system identical to that in the experimental system of 16 8 0 3 p 0 05 to further evaluate the dewaterability of the digested sludge the normalized cst which determines dewatering velocity and srf which determines sludge filterability were measured and compared in fig s6 with fna pre treatment the cst was 141 5 10 4 s l gts comparable to that of the control ad sludge at 136 0 13 1 s l gts p 0 05 the srf value increased from 7 4 2 4 1013 m kg of the control digested sludge to 14 6 2 1 1013 m kg of the experimental digested sludge the solids content cst and srf data collectively indicate that the fna pretreatment did not improve the dewaterability of the digested sludge and likely deteriorated it as shown by the increased srf value yu et al 2019 fig 6b shows the zeta potential values of the twas fna treated twas and digested sludges from the two systems the zeta potential of the twas averaged 23 2 0 3 mv but significantly increased to 15 5 0 2 mv after fna treatment consequently the zeta potential of the digested sludge in experimental ad averaged 25 0 0 7 mv slightly higher than that in control ad of 27 6 0 6 mv p 0 05 the similar zeta potential of the digested sludge from the two ads further indicated the fna pretreatment did not improve the dewaterability of the digested sludge xu et al 2018 the polymer consumption was 24 0 6 lower for the dewatering of the digested sludge with fna pre treatment at 0 50 0 02 g polmer l sludge compared to the control sludge at 0 66 0 02 g polmer l sludge fig 6a however the polymer consumption averaged 18 0 0 5 in both reactors in terms of kg active polymer per ton dried solids of digested sludge the polymer consumption for dewatering is related to the amount of sludge solids in the sludge samples yin et al 2004 with fna pre treatment a lower solids concentration was obtained in the experimental reactor fig s2d due to improved vs destruction fig 1 which is the reason for the lower consumption of polymers 4 conclusions effects of fna pre treatment on the efficiency of anaerobic digester and rheological properties of the digested sludge were investigated through long term pilot scale anaerobic digesters in this study the main conclusions are this study confirmed at a pilot scale that fna pre treatment of twas significantly enhanced methane production and vs destruction this was due to the increased solubilization of twas the fna pre treatment of twas significantly reduced the viscosity of anaerobic digested sludge with 76 4 80 4 and 78 4 reduction achieved for the limiting viscosity and shear viscosity at 100 s 1 and 250 s 1 the reduced viscosity would increase the capacity of anaerobic digester the polymer requirement for dewatering is reduced by 24 0 6 for the digested sludge with fna pre treatment

18161,in this study the effects of free nitrous acid fna pre treatment on the rheological properties of digested sludge were investigated at a pilot scale along with the improvement in volatile solids vs destruction and biogas production two pilot scale anaerobic sludge digesters were operated for one year one receiving thickened waste activated sludge twas without pre treatment control and one receiving twas pre treated for 24 h at an fna concentration of 4 9 6 1 mgn l nitrite 250 mgn l ph 5 0 t 22 30 c the results confirmed the enhancing effect of fna pre treatment on methane production 37 1 consistent with previous laboratory studies equally importantly fna pre treatment substantially reduced the shear viscosity of twas by 51 8 at 100 s 1 and 49 7 at 250 s 1 likely due to the solubilization of the twas 11 1 0 8 similarly fna pre treatment also reduced these viscosity parameters of the digested sludge by 80 4 and 78 4 respectively caused by both enhanced vs destruction and disintegration of the digested sludge the dewaterability of digested sludge assessed by dewatered solids content capillary suction time and specific resistance to filtration was not improved by fna pre treatment the polymer requirement for dewatering was reduced by 24 0 6 due to the lower solids concentration in the digested sludge achieved with fna pre treatment the changes to sludge rheological properties revealed in this study further enhances the business case for the fna pre treatment technology graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion free nitrous acid pilot scale viscosity rheological properties 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad of waste activated sludge was is an important step in contemporary wastewater treatment plants wwtps the main aim of anaerobic sludge digestion is to reduce sludge production and to recover renewable energy from the sludge abelleira pereira et al 2015 zuo et al 2019 however the application of anaerobic sludge digestion in wwtps still faces challenges one challenge is the low biodegradability of was with the methane production of 110 145 ml gvssadded in general gossett and belser 1981 bougrier et al 2006 furthermore the low hydrolysis rate of was known to be the rate limiting step of the anaerobic sludge digestion process requires a long hydraulic retention time hrt l5 days or longer for the digester miron et al 2000 thermal hydrolysis pre treatment thp has found wide applications due to its significant improvement to biogas production by both enhancing the sludge biodegradability and hydrolysis rate wilson and novak 2009 also thp can improve the rheological properties and dewaterability of the digested sludge zhang et al 2018 however the thp process requires high capital investment and also requires significant energy input recently sludge pre treatment using free nitrous acid fna hno2 has been investigated as a promising process for enhancing anaerobic sludge digestion wang et al 2013 zahedi et al 2016 2017 wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 wang et al 2013 demonstrated that with fna pre treatment of full scale thickened was twas for 24 h methane production was enhanced by 20 50 analyzed using biochemical methane production bmp tests this effect was confirmed in a recent laboratory study involving the use of two continuously operated ad reactors wei et al 2018 in addition to enhancing the methane production fna pre treatment also improved the hydrolysis rate of twas model based analysis of bmp data estimated that the sludge hydrolysis rate k was increased from 0 15 0 19 d 1 to 0 23 0 32 d 1 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 the improvement to the sludge hydrolysis rate led to the hypothesis that with fna pre treatment an anaerobic sludge digester could be operated at much reduced hrt there was recently demonstrated in zhang et al 2019 which showed that a continuous ad reactor operated at an hrt of 7 5 days with fna based pretreatment of twas could achieve 35 improvement to volatile solids vs destruction and methane production in comparison to the control reactor without pre treatment running at an hrt of 15 days in both of the studies involved the use of continuously operated ad reactors wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the fna pre treatment was carried out in a well mixed reactor operated at ambient temperature and pressure with a short hrt of 1 day also free nitrous acid the chemical agent required can be produced from the anaerobic sludge digestion liquor law et al 2015 preliminary analysis has shown the cost effectiveness of this process in reducing sludge production and in enhancing biogas production however this process has so far only been demonstrated in laboratory scale 1 l anaerobic sludge digesters pilot scale investigations are clearly required before its full scale application among other potential complications involved in up scaling hydrodynamic behavior has a major influence on the transfer of substrates and heat to microorganisms and consequently on the treatment efficiency of anaerobic digesters heertjes et al 1982 karim et al 2005 these aspects could not be adequately assessed in laboratory studies among other limitations magnetic mixers were used in previous laboratory studies which unlikely produced shear forces similar to those in a full scale digester rheological properties of activated sludge are a critical factor influencing the performance and economics of an anaerobic sludge digester the rheology describes the flow of matter under the influence of mechanical stress which is considered to play a key role in activated sludge treatment processes karim et al 2005 viscosity as the basic rheological parameter has been demonstrated to be a crucial parameter in heat and mass transfer in anaerobic digestion systems verma et al 2007 miryahyaei et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 reported that the apparent viscosity of thp treated sludge is approximately 20 that of untreated sludge liu et al 2016 found that the microwave pre treatment also reduced the apparent viscosity of activated sludge though the microwave pre treatment did not significantly improve the methane production potential at low temperature lower than 40 c kuglarz et al 2013 the viscosity reduction in an anaerobic digester means the digester can be operated at a higher solids concentration which is important for the design and operation of anaerobic digesters however there is little information available on the viscosity characteristic of was treated by fna or digested sludge with fna pre treatment the main aim of this study is to investigate the effect of fna pre treatment on the rheological properties of twas and digested sludge the study also aims to demonstrate the effect of fna pre treatment on vs destruction and methane production of an anaerobic digester at pilot scale 2 material and methods 2 1 pilot scale anaerobic sludge digesters two pilot scale semi continuous ad systems were established at the luggage point wastewater treatment plant lpwwtp brisbane australia the experimental system comprised a 35 l pre treatment reactor and an anaerobic digester with a working volume of 235 l while the control system only consisted of an identical anaerobic digester fig s1 in supplementary information si both digesters made of stainless steel were equipped with impeller agitators for mixing such mixers are commonly used in full scale digesters to provide adequate mixing of anaerobic digesters wu 2011 the reactors were flushed with nitrogen gas to remove oxygen before being sealed the temperature in both digesters was measured with an industrial thermometer and maintained at 37 c using an electric jacket outside the digesters controlled by a programmable logic controller plc the pre treatment unit in the experimental system was continually mixed with a radial impeller it was operated at ambient temperature which varied between 22 c and 30 c during the course of the study the ph in the pre treatment tank was monitored using a ph meter bpd17 rwt australia and controlled at a set point details in section 2 3 by the plc via dosing 1 0 m hcl the pre treatment tank was also equipped with a peristaltic pump controlled by the plc to deliver a pre designed amount of a nitrite stock solution nano2 at 10gn l details in section 2 3 to the pre treatment tank twice a day both the control and experimental lines were fed with 7 83 l twas collected from the full scale plant details in section 2 2 giving an hrt of 15 days in the digesters 235 l 7 83 2 simultaneously the same amount of digested sludge was wasted from each digester both the digesters and the pre treatment unit were monitored closely with a monitoring protocol to be described in section 2 4 2 2 sludge sources and inoculum the inoculum for the two ads was collected from an anaerobic sludge digester in the full scale plant which is a biological nutrient removal plant treating primarily domestic wastewater operated with an hrt of 15 days the feed twas was obtained from a dissolved air flotation thickener twas was manually collected every two to three days and stored in the feed tank in a refrigerator at 4 c the properties of the inoculum and feed sludge are presented in table 1 2 3 experimental design the two pilot scale systems were continuously operated for one year which was divided into two phases in the baseline phase days 0 204 the two systems were operated identically with no pre treatment in either system which allowed both reactors to reach similar anaerobic digestion performance steady state i as indicated by stable vs destruction and methane production as described in section 2 1 twas was fed to each reactor at a flow rate of 15 7 l day giving rise to an hrt of 15 days for both reactors in the experimental phase days 205 365 the control system was operated as in the baseline phase while the pre treatment was started for the experimental system twas fed to the experimental ad reactor was pre treated for 24 h at an fna concentration of approximately 4 9 6 1 mgn l ph 5 0 no2 n 250 mg l ambient temperature t 22 30 c in the pre treatment tank the fna concentration was calculated as per equation sno2 n k a 10ph where k a e 2300 273 t anthonisen et al 1976 2 4 monitoring protocol monitoring protocol for the feed sludge fna treated sludge and digested sludge in the control and experimental ad reactors are detailed in table s1 in summary biogas production and ph were measured online the biogas composition and the concentrations of total solids ts vs ammonium volatile fatty acids vfas total chemical oxygen demand tcod and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod were measured twice a week the dewaterability fecal coliforms abundance viscosity particle size distribution zeta potential and sludge morphology were measured every 1 2 weeks at the steady state of each phase the effect of solids concentration on the viscosity of sludge has been demonstrated in many studies eshtiaghi et al 2013 therefore in addition to the routine viscosity measurement summarized in table s1 the following additional viscosity measurements were also carried out in order to separate the effect of ts on viscosity from the inherent changes in viscosity 1 digested sludge from the control ad reactor which had a higher solids concentration than that in the experimental ad reactor see results and discussion was diluted to reach the experimental solids concentration the viscosity of the diluted sludge samples was then measured in triplicate the dilutions were achieved by adding a certain volume of solids free supernatant from the control ad which is calculated based on ts concentration in the digested sludge from both reactors the solids free supernatant from the control ad was collected by filtering the centrifuge supernatant through a 0 45 μm syringe filter 2 digested sludge from the experimental ad reactor was concentrated to reach the same solids concentration as in the control ad reactor the viscosity of the concentrated sludge was then measured in triplicate the concentrations were achieved by removing a certain volume of supernatant which is calculated based on ts concentration in the digested sludge from both reactors 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 routine analysis of chemical composition parameters ts and vs analyses were performed according to standard methods apha 2005 vs destruction was calculated using the mass balance equation vs destruction vsin vsout vsin 100 where vsin and vsout are the total vs concentrations in g l of feeding and digested sludge respectively switzenbaum et al 2003 cod including tcod and scod were measured using a thermoreactor merck spectroquant tr 320 and a photometer merck spectroquant prove 100 for the measurement of scod soluble kjeldahl nitrogen skn nh4 n no2 n and vfas the samples were filtered through a syringe filter 0 45 μm pore size prior to analysis skn was measured using inductivity coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes optima 7300 dv nh4 n and no2 n were analyzed with a lachat quik chem 8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wisconsin vfas were measured with a gas chromatograph agilent 7890a with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column the concentration of total vfas was calculated by aggregation of individual vfas all expressed as cod alkalinity were determined by a titration method to ph 4 3 biogas composition n2 o2 ch4 co2 was determined using a gas chromatograph agilent 7820a equipped with a thermal conductivity detector methane production rate was calculated based on the biogas production rate recorded by a diaphragm gas meter landis gyr model 750 and the methane fraction in biogas 2 5 2 viscosity sludge rheological behavior was measured with a rheometer anton paar physica mcr101 modular compact rheometer australia equipped with cup and four blade vane geometry of diameter 14 mm prior to each measurement 50 ml sludge sample was kept in the measuring cup where vane is immersed all measurements were carried out at 25 00 0 01 c the temperature was maintained by a peltier controller viscosity measurements were performed in triplicate for each sample for analysis of limiting viscosity at infinite shear rate hysteresis loop test was performed this test consisted of the following steps a the sludge was pre sheared at 5 s 1 for 2 min to minimize the stress history b the shear rate was linearly increased to the maximum shear rate 500 s 1 in 2 min up flow curve c sludge sample was sheared at the maximum shear rate for 1 min d shear rate was linearly decreased to 0 s 1 in 2 min down flow curve for analysis of apparent viscosity controlled shear rate csr tests were undertaken to investigate the changes in viscosity of samples when sheared under this test measurements were carried out in steady flow mode to obtain apparent viscosity η a and rheogram of sludge a the shear rate was increased linearly from 0 1 to 500 s 1 b the constant shear rate of 500 s 1 was applied for 30 s c the shear rate was decreased linearly from 500 to 0 1 s 1 likewise shear viscosity measurement as a function of time were carried out at different shear rates 100 s 1 and 250 s 1 in this study 2 5 3 dewaterability dewaterability of digested sludge was measured according to devlin et al 2011 polymeric aluminum chloride pac as polymer 7 89 g l or 0 789 was gradually added to a 25 ml sludge sample while mixed and stirred until coagulation occurred the volume of polymer added was noted once coagulated the sludge was drained into solids cake through a belt filter fabric then the solids cake was centrifuged in a centrifuge cup with the belt filter fabric at 3750 rpm for 10 min the solids content of the cake was determined after discharging the supernatant capillary suction time cst was measured with a cst instrument 304m triton uk equipped with a 10 mm diameter funnel specific resistance to filtration srf was measured using the method described in liu et al 2012 2 5 4 fecal coliforms measurement fecal coliforms was quantified using colilert 18 test kit from idexx laboratories devlin et al 2011 coelho et al 2011 according to the manufacturer s instructions sludge samples were first diluted to 100 ml using sterilized reverse osmosis water with the dilution times ranging from 103 to106 depending on the sludge samples colilert 18 reagents supplied by the test kit were dissolved in the 100 ml diluted samples afterwards the 100 ml mixed solution was transferred into the quanti tray 2000 and sealed by a quanti tray sealer the sealed quanti tray 2000 was subsequently incubated at 44 5 0 5 c and 100 rpm for 18 h the number of fecal coliform was attained based on the amount of positive yellow wells of the quanti tray 2000 and the most probable number mpn of fecal coliform can be checked from the idexx quanti tray 2000 mpn table http www idexx com au the method can provide 95 confidence limits comparable to the membrane filtration method 2 5 5 soluble protein and polysaccharide measurements the twas was first centrifuged in a 50 ml tube at 4000 g for 5 min and the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 mm zhang et al 2014 the protein concentration in the filtrate was analyzed with the bicinchoninic acid bca method with bovine serum albumin bsa as standard smith et al 1985 the polysaccharide concentration in the filtrate was measured with the anthrone method with glucose solution as standard raunkjaer et al 1994 2 5 6 other physico chemical properties zeta potential a surface characteristic of the sludge was analyzed using a zetasizer malvern nano zs90 uk particle size distribution psd of the sludge samples was measured using a particle size analyzer malvern mastersizer 2000 uk scanning electron microscopy sem jeol jsm 6610 america was employed to observe the morphology of sludge samples the color intensity of effluent from anaerobic digesters was recorded in platinum cobalt ptco units apha 2005 color standards ranging from 5 to 300 ptco units were prepared and the absorbance of each was measured with a spectrophotometer at 475 nm a calibration curve was constructed from the color standards and their corresponding absorbance values the sludge samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe filter and the filtrate was then measured with a spectrophotometer for its absorbance at a wavelength of 475 nm the absorbance was then converted to color units ptco using the calibration curve 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance of the anaerobic digesters fig 1 presents the methane production and vs destruction in the control and experimental anaerobic sludge digesters over the operational period and a summary of averaged methane production and vs destruction in the two systems at the two steady states in the baseline phase the two anaerobic systems reached similar performance after approximately 150 days operation as reflected by the stable and comparable methane production and vs destruction data in the experimental phase after inclusion of the fna pre treatment methane production and vs destruction in the experimental digester gradually exceeded that in the control digester between day 205 and 231 and then remained stable over the remaining period of the experimental phase methane production in the control and experimental ads in the baseline phase averaged 115 3 2 1 and 114 6 2 5 ml gvsadded fig 1c respectively with the vs destruction averaged 24 1 1 4 and 23 9 0 8 fig 1d respectively following the implementation of fna pre treatment in the experimental line biogas production in the experimental ad increased gradually to 157 2 2 5 ml gvsadded in the new steady state fig 1c 37 1 higher than that for the control ad which remained unchanged at 114 7 1 5 ml gvsadded similarly the vs destruction in the experimental ad also increased to 34 8 0 7 in the new steady state fig 1d with a relatively increase of 47 1 compared to the control ad 23 6 0 4 fna pre treatment significantly enhanced methane production with higher conversion of organic components to biogas this was likely because of the solubilization of vs during the fna pre treatment fig 2 which is consistent with previous laboratory studies wang et al 2013 wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 following the 24 h fna treatment the scod increased to 0 158 0 013 mg mgvs compared to the untreated twas at 0 019 0 001 mg mgvs fig 2a similarly skn increased from 0 001 0 0002 mg mgvs for the untreated twas to 0 018 0 0008 mg mgvs for the fna treated twas fig 2a the scod and skn release was likely due to cell lysis and or the solubilization of extracellular polymeric substances eps caused by fna treatment the soluble protein and soluble polysaccharide concentrations increased from 0 005 mg mgvs and 0 001 mg mgvs for untreated twas to 0 029 mg mgvs and 0 015 mg mgvs for the fna treated twas fig 2b further supporting cell lysis and eps solubilization the enhancement of sludge digestion by fna pre treatment is also supported the measurement of ammonium concentration and vs concentration in feed and effluent of the two ads see supporting information for details and fig s2 though the feed of the experimental digester was pre treated at ph 5 0 the ph in the control and experimental ads were comparable averaging 7 19 0 02 and 7 22 0 02 respectively which was in the favorable range for methanogens appels et al 2008 the residual nitrite concentration in the fna treated twas averaged 162 4 12 2 mgn l which was removed in the ad reactor due to nitrite reduction wang et al 2014 the alkalinity produced by nitrite reduction likely partially offset the acidity in the twas fed further the ammonium concentration in the experimental ad reactor was 22 higher than that in the control ad reactor fig s2 due to enhanced vs destruction which provided additional alkalinity to maintain the reactor ph at a neutral level despite of the acidic feed consistent with previous results obtained in lab scale studies duan et al 2018 wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 fna treatment reduced the mpn of fecal coliform in the twas however the anaerobic digester did not further reduce mpn of fecal coliform but increased the count see supporting information for details and fig s3 the results are different from that reported in wei et al 2018 where fna pre treatment reduced the fecal coliform both in twas and the digested sludge but are similar to the results reported in zhang et al 2019 it appears that pathogens inactivated during fna pre treatment were able to regrow in the anaerobic digester similarly riau et al 2010 also observed the recurrence of fecal coliforms in the temperature phased anaerobic digestion the fecal coliforms abundance decreased significantly by 4 logs in the first step thermophilic ad at an hrt of 5 or 15 days but increased in the second step mesophilic ad at an hrt of 15 days the mechanism of the regrowth is unclear at present and warrants further investigation it is possible that some viable pathogen cells could not grow in the 18 h test but are actually viable and managed to grow in the anaerobic digester in this case more optimal treatment conditions may be developed to more effectively inactivate pathogens furthermore the color of the ad liquor from the experimental reactor averaged 1667 27 mgptco l which was slightly 17 higher than that in the control ad liquor of 1433 27 mgptco l thp is known to produce an effluent with a high level dissolved nitrogen compounds leading to color problems with the thp operating temperature ranging from 140 c to 165 c the color of the ad liquor was in the range from 3800 to 8000 mgptco l dwyer et al 2008 while fna pretreatment has only a minor effect on the effluent color 3 2 viscosity the limiting viscosity and shear viscosity at 100 s 1 and 250 s 1 of twas fna treated twas and digested sludge from the two systems in the steady state of the experimental phase are summarized and compared in fig 3 fna pre treatment caused a significant reduction in the treated sludge viscosity compared to the un treated twas the limiting viscosity shear viscosity at 100 s 1 and 250 s 1 was reduced by 58 7 from 345 6 31 9 to 145 6 14 0 mpa s 51 8 from 813 1 106 5 to 398 3 39 2 mpa s and 49 7 from 387 5 40 1 to 198 4 21 3 mpa s respectively fig 3 the reduction in viscosity of the digested sludge was even higher the limiting viscosity and shear viscosity at 100 s 1 and 250 s 1 of the digested sludge from experimental system averaged 81 0 4 1 185 4 9 8 and 100 3 4 8 mpa s compared to the control system of 336 1 10 6 922 9 16 1 and 457 6 11 2 mpa s with the reduction of 76 4 80 4 and 78 4 respectively fig 3 fna pre treatment has been previously demonstrated to solubilize activated sludge wang et al 2013 wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 as is also confirmed in this study fig 2 this could have led to changes in the morphology of the sludge flocs leading to changed viscosity farno et al 2016 sem images provided further information on twas disintegration with fna treatment fig s4 it appears fna treatment ruptured the cell walls and destroyed the sludge surface which helped to release more extracellular and intracellular biopolymers from was flocs into the liquid phase reflected by the increase in soluble proteins and polysaccharides following fna treatment fig 2b furthermore the significant breakdown of macromolecules into small molecules in the soluble phase of twas or digested sludge after fna treatment has also been confirmed using molecular weight distribution analysis by gel permeation chromatography and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy zhang et al 2015 li et al 2020 particle size distribution of sludge samples was also measured in this study fig 4 as a key factor to evaluate the disintegration degree of twas kampas et al 2007 wang et al 2019 as summarized in fig 4 d10 d50 and d90 with dn representing particle size at the cumulative frequency of n of twas decreased substantially by 67 79 after fna treatment the particles sizes of the digested sludge from the experimental reactor were also slightly lower than those of the control ad for example d50 of the experimental sludge 59 0 2 μm was slightly lower than that of control sludge 65 1 μm n 15 p 0 05 also d90 of the experimental sludge averaged 148 1 μm which was lower than 157 2 μm of control sludge n 15 p 0 05 the particle size distribution data indeed indicate that fna pre treatment disintegrated sludge flocs which likely contributed to the reduced viscosity for treated twas and digested sludge the decrease of particle size was likely due to the breakdown of macromolecular organic matters in eps zhang et al 2018 which are considered to be an important factor in viscosity of activated sludge nagaoka et al 1996 the viscosity reduction for digested sludge was likely partially due to a lower solids concentration of the experimental ad sludge as a result of enhanced vs destruction figs 1b and d eshtiaghi et al 2013 to further confirm the mechanism of viscosity reduction for digested sludge with fna pre treatment the viscosities of the diluted control ad sludge to the same concentration as the experimental ad and the concentrated experimental ad sludge to the same concentration as the control ad were analyzed fig s5 as summarized in fig 5 a the limiting viscosity and shear viscosity at 100 s 1 and 250 s 1 of the diluted digested sludge from control system averaged 114 9 7 2 286 8 24 0 and 147 2 9 6 mpa s compared to these there were still 30 2 35 3 and 32 3 reductions in limiting viscosity shear viscosity at 100 s 1 and 250 s 1 for the digested sludge from the experimental system similarly when the experimental ad sludge was concentrated to the same solids concentration as the control ad sludge the limiting viscosity and shear viscosity at 100 s 1 and 250 s 1 were 244 8 16 7 690 6 49 3 and 334 9 20 4 mpa s fig 5b 27 3 25 3 and 27 2 respectively lower than the digested sludge from control system this suggests that fna pre treatment reduces the viscosity of the digested sludge not only through enhancing vs destruction thus leading to reduced viscosity due to reduced solids concentration but also through changing the inherent properties of the sludge fig s4 figs 4 and 5 the above results imply that with fna pretreatment the anaerobic digester can be operated at least at the same solids concentration as in the control system considering the higher vs destruction rate the feed sludge concentration can be at least 13 higher than that fed to the control ad see si for calculation details this would still yield a sludge viscosity that is 25 lower than that in the control ad the mixing energy consumption in a digester is reduced by reduction in viscosity tian et al 2014 and hence energy savings are also expected 3 3 dewateability and polymer consumption the dewaterability of the digested sludge in the two systems in both the baseline and experimental phases after both systems reached stable performance in each phase is compared in fig 6 there was no obvious difference in solids content of the dewatered cake between the two systems the dewatered solids content averaged 17 5 0 3 in the control system identical to that in the experimental system of 16 8 0 3 p 0 05 to further evaluate the dewaterability of the digested sludge the normalized cst which determines dewatering velocity and srf which determines sludge filterability were measured and compared in fig s6 with fna pre treatment the cst was 141 5 10 4 s l gts comparable to that of the control ad sludge at 136 0 13 1 s l gts p 0 05 the srf value increased from 7 4 2 4 1013 m kg of the control digested sludge to 14 6 2 1 1013 m kg of the experimental digested sludge the solids content cst and srf data collectively indicate that the fna pretreatment did not improve the dewaterability of the digested sludge and likely deteriorated it as shown by the increased srf value yu et al 2019 fig 6b shows the zeta potential values of the twas fna treated twas and digested sludges from the two systems the zeta potential of the twas averaged 23 2 0 3 mv but significantly increased to 15 5 0 2 mv after fna treatment consequently the zeta potential of the digested sludge in experimental ad averaged 25 0 0 7 mv slightly higher than that in control ad of 27 6 0 6 mv p 0 05 the similar zeta potential of the digested sludge from the two ads further indicated the fna pretreatment did not improve the dewaterability of the digested sludge xu et al 2018 the polymer consumption was 24 0 6 lower for the dewatering of the digested sludge with fna pre treatment at 0 50 0 02 g polmer l sludge compared to the control sludge at 0 66 0 02 g polmer l sludge fig 6a however the polymer consumption averaged 18 0 0 5 in both reactors in terms of kg active polymer per ton dried solids of digested sludge the polymer consumption for dewatering is related to the amount of sludge solids in the sludge samples yin et al 2004 with fna pre treatment a lower solids concentration was obtained in the experimental reactor fig s2d due to improved vs destruction fig 1 which is the reason for the lower consumption of polymers 4 conclusions effects of fna pre treatment on the efficiency of anaerobic digester and rheological properties of the digested sludge were investigated through long term pilot scale anaerobic digesters in this study the main conclusions are this study confirmed at a pilot scale that fna pre treatment of twas significantly enhanced methane production and vs destruction this was due to the increased solubilization of twas the fna pre treatment of twas significantly reduced the viscosity of anaerobic digested sludge with 76 4 80 4 and 78 4 reduction achieved for the limiting viscosity and shear viscosity at 100 s 1 and 250 s 1 the reduced viscosity would increase the capacity of anaerobic digester the polymer requirement for dewatering is reduced by 24 0 6 for the digested sludge with fna pre treatment

remove tc and otc than h2o2 ultraviolet uv and uv h2o2 at the same doses of oxidants inorganic anions and cations were shown to inhibit the degradation of tc and otc during the photo fenton process in the following order hpo4 2 hco3 so4 2 cl and cu2 ca2 na the tc and otc degradation are generally improved by increasing ph which is opposite to the kpcba obs values caused by increasing the deprotonation degree of tc and otc four and nine transformation products of tc and otc respectively were detected over the treatment period among the transformation products m z 443 14 c22h22n2o8 formed during tc degradation and m z 433 16 c20h20n2o9 and m z 415 15 c20h18n2o8 formed during otc degradation were reported for the first time vibrio fischeri toxicity assessment indicated that the inhibition ratio was decreased with a decreasing tc concentration while otc transformation lead to higher toxicity the product m z 477 15b was determined to be the compound causing toxicity during degradation of otc by using the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar this toxic transformation product caused higher inhibition ratios than its parental compound otc but its further oxidization resulted in decreasing the inhibition ratios graphical abstract image 1 keywords photo fenton process oxy tetracycline water quality parameters transformation products toxicity assessment qsar analysis 1 introduction antibiotics are one of the largest groups of pharmaceutical substances used worldwide for treating diseases in humans as well as for preventing diseases and promoting growth in livestock jeong et al 2010 tetracycline antibiotics tcs have received significant interest because they are broad spectrum antibiotics against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria and have been extensively used as antibacterial agents and veterinary medicine ge et al 2018 yamal turbay et al 2013 wang et al 2011 moreover most tcs are rarely adsorbed and most of them are excreted through urine and feces without being metabolized in the human body or livestock wammer et al 2011 sarmah et al 2006 therefore concentration of tcs have been detected worldwide in surface water sources ground waters sediments soils and even drinking water sources in tens to hundreds μg l 1 range rahmah et al 2011 klavarioti et al 2009 moreover concentration of tcs in livestock wastewater was reported as 2 mg l de godos et al 2012 the presence of tcs in water sources represents a threat to humans and ecosystems because of drug resistant bacteria development and their toxicity macauley et al 2006 pei et al 2007 thus it is very important to remove tcs from contaminated water before discharging it into the environment however it is difficult to remove tcs using conventional water treatment processes such as physico chemical or biological treatment due to their stable structure their tetracene ring and their antibiotic properties against bacteria batt et al 2007 watkinson et al 2007 advanced oxidation processes aops have been proposed as effective treatment methods for water decontamination because they can generate hydroxyl radicals ho which are non selective oxidants and exhibit a high oxidation potential of 2 72 v shah et al 2013 he et al 2014 ho present high second order rate constants in the 108 1010 m 1 s 1 range haag et al 1992 against organic substances and can form oh by removing an electron from organic substances mirzaei et al 2017 in the photo fenton process one molecule of h2o2 is decomposed into two molecules of ho by uv irradiation as shown in eq 1 baxendale et al 1957 also ho can be generated by the reaction of h2o2 and fe2 in fenton process and ho can be additionally generated in the photo fenton process through the reduction of fe3 to fe2 by uv irradiation eq 2 5 kušić et al 2006 1 h2o2 hν 2ho 2 fe2 h2o2 fe3 ho oh 3 fe3 h2o2 fe2 ho2 h 4 fe3 h2o hv fe2 ho h 5 fe3 h2o2 hv fe2 ho2 h despite this effective ho generation studies on the removal of tc and otc using the photo fenton process have been conducted using quite high concentrations of h2o2 50 100 mg l and fe2 2 5 mg l yamal turbay et al 2013 pereira et al 2014 michael et al 2019 lai et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 and these studies have mainly focus on determining the effect of uv wavelength yamal turbay et al 2013 or solar irradiation pereira et al 2014 michael et al 2019 on treatment efficiency iron based catalysts such as fe2o3 lin et al 2019 fe3o4 zhu et al 2019 tio2 fe3o4 yu et al 2019 and mnfe2o4 bio char composite lai et al 2019 have also been widely studied for heterogeneous photo fenton process but their effectiveness on treating tcs is still controversial owing to requiring long reaction time a high h2o2 concentration 340 3400 mg l and a catalyst dosage 100 500 mg l there is a lack of study on the photo fenton uv h2o2 fe2 process conducted at low concentrations of h2o2 and fe2 which would lead to more a promising treatment approach concerns about incomplete mineralization of contaminants during aops including detoxification upon tc and otc has been growing over the past years khan et al 2010 lópez peñalver et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 gómez ocheco et al 2012 thus investigating degradation pathways of tc and otc and evaluating toxicity of their transformation products are gaining more attention lópez peñalver et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 and gómez ocheco et al 2012 reported that inhibition of vibrio fischeri v fischeri increased at the beginning of uv h2o2 process for treating otc and tc in addition hou et al 2016 observed that a maximum daphnia magna immobilization 100 was reached after treating tc for 60 min using an ultrasound assisted fenton like process although few previous studies identified transformation products of tc or otc by h2o2 chen et al 2017 uv h2o2 liu et al 2016 yuan et al 2011 and heterogeneous photo fenton lai et al 2019 process to the best of our knowledge there is no study of comparing identified transformation products of tc and otc and evaluating their possible toxicity based on both microbial toxicity assessment and quantitative structure activity relationship qsar analysis during the photo fenton process uv h2o2 fe2 microbial toxicity assessment is a well known and simple method to monitor toxicity during treatment however to determine which transformation product in a complex mixture is more toxic than the others qsar analysis provides a way to predict ecotoxicological potential of each identified transformation products through correlating molecular structure to biological toxicity wang et al 2018 this method provides information complementary to the microbial toxicity assessment therefore the objectives of this research were 1 to determine low fenton reagent concentrations suitable for the degradation of tc and otc 2 to compare the degradation of tc and otc using the h2o2 uv uv h2o2 and photo fenton uv h2o2 fe2 processes 3 to investigate the effects of several inorganic anions cl hco3 so4 2 and hpo4 2 cations na ca2 and cu2 and the initial ph 3 1 8 5 on the degradation of tc and otc using the photo fenton process 4 to identify the transformation products of tc and otc and 5 to assess toxicities of the transformation products of tc and otc using v fischeri and qsar analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials tetracycline c22h24n2o8 mw 444

with this analytical method the limit of detection was 0 05 μg l for tc and otc 2 3 photochemical reactor and photo fenton process the uv system used for the photochemical experiments were equipped with five 4 w low pressure hg uv lamps puritec hns g5 osram munich germany of 254 nm wavelength and a magnetic stirrer topolino ika germany as shown in fig s1 the uv fluence was calculated to be 0 84 mw cm2 using the ki kio3 actinometer method rahn et al 2003 qiang et al 2015 all the experiments were conducted in quadruplicate using 40 ml quartz reactor for efficient uv absorbance for 60 min the time zero of the photo fenton process was defined after the addition of h2o2 when the reactor containing the tc or otc solution was placed under the uv light the higher initial concentrations 100 mg l of each tc and otc than in real water were used in this study to facilitate the detection of the transformation products the concentration of h2o2 was varied from 20 to 30 and 50 mg l for the uv h2o2 process concentrations of 1 2 5 and 10 mg l of fe2 combined with 20 mg l of h2o2 were used during the photo fenton process at ph range of 5 5 5 6 to evaluate the effect of the fenton reagent

mg l of fe2 when required in the process for 60 min to monitor tc or otc concentration 1 ml of the samples were collected from the reactor at each selected reaction time 1 60 min the whole volume 40 ml at each reaction time was used for analysis of total organic carbon toc concentration h2o2 concentration and ph toc concentration was analyzed with toc l analyzer shimadzu japan to determine mineralization of tc and otc the initial toc concentrations corresponding to the initial concentration of tc initial conc 100 mg l or otc initial conc 100 mg l were 57 7 mg l or 57 2 mg l respectively the concentration of h2o2 was measured for the photo fenton process using sodium thiosulfate titrant method with hydrogen peroxide test kit model hyp 1 hach loveland co usa the ph was measured using a ph benchtop meter orion star a211 thermo scientific waltham ma usa 2 4 effects of competing anions cations and initial solution ph to gain a better understanding of the effects of inorganic anions cations and ph on the degradation of tc and otc during the photo fenton process several inorganic anions cl hco3 so4 2 and hpo4 2 cations na ca2 and cu2 and different initial ph 3 1 8 5 were used while maintain an average uv fluence of 0 84 mw cm2 the sample time and initial concentrations of tc and otc 100 mg l were the same as above 10 mm of each anions and cations cl hco3 so4 2 hpo4 2 na ca2 and cu2 were added to the water as competing ions and ph of these solutions were not additionally adjusted the initial ph of the solutions varied according to specific ions however in this ph range the speciation of each anions and cations were the same for both tc and otc solutions which calculated by visual minteq 3 1 software to verify the effect of the ph initial ph was adjusted to 3 1 4 1 5 5 7 5 and 8 5 using 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh solutions which were shown to have insignificant effects on degradation when investigating competing ions the generation rates of ho during the photo fenton process were investigated at each ph by calculating the observed rate constant of pcba kpcba obs as following equation 6 l n p c b a 0 p c b a t k p c b a o b s t where kpcba obs is the observed rate constant of pcba min 1 p c b a 0 is initial concentration of pcba 20 mg l p c b a t is the concentration of pcba at time t and t is the reaction time min 2 5 identification of the transformation products of tc and otc deionized water for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms grade sigma aldrich st louis mo usa and tc or otc solutions of 200 μm initial concentration were used the transformation products of tc and otc were analyzed using an acquity uplc combined with electrospray ionization and quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer uplc esi qtof ms synapt g2 waters milford ma usa at different reaction times 1 120 min for the photo fenton process 20 mg l of h2o2 and 5 mg l of fe2 water acquity beh c18 1 7 μm 2 1 100 mm waters milford ma usa column was used

handled by masslynx v4 1 software waters milford ma 2 6 toxicity assessment the toxicities of tc otc and their transformation products before and after photo fenton reaction were assessed by measuring the inhibition ratio of the bioluminescence of v fischeri for assessing the toxicity of v fischeri biotox watertox standard kit ebpi mississauga on canada was used samples were obtained by treating solutions containing 200 μm of either tc or otc with 20 mg l of h2o2 and 5 mg l of fe2 for the photo fenton process samples were collected after 1 5 10 20 30 and 60 min of reaction time and the ph of all samples were adjusted to ph 7 5 using 0 1 m naoh prior to testing with v fischeri the bioluminescence of the samples was measured after 15 min of exposure at 15 c using a victor3 multiple plate reader perkinelmer waltham ma usa with a 535 40 emission filter the bioluminescence inhibition ratio was calculated using eq 7 7 b i o l u m i n e s c e n c e i n h i b i t i o n r a t i o l b l a n k l s a m p l e l b l a n k 100 where lblank and lsample are the bioluminescence signals after 15 min of exposure for the sample without tcs and tested samples respectively furthermore qsar analysis was conducted to assess the ecotoxicological potential of the identified tc otc and their transformation products from the photo fenton process by using the ecosar program of the epiwin software sui et al 2017 the lethal concentration 50 lc50 values for fish 96 h and daphnia 48 h and the half maximal effective concentration ec50 for green algae 96 h were provided by the qsar analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of fenton reagent concentration as shown in fig 1 tc and otc were degraded by 28 3 and 13 0 respectively after 60 min of exposure to h2o2 only under uv irradiation alone the degradation efficiencies of tc and otc were 6 5 and 19 2 after 60 min of direct photolysis respectively while 41 4 of tc and 43 5 of otc were degraded in presence of uv and 20 mg l of h2o2 for 60 min fig 1a and b tc and otc were more efficiently degraded in uv h2o2 process than uv process because of ho generated by the decomposition of h2o2 under uv irradiation similarly kim et al 2009 determined that the k values of tc increased more than 3 4 times when using uv h2o2 h2o2 conc 8 2 mg l rather than uv only during the uv h2o2 process the degradation efficiencies of tc and otc were increased from 41 4 to 54 7 and from 43 5 to 59 9 respectively by increasing the h2o2 concentration from 20 to 50 mg l for 60 min fig 1a and b these results suggest that the additional h2o2 50 mg l did not generate significantly more ho under the conditions tested uv irradiation leading to only a slight increase in the tc and otc degradation efficiency to verify the effect of fe2 for the photo fenton process the concentration of fe2 was varied from 1 to 10 mg l with 20 mg l of h2o2 the photo fenton reaction generally occurs very fast at the beginning of the process because the ho are rapidly generated by the reaction of fe2 and h2o2 under uv irradiation mirzaei et al 2017 likewise the degradation of tc and otc occurred very fast within 1 min but slowly thereafter then kobs could not be calculated the highest degradation efficiency was 97 1 for both tc and otc during the photo fenton process with 20 mg l of h2o2 and 10 mg l of fe2 after 60 min fig 1c and d however high degradation efficiencies of 94 2 and 94 8 were also achieved for tc and otc respectively when using only 5 mg l of fe2 during the photo fenton process with 5 mg l of fe2 the concentration of h2o2 continued to decrease during the reaction time from 20 mg l to 12 5 mg l and 3 5 mg l for 10 and 30 min respectively suggesting that enough fe2 was present in the solution to maintain the reaction in addition a relatively large amount of iron oxides were precipitated when adding 10 mg l of fe2 to the reaction mixture as previously reported by karatas et al 2012 suggesting that such a high concentration is not required an amount of 5 mg l of fe2 was thus deemed sufficient and for the remaining experiments the photo fenton process was conducted with the fenton reagent concentrations of 20 mg l of h2o2 and 5 mg l of fe2 3 2 comparison of the tc and otc degradation using various oxidation processes the degradation efficiencies of tc and otc using h2o2 uv uv h2o2 and the photo fenton processes were compared for 30 min as shown in fig 2 the degradation efficiencies of each tc and otc using h2o2 for 30 min were 27 9 and 12 7 respectively fig 2a as an oxidant h2o2 partly degraded tc and otc by its oxidation potential as 1 80 v chen et al 2017 using the uv process 11 7 of otc was degraded which was 7 4 higher than the amount of tc degraded for 30 min fig 2a this result was attributed by the much high molar extinction coefficient of otc at 254 nm 19 799 m 1 cm 1 than that of tc 4108 m 1 cm 1 kim et al 2009 during uv h2o2 process for 30 min the degradation efficiencies of tc and otc were 34 2 and 34 4 respectively when using the photo fenton process efficiencies higher than for h2o2 uv and uv h2o2 processes fig 2a were observed for both tc and otc with removals of 82 1 and 82 5 after 5 min and 91 3 and 92 4 after 30 min respectively these results also indicate that the photo fenton process was more efficient at removing tcs than other uv assisted catalyst reactions reported in literature yu et al 2019 and zhu et al 2019 showed 38 and 45 of tc degradation for 5min respectively when using tio2 fe3o4 and fe3o4 nanoparticles as a catalyst for heterogeneous photo fenton process dose of catalyst 300 mg l h2o2 concentration 340 mg l lai et al 2019 used 100 mg l of mnfe2o4 biochar composite and reported 50 degradation of tc for 30 min with 3400 mg l of h2o2 under uv irradiation during the photo fenton process 82 5 and 97 5 of h2o2 was consumed after 30 min and 60 min reaction fig 2b although h2o2 is steadily consumed during the photo fenton process the complete removal of tc and otc were not reached because of very high initial concentration of tc and otc 100 mg l about 10 of toc mineralization were observed for 60 min of the photo fenton process despite the high degradation efficiency of tc 94 6 and otc 95 0 this indicates a low mineralization of tc and otc and the formation of transformation products which were persistent and not sensitive to degradation during the photo fenton process further discussion of transformation products of tc and otc is provided in section 3 5 to perform experiments at concentrations of tc and otc equivalent to levels expected in real pharmaceutical and livestock wastewaters two initial concentrations 1 and 10 mg l of tc and otc were used li et al 2004 de godos et al 2012 results fig 3 a and b at an initial concentration of 10 mg l indicate that 90 of tc and otc degradation was achieved after 1 min as for the initial concentration of 1 mg l almost complete removal over 99 was achieved after 5 min for both compounds therefore the photo fenton process is an effective way to remove both tc and otc present in the range of concentrations found in real contaminated wastewater 3 3 effect of inorganic anions and cations cl hco3 so4 2 hpo4 2 na ca2 and cu2 inorganic anions can inhibit the generation of ho during the photo fenton process via complexing with ferrous ion or scavenging hassanshahi et al 2018 as can be seen in fig 3c and d when coexisting with 10 mm of each cl so4 2 hco3 or hpo4 2 the degradation efficiencies of tc for 60 min were 94 8 94 8 89 6 and 85 2 respectively and those of otc were 95 2 95 1 75 2 and 72 1 respectively relatively small inhibition effects were observed for so4 2 because so4 2 has low reactivity with ho gao et al 2009 10 mm of cl was considered to have insignificant inhibition effects on the degradation of tc and otc in this study because cl can react with ho to form cloh and can rapidly regenerate ho near neutral ph values liu et al 2016 other studies reported no inhibition effects on the degradation of otc using uv h2o2 liu et al 2016 and solar photo fenton pereira et al 2014 process competing with low concentration of cl 17 mm and so4 2 4 mm however hpo4 2 greatly inhibited the degradation of tc and otc to a greater extent than hco3 because hco3 could generate co3 oxidation potential 1 78 v cope et al 1973 by reacting with ho whereas hpo4 2 is not only ho scavenger but also react with ferrous iron to form insoluble iron phosphate complexes which greatly inhibit the fenton reaction gutiérrez zapata et al 2017 as for the inorganic cations na and ca2 had little inhibition effect on the degradation of tc and otc in the photo fenton process for 60 min fig 3e and f however the degradation of both tc and otc was greatly inhibited by 10 mm of cu2 from the beginning of the reaction after 60 min the degradation efficiencies of tc and otc with 10 mm of cu2 were decreased to 79 31 and 80 83 respectively compare to 94 2 and 94 8 without cu2 although liu et al 2016 reported that slight amount of cu2 1 μm could enhance the otc degradation during uv h2o2 process due to cu2 catalyzed fenton like process cu2 has a lower catalytic activity to convert h2o2 into reactive oxidants than fe2 sutton and winterbourn 1989 lee et al 2014 thus competing with high concentration of cu2 resulted in low degradation efficiency of tc and otc during the photo fenton process using low concentration of fe2 therefore the degradation efficiencies of both tc and otc greatly decreased by the presence of hpo4 2 hco3 and cu2 during the photo fenton process since these ions acted as ho scavengers and competitors and inhibition of each anion and cation was the following order hpo4 2 hco3 so4 2 cl and cu2 ca2 na 3 4 effect of initial ph as illustrated in fig 4 a and b the ph range was set from 3 1 to 8 5 to investigate the influence of the initial ph on the degradation of each tc and otc during the photo fenton process degradation of tc was generally increased by increasing ph while the highest degradation efficiency of otc was achieved at ph 5 5 the initial ph is known to be the most important factor affecting the photo fenton process considering that photo fenton reaction ho generation is generally enhanced under acidic condition because the high reactive fe2 ions are dominant under these conditions jain et al 2018 in previous studies the degradation efficiencies of other antibiotics including amoxicillin elmolla et al 2009 cloxacillin elmolla et al 2009 and ampicillin elmolla et al 2009 rozas et al 2010 were steadily increased by decreasing ph attributed to high ho generation as shown in fig 4c as ph decreased from 8 5 to 3 1 the kpcba obs increased from 2 5 10 2 min 1 to 4 4 10 2 min 1 however unlike the degradation of pcba the degradation of tc and otc was inhibited at ph 3 1 also tc was the most degraded at ph 8 5 while the degradation of otc was the most inhibited fig 4a and b it should be noted that enhancement in their degradation rate at higher ph can be affected by increasing photolysis rate at uv λ 254 nm and reaction rate constant with ho by increasing the deprotonation degree of tc and otc more than generated ho amount there are many dissociated forms of tc tch3 tch2 0 tch tc2 and otc h3otc h2otc hotc otc2 at ph range of 3 1 8 5 which exhibit distinct physicochemical properties at ph 3 1 tc was protonated to be tch3 which became low reactive molecule mohammed ali 2012 causing less susceptible to ho attack with the increase of ph the degree of deprotonation increases by tch2 0 tch and tc2 which results in the increasing photolysis rate ge et al found that tc2 is the fastest degradable form for the photolysis followed by tch and tch2 0 ge et al 2018 moreover tch 105 78 109 m 1 s 1 and tc2 35 29 109 m 1 s 1 are highly reactive toward ho than tch2 0 6 37 109 m 1 s 1 ge et al 2018 similarly uv photolysis of otc was the highest when deprotonated as otc2 followed by hotc h2otc and h3otc under ph 3 11 by the increasing molar absorptivity at 254 nm liu et al 2015 also the reactivity toward ho is higher in the order otc2 hotc h2otc h3otc liu et al 2015 in spite of strong ho scavengers such as hydroxide anion oh and hydroperoxide anion ho2 are majorly present buxton et al 1988 christensen et al 1982 the highest degradation of tc was achieved at ph 8 5 due to the most highly reactive tch however degradation of otc was significantly inhibited at the beginning of the reaction by the fact that the relatively slight increase of ho reactivity among otc dissociated forms might not fully overcome competing effect toward ho as a results although the pseudo first rate constant values of pcba were about 57 4 decreasing by increasing ph from 3 1 to 8 5 deprotonated tc tch and otc h2otc and hotc can enhance their degradation efficiencies via highly photolysis and reactive toward ho therefore ph 5 5 might be effective to degrade tc and otc using the photo fenton process 3 5 identification of transformation products of tc and otc the transformation products of tc m z 461 15 459 14 443 14 and 413 13 and otc m z 477 15a b two products 475 14 459 14 449 15 447 14 433 16a b two products and 415 15 were identified for the photo fenton process table s1 the structural difference between tc and otc is that tc has a hydrogen molecule on c5 where otc has an hydroxyl group leading to slightly different pka values pka1 3 3 pka2 7 7 and pka3 9 7 for tc and pka1 3 57 pka2 7 49 and pka3 9 44 for otc ge et al 2018 cheng et al 2013 both tc and otc degradation was initiated at the c11a c12 double bond site however further degradation followed different pathways during the photo fenton reaction as indicated in fig 5 a the m z 461 15 transformation product from the degradation of tc was assumed to be the primary transformation product at the beginning of the photo fenton process since the c11a c12 double bond of tc was a susceptible site for the ho attack wang et al 2011 also found that m z 461 was attacked by free ozone or ho during the ozonation of tc the dehydration of c6 c5a of m z 461 product was first observed m z 443 14 in the present study the molar mass of the m z 459 15 transformation product was 14 da higher than that of the parent tc this is attributed to the formation of an aldehyde group hc o also the m z 413 13 transformation product was formed by the dehydration of c6 c5a and demethylation the transformation products of otc were more varied than those of tc which included products from hydroxylation decarbonylation demethylation secondary alcohol oxidation and dehydaration fig 5b the hydroxylation products m z 477 15 were generated by adding hydroxyl groups to the aromatic ring m z 477 15a and c11a c12 double bond of otc m z 477 15b hydrogen abstraction at c5 formed the m z 459 14 product and m z 475 14 was formed by combining hydroxyl addition to the aromatic ring with hydrogen abstraction the m z 433 16a transformation product was engaged in a loss of c0 at c1 then m z 449 15 was formed by further hydroxyl addition to aromatic ring demethylation was involved in the abstraction of one methyl group m z 447 14 and two methyl groups m z 433 16b of dimethylammonium group at c4 also dehydration at c3 generated m z 415 15 similarly liu et al 2016 reported five degradation pathways for otc using the uv h2o2 process and same seven transformation products m z 477 15a b 475 14 459 14 449 15 447 14 and 433 16 were observed in present study however the m z 433 16 c20h20n2o9 and 415 15 c20h18n2o8 transformation products from otc of the photo fenton process were observed for the first time in the present study 3 6 toxicity of tc and otc transformation products the ec50 15min of tc and otc against v fischeri were calculated to be 104 μm tong et al 2015 and 152 μm yuan et al 2011 when 200 μm of tc and otc were used as the initial concentration in previous toxicity assessments the toxicities for v fischeri of tc otc and their transformation products were investigated during the photo fenton process fig 6 the inhibition ratio of tc was the highest 62 8 for the control sample tc 200 μm then gradually decreased by increasing the reaction time of the photo fenton process fig 6a this result indicated that the toxicity for v fischeri was attributed to the decreasing tc concentration and the transformation products of tc becoming less toxic than tc itself after 60 min of the photo fenton process the inhibition ratio of tc and its transformation products for v fischeri was 13 7 on the other hand the inhibition ratio of otc 200 μm for v fischeri was initially 42 9 and the inhibition ratios of otc and its transformation products increased to over 90 during the photo fenton process 1 30 min although the otc concentration steadily decreased fig 6b this suggests that otc was transformed into products more toxic for v fischeri during the photo fenton reaction even after a very short reaction time of 1 min table 1 shows the predicted toxicity values of otc and the transformation products m z 415 15 459 14 475 14 and 477 15b which were detected in all samples using the ecosar program three transformation products m z 415 15 459 14 and 475 14 presented significantly lower acute toxicity for all fish daphnia and green algae while m z 477 15b is predicted to have a significantly higher acute toxicity for fish and green algae than otc this can explain why the lower toxicity to v fischeri observed after 60 min considering that the amount of m z 477 15b was then decreased fig 6c similarly wang et al 2018 reported that v fischeri inhibition was the highest after 10 min 55 of electrochemical oxidation over a ti ti4o7 anode due to the formation of more toxic transformation products of tc with m z 461 432 and 477 examined by qsar analysis these results demonstrate the importance of monitoring transformation products and their toxicity when using the photo fenton process to ensure that sufficient time and oxidant doses are applied to further degrade toxic transformation products that might be formed 4 conclusions in the present study the degradation mechanism of tc and otc during the photo fenton process was investigated including the effects of fenton reagent concentrations anions cations and ph as well as the nature of the transformation products of tc and otc formed and their toxicity evaluated by v fischeri inhibition and qsar analysis in the range of conditions investigated the degradation efficiencies of tc and otc were increased by increasing fe2 and h2o2 concentrations otc was more sensitive to uv irradiation than tc while the degradation of tc by ho is higher than that of otc the photo fenton process was the most effective way to remove tc and otc when compare to h2o2 uv and uv h2o2 process there was a little impact on the degradation of tc and otc due to the presence of cl so4 2 na or ca2 but some significant inhibition was observed with hpo4 2 hco3 and cu2 a few of transformation products of tc and otc during photo fenton process were newly identified in the present study all observed transformation products of tc exhibited lower v fischeri toxicity than that of tc however at the beginning of the photo fenton process otc transformed into transformation product more toxic to v fischeri then further oxidized to non toxic transformation products therefore without ph adjustment and at low concentrations of fenton reagent the photo fenton process was efficient at removing tc and can be efficiently apply to the treatment of otc as long as the process is operated under conditions allowing the further degradation of the toxic transformation products declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

18162,advanced oxidation processes have gained significant attention for treating tetracycline tc and oxytetracycline otc however their oxidation using the photo fenton process has not been sufficiently studied although degradations of tc and otc were enhanced by increasing h2o2 and fe2 within the ranges investigated h2o2 20 50 mg l and fe 1 10 mg l under uv irradiation further experiments for the photo fenton process were conducted with 20 mg l of h2o2 and 5 mg l of fe2 to balance efficiency and cost the photo fenton process uv h2o2 fe2 was shown to be more effective to remove tc and otc than h2o2 ultraviolet uv and uv h2o2 at the same doses of oxidants inorganic anions and cations were shown to inhibit the degradation of tc and otc during the photo fenton process in the following order hpo4 2 hco3 so4 2 cl and cu2 ca2 na the tc and otc degradation are generally improved by increasing ph which is opposite to the kpcba obs values caused by increasing the deprotonation degree of tc and otc four and nine transformation products of tc and otc respectively were detected over the treatment period among the transformation products m z 443 14 c22h22n2o8 formed during tc degradation and m z 433 16 c20h20n2o9 and m z 415 15 c20h18n2o8 formed during otc degradation were reported for the first time vibrio fischeri toxicity assessment indicated that the inhibition ratio was decreased with a decreasing tc concentration while otc transformation lead to higher toxicity the product m z 477 15b was determined to be the compound causing toxicity during degradation of otc by using the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar this toxic transformation product caused higher inhibition ratios than its parental compound otc but its further oxidization resulted in decreasing the inhibition ratios graphical abstract image 1 keywords photo fenton process oxy tetracycline water quality parameters transformation products toxicity assessment qsar analysis 1 introduction antibiotics are one of the largest groups of pharmaceutical substances used worldwide for treating diseases in humans as well as for preventing diseases and promoting growth in livestock jeong et al 2010 tetracycline antibiotics tcs have received significant interest because they are broad spectrum antibiotics against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria and have been extensively used as antibacterial agents and veterinary medicine ge et al 2018 yamal turbay et al 2013 wang et al 2011 moreover most tcs are rarely adsorbed and most of them are excreted through urine and feces without being metabolized in the human body or livestock wammer et al 2011 sarmah et al 2006 therefore concentration of tcs have been detected worldwide in surface water sources ground waters sediments soils and even drinking water sources in tens to hundreds μg l 1 range rahmah et al 2011 klavarioti et al 2009 moreover concentration of tcs in livestock wastewater was reported as 2 mg l de godos et al 2012 the presence of tcs in water sources represents a threat to humans and ecosystems because of drug resistant bacteria development and their toxicity macauley et al 2006 pei et al 2007 thus it is very important to remove tcs from contaminated water before discharging it into the environment however it is difficult to remove tcs using conventional water treatment processes such as physico chemical or biological treatment due to their stable structure their tetracene ring and their antibiotic properties against bacteria batt et al 2007 watkinson et al 2007 advanced oxidation processes aops have been proposed as effective treatment methods for water decontamination because they can generate hydroxyl radicals ho which are non selective oxidants and exhibit a high oxidation potential of 2 72 v shah et al 2013 he et al 2014 ho present high second order rate constants in the 108 1010 m 1 s 1 range haag et al 1992 against organic substances and can form oh by removing an electron from organic substances mirzaei et al 2017 in the photo fenton process one molecule of h2o2 is decomposed into two molecules of ho by uv irradiation as shown in eq 1 baxendale et al 1957 also ho can be generated by the reaction of h2o2 and fe2 in fenton process and ho can be additionally generated in the photo fenton process through the reduction of fe3 to fe2 by uv irradiation eq 2 5 kušić et al 2006 1 h2o2 hν 2ho 2 fe2 h2o2 fe3 ho oh 3 fe3 h2o2 fe2 ho2 h 4 fe3 h2o hv fe2 ho h 5 fe3 h2o2 hv fe2 ho2 h despite this effective ho generation studies on the removal of tc and otc using the photo fenton process have been conducted using quite high concentrations of h2o2 50 100 mg l and fe2 2 5 mg l yamal turbay et al 2013 pereira et al 2014 michael et al 2019 lai et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 and these studies have mainly focus on determining the effect of uv wavelength yamal turbay et al 2013 or solar irradiation pereira et al 2014 michael et al 2019 on treatment efficiency iron based catalysts such as fe2o3 lin et al 2019 fe3o4 zhu et al 2019 tio2 fe3o4 yu et al 2019 and mnfe2o4 bio char composite lai et al 2019 have also been widely studied for heterogeneous photo fenton process but their effectiveness on treating tcs is still controversial owing to requiring long reaction time a high h2o2 concentration 340 3400 mg l and a catalyst dosage 100 500 mg l there is a lack of study on the photo fenton uv h2o2 fe2 process conducted at low concentrations of h2o2 and fe2 which would lead to more a promising treatment approach concerns about incomplete mineralization of contaminants during aops including detoxification upon tc and otc has been growing over the past years khan et al 2010 lópez peñalver et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 gómez ocheco et al 2012 thus investigating degradation pathways of tc and otc and evaluating toxicity of their transformation products are gaining more attention lópez peñalver et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 and gómez ocheco et al 2012 reported that inhibition of vibrio fischeri v fischeri increased at the beginning of uv h2o2 process for treating otc and tc in addition hou et al 2016 observed that a maximum daphnia magna immobilization 100 was reached after treating tc for 60 min using an ultrasound assisted fenton like process although few previous studies identified transformation products of tc or otc by h2o2 chen et al 2017 uv h2o2 liu et al 2016 yuan et al 2011 and heterogeneous photo fenton lai et al 2019 process to the best of our knowledge there is no study of comparing identified transformation products of tc and otc and evaluating their possible toxicity based on both microbial toxicity assessment and quantitative structure activity relationship qsar analysis during the photo fenton process uv h2o2 fe2 microbial toxicity assessment is a well known and simple method to monitor toxicity during treatment however to determine which transformation product in a complex mixture is more toxic than the others qsar analysis provides a way to predict ecotoxicological potential of each identified transformation products through correlating molecular structure to biological toxicity wang et al 2018 this method provides information complementary to the microbial toxicity assessment therefore the objectives of this research were 1 to determine low fenton reagent concentrations suitable for the degradation of tc and otc 2 to compare the degradation of tc and otc using the h2o2 uv uv h2o2 and photo fenton uv h2o2 fe2 processes 3 to investigate the effects of several inorganic anions cl hco3 so4 2 and hpo4 2 cations na ca2 and cu2 and the initial ph 3 1 8 5 on the degradation of tc and otc using the photo fenton process 4 to identify the transformation products of tc and otc and 5 to assess toxicities of the transformation products of tc and otc using v fischeri and qsar analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials tetracycline c22h24n2o8 mw 444

with this analytical method the limit of detection was 0 05 μg l for tc and otc 2 3 photochemical reactor and photo fenton process the uv system used for the photochemical experiments were equipped with five 4 w low pressure hg uv lamps puritec hns g5 osram munich germany of 254 nm wavelength and a magnetic stirrer topolino ika germany as shown in fig s1 the uv fluence was calculated to be 0 84 mw cm2 using the ki kio3 actinometer method rahn et al 2003 qiang et al 2015 all the experiments were conducted in quadruplicate using 40 ml quartz reactor for efficient uv absorbance for 60 min the time zero of the photo fenton process was defined after the addition of h2o2 when the reactor containing the tc or otc solution was placed under the uv light the higher initial concentrations 100 mg l of each tc and otc than in real water were used in this study to facilitate the detection of the transformation products the concentration of h2o2 was varied from 20 to 30 and 50 mg l for the uv h2o2 process concentrations of 1 2 5 and 10 mg l of fe2 combined with 20 mg l of h2o2 were used during the photo fenton process at ph range of 5 5 5 6 to evaluate the effect of the fenton reagent concentration on degradation to compare the degradation of tc and otc using various oxidation processes h2o2 uv uv h2o2 and photo fenton uv h2o2 fe2 processes were performed with 20 mg l of h2o2 and 5 mg l of fe2 when required in the process for 60 min to monitor tc or otc concentration 1 ml of the samples were collected from the reactor at each selected reaction time 1 60 min the whole volume 40 ml at each reaction time was used for analysis of total organic carbon toc concentration h2o2 concentration and ph toc concentration was analyzed with toc l analyzer shimadzu japan to determine mineralization of tc and otc the initial toc concentrations corresponding to the initial concentration of tc initial conc 100 mg l or otc initial conc 100 mg l were 57 7 mg l or 57 2 mg l respectively the concentration of h2o2 was measured for the photo fenton process using sodium thiosulfate titrant method with hydrogen peroxide test kit model hyp 1 hach loveland co usa the ph was measured using a ph benchtop meter orion star a211 thermo scientific waltham ma usa 2 4 effects of competing anions cations and initial solution ph to gain a better understanding of the effects of inorganic anions cations and ph on the degradation of tc and otc during the photo fenton process several inorganic anions cl hco3 so4 2 and hpo4 2 cations na ca2 and cu2 and different initial ph 3 1 8 5 were used while maintain an average uv fluence of 0 84 mw cm2 the sample time and initial concentrations of tc and otc 100 mg l were the same as above 10 mm of each anions and cations cl hco3 so4 2 hpo4 2 na ca2 and cu2 were added to the water as competing ions and ph of these solutions were not additionally adjusted the initial ph of the solutions varied according to specific ions however in this ph range the speciation of each anions and cations were the same for both tc and otc solutions which calculated by visual minteq 3 1 software to verify the effect of the ph initial ph was adjusted to 3 1 4 1 5 5 7 5 and 8 5 using 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh solutions which were shown to have insignificant effects on degradation when investigating competing ions the generation rates of ho during the photo fenton process were investigated at each ph by calculating the observed rate constant of pcba kpcba obs as following equation 6 l n p c b a 0 p c b a t k p c b a o b s t where kpcba obs is the observed rate constant of pcba min 1 p c b a 0 is initial concentration of pcba 20 mg l p c b a t is the concentration of pcba at time t and t is the reaction time min 2 5 identification of the transformation products of tc and otc deionized water for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms grade sigma aldrich st louis mo usa and tc or otc solutions of 200 μm initial concentration were used the transformation products of tc and otc were analyzed using an acquity uplc combined with electrospray ionization and quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer uplc esi qtof ms synapt g2 waters milford ma usa at different reaction times 1 120 min for the photo fenton process 20 mg l of h2o2 and 5 mg l of fe2 water acquity beh c18 1 7 μm 2 1 100 mm waters milford ma usa column was used and the temperature was set at 40 c the mobile phase consisted of a 0 1 formic acid fa in h2o and b 0 1 fa in acn with a gradient of 3 b which was increased to 100 in 10 min was maintained for 0 5 min and then decreased back to 3 b in the next 1 5 min the flow rate and sample injection volume were 0 4 ml min and 5 μl respectively the mass spectrometric analysis m z 50 1400 were conducted using electrospray ionization esi source in positive mode with source temperature of 120 c desolvation temperature of 550 c desolvation gas flow of 900 l h and capillary of 2 0 kv data acquisition was handled by masslynx v4 1 software waters milford ma 2 6 toxicity assessment the toxicities of tc otc and their transformation products before and after photo fenton reaction were assessed by measuring the inhibition ratio of the bioluminescence of v fischeri for assessing the toxicity of v fischeri biotox watertox standard kit ebpi mississauga on canada was used samples were obtained by treating solutions containing 200 μm of either tc or otc with 20 mg l of h2o2 and 5 mg l of fe2 for the photo fenton process samples were collected after 1 5 10 20 30 and 60 min of reaction time and the ph of all samples were adjusted to ph 7 5 using 0 1 m naoh prior to testing with v fischeri the bioluminescence of the samples was measured after 15 min of exposure at 15 c using a victor3 multiple plate reader perkinelmer waltham ma usa with a 535 40 emission filter the bioluminescence inhibition ratio was calculated using eq 7 7 b i o l u m i n e s c e n c e i n h i b i t i o n r a t i o l b l a n k l s a m p l e l b l a n k 100 where lblank and lsample are the bioluminescence signals after 15 min of exposure for the sample without tcs and tested samples respectively furthermore qsar analysis was conducted to assess the ecotoxicological potential of the identified tc otc and their transformation products from the photo fenton process by using the ecosar program of the epiwin software sui et al 2017 the lethal concentration 50 lc50 values for fish 96 h and daphnia 48 h and the half maximal effective concentration ec50 for green algae 96 h were provided by the qsar analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of fenton reagent concentration as shown in fig 1 tc and otc were degraded by 28 3 and 13 0 respectively after 60 min of exposure to h2o2 only under uv irradiation alone the degradation efficiencies of tc and otc were 6 5 and 19 2 after 60 min of direct photolysis respectively while 41 4 of tc and 43 5 of otc were degraded in presence of uv and 20 mg l of h2o2 for 60 min fig 1a and b tc and otc were more efficiently degraded in uv h2o2 process than uv process because of ho generated by the decomposition of h2o2 under uv irradiation similarly kim et al 2009 determined that the k values of tc increased more than 3 4 times when using uv h2o2 h2o2 conc 8 2 mg l rather than uv only during the uv h2o2 process the degradation efficiencies of tc and otc were increased from 41 4 to 54 7 and from 43 5 to 59 9 respectively by increasing the h2o2 concentration from 20 to 50 mg l for 60 min fig 1a and b these results suggest that the additional h2o2 50 mg l did not generate significantly more ho under the conditions tested uv irradiation leading to only a slight increase in the tc and otc degradation efficiency to verify the effect of fe2 for the photo fenton process the concentration of fe2 was varied from 1 to 10 mg l with 20 mg l of h2o2 the photo fenton reaction generally occurs very fast at the beginning of the process because the ho are rapidly generated by the reaction of fe2 and h2o2 under uv irradiation mirzaei et al 2017 likewise the degradation of tc and otc occurred very fast within 1 min but slowly thereafter then kobs could not be calculated the highest degradation efficiency was 97 1 for both tc and otc during the photo fenton process with 20 mg l of h2o2 and 10 mg l of fe2 after 60 min fig 1c and d however high degradation efficiencies of 94 2 and 94 8 were also achieved for tc and otc respectively when using only 5 mg l of fe2 during the photo fenton process with 5 mg l of fe2 the concentration of h2o2 continued to decrease during the reaction time from 20 mg l to 12 5 mg l and 3 5 mg l for 10 and 30 min respectively suggesting that enough fe2 was present in the solution to maintain the reaction in addition a relatively large amount of iron oxides were precipitated when adding 10 mg l of fe2 to the reaction mixture as previously reported by karatas et al 2012 suggesting that such a high concentration is not required an amount of 5 mg l of fe2 was thus deemed sufficient and for the remaining experiments the photo fenton process was conducted with the fenton reagent concentrations of 20 mg l of h2o2 and 5 mg l of fe2 3 2 comparison of the tc and otc degradation using various oxidation processes the degradation efficiencies of tc and otc using h2o2 uv uv h2o2 and the photo fenton processes were compared for 30 min as shown in fig 2 the degradation efficiencies of each tc and otc using h2o2 for 30 min were 27 9 and 12 7 respectively fig 2a as an oxidant h2o2 partly degraded tc and otc by its oxidation potential as 1 80 v chen et al 2017 using the uv process 11 7 of otc was degraded which was 7 4 higher than the amount of tc degraded for 30 min fig 2a this result was attributed by the much high molar extinction coefficient of otc at 254 nm 19 799 m 1 cm 1 than that of tc 4108 m 1 cm 1 kim et al 2009 during uv h2o2 process for 30 min the degradation efficiencies of tc and otc were 34 2 and 34 4 respectively when using the photo fenton process efficiencies higher than for h2o2 uv and uv h2o2 processes fig 2a were observed for both tc and otc with removals of 82 1 and 82 5 after 5 min and 91 3 and 92 4 after 30 min respectively these results also indicate that the photo fenton process was more efficient at removing tcs than other uv assisted catalyst reactions reported in literature yu et al 2019 and zhu et al 2019 showed 38 and 45 of tc degradation for 5min respectively when using tio2 fe3o4 and fe3o4 nanoparticles as a catalyst for heterogeneous photo fenton process dose of catalyst 300 mg l h2o2 concentration 340 mg l lai et al 2019 used 100 mg l of mnfe2o4 biochar composite and reported 50 degradation of tc for 30 min with 3400 mg l of h2o2 under uv irradiation during the photo fenton process 82 5 and 97 5 of h2o2 was consumed after 30 min and 60 min reaction fig 2b although h2o2 is steadily consumed during the photo fenton process the complete removal of tc and otc were not reached because of very high initial concentration of tc and otc 100 mg l about 10 of toc mineralization were observed for 60 min of the photo fenton process despite the high degradation efficiency of tc 94 6 and otc 95 0 this indicates a low mineralization of tc and otc and the formation of transformation products which were persistent and not sensitive to degradation during the photo fenton process further discussion of transformation products of tc and otc is provided in section 3 5 to perform experiments at concentrations of tc and otc equivalent to levels expected in real pharmaceutical and livestock wastewaters two initial concentrations 1 and 10 mg l of tc and otc were used li et al 2004 de godos et al 2012 results fig 3 a and b at an initial concentration of 10 mg l indicate that 90 of tc and otc degradation was achieved after 1 min as for the initial concentration of 1 mg l almost complete removal over 99 was achieved after 5 min for both compounds therefore the photo fenton process is an effective way to remove both tc and otc present in the range of concentrations found in real contaminated wastewater 3 3 effect of inorganic anions and cations cl hco3 so4 2 hpo4 2 na ca2 and cu2 inorganic anions can inhibit the generation of ho during the photo fenton process via complexing with ferrous ion or scavenging hassanshahi et al 2018 as can be seen in fig 3c and d when coexisting with 10 mm of each cl so4 2 hco3 or hpo4 2 the degradation efficiencies of tc for 60 min were 94 8 94 8 89 6 and 85 2 respectively and those of otc were 95 2 95 1 75 2 and 72 1 respectively relatively small inhibition effects were observed for so4 2 because so4 2 has low reactivity with ho gao et al 2009 10 mm of cl was considered to have insignificant inhibition effects on the degradation of tc and otc in this study because cl can react with ho to form cloh and can rapidly regenerate ho near neutral ph values liu et al 2016 other studies reported no inhibition effects on the degradation of otc using uv h2o2 liu et al 2016 and solar photo fenton pereira et al 2014 process competing with low concentration of cl 17 mm and so4 2 4 mm however hpo4 2 greatly inhibited the degradation of tc and otc to a greater extent than hco3 because hco3 could generate co3 oxidation potential 1 78 v cope et al 1973 by reacting with ho whereas hpo4 2 is not only ho scavenger but also react with ferrous iron to form insoluble iron phosphate complexes which greatly inhibit the fenton reaction gutiérrez zapata et al 2017 as for the inorganic cations na and ca2 had little inhibition effect on the degradation of tc and otc in the photo fenton process for 60 min fig 3e and f however the degradation of both tc and otc was greatly inhibited by 10 mm of cu2 from the beginning of the reaction after 60 min the degradation efficiencies of tc and otc with 10 mm of cu2 were decreased to 79 31 and 80 83 respectively compare to 94 2 and 94 8 without cu2 although liu et al 2016 reported that slight amount of cu2 1 μm could enhance the otc degradation during uv h2o2 process due to cu2 catalyzed fenton like process cu2 has a lower catalytic activity to convert h2o2 into reactive oxidants than fe2 sutton and winterbourn 1989 lee et al 2014 thus competing with high concentration of cu2 resulted in low degradation efficiency of tc and otc during the photo fenton process using low concentration of fe2 therefore the degradation efficiencies of both tc and otc greatly decreased by the presence of hpo4 2 hco3 and cu2 during the photo fenton process since these ions acted as ho scavengers and competitors and inhibition of each anion and cation was the following order hpo4 2 hco3 so4 2 cl and cu2 ca2 na 3 4 effect of initial ph as illustrated in fig 4 a and b the ph range was set from 3 1 to 8 5 to investigate the influence of the initial ph on the degradation of each tc and otc during the photo fenton process degradation of tc was generally increased by increasing ph while the highest degradation efficiency of otc was achieved at ph 5 5 the initial ph is known to be the most important factor affecting the photo fenton process considering that photo fenton reaction ho generation is generally enhanced under acidic condition because the high reactive fe2 ions are dominant under these conditions jain et al 2018 in previous studies the degradation efficiencies of other antibiotics including amoxicillin elmolla et al 2009 cloxacillin elmolla et al 2009 and ampicillin elmolla et al 2009 rozas et al 2010 were steadily increased by decreasing ph attributed to high ho generation as shown in fig 4c as ph decreased from 8 5 to 3 1 the kpcba obs increased from 2 5 10 2 min 1 to 4 4 10 2 min 1 however unlike the degradation of pcba the degradation of tc and otc was inhibited at ph 3 1 also tc was the most degraded at ph 8 5 while the degradation of otc was the most inhibited fig 4a and b it should be noted that enhancement in their degradation rate at higher ph can be affected by increasing photolysis rate at uv λ 254 nm and reaction rate constant with ho by increasing the deprotonation degree of tc and otc more than generated ho amount there are many dissociated forms of tc tch3 tch2 0 tch tc2 and otc h3otc h2otc hotc otc2 at ph range of 3 1 8 5 which exhibit distinct physicochemical properties at ph 3 1 tc was protonated to be tch3 which became low reactive molecule mohammed ali 2012 causing less susceptible to ho attack with the increase of ph the degree of deprotonation increases by tch2 0 tch and tc2 which results in the increasing photolysis rate ge et al found that tc2 is the fastest degradable form for the photolysis followed by tch and tch2 0 ge et al 2018 moreover tch 105 78 109 m 1 s 1 and tc2 35 29 109 m 1 s 1 are highly reactive toward ho than tch2 0 6 37 109 m 1 s 1 ge et al 2018 similarly uv photolysis of otc was the highest when deprotonated as otc2 followed by hotc h2otc and h3otc under ph 3 11 by the increasing molar absorptivity at 254 nm liu et al 2015 also the reactivity toward ho is higher in the order otc2 hotc h2otc h3otc liu et al 2015 in spite of strong ho scavengers such as hydroxide anion oh and hydroperoxide anion ho2 are majorly present buxton et al 1988 christensen et al 1982 the highest degradation of tc was achieved at ph 8 5 due to the most highly reactive tch however degradation of otc was significantly inhibited at the beginning of the reaction by the fact that the relatively slight increase of ho reactivity among otc dissociated forms might not fully overcome competing effect toward ho as a results although the pseudo first rate constant values of pcba were about 57 4 decreasing by increasing ph from 3 1 to 8 5 deprotonated tc tch and otc h2otc and hotc can enhance their degradation efficiencies via highly photolysis and reactive toward ho therefore ph 5 5 might be effective to degrade tc and otc using the photo fenton process 3 5 identification of transformation products of tc and otc the transformation products of tc m z 461 15 459 14 443 14 and 413 13 and otc m z 477 15a b two products 475 14 459 14 449 15 447 14 433 16a b two products and 415 15 were identified for the photo fenton process table s1 the structural difference between tc and otc is that tc has a hydrogen molecule on c5 where otc has an hydroxyl group leading to slightly different pka values pka1 3 3 pka2 7 7 and pka3 9 7 for tc and pka1 3 57 pka2 7 49 and pka3 9 44 for otc ge et al 2018 cheng et al 2013 both tc and otc degradation was initiated at the c11a c12 double bond site however further degradation followed different pathways during the photo fenton reaction as indicated in fig 5 a the m z 461 15 transformation product from the degradation of tc was assumed to be the primary transformation product at the beginning of the photo fenton process since the c11a c12 double bond of tc was a susceptible site for the ho attack wang et al 2011 also found that m z 461 was attacked by free ozone or ho during the ozonation of tc the dehydration of c6 c5a of m z 461 product was first observed m z 443 14 in the present study the molar mass of the m z 459 15 transformation product was 14 da higher than that of the parent tc this is attributed to the formation of an aldehyde group hc o also the m z 413 13 transformation product was formed by the dehydration of c6 c5a and demethylation the transformation products of otc were more varied than those of tc which included products from hydroxylation decarbonylation demethylation secondary alcohol oxidation and dehydaration fig 5b the hydroxylation products m z 477 15 were generated by adding hydroxyl groups to the aromatic ring m z 477 15a and c11a c12 double bond of otc m z 477 15b hydrogen abstraction at c5 formed the m z 459 14 product and m z 475 14 was formed by combining hydroxyl addition to the aromatic ring with hydrogen abstraction the m z 433 16a transformation product was engaged in a loss of c0 at c1 then m z 449 15 was formed by further hydroxyl addition to aromatic ring demethylation was involved in the abstraction of one methyl group m z 447 14 and two methyl groups m z 433 16b of dimethylammonium group at c4 also dehydration at c3 generated m z 415 15 similarly liu et al 2016 reported five degradation pathways for otc using the uv h2o2 process and same seven transformation products m z 477 15a b 475 14 459 14 449 15 447 14 and 433 16 were observed in present study however the m z 433 16 c20h20n2o9 and 415 15 c20h18n2o8 transformation products from otc of the photo fenton process were observed for the first time in the present study 3 6 toxicity of tc and otc transformation products the ec50 15min of tc and otc against v fischeri were calculated to be 104 μm tong et al 2015 and 152 μm yuan et al 2011 when 200 μm of tc and otc were used as the initial concentration in previous toxicity assessments the toxicities for v fischeri of tc otc and their transformation products were investigated during the photo fenton process fig 6 the inhibition ratio of tc was the highest 62 8 for the control sample tc 200 μm then gradually decreased by increasing the reaction time of the photo fenton process fig 6a this result indicated that the toxicity for v fischeri was attributed to the decreasing tc concentration and the transformation products of tc becoming less toxic than tc itself after 60 min of the photo fenton process the inhibition ratio of tc and its transformation products for v fischeri was 13 7 on the other hand the inhibition ratio of otc 200 μm for v fischeri was initially 42 9 and the inhibition ratios of otc and its transformation products increased to over 90 during the photo fenton process 1 30 min although the otc concentration steadily decreased fig 6b this suggests that otc was transformed into products more toxic for v fischeri during the photo fenton reaction even after a very short reaction time of 1 min table 1 shows the predicted toxicity values of otc and the transformation products m z 415 15 459 14 475 14 and 477 15b which were detected in all samples using the ecosar program three transformation products m z 415 15 459 14 and 475 14 presented significantly lower acute toxicity for all fish daphnia and green algae while m z 477 15b is predicted to have a significantly higher acute toxicity for fish and green algae than otc this can explain why the lower toxicity to v fischeri observed after 60 min considering that the amount of m z 477 15b was then decreased fig 6c similarly wang et al 2018 reported that v fischeri inhibition was the highest after 10 min 55 of electrochemical oxidation over a ti ti4o7 anode due to the formation of more toxic transformation products of tc with m z 461 432 and 477 examined by qsar analysis these results demonstrate the importance of monitoring transformation products and their toxicity when using the photo fenton process to ensure that sufficient time and oxidant doses are applied to further degrade toxic transformation products that might be formed 4 conclusions in the present study the degradation mechanism of tc and otc during the photo fenton process was investigated including the effects of fenton reagent concentrations anions cations and ph as well as the nature of the transformation products of tc and otc formed and their toxicity evaluated by v fischeri inhibition and qsar analysis in the range of conditions investigated the degradation efficiencies of tc and otc were increased by increasing fe2 and h2o2 concentrations otc was more sensitive to uv irradiation than tc while the degradation of tc by ho is higher than that of otc the photo fenton process was the most effective way to remove tc and otc when compare to h2o2 uv and uv h2o2 process there was a little impact on the degradation of tc and otc due to the presence of cl so4 2 na or ca2 but some significant inhibition was observed with hpo4 2 hco3 and cu2 a few of transformation products of tc and otc during photo fenton process were newly identified in the present study all observed transformation products of tc exhibited lower v fischeri toxicity than that of tc however at the beginning of the photo fenton process otc transformed into transformation product more toxic to v fischeri then further oxidized to non toxic transformation products therefore without ph adjustment and at low concentrations of fenton reagent the photo fenton process was efficient at removing tc and can be efficiently apply to the treatment of otc as long as the process is operated under conditions allowing the further degradation of the toxic transformation products declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

18163,this study proposes a novel method to directly treat reject water with a high ammonium content without relying on dilution the originality of this method resides in leveraging the coordinated action of a methane and methanol dependent bacterial consortium and the biogas generated from wastewater treatment facilities specifically ammonium is removed through autotrophic assimilation in the glutamate cycle of methanotrophs and methylophilus while simultaneously methanol generated by methanotrophs is treated through formaldehyde assimilation as methylophilus undergo the same ribulose monophosphate cycle as methanotrophs using this method the backflow of high concentration ammonium into the wastewater treatment process was reduced to 59 in a single operation using a sequencing batch reactor at a mean influent concentration of 877 3 mg l 1 however the removal rate temporarily declined to an average of 37 6 at a concentration of 800 mg l 1 or above which was imputed to the influence of toxic intermediates graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater treatment plants reject water ammonium methanotrophs methylophilus bacterial consortium biogas 1 introduction reject water is a necessary by product from anaerobic digester supernatants and sludge dewatering at wastewater treatment plants wwtps fig s1 the reject water from the sludge dewatering process accounts for only 1 5 3 of the influent wastewater in volume but represents more than 30 of the ammonium nitrogen influx into the treatment process which creates significant internal nitrogen loading in wwtps wett et al 1998 along with a rapid spike in the nitrogen loading the reject water which is fed back into the treatment process also causes sporadic ammonium overloading arnold et al 2000 this not only precludes an efficient overall denitrification process but also incurs great costs as additional nitrification denitrification systems or improvements to the treatment process become necessary siegrist 1996 in short despite its small volume the reject water is detrimental to the quality of discharge from wwtps as it flows back into the process and compromises denitrification efficiency through increased nitrogen loading in the influent water less efficient nitrification and a lower carbon nitrogen c n ratio the impetus for research into the improvement and upgrading of wwtps to resolve the issues associated with reject water came from the application of a nitrification denitrification process using nitrites obtained through partial nitrification of ammonia abeling and seyfried 1992 by hellinga et al 1998 their process was proven economically feasible as it reduced the carbon source requirement to 60 compared to denitrification followed by nitrification resulting in nitrate production with reduced energy consumption for aeration another proposed denitrification method was the sharon process designed to denitrify nitrites sustainably hellinga et al 1998 the anammox process which involves the direct assimilation of ammonium to denitrify it into nitrogen gas in anoxic conditions also heralded a new trend in reject water treatment at wwtps mulder et al 1995 these proposals coincided with the oxygen limited autotrophic nitrification denitrification oland process kuai and verstraete 1998 followed by the canon process aimed at complete autotrophic nitrogen removal sliekers et al 2002 the sharon anammox process based on the double stage partial nitration anaerobic ammonium oxidation technique jetten et al 1997 is an advanced technology in use at wwtps that builds on the above methods however these technologies have several downsides they require aeration to convert ammonia into nitrites and a nitrification denitrification phase at the end of the treatment process is imperative to treat high concentration ammonia schmidt et al 2003 van hulle et al 2005 2010 volcke et al 2006 processes handling reject water with a high ammonium concentration such as oland also require an additional external carbon source e g methanol and air supply over an extended period of time schmidt et al 2003 van hulle et al 2010 the sharon anammox process is not without its limits either it is a complicated process that requires two reactors and high concentration ammonia must be diluted schmidt et al 2003 van dongen et al 2001 van hulle et al 2010 previous nitritation anammox implementations had employed two stage reactor configurations or existing nitration systems recently a single stage partial nitritation anammox system was developed to simplify treatment system and maximize the limited facility space choi et al 2019 han et al 2018 lackner et al 2014 methanotrophs a group of microorganisms that metabolize methane produce methanol through methane oxidation and are capable of denitrification on their own mechsner and hamer 1985 the possibility of methane dependent denitrification was also established through reactor experiments in laboratory settings houbron et al 1999 rajapakse and scutt 1999 thalasso et al 1997 in the metabolic process of methanotrophs ammonia acts as a co metabolic substrate along with methane and nh2oh which is partially produced by the methane monooxygenase mmo of methanotrophs is oxidized to nitrite and nitrate through the primary and secondary nitrification by nitrification bacteria that co exist as a small portion of the microbial community this methanotrophic oxidation process is similar to the oxidation pathway of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob bédard and knowles 1989 carlsen et al 1991 studies on autotrophic denitrification by methanotrophs has a long history but no research has been attempted to apply these characteristics to a denitrification process nitrogen reduction by methanotrophs requires a relatively large amount of nitrogen 0 25 mol of nitrogen needs to be absorbed to assimilate 1 mol of carbon from methane anthony 1982 our previous research on the cultivation and application of methanotrophs brought to our attention the notable co existence of methylophilus that uses methanol generated from methanotroph cultivation kim et al 2019 methylophilus lives symbiotically with methanotrophs utilizing methanol generated from their metabolic process and is a gram negative obligate aerobic bacterium gogleva et al 2010 that converts methanol into formaldehyde using pyrroloquinoline quinone methanol dehydrogenase pqq mdh methylophilus has also been confirmed to use nitrates and ammonia as nitrogen sources to assimilate carbon via the ribulose monophosphate rump pathway beck et al 2014 madhaiyan et al 2009 we took note of the fact that methanotrophs and methylophilus both autotrophically consume nitrogen sources such as nitrates and ammonia and sought to explore the feasibility of applying this symbiosis to the context of efficient treatment of reject water with high concentration ammonium the present study proposes a novel advanced method that leverages the coordination mechanism of a methanotroph methylophilus bacterial consortium to treat reject water containing high concentration ammonium nitrogen generated from wwtps more economically and efficiently than the existing processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation of the bacterial consortium activated sludge from a wwtp aeration tank was used to cultivate a bacterial consortium wet activated sludge was sieved through a strainer no 50 300 μm and the sieved material was put into several 500 ml flasks whose air filled headspace was injected with 20 methane before storage at 4 c for subsequent use the present assay used ammonium therefore we created an ammonium mineral salt ams liquid medium for microbial cultivation with a relatively high concentration of ammonium chloride 10 mm as the nitrogen source in a laboratory setting instead of nitrate mineral salt nms medium which is the common choice in methanotroph cultivation whittenbury et al 1970 table s1 the copper cuso4 concentration in the final medium was 20 μm for all media formulations and the media were buffered to ph 6 8 by the addition of 1 5 ml phosphate buffer 26 g l kh2po4 33 g l na2hpo4 a 10 g activated sludge sample stored at 4 c was put into a 350 ml flask containing 200 ml ams liquid medium the flask opening was closed with a silicon stopper and methane was inserted into the 150 ml internal headspace at 20 vol before fully sealing the opening with parafilm the medium was then placed in a rotary shaker lab champion is 971r champion laboratories albion il usa for cultivation at 250 rpm for one day at 25 c the cultured medium was precipitated for 10 min after which 100 ml was put into a 350 ml flask containing fresh ams medium these steps were repeated six times the cultivated methanotrophs were separated by centrifugation centrifuge 416 dongseo science ltd dangjin korea at 2 700 g the centrifuged pellet was freeze dried at 55 c in a freeze dryer opern fds 12003 seoul korea

amounts of h2 n2 co and halogenated compounds depending on the feedstock and process conditions andriani et al 2014 van der ha et al 2012 biogas discharged from the anaerobic sludge digester in the terminal wastewater treatment plant ilsan korea was used as the methane supply source in the experiment the mean biogas discharge from the wwtp was 65 2 count 13 maximum 69 3 minimum 61 5 median 54 3 with a standard deviation of 0 67 and its constituents mostly remained stable with no major fluctuations the biogas in the present assay consisted of ch4 66 9 co2 31 3 n2 1 2 and o2 0 2 multiple 4 9l high pressure gas tanks globalgastec ltd bucheon korea were used to collect and store gas for subsequent use 2 3 analysis and measurements for microbiological analysis dna extraction polymerase chain

analyses of water quality and wwtp components organic components were analyzed colorimetrically and atomic analysis was performed using atomic absorption spectroscopy table s2 2 4 batch testing and assay device for sequencing batch processing for batch testing 160 ml serum bottles were filled with 50 ml of ams media to which the cultured bacteria consortium or the stored reject water collected

assay was equipped with a mixer gas supply and pressure gauge fig 1 a pressure sensor was attached to the bioreactor to ensure that the biogas and oxygen consumption inside the reactor was automatically detected and the gases were automatically injected as necessary to replenish the gas supply the sbr installed in the on site lab of the wastewater treatment plant was operated for 152

suspended solid mlss was maintained at 3 700 4 400 mg l 1 and the sludge retention time srt was 20 days the methane to oxygen ratio of the biogas in air was maintained within the 1 1 5 range as the biogas was automatically fed into the sbr the bacteria increased through multiplication were released from the reactor 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the mixed bacteria culture in reject water the methane and methanol dependent mixed bacteria consortium was cultivated again in ams and reject water using biogas the gas was replaced every 24 h with a methane to atmospheric oxygen ratio of 17 8 ml 16 9 ml fig 2 illustrates the species composition of the mixed bacteria consortium at day 6 of the cultivation the mixed bacterial consortium cultured in pure ams medium fig 2a featured a dominant presence of methylophilus at 67 37 m flavus 57 29 and m rhizosphaerae 9 12 followed by methylobacter at 27 11 methylomonas at 3 22 methylomonas f uc at 0 82 and methylosarcina at 0 63 all of which are methanotrophs fig s2 when pure atmospheric air was injected without biogas fig 2b pseudomonas showed a very high prevalence at 72 04 and methylophilus which was the main constituent of the mixed bacterial consortium cultured with biogas and ams media accounted for a mere 1 33 of the methanotrophic orders only methylomonas was detected at a low proportion 0 44 pseudomonas the dominant species in this culture commonly inhabits activated sludge at wwtps and is often found in microbial cultures separated and cultivated from the sludge annadurai et al 2002 nishihara et al 2000 this finding indicates that the composition of a mixed bacterial consortium reverts to the composition of predominant species in activated sludge when biogas is not expressly injected however when the ams medium was substituted with reject water and biogas was injected into the culture pseudomonas constituted 36 02 of the bacterial consortium but methylophilus showed a high presence at 34 35 m flavus 28 64 and m rhizosphaerae 4 99 methylobacter was also present at a high proportion at 13 55 along with methylomonas 0 22 methylomonas f uc 0 18 and methylosarcina 0 08 this indicates a significant enhancement in the diversity of the methanotrophic species compared to the culture injected with atmospheric air these methanotrophs all belong to type i strains of the intracellular multiplication type gammaproteobacteria class that express particulate methane monooxygenase pmmo and remain active even in a high concentration of copper semrau et al 1995 the exclusive presence of type i methanotrophs is ascribed to the high concentration of ammonium and copper in the reject water that was used as the culture medium in other words unlike alphaproteobacteria methanotrophs also known as type ii methanotrophs the observed species all of which were gammaproteobacteria methanotrophs also known as type i or type x methanotrophs experience less inhibition or even stimulation when nitrogen is introduced into their environment nyerges and stein 2009 another way in which the ammonium influences the species composition and growth of methanotrophs is through the varying preference for ammonium between type i and type ii methanotrophs mohammadi et al 2017 van der nat et al 1998 previous research also found that the addition of ammonium to rice paddies stimulates methane oxidation rather than inhibiting it nyerges and stein 2009 holmes et al 1995 noted that increased growth of type i methanotrophs is possible when ammonia acts more as a nutrient i e a nitrogen source rather than a growth retardant provided that the methanotrophs grew to a sufficient level with abundant carbon sources these findings indicate that hydroxylamine and nitrites generated from ammonia are not detrimental to the growth of pmmo expressing bacteria in contrast to the ones that express soluble monooxygenase smmo the findings from the species composition of the mixed bacteria consortium in the present assay suggest that utilizing methanotrophs to treat reject water with a high concentration of ammonium is feasible 3 2 denitrification characteristics of the mixed bacterial consortium in reject water to examine the differences in the removal or conversion of high concentration ammonium and low concentration nitrates in the reject water we compared the samples with 25 biogas in the headspace against the samples whose headspace was filled with air i e the control samples the results are illustrated in fig 3 in the samples supplied with methane through biogas the ammonium concentration decreased by 42 7 in 4 h and 63 5 in 12 h however in the air filled controls the ammonium concentration declined by only 16 8 in the first 4 h including its partial conversion into nitrates due to nitrification the nitrate content increased from 5 2 mg l 1 to 31 2 mg l 1 after which no notable variation in the ammonium concentration was observed because the aerobic nitrification of ammonium and the autotrophic assimilation of methanotrophs and methylophilus took place simultaneously we could not calculate a relative nitrate volume from these findings however there was no overall surge in the nitrate content which decreased 2 0 mg l 1 from 5 2 mg l 1 to 3 2 mg l 1 in the samples subjected to biogas the present method involved the simultaneous implementation of two mechanisms 1 nitrogen assimilation by methanotrophs and 2 removal of nitrogen content from reject water by oxidation wherein ammonia was converted into hydroxylamine and nitrite via mmo our analysis of the nitrogen and phosphate content in the sludge showed a higher total nitrogen content in the methanotrophic sludge 8 53 than in the active sludge 5 34 which is ascribed to the high nitrogen requirement for the growth of methanotrophs as established by previous studies kim et al 2019 methylophilus is a denitrification bacterium when methanol is used as the substrate and disappears from a bacterial consortium when methanol is exhausted this has been confirmed by osaka et al 2006 who discovered an association between denitrifying consortia in wwtp sludge samples and the methanol assimilating denitrification activities of methylophilus methylobacillus and aminomonas microbes of the methylophilaceae family through stable isotope probing this is also consistent with our findings in section 3 1 due to the lack of methanol production from methanotrophic activity a sharp decrease in methylophilus was observed when the sludge samples were supplied with only air according to another previous study this bacterium utilizes nitrates and ammonia as the nitrogen sources in converting methanol into formaldehyde using pqq mdh and assimilating formaldehyde via the rump pathway gogleva et al 2010 another dominant species methylophilus rhizosphaerae followed the same mechanism as a strictly aerobic gram negative bacterium madhaiyan et al 2009 methylophilus flavus the dominant species in the present assay is an obligate methanol utilizing gram negative bacterium and was first named and characterized as a strictly aerobic bacterium by gogleva et al 2010 the reaction kinetics of the bacteria consortium in this assay needs further consideration the cellular growth yield coefficient y of the methane and methanol dependent bacterial consortium was 0 42 mg vss mg 1 ch4 and its internal respiration rate constant b was 0 01 day 1 the maximum specific methane utilization rate k max of the bacterial consortium was 0 85 mg ch4 l 1 and the monod half saturation constant k s of the substrate was 0 85 mg ch4 l 1 kinetic data from type i methanotrophs mixed culture obtained by al sayed et al 2018 which was cultivated from waste activated sludge as in the present assay were largely consistent with our calculations but with slightly larger values for y and k s 0 592 gdcw g 1ch4 and 1 04 mgch4 aq l 1 respectively further detail of this calculation is available in appendix b 3 3 variations in the species composition of the bacterial consortium and ammonium removal characteristics with the methane to oxygen ratio variations in the species composition of the bacterial consortium in relation to the methane to oxygen ratio were observed at the 214th hour of batch testing to this end the proportion of the methane and airborne oxygen volume was adjusted by means of the biogas injection volume into the serum bottle headspace the air was replaced every 24 h fig 4 the overall proportion of methanotrophs remained stable in the presence of methane to oxygen ratios of 35 9 34 7 and 35 1 when the methane to oxygen ratio was 1 1 25 1 5 respectively however methylophilus accounted for 32 34 36 42 and 24 82 of the consortium at the methane to oxygen ratio of 1 1 25 and 1 5 respectively the proportion fell substantially to 2 when the methane to oxygen ratio rose to 2 increasing the methane to oxygen ratio up to 1 5 were also associated with a growing proportion of methylomonas among the methanotrophs hernandez et al 2015 discovered that methylobacter becomes dominant at high oxygen tensions in contrast to our findings that an increase in the methane to oxygen ratio up to a certain level is associated with the growing proportion of methylobacter our results are not directly comparable to those of hernandez et al due to the presence of high concentration ammonium in our assay and the different experimental scope of oxygen tensions nonetheless hernandez et al s finding that the relative concentration levels of methane and oxygen have a strong bearing on the species composition of a microbial community is congruent with our observations the methane utilization rate of the bacteria consortium in terms of the methane to oxygen ratio was the highest at 0 098 mgch4 mgmlss 1 under the methane to oxygen ratio of 1 25 table 1 the ammonium removal rate was the highest at 58 2 at a methane to oxygen ratio of 1 25 followed by 52 1 at 1 0 however the removal efficiency fell drastically when the methane to oxygen rate exceeded these levels the ammonium removal rate was only 39 4 at a methane to oxygen ratio of 1 5 based on these findings we maintained a methane to oxygen ratio in the biogas supply of 1 1 5 during the subsequent sbr test aimed at removing ammonium from reject water using a methane and methanol dependent bacteria consortium 3 4 continuous sbr operation a municipal wwtp ilsan terminal wastewater treatment plant ilsan korea was selected for the assay and a detailed analysis of the operational data from the wwtp table s3 shows that reject water generated from the sludge thickener digester and dehydrator flows back into the front end of the primary sedimentation tank along with the influent wastewater that enters the treatment process this supernatant accounted for only 1 3 of the influent liquid however due to its high nitrogen and phosphate content as well as a substantial amount of organic matter it represented 30 50 of nitrogen loading and 20 30 of total phosphate loading the influent wastewater of the target wastewater treatment plant of this study comes from a separated sewer system the wastewater contains large portions of organic components volatile matter 62 80 ash 24 17 combined sewer system seonam stp seoul volatile matter 52 52 ash 39 04 in addition waste liquid from septic tanks for treating night soil and food waste leachate are also treated in the wastewater treatment plant accordingly the digester contains a relatively high organic content and thus the reject water shows a relatively high concentration of ammonium nitrogen most strains of nitrifiers grow optimally at temperatures between 25 and 30 c watson et al 1981 therefore in winter the low water temperature drags down the activation level of nitrifying bacteria which results in a relatively high nitrogen concentration in the discharge from wwtps compared to other seasons observational data from the municipal wwtp in the present study fig s3 also showed deterioration in the water quality when the flow rate of the drainage system became smaller in winter fig 5 illustrates the outcomes from the 152 day sbr operation with reject water that was supplied daily from municipal wwtp using the methane and methanol dependent bacterial consortium as well as biogas each round of the sbr operation consisted of mixing for 6 h 30 min of precipitation and the release of the treated supernatant the ever growing mixed bacterial sludge was periodically discharged to maintain an mlss level of 3 700 4 400 mg l 1 the mean ammonium removal rate was 58 9 8 4 with a mean influent concentration of 877 3 mg l 1 and mean effluent concentration of 359 9 mg l 1 which represents a reduction of approximately 59 in the ammonium content in the reject water that flows back into the wastewater treatment process the municipal wwtp used in this study was characterized by great variations in the ammonium concentration ranging from 388 to 1 468 mg l 1 in its reject water with a mean removal rate of 60 or above when the ammonium concentration was at or below the cut off point of 800 mg l 1 however above this level we witnessed a dramatic decrease in the mean removal rate to 37 6 we suggest that this phenomenon has complex sources either the presence of ammonium above a certain concentration hampers the normal operation of the hydroxylamine and nitrite detoxification mechanism or methanotrophs consumes energy to detoxify hydroxylamine noll et al 2008 qiu et al 2008 wu et al 2009 zheng et al 2014 a recent development in korea titled combining anammox and autotrophic sulfur denitrification processes brings partial nitration anammox and sulfur oxidation denitrification processes to remove nitrogen from reject water using autotrophic microbes kwon et al 2019 however this method also falls into the trap of complicated processes reject water is diluted 2 9 4 3 fold with mainstream effluent before injection into the process to reduce influent t n loading unlike existing methods such as sharon anammox and oland but similar to the recently reported one stage pn a process choi et al 2019 han et al 2018 klaus et al 2017 lackner et al 2014 our novel method for reject water treatment does not require multiple reactors additional carbon sources for aeration and denitrification to partially nitrify ammonium into nitrites or dilution of reject water with wwtp influent or effluent water instead the high concentration ammonium is treated via a single sbr treatment process without dilution we could reduce the ammonium loading caused by its increasing concentration in the wwtp influent water to a significant extent however ammonium content in reject water shows great variations given our findings that ammonium concentrations above the cut off point of 800 mg l 1 leads to a drastic decrease in the mean ammonium removal rate we propose the installation of an additional detention tank in front of the sbr treatment system upon industrial implementation of the present method as a potential solution to the influx of high concentration ammonium that reduces treatment efficiency in our previous study kim et al 2019 the sedimentation properties of the methane oxidation bioreactor mob sludge were comparatively analyzed with activated sludge in a 1000 ml graduated cylinder complete sedimentation of mob sludge occurred within 5 min with a settling tank retention time of 10 min in contrast the activated sludge settling tank retention time would need to be 50 min due to the slow rate of sedimentation of activated sludge the characteristic rapid sedimentation brought about by mob sludge was determined by a much higher eps content than activated sludge resulting in larger particle size in mob sludge 742 μm than in activated sludge 107 μm in the case of a full scale operation only a small amount of sludge is produced by sbr for treating reject water as compared to total sludge of the wastewater treatment plant such a small amount of sludge can be directly fed into an aeration tank or treated in the sludge treatment process of the plant 3 5 conceptualization of the autotrophic denitrification by a methane and methanol dependent bacterial consortium type i methanotrophs remove ammonium through oxidation via two pathways direct assimilation of ammonium and nitrates in reject water as a nitrogen source for its growth and expression of the pmmo enzyme for oxidation of methane into methanol some of which oxidizes ammonium via the same mechanism and pathway as the ammonia monooxygenase amo of aob this similarity is attributed to the fact that amo and mmo are closely related and the gene that encodes pmmo is highly similar to amo genes holmes et al 1995 norton et al 2002 as with amo two metabolic pathways have been discovered for hydroxylamine and nitrites the toxic intermediates of ammonium oxidation stein and klotz 2011 on one hand as in the case of ammonia oxidizers hydroxylamine once generated is first oxidized into nitrites they are reduced to nitric oxide which in turn becomes nitrous oxide fig 6 on the other hand hydroxylamine becomes nitrous oxide via nitric oxide fig 6 some of the hydroxylamine is reduced into ammonia by hydroxylamine reductase enzymes a unique methanotrophic detoxification mechanism stein et al 2010 m flavus and m rhizosphaerae are newly isolated methylotrophic strains characterized as novel species of the genus methylophilus by gogleva et al 2010 who established that they as with methanotrophs use the rump pathway to oxidize methanol produced by methanotrophs into formaldehyde by pqq mdh to assimilate carbon gogleva et al 2010 found that m flavus and m rhizosphaerae assimilate ammonium and nitrates as nitrogen sources for their growth via the glutamate cycle enzymes glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase as for methylophilus which co exists with methanotrophs using the methanol produced by them assimilation of ammonia via glutamate dehydrogenase is more energy efficient than via glutamate synthase thus the recombinant organism converts more growth substrate methanol into cellular carbon windass et al 1980 fig 6 shows a schematic diagram of the possible ammonium removing metabolic pathways from reject water by the methane and methanol dependent bacterial consortium methanotrophs and methylophilus based on previous and present findings denitrification by various consortia of methylotrophs and methanotrophs such as methylophilus is clearly observed as shown by this study however clearer reasons for this correlation beyond the ones elucidated in fig 6 is not yet known this warrants future research endeavors that examine the behavior within the methanotroph and methylophilus cells through labeled nitrogen isotopic probing as well as the behavior of n2o and n2 the final products of the treatment process we also propose further studies on the single cultivation and denitrification characteristics of methylophilus in relation to methanol concentration levels it should also be noted that this study excludes the influence of other inhibitors such as the concentration of copper free ammonia and suspended solids which needs further investigation furthermore although a detailed analysis of the economic aspects of the proposed method should be done the following economic advantages can be considered based on the current study 1 since highly concentrated reject water is not directly treated nor diluted by influent water of the wastewater treatment plant the treatment amount is relatively small and thus a facility with a smaller capacity would be sufficient 2 for municipal wastewater treatment plants which are typically located in an urban area and thus face spatial constraints the site can be efficiently utilized 3 no expensive carbon source for denitrification needs to be additionally injected but only biogas discharged from the anaerobic sludge digester of a wastewater treatment plant is used 4 conclusions methylophilus and methanotrophs represented a high proportion of the species composition of the bacteria consortium cultivated with wwtp reject water and biogas when this consortium was used in the continuous sbr operation with a mean ammonium concentration in the influent water of 877 3 mg l 1 number of observations 105 of these 75 and 30 had concentrations below and above 800 mg l 1 respectively the mean ammonium removal rate was 58 9 8 4 this study uses the coordination mechanism between the component species of the methane and methanol dependent bacterial consortium methanotrophs and methylophilus for the first time and we have confirmed the potential

18163,this study proposes a novel method to directly treat reject water with a high ammonium content without relying on dilution the originality of this method resides in leveraging the coordinated action of a methane and methanol dependent bacterial consortium and the biogas generated from wastewater treatment facilities specifically ammonium is removed through autotrophic assimilation in the glutamate cycle of methanotrophs and methylophilus while simultaneously methanol generated by methanotrophs is treated through formaldehyde assimilation as methylophilus undergo the same ribulose monophosphate cycle as methanotrophs using this method the backflow of high concentration ammonium into the wastewater treatment process was reduced to 59 in a single operation using a sequencing batch reactor at a mean influent concentration of 877 3 mg l 1 however the removal rate temporarily declined to an average of 37 6 at a concentration of 800 mg l 1 or above which was imputed to the influence of toxic intermediates graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater treatment plants reject water ammonium methanotrophs methylophilus bacterial consortium biogas 1 introduction reject water is a necessary by product from anaerobic digester supernatants and sludge dewatering at wastewater treatment plants wwtps fig s1 the reject water from the sludge dewatering process accounts for only 1 5 3 of the influent wastewater in volume but represents more than 30 of the ammonium nitrogen influx into the treatment process which creates significant internal nitrogen loading in wwtps wett et al 1998 along with a rapid spike in the nitrogen loading the reject water which is fed back into the treatment process also causes sporadic ammonium overloading arnold et al 2000 this not only precludes an efficient overall denitrification process but also incurs great costs as additional nitrification denitrification systems or improvements to the treatment process become necessary siegrist 1996 in short despite its small volume the reject water is detrimental to the quality of discharge from wwtps as it flows back into the process and compromises denitrification efficiency through increased nitrogen loading in the influent water less efficient nitrification and a lower carbon nitrogen c n ratio the impetus for research into the improvement and upgrading of wwtps to resolve the issues associated with reject water came from the application of a nitrification denitrification process using nitrites obtained through partial nitrification of ammonia abeling and seyfried 1992 by hellinga et al 1998 their process was proven economically feasible as it reduced the carbon source requirement to 60 compared to denitrification followed by nitrification resulting in nitrate production with reduced energy consumption for aeration another proposed denitrification method was the sharon process designed to denitrify nitrites sustainably hellinga et al 1998 the anammox process which involves the direct assimilation of ammonium to denitrify it into nitrogen gas in anoxic conditions also heralded a new trend in reject water treatment at wwtps mulder et al 1995 these proposals coincided with the oxygen limited autotrophic nitrification denitrification oland process kuai and verstraete 1998 followed by the canon process aimed at complete autotrophic nitrogen removal sliekers et al 2002 the sharon anammox process based on the double stage partial nitration anaerobic ammonium oxidation technique jetten et al 1997 is an advanced technology in use at wwtps that builds on the above methods however these technologies have several downsides they require aeration to convert ammonia into nitrites and a nitrification denitrification phase at the end of the treatment process is imperative to treat high concentration ammonia schmidt et al 2003 van hulle et al 2005 2010 volcke et al 2006 processes handling reject water with a high ammonium concentration such as oland also require an additional external carbon source e g methanol and air supply over an extended period of time schmidt et al 2003 van hulle et al 2010 the sharon anammox process is not without its limits either it is a complicated process that requires two reactors and high concentration ammonia must be diluted schmidt et al 2003 van dongen et al 2001 van hulle et al 2010 previous nitritation anammox implementations had employed two stage reactor configurations or existing nitration systems recently a single stage partial nitritation anammox system was developed to simplify treatment system and maximize the limited facility space choi et al 2019 han et al 2018 lackner et al 2014 methanotrophs a group of microorganisms that metabolize methane produce methanol through methane oxidation and are capable of denitrification on their own mechsner and hamer 1985 the possibility of methane dependent denitrification was also established through reactor experiments in laboratory settings houbron et al 1999 rajapakse and scutt 1999 thalasso et al 1997 in the metabolic process of methanotrophs ammonia acts as a co metabolic substrate along with methane and nh2oh which is partially produced by the methane monooxygenase mmo of methanotrophs is oxidized to nitrite and nitrate through the primary and secondary nitrification by nitrification bacteria that co exist as a small portion of the microbial community this methanotrophic oxidation process is similar to the oxidation pathway of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob bédard and knowles 1989 carlsen et al 1991 studies on autotrophic denitrification by methanotrophs has a long history but no research has been attempted to apply these characteristics to a denitrification process nitrogen reduction by methanotrophs requires a relatively large amount of nitrogen 0 25 mol of nitrogen needs to be absorbed to assimilate 1 mol of carbon from methane anthony 1982 our previous research on the cultivation and application of methanotrophs brought to our attention the notable co existence of methylophilus that uses methanol generated from methanotroph cultivation kim et al 2019 methylophilus lives symbiotically with methanotrophs utilizing methanol generated from their metabolic process and is a gram negative obligate aerobic bacterium gogleva et al 2010 that converts methanol into formaldehyde using pyrroloquinoline quinone methanol dehydrogenase pqq mdh methylophilus has also been confirmed to use nitrates and ammonia as nitrogen sources to assimilate carbon via the ribulose monophosphate rump pathway beck et al 2014 madhaiyan et al 2009 we took note of the fact that methanotrophs and methylophilus both autotrophically consume nitrogen sources such as nitrates and ammonia and sought to explore the feasibility of applying this symbiosis to the context of efficient treatment of reject water with high concentration ammonium the present study proposes a novel advanced method that leverages the coordination mechanism of a methanotroph methylophilus bacterial consortium to treat reject water containing high concentration ammonium nitrogen generated from wwtps more economically and efficiently than the existing processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation of the bacterial consortium activated sludge from a wwtp aeration tank was used to cultivate a bacterial consortium wet activated sludge was sieved through a strainer no 50 300 μm and the sieved material was put into several 500 ml flasks whose air filled headspace was injected with 20 methane before storage at 4 c for subsequent use the present assay used ammonium therefore we created an ammonium mineral salt ams liquid medium for microbial cultivation with a relatively high concentration of ammonium chloride 10 mm as the nitrogen source in a laboratory setting instead of nitrate mineral salt nms medium which is the common choice in methanotroph cultivation whittenbury et al 1970 table s1 the copper cuso4

sludge sample stored at 4 c was put into a 350 ml flask containing 200 ml ams liquid medium the flask opening was closed with a silicon stopper and methane was inserted into the 150 ml internal headspace at 20 vol before fully sealing the opening with parafilm the medium was then placed in a rotary shaker lab champion is 971r champion laboratories albion il usa for cultivation at 250 rpm for one day at 25 c the cultured medium was precipitated for 10 min after which 100 ml was put into a 350 ml flask containing fresh ams medium these steps were repeated six times the cultivated methanotrophs were separated by centrifugation centrifuge 416 dongseo science ltd dangjin korea at 2 700 g the centrifuged pellet was freeze dried at 55 c in a freeze dryer opern fds 12003 seoul korea

terminal wastewater treatment plant ilsan korea was used as the methane supply source in the experiment the mean biogas discharge from the wwtp was 65 2 count 13 maximum 69 3 minimum 61 5 median 54 3 with a standard deviation of 0 67 and its constituents mostly remained stable with no major fluctuations the biogas in the present assay consisted of ch4 66 9 co2 31 3 n2 1 2 and o2 0 2 multiple 4 9l high pressure gas tanks globalgastec ltd bucheon korea were used to collect and store gas for subsequent use 2 3 analysis and measurements for microbiological analysis dna extraction polymerase chain

analyses of water quality and wwtp components organic components were analyzed colorimetrically and atomic analysis was performed using atomic absorption spectroscopy table s2 2 4 batch testing and assay device for sequencing batch processing for batch testing 160 ml serum bottles were filled with 50 ml of ams media to which the cultured bacteria consortium or the stored reject water collected

assay was equipped with a mixer gas supply and pressure gauge fig 1 a pressure sensor was attached to the bioreactor to ensure that the biogas and oxygen consumption inside the reactor was automatically detected and the gases were automatically injected as necessary to replenish the gas supply the sbr installed in the on site lab of the wastewater treatment plant was operated for 152 days considering all the variations in reject water quality the sbr was operated at 20 25 c 150 rpm mixing speed and a 6 12 h holding time the precipitating time was set at 30 min mixed liquor suspended solid mlss was maintained at 3 700 4 400 mg l 1 and the sludge retention time srt was 20 days the methane to oxygen ratio of the biogas in air was maintained within the 1 1 5 range as the biogas was automatically fed into the sbr the bacteria increased through multiplication were released from the reactor 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the mixed bacteria culture in reject water the methane and methanol dependent mixed bacteria consortium was cultivated again in ams and reject water using biogas the gas was replaced every 24 h with a methane to atmospheric oxygen ratio of 17 8 ml 16 9 ml fig 2 illustrates the species composition of the mixed bacteria consortium at day 6 of the cultivation the mixed bacterial consortium cultured in pure ams medium fig 2a featured a dominant presence of methylophilus at 67 37 m flavus 57 29 and m rhizosphaerae 9 12 followed by methylobacter at 27 11 methylomonas at 3 22 methylomonas f uc at 0 82 and methylosarcina at 0 63 all of which are methanotrophs fig s2 when pure atmospheric air was injected without biogas fig 2b pseudomonas showed a very high prevalence at 72 04 and methylophilus which was the main constituent of the mixed bacterial consortium cultured with biogas and ams media accounted for a mere 1 33 of the methanotrophic orders only methylomonas was detected at a low proportion 0 44 pseudomonas the dominant species in this culture commonly inhabits activated sludge at wwtps and is often found in microbial cultures separated and cultivated from the sludge annadurai et al 2002 nishihara et al 2000 this finding indicates that the composition of a mixed bacterial consortium reverts to the composition of predominant species in activated sludge when biogas is not expressly injected however when the ams medium was substituted with reject water and biogas was injected into the culture pseudomonas constituted 36 02 of the bacterial consortium but methylophilus showed a high presence at 34 35 m flavus 28 64 and m rhizosphaerae 4 99 methylobacter was also present at a high proportion at 13 55 along with methylomonas 0 22 methylomonas f uc 0 18 and methylosarcina 0 08 this indicates a significant enhancement in the diversity of the methanotrophic species compared to the culture injected with atmospheric air these methanotrophs all belong to type i strains of the intracellular multiplication type gammaproteobacteria class that express particulate methane monooxygenase pmmo and remain active even in a high concentration of copper semrau et al 1995 the exclusive presence of type i methanotrophs is ascribed to the high concentration of ammonium and copper in the reject water that was used as the culture medium in other words unlike alphaproteobacteria methanotrophs also known as type ii methanotrophs the observed species all of which were gammaproteobacteria methanotrophs also known as type i or type x methanotrophs experience less inhibition or even stimulation when nitrogen is introduced into their environment nyerges and stein 2009 another way in which the ammonium influences the species composition and growth of methanotrophs is through the varying preference for ammonium between type i and type ii methanotrophs mohammadi et al 2017 van der nat et al 1998 previous research also found that the addition of ammonium to rice paddies stimulates methane oxidation rather than inhibiting it nyerges and stein 2009 holmes et al 1995 noted that increased growth of type i methanotrophs is possible when ammonia acts more as a nutrient i e a nitrogen source rather than a growth retardant provided that the methanotrophs grew to a sufficient level with abundant carbon sources these findings indicate that hydroxylamine and nitrites generated from ammonia are not detrimental to the growth of pmmo expressing bacteria in contrast to the ones that express soluble monooxygenase smmo the findings from the species composition of the mixed bacteria consortium in the present assay suggest that utilizing methanotrophs to treat reject water with a high concentration of ammonium is feasible 3 2 denitrification characteristics of the mixed bacterial consortium in reject water to examine the differences in the removal or conversion of high concentration ammonium and low concentration nitrates in the reject water we compared the samples with 25 biogas in the headspace against the samples whose headspace was filled with air i e the control samples the results are illustrated in fig 3 in the samples supplied with methane through biogas the ammonium concentration decreased by 42 7 in 4 h and 63 5 in 12 h however in the air filled controls the ammonium concentration declined by only 16 8 in the first 4 h including its partial conversion into nitrates due to nitrification the nitrate content increased from 5 2 mg l 1 to 31 2 mg l 1 after which no notable variation in the ammonium concentration was observed because the aerobic nitrification of ammonium and the autotrophic assimilation of methanotrophs and methylophilus took place simultaneously we could not calculate a relative nitrate volume from these findings however there was no overall surge in the nitrate content which decreased 2 0 mg l 1 from 5 2 mg l 1 to 3 2 mg l 1 in the samples subjected to biogas the present method involved the simultaneous implementation of two mechanisms 1 nitrogen assimilation by methanotrophs and 2 removal of nitrogen content from reject water by oxidation wherein ammonia was converted into hydroxylamine and nitrite via mmo our analysis of the nitrogen and phosphate content in the sludge showed a higher total nitrogen content in the methanotrophic sludge 8 53 than in the active sludge 5 34 which is ascribed to the high nitrogen requirement for the growth of methanotrophs as established by previous studies kim et al 2019 methylophilus is a denitrification bacterium when methanol is used as the substrate and disappears from a bacterial consortium when methanol is exhausted this has been confirmed by osaka et al 2006 who discovered an association between denitrifying consortia in wwtp sludge samples and the methanol assimilating denitrification activities of methylophilus methylobacillus and aminomonas microbes of the methylophilaceae family through stable isotope probing this is also consistent with our findings in section 3 1 due to the lack of methanol production from methanotrophic activity a sharp decrease in methylophilus was observed when the sludge samples were supplied with only air according to another previous study this bacterium utilizes nitrates and ammonia as the nitrogen sources in converting methanol into formaldehyde using pqq mdh and assimilating formaldehyde via the rump pathway gogleva et al 2010 another dominant species methylophilus rhizosphaerae followed the same mechanism as a strictly aerobic gram negative bacterium madhaiyan et al 2009 methylophilus flavus the dominant species in the present assay is an obligate methanol utilizing gram negative bacterium and was first named and characterized as a strictly aerobic bacterium by gogleva et al 2010 the reaction kinetics of the bacteria consortium in this assay needs further consideration the cellular growth yield coefficient y of the methane and methanol dependent bacterial consortium was 0 42 mg vss mg 1 ch4 and its internal respiration rate constant b was 0 01 day 1 the maximum specific methane utilization rate k max of the bacterial consortium was 0 85 mg ch4 l 1 and the monod half saturation constant k s of the substrate was 0 85 mg ch4 l 1 kinetic data from type i methanotrophs mixed culture obtained by al sayed et al 2018 which was cultivated from waste activated sludge as in the present assay were largely consistent with our calculations but with slightly larger values for y and k s 0 592 gdcw g 1ch4 and 1 04 mgch4 aq l 1 respectively further detail of this calculation is available in appendix b 3 3 variations in the species composition of the bacterial consortium and ammonium removal characteristics with the methane to oxygen ratio variations in the species composition of the bacterial consortium in relation to the methane to oxygen ratio were observed at the 214th hour of batch testing to this end the proportion of the methane and airborne oxygen volume was adjusted by means of the biogas injection volume into the serum bottle headspace the air was replaced every 24 h fig 4 the overall proportion of methanotrophs remained stable in the presence of methane to oxygen ratios of 35 9 34 7 and 35 1 when the methane to oxygen ratio was 1 1 25 1 5 respectively however methylophilus accounted for 32 34 36 42 and 24 82 of the consortium at the methane to oxygen ratio of 1 1 25 and 1 5 respectively the proportion fell substantially to 2 when the methane to oxygen ratio rose to 2 increasing the methane to oxygen ratio up to 1 5 were also associated with a growing proportion of methylomonas among the methanotrophs hernandez et al 2015 discovered that methylobacter becomes dominant at high oxygen tensions in contrast to our findings that an increase in the methane to oxygen ratio up to a certain level is associated with the growing proportion of methylobacter our results are not directly comparable to those of hernandez et al due to the presence of high concentration ammonium in our assay and the different experimental scope of oxygen tensions nonetheless hernandez et al s finding that the relative concentration levels of methane and oxygen have a strong bearing on the species composition of a microbial community is congruent with our observations the methane utilization rate of the bacteria consortium in terms of the methane to oxygen ratio was the highest at 0 098 mgch4 mgmlss 1 under the methane to oxygen ratio of 1 25 table 1 the ammonium removal rate was the highest at 58 2 at a methane to oxygen ratio of 1 25 followed by 52 1 at 1 0 however the removal efficiency fell drastically when the methane to oxygen rate exceeded these levels the ammonium removal rate was only 39 4 at a methane to oxygen ratio of 1 5 based on these findings we maintained a methane to oxygen ratio in the biogas supply of 1 1 5 during the subsequent sbr test aimed at removing ammonium from reject water using a methane and methanol dependent bacteria consortium 3 4 continuous sbr operation a municipal wwtp ilsan terminal wastewater treatment plant ilsan korea was selected for the assay and a detailed analysis of the operational data from the wwtp table s3 shows that reject water generated from the sludge thickener digester and dehydrator flows back into the front end of the primary sedimentation tank along with the influent wastewater that enters the treatment process this supernatant accounted for only 1 3 of the influent liquid however due to its high nitrogen and phosphate content as well as a substantial amount of organic matter it represented 30 50 of nitrogen loading and 20 30 of total phosphate loading the influent wastewater of the target wastewater treatment plant of this study comes from a separated sewer system the wastewater contains large portions of organic components volatile matter 62 80 ash 24 17 combined sewer system seonam stp seoul volatile matter 52 52 ash 39 04 in addition waste liquid from septic tanks for treating night soil and food waste leachate are also treated in the wastewater treatment plant accordingly the digester contains a relatively high organic content and thus the reject water shows a relatively high concentration of ammonium nitrogen most strains of nitrifiers grow optimally at temperatures between 25 and 30 c watson et al 1981 therefore in winter the low water temperature drags down the activation level of nitrifying bacteria which results in a relatively high nitrogen concentration in the discharge from wwtps compared to other seasons observational data from the municipal wwtp in the present study fig s3 also showed deterioration in the water quality when the flow rate of the drainage system became smaller in winter fig 5 illustrates the outcomes from the 152 day sbr operation with reject water that was supplied daily from municipal wwtp using the methane and methanol dependent bacterial consortium as well as biogas each round of the sbr operation consisted of mixing for 6 h 30 min of precipitation and the release of the treated supernatant the ever growing mixed bacterial sludge was periodically discharged to maintain an mlss level of 3 700 4 400 mg l 1 the mean ammonium removal rate was 58 9 8 4 with a mean influent concentration of 877 3 mg l 1 and mean effluent concentration of 359 9 mg l 1 which represents a reduction of approximately 59 in the ammonium content in the reject water that flows back into the wastewater treatment process the municipal wwtp used in this study was characterized by great variations in the ammonium concentration ranging from 388 to 1 468 mg l 1 in its reject water with a mean removal rate of 60 or above when the ammonium concentration was at or below the cut off point of 800 mg l 1 however above this level we witnessed a dramatic decrease in the mean removal rate to 37 6 we suggest that this phenomenon has complex sources either the presence of ammonium above a certain concentration hampers the normal operation of the hydroxylamine and nitrite detoxification mechanism or methanotrophs consumes energy to detoxify hydroxylamine noll et al 2008 qiu et al 2008 wu et al 2009 zheng et al 2014 a recent development in korea titled combining anammox and autotrophic sulfur denitrification processes brings partial nitration anammox and sulfur oxidation denitrification processes to remove nitrogen from reject water using autotrophic microbes kwon et al 2019 however this method also falls into the trap of complicated processes reject water is diluted 2 9 4 3 fold with mainstream effluent before injection into the process to reduce influent t n loading unlike existing methods such as sharon anammox and oland but similar to the recently reported one stage pn a process choi et al 2019 han et al 2018 klaus et al 2017 lackner et al 2014 our novel method for reject water treatment does not require multiple reactors additional carbon sources for aeration and denitrification to partially nitrify ammonium into nitrites or dilution of reject water with wwtp influent or effluent water instead the high concentration ammonium is treated via a single sbr treatment process without dilution we could reduce the ammonium loading caused by its increasing concentration in the wwtp influent water to a significant extent however ammonium content in reject water shows great variations given our findings that ammonium concentrations above the cut off point of 800 mg l 1 leads to a drastic decrease in the mean ammonium removal rate we propose the installation of an additional detention tank in front of the sbr treatment system upon industrial implementation of the present method as a potential solution to the influx of high concentration ammonium that reduces treatment efficiency in our previous study kim et al 2019 the sedimentation properties of the methane oxidation bioreactor mob sludge were comparatively analyzed with activated sludge in a 1000 ml graduated cylinder complete sedimentation of mob sludge occurred within 5 min with a settling tank retention time of 10 min in contrast the activated sludge settling tank retention time would need to be 50 min due to the slow rate of sedimentation of activated sludge the characteristic rapid sedimentation brought about by mob sludge was determined by a much higher eps content than activated sludge resulting in larger particle size in mob sludge 742 μm than in activated sludge 107 μm in the case of a full scale operation only a small amount of sludge is produced by sbr for treating reject water as compared to total sludge of the wastewater treatment plant such a small amount of sludge can be directly fed into an aeration tank or treated in the sludge treatment process of the plant 3 5 conceptualization of the autotrophic denitrification by a methane and methanol dependent bacterial consortium type i methanotrophs remove ammonium through oxidation via two pathways direct assimilation of ammonium and nitrates in reject water as a nitrogen source for its growth and expression of the pmmo enzyme for oxidation of methane into methanol some of which oxidizes ammonium via the same mechanism and pathway as the ammonia monooxygenase amo of aob this similarity is attributed to the fact that amo and mmo are closely related and the gene that encodes pmmo is highly similar to amo genes holmes et al 1995 norton et al 2002 as with amo two metabolic pathways have been discovered for hydroxylamine and nitrites the toxic intermediates of ammonium oxidation stein and klotz 2011 on one hand as in the case of ammonia oxidizers hydroxylamine once generated is first oxidized into nitrites they are reduced to nitric oxide which in turn becomes nitrous oxide fig 6 on the other hand hydroxylamine becomes nitrous oxide via nitric oxide fig 6 some of the hydroxylamine is reduced into ammonia by hydroxylamine reductase enzymes a unique methanotrophic detoxification mechanism stein et al 2010 m flavus and m rhizosphaerae are newly isolated methylotrophic strains characterized as novel species of the genus methylophilus by gogleva et al 2010 who established that they as with methanotrophs use the rump pathway to oxidize methanol produced by methanotrophs into formaldehyde by pqq mdh to assimilate carbon gogleva et al 2010 found that m flavus and m rhizosphaerae assimilate ammonium and nitrates as nitrogen sources for their growth via the glutamate cycle enzymes glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase as for methylophilus which co exists with methanotrophs using the methanol produced by them assimilation of ammonia via glutamate dehydrogenase is more energy efficient than via glutamate synthase thus the recombinant organism converts more growth substrate methanol into cellular carbon windass et al 1980 fig 6 shows a schematic diagram of the possible ammonium removing metabolic pathways from reject water by the methane and methanol dependent bacterial consortium methanotrophs and methylophilus based on previous and present findings denitrification by various consortia of methylotrophs and methanotrophs such as methylophilus is clearly observed as shown by this study however clearer reasons for this correlation beyond the ones elucidated in fig 6 is not yet known this warrants future research endeavors that examine the behavior within the methanotroph and methylophilus cells through labeled nitrogen isotopic probing as well as the behavior of n2o and n2 the final products of the treatment process we also propose further studies on the single cultivation and denitrification characteristics of methylophilus in relation to methanol concentration levels it should also be noted that this study excludes the influence of other inhibitors such as the concentration of copper free ammonia and suspended solids which needs further investigation furthermore although a detailed analysis of the economic aspects of the proposed method should be done the following economic advantages can be considered based on the current study 1 since highly concentrated reject water is not directly treated nor diluted by influent water of the wastewater treatment plant the treatment amount is relatively small and thus a facility with a smaller capacity would be sufficient 2 for municipal wastewater treatment plants which are typically located in an urban area and thus face spatial constraints the site can be efficiently utilized 3 no expensive carbon source for denitrification needs to be additionally injected but only biogas discharged from the anaerobic sludge digester of a wastewater treatment plant is used 4 conclusions methylophilus and methanotrophs represented a high proportion of the species composition of the bacteria consortium cultivated with wwtp reject water and biogas when this consortium was used in the continuous sbr operation with a mean ammonium concentration in the influent water of 877 3 mg l 1 number of observations 105 of these 75 and 30 had concentrations below and above 800 mg l 1 respectively the mean ammonium removal rate was 58 9 8 4 this study uses the coordination mechanism between the component species of the methane and methanol dependent bacterial consortium methanotrophs and methylophilus for the first time and we have confirmed the potential of the present method as efficient means to treat reject water with high concentration ammonium declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18164,unpleasant odor in drinking water is a worldwide substantial issue for consumers and water utilities however its hidden social impact has been ignored as there are no apparent direct health effects compared with other pollutants in this study we developed a method to characterize the adverse effects of a typical odorant based on behavioral responses with the corresponding economic burden illustrated by 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib the dose response based on behavioral responses to odors using a questionnaire was established in consideration of the bandwagon effect results showed that about half of consumers adopted averting behaviors after detecting even very weak odor but generally recognizable in drinking water total economic burden was determined to be 290690 27427 per million people per day by the surcharges arising from consumer averting behavior or additional treatment of drinking water odor among which about 13 of surcharge originated from insensitive people because of bandwagon effect this is the first study to quantify odor hidden risk based on people s behavioral responses using economic burden which provides a useful tool to comparing the risks of different types of pollutants in drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords sensitive subpopulation behavioral responses surcharge socio economic burden zero inflated model 1 introduction olfaction is one of the most important senses for survival by helping to perceive danger and drive intuitive or subconscious level behaviors holland et al 2005 on the other hand herding response to drinking water odor can trigger emergency response at the human community level rao et al 2003 díaz et al 2004 as of year 2014 there were more than 10 documented odor events in the united states usa middleton et al 1956 burlingame et al 1992 noblet et al 1999 young et al 1999 smith et al 2002 dzialowski et al 2009 city of toledo 2014 sain et al 2015 furthermore in china serious drinking water odor events occurred in taihu lake in 2007 li et al 2009 and lanzhou in 2014 dou et al 2014 resulting in the mass purchase of bottled water by residents although odor problem in drinking water can result in enormous social impact e g panic economic loss at the social level and psychological fear regarding water safety mcguire 1995 its hidden social impact are often ignored as most of them have no direct health effects on people in comparison to the chemical pollutants themselves which cause the odorant risk to be underestimated thus it will be useful for environmental management to develop a method to quantify the hidden risk of odor causing compounds to effectively allocate limited public resources in pollution control including pathogens chemicals and odorants most odorants only impact individuals psychologically in regard to decision making processes and subsequent behaviors garcia et al 2018 thus it is critical to quantify these behavioral responses in the risk assessment of odorants in fact the individual s response to odor is an adaptive ability evolved to reduce exposure to negative conditions riddell et al 2005 and includes distrust in water safety and averting behavior um et al 2002 nauges and van 2009 due to the bandwagon effect a psychological phenomenon in which people follow others behaviors regardless of their own beliefs nadeau et al 1993 behavioral responses of sensitive populations to odor in drinking water such as hoarding bottled water can be gradually amplified and even evolve to a crisis point through social network platforms such as facebook twitter wechat and qq howard 2019 therefore hidden risk caused by odorants can be estimated at the social level while individual adverse health was assessed for chemicals or pathogens it plays a critical role to understand the decision making processes and behavioral responses of the population to odor in drinking water questionnaire surveys are an effective way in which to understand the behavior and psychology of consumers güngör demirci et al 2016 and can also be used to explore decision making of residents concerning drinking water odor however research on the risk endpoints of the behavioral responses of people to unpleasant odors in drinking water remains scarce economic burden a term frequently used in medicine to describe losses in individual utility or social welfare caused by ill health both directly and indirectly by decreasing the enjoyment or utility associated with the consumption of goods and services unrelated to health or by compromising other economic objectives world health organization 2009 can help characterize behavioral responses at the social level and has been used to assess the risk of uncontrolled behaviors like crime drink driving and drug addiction baumberg 2006 cartwright 2008 in china people usually drink boiled tap water due to reasons such as taste odor microbial and chemical quality hu et al 2013 some odor causing compounds e g 2 methylisoborneol geosmin is semi volatile which can still exist in boiled water and trigger odor issues in despite of volatilization of odor causing compounds during boiling burlingame and tanjutco 2001 kim et al 2006 in this study the odorant related economic burden was applied as the endpoint to assess odorant hidden risk through the behavioral responses which was illustrated by 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib the most often encountered musty earthy odorant in drinking water the zero inflated model was adopted to deal with 2 mib data with left censored data data below detection limits moulton and halsey 1995 compared to previous studies on the traditional risk assessment methods on chemicals and pathogens our study had the following characteristics i population behavioral responses were proposed to characterize adverse odorant effects in drinking water ii economic burden caused by surcharges resulting from consumer behavioral responses towards drinking water odor problems was identified as the endpoint of odorant risk and iii the zero inflated model was used to deal with odorant data with left censored data in drinking water this study is the first to quantify the social hidden risk of odor causing compounds in drinking water through population behavioral responses our research should provide a useful tool for environmental management to discover the hidden risk and compare the risk of different pollution 2 materials and methods 2 1 diagram for hidden social risk quantification of odor the quantification of odorant risk through economic burden is shown in fig 1 illustrated by 2 mib which include exposure assessment system response and social risk characterization using the classical risk assessment frame considering the existence of quantities of zeros and left censored 2 mib data the first part estimated odorant exposure in drinking water using zero inflated model by maximum likelihood method mle the second part indicated population sensitivity distribution using sensory evaluation which could be further used to calculate the proportion of sensitive subpopulation by combining with exposure assessment then built individual behavioral responses e g bearing complaining to water supply utilities and switching water source to odors using questionnaires in consideration of bandwagon effects through social media the behavioral responses of consumers to varied 2 mib concentrations were also assessed the last part calculated the economic burden due to surcharges resulting from consumer behavioral responses to odor problems in drinking water 2 2 exposure assessment of 2 mib 2 mib mainly occurred from sep to nov every year in a north chinese city city a according to our previous studies su et al 2015 2017 and a total of 101 2 mib finished water data were collected from four drinking water treatment plants dwtp from sept 2015 to oct 2016 showing the regular 2 mib occurrence in drinking water in city a ductile iron pipes were mainly adopted for most of main pipelines in city a and polyvinyl chloride pipes pvc polypropylene random pipes ppr and steel pipes were commonly used for service pipes there were 36 zero data generated from less than the detection limit of 2 ng l the positive non zero part of 2 mib data are assumed to be log normally distributed and natural log transformation was conducted histogram and quantile quantile q q plot were used to observe and check data distribution because the excessive zeros impacted data distribution structure significantly the zero inflated lognormal distribution was used to fit the 2 mib data table 1 eq 1 parameters including mean u e standard deviation σ e and probability of true zero observations p 0 were obtained by mle using the function maxlik in r version 3 6 1 where the values below the censor limit were imputed based on assumed lognormal distribution of values above the censor limit jain et al 2008 in statistics mle obtains parameters of a statistical model which are most likely to generate the observed measurements reducing estimation errors for summary statistics substantially compared to simple substitution methods cole et al 2009 the likelihood function is given in eq 2 in table 1 2 3 odor evaluation here human sensitivity to odor was characterized by the odor threshold concentration otc of 2 mib as determined by three alternative forced choice 3 afc astm international 2004 in total 78 study subjects were recruited from the water utility staff in city a with those exhibiting a lack of sensitivity to odor stimuli excluded spiked samples with an initial 2 mib concentration of 200 ng l were diluted in odor free ultrapure deionized water with each level differing by a dilution factor of two the 3 afc protocol has been described in detail previously guo et al 2016 the q q plot was employed to check the validity of the logarithmic normal distribution assumption for 2 mib threshold values thus providing a visual comparison of the sample quantiles and corresponding theoretical quantiles the otc probability distribution parameters table 1 eq 3 were then assessed by mle the previous studies showed that the slopes of weber fechner plots based on flavor profile analysis fpa of people in different chinese cities have no significant differences rsd 15 yu et al 2014a therefore we applied a slope of 2 31 for individual weber fechner plots table 1 eq 4 of people in the city in the current study the fpa odor intensity scale includes 0 odor free 2 very weak but generally recognizable 4 weak 6 weak to moderate 8 moderate 10 moderate to strong and 12 strong rashash et al 1997 in general the variances of otcs were determined by population odor sensitivity distribution which can be easily estimated by 3 afc thus the intercept variances of weber fechner was replaced by that of otcs of 3 afc which applied monte carlo simulation to incorporate uncertainty in the intercept distribution fig 2 following the distribution of the intercepts a total of 10000 simulations were performed and input into weber fechner curves to obtain the variation of odor intensities the predicted proportion of odor intensities under different 2 mib exposures based on individual weber fechner models was conducted in r 2 4 quantification relation of behavioral responses to odor the quantification of behavioral responses of consumers to drinking water odor were investigated through an online questionnaire generated by wenjuanxing website wjx cn which was sent to residents of city a randomly using a quick response code unstratified by age or sex table a1 factors like length of the questionnaires question positions fan and yan 2010 were considered and 10 questions were finally listed to avoid the risk of becoming bored while answering the questionnaire more than 400 people scanned the quick response code to meet the 95 confidence level at a margin of error of 7 for the population size of city a the participants were asked to declare personal information such as gender age olfactory state and the occasions when they smelt odor in tap water a series of questions about consumer attitudes towards drinking water odor problems were proposed to assess the behavioral responses of consumers to odor issues the data were collected automatically by wenjuanxing website and then downloaded xlsx file for statistics analysis questionnaires contained incomplete contradictive answers as well as those taken less than 40 s were excluded finally a total of 263 valid questionnaires 95 confidence level at a margin of error of 6 were returned consisting of 114 female respondents and 149 male respondents in the age range of teenage 20 1 14 20 30 54 75 30 40 26 62 40 50 11 03 and 50 6 46 people suffering rhinitis were considered to be less sensitive to odor than people without rhinitis as rhinitis has the potential to result in anosmia or poor sensitivity to odor stimuli 2 5 economic burden assessment based on behavioral responses previously economic burden of disease was separated into disease attributable direct medical management and indirect costs output losses and family costs as a consequence of illness sullivan et al 2000 similarly the economic burden of 2 mib was mainly those from indirect economic loss originating from consumer behavioral responses to avoid the odor problems in this study the economic burden of a 2 mib odor episode primarily consisted of two components averting expenditures resulting from switching to bottled water in consideration of the bandwagon effect and costs for odor treatment in dwtps for the first part the proportion of sensitive people was described as the ratio of individual otcs less than the specific 2 mib exposure concentration and was calculated by a double integral based on 2 mib exposure distribution and otc distribution table 1 eq 5 monte carlo simulation was used for uncertainty analysis which comes from the variation of exposure concentrations in the quantification of sensitive population based on the distributions of the concentration data and parameters a total of 10000 simulations were performed the cost of averting behaviors in response to drinking water odor was then determined by table 1 eq 6 including the costs for insensitive people switching to bottled water due to the bandwagon effect powdered activated carbon pac is usually adopted to control seasonable odor problems caused by 2 mib and geosmin cook et al 2001 yu et al 2016 based on this the cost for pac addition was estimated in fig a1 generally the costs for odor elimination during odor episodes depend on the magnitude frequency and occurrence duration for the dwtps in city a a pac dose of 10 15 mg l is usually adopted for 2 mib removal yu et al 2014b thus the potential cost based on a 15 mg l pac dose over 73 days was used to quantify risk table 1 eq 7 3 results and discussion 3 1 derivation of 2 mib probability distribution the probability density and cumulative probability curves of 2 mib concentrations in drinking water are shown in fig 3 according to the q q plot the log transformed 2 mib data fitted a normal distribution reasonably well in general the concentrations of 2 mib ranged from below the detection limit to 26 ng l median value 5 ng l with 36 5 of censored data the fitting p 0 u e and σ e of zero inflated lognormal distribution were 0 35 2 00 and 0 61 with standard error of 0 05 0 08 and 0 06 respectively according to the results about 20 of 2 mib concentration levels were higher than the chinese guideline level of 10 ng l recommended by the standards for drinking water quality gb 5749 2006 previous research has detected 2 mib in about 60 of finished water samples in several chinese cities with a concentration range of n d 32 5 ng l sun et al 2014 though few occurrence data were reported in finished water 2 mib has been problematic in the source drinking water around the world westerhoff et al reported that 2 mib concentrations increased from spring to late summer in three reservoirs in phoenix usa with concentrations of 26 46 ng l westerhoff et al 2005 kishida et al reported that concentrations of 2 mib ranged from n d 40 ng l in 2003 2009 in a typical japanese dwtp kishida et al 2013 3 2 derivation of otc probability distribution the tabulated otc results from 78 subjects ranged from 0 55 ng l to 17 68 ng l with a median of 2 10 ng l as seen in table a2 as shown in the q q plot embedded in fig a2 the points tended to fall on a line indicating that lognormal distribution provided an adequate fit to the data the fitting parameters u o t c 3 a f c and σ o t c 3 a f c were 0 81 and 0 74 with standard error of 0 08 and 0 06 respectively according to fig a2 the odor thresholds of 2 mib varied with an average otc of 2 29 ng l according to lognormal distribution similar results have been reported in philadelphia and the metropolitan water district of southern california where the average otc in water for 2 mib at 45 c was 2 1 ng l mackey et al 2008 while the odor threshold concentration levels of 2 mib in water are reported to vary significantly worldwide they generally range from 5 to 10 ng l worley et al 2003 piriou et al 2009 this may be due to the individual olfactory sensitivity of panelists methodologies used genetics bushdid et al 2014 logan 2014 age and gender of the panelists doty and cameron 2009 rawson et al 2012 odor memory or prior exposure experience wilson and stevenson 2003 köster 2005 and time of day gallagher et al 2015 3 3 behavioral responses to odor problems the behavioral responses of consumers to drinking water odor were investigated in the current study through an online questionnaire in total 33 84 of people suffered rhinitis which is comparable to previous results reported in 2011 indicating that 20 of people suffer allergic rhinitis in city a wang et al 2016 about one third of people perceived unpleasant odor problems in tap water occasionally although others around them were not conscious of the odor people could perceive tap water odor when they washed their face 42 59 had a shower 19 77 and drank boiled or unboiled tap water 46 77 people s behaviors are varied after smelling odor in drinking water such as tolerance accusing for the unpleasant odor or switching to an alternative such as bottled water or household water purification according to fig a3 more females will adopt some averting behaviors compared to males when detecting odor in their drinking water and females in the age range of 20 50 have more responses among those who drank tap water 43 9 of people without rhinitis claimed they would switch to bottled water even when detecting only a very weak odor in tap water and as odor intensity increased more people stopped using tap water and the complaint ratio increased significantly thus resulting in substantial economic and social burdens fig 4 as shown in fig 4 sensitivity to 2 mib varied greatly among individuals under the same exposure concentrations and with the increase in odor exposure concentration more people detected the odor at higher odor intensities when the 2 mib concentration in drinking water was less than 5 ng l it was barely detected by most people very weak odor 22 and weak odor intensity 14 were detected at a 2 mib exposure concentration of 10 ng l almost all people detected odor problems when the 2 mib concentration was within the range of 50 200 ng l and recorded a moderate to strong musty earthy odor which is in accordance with previous reports that 2 mib exposure concentrations of 42 230 ng l yielded a fpa intensity of 8 rashash et al 1997 whelton and dietrich 2004 behavioral responses under different 2 mib exposure concentrations were obtained and used to predict consumer behavioral responses to drinking water odor problems fig 4 when the 2 mib concentration reached 50 ng l 36 2 of consumers not including insensitive people complained about the bad odor and 54 0 switched to bottled water considering the bandwagon effect the proportion of complaints and switching of drinking water increased as those who lacked odor sensitivity also began to respond many factors influence individual decision making in regard to behavioral responses one important factor is the bandwagon effect whereby people tend to have the same opinions and behavioral tendencies nadeau et al 1993 here the responses of sensitive people were spread and amplified which could gradually evolve into a severe social event this was partly illustrated by question 10 in the questionnaire table a1 where consumers ask more people about odor problems before deciding whether to continue drinking tap water even though they are unconscious of it which results in the amplification of odor problems fig 5 the influence of social media is substantial during the amplification process for example during the water crisis of lanzhou in april 2014 there were 8658 news reports with more than 1 09 million comments and more than 0 5 million micro blog users participating in the discussion bao 2014 the behavioral responses of consumers are also affected by reference dependence preferences according to behavioral economic theory santos and chen 2009 bhatia and golman 2019 people will make the most cost effective decisions which will gain maximum satisfaction or utility under economic constraints opryszko 2012 it means that though the surcharge for changing drinking water would cause the same economic loss for different people the financial and psychological burden of which was varied with the different references compared to families with high incomes a family with low income believes that the surcharge for switching to bottled water causes sizable economic burden reports have showed that income would constrain purchasing bottled water for low income family mcspirit and reid 2011 besides convenience of purchasing water also affects the decision for purchasing bottled water ward et al 2009 it is also worth noting that long term exposure to odor problems may reduce the olfactory sensitivity which would impact people s behaviors towards odor problems in tap water knasko 1996 dalton 2000 thus the questionnaires were sent to different local residents in corresponding water supply service areas 3 4 determination of odor risk by economic burden in the current study the sensitive population that can perceive very weak odor in drinking water was 16 6 1 8 which was calculated by a double integral based on 2 mib exposure distribution and otc distribution table 1 eq 5 overall the averted expenditures caused by switching to bottled water were 286194 25874 per million people per day table 1 eq 6 with 13 of surcharge from insensitive people because of bandwagon effect this illustrated that bandwagon effect was an important factor influencing the decision making of consumers the cost for odor treatment pac addition was 4496 1553 per million people per day table 1 eq 7 which was about 1 50 times lower than the surcharge for switching to bottled water thus the total 2 mib economic burden was 290690 27427 per million people per day economic burden as the endpoint of odor risk can be directly compared with other health related risk factors the economic burden of 2 mib is about 5 times of the economic burden of haloacetic acids and total trihalomethanes in drinking water of china and is comparable to the economic burden of arsenic 238200 per million people per day as reported by pan et al pan 2014 similarly fluoride in drinking water leads to a non lethal effect its economic burden is very high 898500 per million people per day these results indicate that although pollutants like odor causing compounds or fluoride in drinking water can lead to non lethal effects in humans their social risks are still worth attention in fact the surcharges arising from averting behaviors or additional treatment because of odor problems in drinking water are considerable suffet et al 2004 güngör demirci et al 2016 dodds et al estimated that more than us813 million is spent annually on bottled water due to odor problems potentially linked to algae in the usa dodds et al 2009 furthermore us8 5 million was spent on ozone equipment to control taste and odor problems in the water supply system in wichita usa the anderson regional joint water system spent about us500 000 on pac treatment to eliminate odor problems in 2014 huddleston et al 2015 despite the high price compared to tap water bottled water consumption has increased worldwide during the last three decades doria 2006 yilkal et al 2019 which is partly associated with unpleasant odor problems there is pronounced policy interest in the quantification of the economic burden of pollutants particularly in regard to water quality aesthetics and health outcomes and in understanding how consumers respond to problems in drinking water using human behavior responses to characterize the possible risk for chemicals should be valued as traditional health based risk assessment often lowers the risk of pollutants associated with enormous socio economic burdens for chemicals with both aesthetic and health effects further study covering behavioral responses psychological aspects and health effects should be considered 4 conclusion in this study hidden social risk from exposure of 2 mib was assessed following the traditional risk assessment frame the proportion of sensitive subpopulation to 2 mib was determined by combing the population sensitivity distribution u o r g 3 a f c 0 81 σ o t c 3 a f c 0 74 ng l with 2 mib exposure distribution p 0 0 35 u e 2 00 σ e 0 61 total economic burden was determined to be 290690 27427 per million people per day by the surcharges arising from consumer averting behavior or additional treatment of drinking water odor among which about 13 of surcharge

18164,unpleasant odor in drinking water is a worldwide substantial issue for consumers and water utilities however its hidden social impact has been ignored as there are no apparent direct health effects compared with other pollutants in this study we developed a method to characterize the adverse effects of a typical odorant based on behavioral responses with the corresponding economic burden illustrated by 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib the dose response based on behavioral responses to odors using a questionnaire was established in consideration of the bandwagon effect results showed that about half of consumers adopted averting behaviors after detecting even very weak odor but generally recognizable in drinking water total economic burden was determined to be 290690 27427 per million people per day by the surcharges arising from consumer averting behavior or additional treatment of drinking water odor among which about 13 of surcharge originated from insensitive people because of bandwagon effect this is the first study to quantify odor hidden risk based on people s behavioral responses using economic burden which provides a useful tool to comparing the risks of different types of pollutants in drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords sensitive subpopulation behavioral responses surcharge socio economic burden zero inflated model 1 introduction olfaction is one of the most important senses for survival by helping to perceive danger and drive intuitive or subconscious level behaviors holland et al 2005 on the other hand herding response to drinking water odor can trigger emergency response at the human community level rao et al 2003 díaz et al 2004 as of year 2014 there were more than 10 documented odor events in the united states usa middleton et al 1956 burlingame et al 1992 noblet et al 1999 young et al 1999 smith et al 2002 dzialowski et al 2009 city of toledo 2014 sain et al 2015 furthermore in china serious drinking water odor events occurred in taihu lake in 2007 li et al 2009 and lanzhou in 2014 dou et al 2014 resulting in the mass purchase of bottled water by residents although odor problem in drinking water can result in enormous social impact e g panic economic loss at the social level and psychological fear regarding water safety mcguire 1995 its hidden social impact are often ignored as most of them have no direct health effects on people in comparison to the chemical pollutants themselves which cause the odorant risk to be underestimated thus it will be useful for environmental management to develop a method to quantify the hidden risk of odor causing compounds to effectively allocate limited public resources in pollution control including pathogens chemicals and odorants most odorants only impact individuals psychologically in regard to decision making processes and subsequent behaviors garcia et al 2018 thus it is critical to quantify these behavioral responses in the risk assessment of odorants in fact the individual s response to odor is an adaptive ability evolved to reduce exposure to negative conditions riddell et al 2005 and includes distrust in water safety and averting behavior um et al 2002 nauges and van 2009 due to the bandwagon effect a psychological phenomenon in which people follow others behaviors regardless of their own beliefs nadeau et al 1993 behavioral responses of sensitive populations to odor in drinking water such as hoarding bottled water can be gradually amplified and even evolve to a crisis point through social network platforms such as facebook twitter wechat and qq howard 2019 therefore hidden risk caused by odorants can be estimated at the social level while individual adverse health was assessed for chemicals or pathogens it plays a critical role to understand the decision making processes and behavioral responses of the population to odor in drinking water questionnaire surveys are an effective way in which to understand the behavior and psychology of consumers güngör demirci et al 2016 and can also be used to explore decision making of residents concerning drinking water odor however research on the risk endpoints of the behavioral responses of people to unpleasant odors in drinking water remains scarce economic burden a term frequently used in medicine to describe losses in individual utility or social welfare caused by ill health both directly and indirectly by decreasing the enjoyment or utility associated with the consumption of goods and services unrelated to health or by compromising other economic objectives world health organization 2009 can help characterize behavioral responses at the social level and has been used to assess the risk of uncontrolled behaviors like crime drink driving and drug addiction baumberg 2006 cartwright 2008 in china people usually drink boiled tap water due to reasons such as taste odor microbial and chemical quality hu et al 2013 some odor causing compounds e g 2 methylisoborneol geosmin is semi volatile which can still exist in boiled water and trigger odor issues in despite of volatilization of odor causing compounds during boiling burlingame and tanjutco 2001 kim et al 2006 in this study the odorant related economic burden was applied as the endpoint to assess odorant hidden risk through the behavioral responses which was illustrated by 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib the most often encountered musty earthy odorant in drinking water the zero inflated model was adopted to deal with 2 mib data with left censored data data below detection limits moulton and halsey 1995 compared to previous studies on the traditional risk assessment methods on chemicals and pathogens our study had the following characteristics i population behavioral responses were proposed to characterize adverse odorant effects in drinking water ii economic burden caused by surcharges resulting from consumer behavioral responses towards drinking water odor problems was identified as the endpoint of odorant risk and iii the zero inflated model was used to deal with odorant data with left censored data in drinking water this study is the first to quantify the social hidden risk of odor causing compounds in drinking water through population behavioral responses our research should provide a useful tool for environmental management to discover the hidden risk and compare the risk of different pollution 2 materials and methods 2 1 diagram for hidden social risk quantification of odor the quantification of odorant risk through economic burden is shown in fig 1 illustrated by 2 mib which include exposure assessment system response and social risk characterization using the classical risk assessment frame considering the existence of quantities of zeros and left censored 2 mib data the first part estimated odorant exposure in drinking water using zero inflated model by maximum likelihood method mle the second part indicated population sensitivity distribution using sensory evaluation which could be further used to calculate the proportion of sensitive subpopulation by combining with exposure assessment then built individual behavioral responses e g bearing complaining to water supply utilities and switching water source to odors using questionnaires in consideration of bandwagon effects through social media the behavioral responses of consumers to varied 2 mib concentrations were also assessed the last part calculated the economic burden due to surcharges resulting from consumer behavioral responses to odor problems in drinking water 2 2 exposure assessment of 2 mib 2 mib mainly occurred from sep to nov every year in a north chinese city city a according to our previous studies su et al 2015 2017 and a total of 101 2 mib finished water data were collected from four drinking water treatment plants dwtp from sept 2015 to oct 2016 showing the regular 2 mib occurrence in drinking water in city a ductile iron pipes were mainly adopted for most of main pipelines in city a and polyvinyl chloride pipes pvc polypropylene random pipes ppr and steel pipes were commonly used for service pipes there were 36 zero data generated from less than the detection limit of 2 ng l the positive non zero part of 2 mib data are assumed to be log normally distributed and natural log transformation was conducted histogram and quantile quantile q q plot were used to observe and check data distribution because the excessive zeros impacted data distribution structure significantly the zero inflated lognormal distribution was used to fit the 2 mib data table 1 eq 1 parameters including mean u e standard deviation σ e and probability of true zero observations p 0 were obtained by mle using the function maxlik in r version 3 6 1 where the values below the censor limit were imputed based on assumed lognormal distribution of values above the censor limit jain et al 2008 in statistics mle obtains parameters of a statistical model which are most likely to generate the observed measurements reducing estimation errors for summary statistics substantially compared to simple substitution methods cole et al 2009 the likelihood function is given in eq 2 in table 1 2 3 odor evaluation here human sensitivity to odor was characterized by the odor threshold concentration otc of 2 mib as determined by three alternative forced choice 3 afc astm international 2004 in total 78 study subjects were recruited from the water utility staff in city a with those exhibiting a lack of sensitivity to odor stimuli excluded spiked samples with an initial 2 mib concentration of 200 ng l were diluted in odor free ultrapure deionized water with each level differing by a dilution factor of two the 3 afc protocol has been described in detail previously guo et al 2016 the q q plot was employed to check the validity of the logarithmic normal distribution assumption for 2 mib threshold values thus providing a visual comparison of the sample quantiles and corresponding theoretical quantiles the otc probability distribution parameters table 1 eq 3 were then assessed by mle the previous studies showed that the slopes of weber fechner plots based on flavor profile analysis fpa of people in different chinese cities have no significant differences rsd 15 yu et al 2014a therefore we applied a slope of 2 31 for individual weber fechner plots table 1 eq 4 of people in the city in the current study the fpa odor intensity scale includes 0 odor free 2 very weak but generally recognizable 4 weak 6 weak to moderate 8 moderate 10 moderate to strong and 12 strong rashash et al 1997 in general the variances of otcs were determined by population odor sensitivity distribution which can be easily estimated by 3 afc thus the intercept variances of weber fechner was replaced by that of otcs of 3 afc which applied monte carlo simulation to incorporate uncertainty in the intercept distribution fig 2 following the distribution of the intercepts a total of 10000 simulations were performed and input into weber fechner curves to obtain the variation of odor intensities the predicted proportion of odor intensities under different 2 mib exposures based on individual weber fechner models was conducted in r 2 4 quantification relation of behavioral responses to odor the quantification of behavioral responses of consumers to drinking water odor were investigated through an online questionnaire generated by wenjuanxing website wjx cn which was sent to residents of city a randomly using a quick response code unstratified by age or sex table a1 factors like length of the questionnaires question positions fan and yan 2010 were considered and 10 questions were finally listed to avoid the risk of becoming bored while answering the questionnaire more than 400 people scanned the quick response code to meet the 95 confidence level at a margin of error of 7 for the population size of city a the participants were asked to declare personal information such as gender age olfactory state and the occasions when they smelt odor in tap water a series of questions about consumer attitudes towards drinking water odor problems were proposed to assess the behavioral responses of consumers to odor issues the data were collected automatically by wenjuanxing website and then downloaded xlsx file for statistics analysis questionnaires contained incomplete contradictive answers as well as those taken less than 40 s were excluded finally a total of 263 valid questionnaires 95 confidence level at a margin of error of 6 were returned consisting of 114 female respondents and 149 male respondents in the age range of teenage 20 1 14 20 30 54 75 30 40 26 62 40 50 11 03 and 50 6 46 people suffering rhinitis were considered to be less sensitive to odor than people without rhinitis as rhinitis has the potential to result in anosmia or poor sensitivity to odor stimuli 2 5 economic burden assessment based on behavioral responses previously economic burden of disease was separated into disease attributable direct medical management and indirect costs output losses and family costs as a consequence of illness sullivan et al 2000 similarly the economic burden of 2 mib was mainly those from indirect economic loss originating from consumer behavioral responses to avoid the odor problems in this study the economic burden of a 2 mib odor episode primarily consisted of two components averting expenditures resulting from switching to bottled water in consideration of the bandwagon effect and costs for odor treatment in dwtps for the first part the proportion of sensitive people was described as the ratio of individual otcs less than the specific 2 mib exposure concentration and was calculated by a double integral based on 2 mib exposure distribution and otc distribution table 1 eq 5 monte carlo simulation was used for uncertainty analysis which comes from the variation of exposure concentrations in the quantification of sensitive population based on the distributions of the concentration data and parameters a total of 10000 simulations were performed the cost of averting behaviors in response to drinking water odor was then determined by table 1 eq 6 including the costs for insensitive people switching to bottled water due to the bandwagon effect powdered activated carbon pac is usually adopted to control seasonable odor problems caused by 2 mib and geosmin cook et al 2001 yu et al 2016 based on this the cost for pac addition was estimated in fig a1 generally the costs for odor elimination during odor episodes depend on the magnitude frequency and occurrence duration for the dwtps in city a a pac dose of 10 15 mg l is usually adopted for 2 mib removal yu et al 2014b thus the potential cost based on a 15 mg l pac dose over 73 days was used to quantify risk table 1 eq 7 3 results and discussion 3 1 derivation of 2 mib probability distribution the probability density and cumulative probability curves of 2 mib concentrations in drinking water are shown in fig 3 according to the q q plot the log transformed 2 mib data fitted a normal distribution reasonably well in general the concentrations of 2 mib ranged from below the detection limit to 26 ng l median value 5 ng l with 36 5 of censored data the fitting p 0 u e and σ e of zero inflated lognormal distribution were 0 35 2 00 and 0 61 with standard error of 0 05 0 08 and 0 06 respectively according to the results about 20 of 2 mib concentration levels were higher than the chinese guideline level of 10 ng l recommended by the standards for drinking water quality gb 5749 2006 previous research has detected 2 mib in about 60 of finished water samples in several chinese cities with a concentration range of n d 32 5 ng l sun et al 2014 though few occurrence data were reported in finished water 2 mib has been problematic in the source drinking water around the world westerhoff et al reported that 2 mib concentrations increased from spring to late summer in three reservoirs in phoenix usa with concentrations of 26 46 ng l westerhoff et al 2005 kishida et al reported that concentrations of 2 mib ranged from n d 40 ng l in 2003 2009 in a typical japanese dwtp kishida et al 2013 3 2 derivation of otc probability distribution the tabulated otc results from 78 subjects ranged from 0 55 ng l to 17 68 ng l with a median of 2 10 ng l as seen in table a2 as shown in the q q plot embedded in fig a2 the points tended to fall on a line indicating that lognormal distribution provided an adequate fit to the data the fitting parameters u o t c 3 a f c and σ o t c 3 a f c were 0 81 and 0 74 with standard error of 0 08 and 0 06 respectively according to fig a2 the odor thresholds of 2 mib varied with an average otc of 2 29 ng l according to lognormal distribution similar results have been reported in philadelphia and the metropolitan water district of southern california where the average otc in water for 2 mib at 45 c was 2 1 ng l mackey et al 2008 while the odor threshold concentration levels of 2 mib in water are reported to vary significantly worldwide they generally range from 5 to 10 ng l worley et al 2003 piriou et al 2009 this may be due to the individual olfactory sensitivity of panelists methodologies used genetics bushdid et al 2014 logan 2014 age and gender of the panelists doty and cameron 2009 rawson et al 2012 odor memory or prior exposure experience wilson and stevenson 2003 köster 2005 and time of day gallagher et al 2015 3 3 behavioral responses to odor problems the behavioral responses of consumers to drinking water odor were investigated in the current study through an online questionnaire in total 33 84 of people suffered rhinitis which is comparable to previous results reported in 2011 indicating that 20 of people suffer allergic rhinitis in city a wang et al 2016 about one third of people perceived unpleasant odor problems in tap water occasionally although others around them were not conscious of the odor people could perceive tap water odor when they washed their face 42 59 had a shower 19 77 and drank boiled or unboiled tap water 46 77 people s behaviors are varied after smelling odor in drinking water such as tolerance accusing for the unpleasant odor or switching to an alternative such as bottled water or household water purification according to fig a3 more females will adopt some averting behaviors compared to males when detecting odor in their drinking water and females in the age range of 20 50 have more responses among those who drank tap water 43 9 of people without rhinitis claimed they would switch to bottled water even when detecting only a very weak odor in tap water and as odor intensity increased more people stopped using tap water and the complaint ratio increased significantly thus resulting in substantial economic and social burdens fig 4 as shown in fig 4 sensitivity to 2 mib varied greatly among individuals under the same exposure concentrations and with the increase in odor exposure concentration more people detected the odor at higher odor intensities when the 2 mib concentration in drinking water was less than 5 ng l it was barely detected by most people very weak odor 22 and weak odor intensity 14 were detected at a 2 mib exposure concentration of 10 ng l almost all people detected odor problems when the 2 mib concentration was within the range of 50 200 ng l and recorded a moderate to strong musty earthy odor which is in accordance with previous reports that 2 mib exposure concentrations of 42 230 ng l yielded a fpa intensity of 8 rashash et al 1997 whelton and dietrich 2004 behavioral responses under different 2 mib exposure concentrations were obtained and used to predict consumer behavioral responses to drinking water odor problems fig 4 when the 2 mib concentration reached 50 ng l 36 2 of consumers not including insensitive people complained about the bad odor and 54 0 switched to bottled water considering the bandwagon effect the proportion of complaints and switching of drinking water increased as those who lacked odor sensitivity also began to respond many factors influence individual decision making in regard to behavioral responses one important factor is the bandwagon effect whereby people tend to have the same opinions and behavioral tendencies nadeau et al 1993 here the responses of sensitive people were spread and amplified which could gradually evolve into a severe social event this was partly illustrated by question 10 in the questionnaire table a1 where consumers ask more people about odor problems before deciding whether to continue drinking tap water even though they are unconscious of it which results in the amplification of odor problems fig 5 the influence of social media is substantial during the amplification process for example during the water crisis of lanzhou in april 2014 there were 8658 news reports with more than 1 09 million comments and more than 0 5 million micro blog users participating in the discussion bao 2014 the behavioral responses of consumers are also affected by reference dependence preferences according to behavioral economic theory santos and chen 2009 bhatia and golman 2019 people will make the most cost effective decisions which will gain maximum satisfaction or utility under economic constraints opryszko 2012 it means that though the surcharge for changing drinking water would cause the same economic loss for different people the financial and psychological burden of which was varied with the different references compared to families with high incomes a family with low income believes that the surcharge for switching to bottled water causes sizable economic burden reports have showed that income would constrain purchasing bottled water for low income family mcspirit and reid 2011 besides convenience of purchasing water also affects the decision for purchasing bottled water ward et al 2009 it is also worth noting that long term exposure to odor problems may reduce the olfactory sensitivity which would impact people s behaviors towards odor problems in tap water knasko 1996 dalton 2000 thus the questionnaires were sent to different local residents in corresponding water supply service areas 3 4 determination of odor risk by economic burden in the current study the sensitive population that can perceive very weak odor in drinking water was 16 6 1 8 which was calculated by a double integral based on 2 mib exposure distribution and otc distribution table 1 eq 5 overall the averted expenditures caused by switching to bottled water were 286194 25874 per million people per day table 1 eq 6 with 13 of surcharge from insensitive people because of bandwagon effect this illustrated that bandwagon effect was an important factor influencing the decision making of consumers the cost for odor treatment pac addition was 4496 1553 per million people per day table 1 eq 7 which was about 1 50 times lower than the surcharge for switching to bottled water thus the total 2 mib economic burden was 290690 27427 per million people per day economic burden as the endpoint of odor risk can be directly compared with other health related risk factors the economic burden of 2 mib is about 5 times of the economic burden of haloacetic acids and total trihalomethanes in drinking water of china and is comparable to the economic burden of arsenic 238200 per million people per day as reported by pan et al pan 2014 similarly fluoride in drinking water leads to a non lethal effect its economic burden is very high 898500 per million people per day these results indicate that although pollutants like odor causing compounds or fluoride in drinking water can lead to non lethal effects in humans their social risks are still worth attention in fact the surcharges arising from averting behaviors or additional treatment because of odor problems in drinking water are considerable suffet et al 2004 güngör demirci et al 2016 dodds et al estimated that more than us813 million is spent annually on bottled water due to odor problems potentially linked to algae in the usa dodds et al 2009 furthermore us8 5 million was spent on ozone equipment to control taste and odor problems in the water supply system in wichita usa the anderson regional joint water system spent about us500 000 on pac treatment to eliminate odor problems in 2014 huddleston et al 2015 despite the high price compared to tap water bottled water consumption has increased worldwide during the last three decades doria 2006 yilkal et al 2019 which is partly associated with unpleasant odor problems there is pronounced policy interest in the quantification of the economic burden of pollutants particularly in regard to water quality aesthetics and health outcomes and in understanding how consumers respond to problems in drinking water using human behavior responses to characterize the possible risk for chemicals should be valued as traditional health based risk assessment often lowers the risk of pollutants associated with enormous socio economic burdens for chemicals with both aesthetic and health effects further study covering behavioral responses psychological aspects and health effects should be considered 4 conclusion in this study hidden social risk from exposure of 2 mib was assessed following the traditional risk assessment frame the proportion of sensitive subpopulation to 2 mib was determined by combing the population sensitivity distribution u o r g 3 a f c 0 81 σ o t c 3 a f c 0 74 ng l with 2 mib exposure distribution p 0 0 35 u e 2 00 σ e 0 61 total economic burden was determined to be 290690 27427 per million people per day by the surcharges arising from consumer averting behavior or additional treatment of drinking water odor among which about 13 of surcharge originated from insensitive people because of bandwagon effect this study attempted to use human behavioral responses for the risk assessment of odor causing compounds in drinking water which will
