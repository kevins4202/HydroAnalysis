3345,understanding the propagation dynamics from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts and their spatial temporal evolution is essential for monitoring and assessing groundwater drought risk in this study the standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei and gravity recovery and climate experiment grace groundwater drought index gdi were used for assessing meteorological and groundwater droughts respectively in the north china plain ncp the directed information transfer index diti was used to identify the propagation from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts the verification results indicated good reliability of grace data for assessing drought events in the ncp from the view of temporal variation the spei 1 was first decreased and then increased and the minimum value was in 2011 the gdi was first increased and then decreased and the maximum was in 2008 in terms of spatial distribution the spei 1 significantly decreased in the central part of the ncp before 2011 the 2011 2020 period revealed an increasing trend in spei 1 in many parts of the ncp according to the gdi results an increasing trend was observed in the central and western parts of the ncp before 2008 and many parts of the study region revealed a decreasing trend in gdi during the 2008 2020 period the propagation time of spei 1 to gdi was long in spring and winter and short in summer the maximum diti values ranged from 0 4 to 0 9 and the most spread time was about 18 to 24 months in the northern and southern parts of hebei and the northern part of henan province covering 36 40 of the total surface area of the ncp regarding the drought sensitivity and propagation rate the dominated distribution was in a pattern of high in the northern and low in southern parts of the ncp with the rates of 38 44 and 34 17 respectively keywords meteorological drought groundwater drought spatial temporal evolution propagation characteristics north china plain 1 introduction for the

cao et al 2022 easterling et al 2000 wu et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 drought is one of the common natural disasters across the globe droughts usually have a large scale of influence that persists for a long time leading to significant negative impacts on agricultural production socioeconomic development ecosystems and human environmental interactions um et al 2018 wang et al 2019 the water shortage crisis caused by droughts threatens not only the development of agricultural and industrial productions but also affects human life land desertification and ecological stability wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2019a zhao et al 2019b zhou et al 2021 efforts on drought monitoring and its early warning are the foundation for effective drought policies droughts can be traditionally classified into meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic droughts depending on the type of water deficit ams 2013 another type developing of drought called groundwater drought has received growing attention thomas et al 2017 wang et al 2022 groundwater drought is caused by overexploitation of groundwater from human activities van lanen and peters 2000 thomas et al 2017 groundwater drought monitoring is based mainly on well point data collections wang et al 2020a however the accuracy of this method depends on the number of available wells and their spatial distribution currently long term observation data is limited despite several recent projects e g national groundwater monitoring project in china have been implemented to enhance well points density yan and zhou 2017 it has been challenging to assess the groundwater drought dynamic at a large scale in many areas long et al 2015 some researchers have attempted employing hydrological models to assess the groundwater drought but uncertainties in inputs would lead to inaccurate results shen et al 2015 the development of remote sensing techniques makes it possible to assess groundwater drought for the large scale area wang et al 2022 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites launched in march 2002 have provided a powerful tool for monitoring the groundwater drought from space loon et al 2017 thomas et al 2017 wang et al 2020a developed a groundwater drought index based on the grace data and demonstrated that the index was increasing at a rate of 0 0091 month in the north china plain ncp during 2003 2015 li et al 2019 found that groundwater drought indicators based on grace data assimilation agreed with other regional drought indicators recent studies demonstrated close relations among different types of droughts barker et al 2016 ding et al 2021 fang et al 2020 xu et al 2021 globally groundwater drought is caused by meteorological drought meteorological drought may lead to a decline in soil moisture and surface water resources in such a case significantly more groundwater would be used to meet the needs of agriculture industry and daily life resulting in groundwater drought especially during dry periods abhishek and kinouchi 2021 han et al 2021 compared with surface water groundwater respond to precipitation variability or other meteorological conditions in a slower manner it is difficult to accurately assess the variability of groundwater levels at the beginning of agricultural or hydrological droughts changnon et al 1988 han et al 2021 several authors have found strong relationships between groundwater and meteorological droughts han et al 2021 reported the relationship between meteorological and groundwater droughts in the xijiang river basin of china and revealed that the propagation time ranged from 8 to 42 months kumar et al 2016 reported that standardized precipitation index spi was an inadequate indicator of groundwater drought and regional hydrogeological characteristics should be considered in these studies the variation of groundwater drought and the relationship between groundwater drought and meteorological drought were considered linear the relationship however can be nonlinear zhou et al 2021 few studies have been carried out to assess the response time of groundwater drought to meteorological drought from the point of non linear relationship li et al 2020 liu et al 2016a liu et al 2016b liu et al 2016c zhang et al 2021 in the ncp 67 79 of the total water consumption and 62 9 of the total agricultural irrigation water come from groundwater chen et al 2020 groundwater overuse has become a growing concern in this region resulting in a decline of 0 3 m yr over the ncp cao et al 2016 numerous reports showed that the frequency duration and severity of droughts in the ncp are expected to increase liu et al 2018a wang et al 2018 in this context a systematic investigation of groundwater drought characteristics and propagation from meteorological to groundwater drought considering the nonlinear dependence has not been carried out the present study aims to assess the spatial temporal evolution patterns of meteorological and groundwater droughts by using standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei and grace groundwater drought index gdi and to determine the response time from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts using a non linear method specifically the prime objectives are 1 to assess the precision of grace results in

forest grassland water bodies and urban area fig 1b with population growth and industrial and agricultural developments water resource shortage has long been the main factor hindering economic development in the ncp wang et al 2020a global warming and groundwater extraction practices in recent decades have further intensified the meteorological and groundwater drought events feng et al 2013

legacy of tracking earth s water movement across the planet the time span of the grace follow on data used in the study range from may 2018 to december 2020 with a same spatial temporal resolution with the grace data linear interpolation was used to make up for the missing data in grace and grace follow on wang et al 2020a 2 2 2 gldas data the global land data assimilation system gldas dataset is a cooperative program developed by nasa national centers for environmental prediction ncep and national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa rodell et al 2004 wang et al 2020a gldas uses

https disc gsfc nasa gov 2 2 3 auxiliary data the monthly precipitation and temperature data observed during 2003 to 2020 period by 77 meteorological stations located in the ncp were supplied by china meteorological data service centre http data cma cn the collected data were first checked for accuracy and then used in current study wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b the land use data with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km was supplied by the resources and environmental science data center of china fig 1b https www resdc cn 2 3 methods 2 3 1 spei calculation the spei is a meteorological drought index developed by vicente serrano et al 2010 this index serves to determine the water budget deficit and surplus taking into account monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration compared with other meteorological drought indexes spei not only combines the advantages of the palmer drought severity index pdsi and spi but provides simpler calculation wang et al 2020b positive and negative values of the spei indicate wet and dry conditions respectively in this study the thornthwaite equation was used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration thornthwaite 1948 the difference between reference evapotranspiration and precipitation p for the month i is calculated as follows 1 d i p i p e t i the obtained di values are aggregated at different timescales following the same procedure as that for the commonly used spei the d i l is the l month of all months used in the calculation in the year i the difference d i j k on a given month j and year i depends on the chosen timescale k month for instance the accumulated difference for l month in a particular year i with a 12 month timescale or other timescales is calculated as follows 2 x i j k l 13 k j 12 d i 1 l l 1 j d i l if j k and x i j k l j k 1 j d i l if j k where di j indicates the difference between p and pet in month l year i then the probability distribution function of the d series can be showed as 3 f x 1 α x γ β 1 where α is the scale β is the shape and γ is the origin the spei can be calculated as follows 4 spei w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 p 0 5 spei c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2

189269 and d3 0 001308 respectively detailed grading can be found in table 1 2 3 2 gdi calculation the gdi was used to characterize groundwater drought this index represents the deviation in groundwater volume storage according to seasonal variability compared with grace dsi gdi removes the seasonal effects and can better evaluate groundwater drought wang et al 2020a the calculation steps as follows 1 the groundwater storage anomalies gsa were calculated by the water budget 5 gsa t w s a s c w s a s m s a s w e a where twsa is terrestrial water storage anomalies scwsa smsa and swea are the surface canopy water storage anomalies soil moisture storage anomalies and snow water equivalent anomalies respectively these data were provided by gldas model 2 monthly climatology mj can be calculated as follows 6 m j 1 n j 1 n j gs a j where mj indicates the climatology for month j j 1 2 12 3 groundwater storage deviation gsd was calculated as follows 7 gs d j g s a j m j 4 groundwater drought index gdi was calculated as follows 8 gd i i j gs d i j gsd s gsd where i is year from 2003 to 2020 gsd is mean value of gsd in month j and sgsd is the standard deviation of gsd in month j detailed grading can be found in table 1 the result of monthly climatology mj can be found in fig s1 2 3 3 ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd multi scale or multi level droughts need to be analyzed due to their complex nonlinear system zhu et al 2021 eemd is an effective method for dealing with nonlinear and non stationary time series this method is an improved method of empirical mode decomposition emd which has been widely used in meteorological agricultural hydrological and groundwater drought studies to overcome the problem of mode mixing in emd an appropriate white noise was added to the original observation data to simulate several scenarios and perform calculations after repeated average ensemble in this research the eemd was used to decompose the monthly spei and gdi from 2003 to 2020 into different intrinsic mode functions imfi and trend components resi the specific decomposition process is as follows 8 im f j t 1 m i 1 m im f ij t 9 res t 1 m i 1 m re s i t 10 x t j 1 j im f j t re s t where imfj t and res t is the jth component intrinsic mode functions imf and term of the trend respectively m is the number of times the white noise is added j is the total number of imfs 2 3 4 directed information transfer index diti to assess the effect of meteorological drought to groundwater drought the diti was used due to the significant seasonal difference of the propagation time a year was divided into spring march to may summer june to august autumn september to november and winter december to february of the next year the diti can be calculated as below shi et al 2018 zhou et al 2021 1 suppose we have two continuous random variables x and y joint distribution of them is fx y x y and marginal distributions of x and y are fx x and fy y the formula of their information entropy is calculated as follows zhou et al 2021 11 h x s f x log f x x 12 h y s f y log f y y the mutual information mi of x and y can be defined as follows 13 i x y s f x y x y log f x y x y f x x f y y the diti from information source x meteorological drought to information function point y groundwater drought is calculated as follows 14 diti x y i x y h y where x and y are the information source and information function point in this work meteorological drought and groundwater drought are used as the information source and information function point respectively 2 3 5 drought propagation rate as a result of the natural and social conditions of basin itself meteorological drought may not lead to groundwater drought zhou et al 2021 to measure the drought propagation degree the sensitivity of groundwater drought to meteorological drought and the drought propagation rate from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts were used to evaluate the characteristics of drought propagation guo et al 2020 15 t s n t n g 16 t t n t n m where ts and tt denotes the sensitivity of groundwater drought to meteorological drought and drought propagation rate respectively nt ng and nm is the total times of meteorological drought triggering groundwater drought the number of groundwater droughts and the total times of meteorological drought respectively 3 results 3 1 grace verification to validate the reliability of the grace twsa the gldas hydrological model and precipitation data were used the water storage change wsc was used to represent the sum of scwsa smsa and swea from gldas model the results showed that the twsa and wsc variations ranged from 233 50 to 92 23 mm and from 83 92 to 96 15 mm using grace and gldas during the 2003 2020 period respectively fig 2 a and 2b this difference of variation in twsa and wsc may be due to the sum of surface water and groundwater storages considered by grace whereas gldas includes only surface water in water storage monitoring wang et al 2020a the twsa of the whole ncp indicated an overall downward trend 0 027 mm month the downward trends were different for the two periods i e 2003 2014 0 024 mm month and 2015 2020 0 039 mm month fig 2a the wsc of the whole ncp also indicated an overall downward trend 0 003 mm month with different change trends for the two periods i e 2003 2014 0 01 mm month and 2015 2020 0 015 mm month fig 2b according to the monthly twsa and wsc values obtained during the 2003 2020 period in the ncp a significant positive correlation between twsa and wsc was observed r 0 51 p 0 05 fig 2c the correlation coefficient reached 0 83 p 0 01 and 0 38 p 0 01 for the 2003 2014 and 2015 2020 periods respectively fig 2c this may be because of marked increase of surface water storage from 2015 to 2020 since the south to north water diversion middle route project started however the soil moisture water storage showed no significant trends liu et al 2021 the correlation results also showed that there was a slight difference between the maximum precipitation and the maximum time point value of twsa the precipitation was in fact positively correlated with the twsa with one month lag in the ncp r 0 36 p 0 01 fig 2d 3 2 spei 1 and gdi drought characteristics 3 2 1 temporal evolution of drought fig 3 shows the spei and gdi at a one month scale obtained using the eemd method over 2003 to 2020 period in the ncp as shown in fig 3 the trend component res of monthly spei 1 first decreased to a minimum value of 0 05 in 2011 and then increased until 2020 meteorological drought in the ncp showed an aggravating trend before 2011 fig 3a regarding res of monthly gdi a negative trend was observed especially after 2008 indicating that groundwater drought in the ncp was more serious table 2 indicates that the periodic cycles of imf components of monthly spei 1 and gdi increased from 3 months imf 1 to 108 months imf 6 the strongest relationship observed between spei 1 and imf 1 r 0 77 p 0 01 suggested a significant seasonal meteorological drought table 2 whereas the significant correlation between gdi and res r 0 85 p 0 01 indicated significant interdecadal variation in groundwater drought table 2 3 2 2 spatial distribution of drought the year of associated with extreme point of the res component was used as the turning point results of eemd identified the 2011 and 2008 as the turning point according to monthly spei 1 and gdi before the observed turning points the area characterized by a downward trend of spei 1 accounted for 87 72 of the total area of ncp with 33 33 presenting a significant trend fig 4 a a large scale negative trend was observed in the central part of the ncp indicating that meteorological drought was more severe during the 2003 2011 period after the turning points the areas with positive trend of spei 1 accounted for 55 93 of the ncp with only 0 24 showing a significant positive trend fig 4b in terms of spatial variation in gdi during the 2003 2008 period areas with increasing and decreasing trends in gdi accounted for 64 50 39 90 significant and 45 50 11 24 significant respectively fig 4c additionally a large scale significant upward trend was revealed in the central and western ncp while a significant downward trend was observed at shandong peninsula and hebei provinces after the turning points the area with downward and upward trends in gdi accounted for 88 03 78 01 significant fig 4d and 11 97 7 41 significant fig 4d respectively moreover areas with a significant increasing trend were located in the southern ncp fig 4d 3 3 propagation characteristics from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts 3 3 1 the propagation time from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts fig 5 shows the diti values between the monthly gdi 1 12 months and spei 1 series with various lag time 0 to 24 months in the ncp it can be observed that the propagation time from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts in the ncp was significantly different throughout the year propagation time from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts was 15 23 13 12 18 7 6 5 14 15 10 and 17 months from january to december the maximum diti value observed in february was about 0 90 furthermore the propagation time from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts was about 12 18 5 7 10 15 and 15 23 months in spring summer autumn and winter seasons respectively fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of mditi maximum diti occurring month of mditi and the propagation time from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts it can be observed that the mditi values vary between 0 40 and 0 90 the lowest mditi values were mainly found in the southwest of hebei province and highest mditi values were found mainly in the southern part of the ncp fig 6a according to fig 6b mditi values were mainly from november to february 34 09 of all grids in the ncp and were located at the central part of ncp the cold and dry weather conditions in this period frequently brought drought to the ncp liu et al 2018a as a result ground water was over exploited to meet industrial or agricultural needs the propagation area ratio was lower from june to august 16 54 of all grids in the ncp and the area was mainly distributed in the central and northern parts of henan province propagation area ratio was about 23 34 during the september november period and was mainly found in the southern part of hebei province as well as the central and northern part of shandong province regarding the shandong jiangsu and anhui provinces propagation area ratio accounted for 26 87 during the december february period as reported in fig 6c the propagation time from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts was about 12 to 24 months 61 96 of all grids in the ncp ratio of propagation time for the 0 6 months period was 23 68 and was mainly observed in the central part of the ncp in hebei and henan provinces the ratio was about 36 40 for the 18 24 months period fig 6c 3 3 2 drought propagation rate fig 7 illustrates the spatial pattern of drought propagation rate and associated sensitivity in ncp in general the ts value of the whole ncp was 38 44 the high value ts 50 areas were distributed in the hebei central shandong and northwest henan provinces fig 7a in addition the results reported that northern part of the study area showed a higher effective drought propagation rate tt 50 than the southern part tt 25 specifically the percentage of area with lower drought propagation rate tt 25 was high up to 43 83 they were distributed mainly in the southern part of the ncp and the northern part of hebei province the percentage of area with higher drought propagation rate tt 50 was only 21 23 they area distributed mainly in beijing and central and southern hebei province fig 7b 4 discussion 4 1 possible driving factors of groundwater drought in the context of global warming precipitation and temperature are the key factors affecting drought duo et al 2016 the eemd indicated that groundwater drought has become increasingly severe in our study area results showed that there was a decreasing trend in mean annual precipitation 4 16 mm yr over the 2003 2019 period and an increasing trend in mean annual temperature 0 028 yr fig 8 and fig s2 groundwater drought in the ncp has become more severe due to the warm and dry climate which confirmed the findings by wang et al 2020 and zhao et al 2019a zhao et al 2019b in addition to climate factors human activities also had an important impact on groundwater drought the spatial temporal distribution of water resources in the ncp is extremely non uniform fang et al 2010 to meet the water demand of regional domestic industrial and agricultural activities groundwater has been extensively exploited in the ncp chen et al 2019 long et al 2020 the over exploitation of groundwater caused continuous drawdown of groundwater and increasing the risk of groundwater drought wang et al 2020a although the groundwater pumping control policy and artificial groundwater recharge projects e g south to north water transfer project are implemented in the ncp the increasing water demand presents a challenge to urban industrial and agricultural needs wang et al 2020a wu et al 2019 a significant upward trend was found in monthly wsc from 2015 to 2020 due to the implementation of the south to north water diversion middle route project in december 2014 this project was probably the main driver for increased surface water storage in the ncp liu et al 2021 the main reason for the serious groundwater decline from 2015 to 2020 was that beijing and tianjin are the key cities for water replenishment in the south to north water diversion project for most of the cities the amount of water replenished was far less than the sum of the domestic agricultural and industrial uses liu et al 2021 after 2014 severe droughts occurred in shandong henan and some other places leading to extensive exploitation of groundwater as a result groundwater reserves declined seriously liu et al 2021 the abrupt change of propagation time in fig 5 may be caused by groundwater depletion the ncp suffered from frequent droughts especially in the transition months such as february may and november from one season to another fig 5 groundwater depletion could occur with the drought as people pumped of groundwater to meet the agriculture industry and domestic uses wang et al 2020b zhao et al 2019a zhao et al 2019b groundwater depletion can affect the normal operation of drought propagation mechanism and shorten the drought transmission time quickly 4 2 comparison with other previous studies it has been increasingly popular to compare meteorological with groundwater droughts javadinejad et al 2020 used the spi and gri groundwater resources index to assess the relationship between meteorological drought and groundwater drought in the isfahan borkhar basin of iran han et al 2019 reported that the propagation from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts in the pearl river basin of china was about 8 months in terms of the spi and gwsa dsi liu et al 2016a liu et al 2016b liu et al 2016c assessed the response of groundwater drought to meteorological drought in the jiangsu province using cross correlation and reported the spatial variation in correlations in these studies either linear or nonlinear relationships have been assumed between different types of droughts some researchers argued that the ideal relationships were straightforward and the propagation threshold for each drought was similar edossa et al 2010 to some extent the linear methods such as correlation analysis can be used to reflect this relationship wu et al 2017 wu et al 2021 this assumption might be true in a purely natural setting but the groundwater drought has also been largely affected by factors including anthropogenic activities and the corresponding climate change wu et al 2017 wu et al 2021 these factors can significantly complicate the relationships between groundwater drought and meteorological drought that linear models can hardly deal with wu et al 2021 indicated propagation thresholds between different types of droughts were similar at all timescales by using the linear method it is unreasonable to obtain propagation thresholds by linear method as such the non linear models such as three parameter power function have been selected in more recent studies wu et al 2017 wu et al 2021 results showed that they were able to better characterize the relationships between different types of droughts in this study the non linear relationship between meteorological and groundwater droughts was calculated using diti diti can avoid overestimating the drought response time compared with other non linear methods zhou et al 2021 our results indicated that the propagation time from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts in summer was shorter than other seasons probably owing to the higher temperature and rainfall this result was consistent with the seasonal variation characteristics of meteorological propagation to hydrological drought han et al 2019 huang et al 2017 in the ncp annual precipitation most of which occurs during the summer from june to august ranges from about 400 mm in the north to 850 mm in the south chen et al 2020 wang et al 2020b this leads to sufficient water and relatively high soil moisture content that will accelerate the rate of precipitation infiltration for recharge of groundwater han et al 2019 propagation time observed in autumn and winter seasons was relatively long 10 23 months probably due to the presence of water stored in soils in the past few months huang et al 2017 on the other hand eemd results indicated that spei 1 values were first decreased during the 2003 2011 period and then increased during the 2011 2020 period whereas monthly gdi showed a steady downward trend during the 2003 2020 period fig 3 based on results reported in fig 4 the groundwater drought was found to be more frequent during the 2008 2020 period probably due to overuse of groundwater wang et al 2020a also the increase in deep rooted plants at ground surface as part of vegetation restoration program e g three north protection forest may cause an increase in groundwater consumption and consequently exacerbate water shortages shao et al 2019 yin et al 2015 4 3 uncertainties and future directions in the current study the spatial temporal pattern and propagation characteristics from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts using a nonlinear method were assessed several uncertainties remained in this study first post processing methods of grace satellite data affected the water storage change results grace datasets from different organizations jpl csr and gfz have uncertainties grace rl06 mascon model was used in this study to reduce the computational error of the earth s gravity field mode wang et al 2022 second filling missing data of grace data using linear interpolation technique resulted in uncertainties abhishek et al 2022 long et al 2015 this method may underestimate the actual tws in the peak of the wet or dry season abhishek et al 2022 the tws will also be overestimated or underestimated if the high short term fluctuations were existed abhishek et al 2022 using other nonlinear techniques such as machine learning deep learning techniques and artificial neural network with genetic algorithms may be an alternative to handle missing data and provide more accurate data abhishek et al 2022 sun et al 2020 the dense observation network for groundwater level data could be used to fill the missing data in the future study finally probability models and cross wavelet transformation were used to analyze the propagation from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts han et al 2019 han et al 2021 further studies on the determination of the advantages and disadvantages of these methods are required in addition flash drought has become a major issue over the past decade as climate warming and human activities are continuously increasing christian et al 2021 liang and yuan 2021 wang and yuan 2021 yuan et al 2019 it is also suggested to assess the relationships between flash droughts and meteorological or groundwater drought in future studies zhou et al 2021 a denser observation network for groundwater level data in the ncp could be used to evaluate twas accuracy in the future study 5 conclusions in this study the eemd was used in the spatial temporal evolution patterns of meteorological and groundwater droughts during the 2003 2020 period in addition the idti was employed to assess the relationships between meteorological and groundwater droughts 1 the verification of grace showed good agreement between gravity satellite data gldas hydrological

meteorological drought may lead to a decline in soil moisture and surface water resources in such a case significantly more groundwater would be used to meet the needs of agriculture industry and daily life resulting in groundwater drought especially during dry periods abhishek and kinouchi 2021 han et al 2021 compared with surface water groundwater respond to precipitation variability or other meteorological conditions in a slower manner it is difficult to accurately assess the variability of groundwater levels at the beginning of agricultural or hydrological droughts changnon et al 1988 han et al 2021 several authors have found strong relationships between groundwater and meteorological droughts han et al 2021 reported the relationship between meteorological and groundwater droughts in the xijiang river basin of china and revealed that the propagation time ranged from 8 to 42 months kumar et al 2016 reported that standardized precipitation index spi was an inadequate indicator of groundwater drought and regional hydrogeological characteristics should be considered in these studies the variation of groundwater drought and the relationship between groundwater drought and meteorological drought were considered linear the relationship however can be nonlinear zhou et al 2021 few studies have been carried out to assess the response time of groundwater drought to meteorological drought from the point of non linear relationship li et al 2020 liu et al 2016a liu et al 2016b liu et al 2016c zhang et al 2021 in the ncp 67 79 of the total water consumption and

index developed by vicente serrano et al 2010 this index serves to determine the water budget deficit and surplus taking into account monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration compared with other meteorological drought indexes spei not only combines the advantages of the palmer drought severity index pdsi and spi but provides simpler calculation wang et al 2020b positive and negative values of the spei indicate wet and dry conditions respectively in this study the thornthwaite equation was used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration thornthwaite 1948 the difference between reference evapotranspiration and precipitation p for the month i is calculated as follows 1 d i p i p e t i the obtained di values are aggregated at different timescales following the same procedure as that for the commonly used spei the d i l is the l month of all months used in the calculation in the year i the difference d i j k on a given month j and year i depends on the chosen timescale k month for instance the accumulated difference for l month in a particular year i with a 12 month timescale or other timescales is calculated as follows 2 x i j k l 13 k j 12 d i 1 l l 1 j d i l if j k and x i j k l j k 1 j d i l if j k where di j indicates the difference between p and pet in month l year i then the probability distribution function of the d series can be showed as 3 f x 1 α x γ β 1 where α is the scale β is the shape and γ is the origin the spei can be calculated as follows 4 spei w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 p 0 5 spei c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2

189269 and d3 0 001308 respectively detailed grading can be found in table 1 2 3 2 gdi calculation the gdi was used to characterize groundwater drought this index represents the deviation in groundwater volume storage according to seasonal variability compared with grace dsi gdi removes the seasonal effects and can better evaluate groundwater drought wang et al 2020a the calculation steps as follows 1 the groundwater storage anomalies gsa were calculated by the water budget 5 gsa t w s a s c w s a s m s a s w e a where twsa is terrestrial water storage anomalies scwsa smsa and swea are the surface canopy water storage anomalies soil moisture storage anomalies and snow water equivalent anomalies respectively these data were provided by gldas model 2 monthly climatology mj can be calculated as follows 6 m j 1 n j 1 n j gs a j where mj indicates the climatology for month j j 1 2 12 3 groundwater storage deviation gsd was calculated as follows 7 gs d j g s a j m j 4 groundwater drought index gdi was calculated as follows 8 gd i i j gs d i j gsd s gsd where i is year from 2003 to 2020 gsd is mean value of gsd in month j and sgsd is the standard deviation of gsd in month j detailed grading can be found in table 1 the result of monthly climatology mj can be found in fig s1 2 3 3 ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd multi scale or multi level droughts need to be analyzed due to their complex nonlinear system zhu et al 2021 eemd is an effective method for dealing with nonlinear and non stationary time series this method is an improved method of empirical mode decomposition emd which has been widely used in meteorological agricultural hydrological and groundwater drought studies to overcome the problem of mode mixing in emd an appropriate white noise was added to the original observation data to simulate several scenarios and perform calculations after repeated average ensemble in this research the eemd was used to decompose the monthly spei and gdi from 2003 to 2020 into different intrinsic mode functions imfi and trend components resi the specific decomposition process is as follows 8 im f j t 1 m i 1 m im f ij t 9 res t 1 m i 1 m re s i t 10 x t j 1 j im f j t re s t where imfj t and res t is the jth component intrinsic mode functions imf and term of the trend respectively m is the number of times the white noise is added j is the total number of imfs 2 3 4 directed information transfer index diti to assess the effect of meteorological drought to groundwater drought the diti was used due to the significant seasonal difference of the propagation time a year was divided into spring march to may summer june to august autumn september to november and winter december to february of the next year the diti can be calculated as below shi et al 2018 zhou et al 2021 1 suppose we have two continuous random variables x and y joint distribution of them is fx y x y and marginal distributions of x and y are fx x and fy y the formula of their information entropy is calculated as follows zhou et al 2021 11 h x s f x log f x x 12 h y s f y log f y y the mutual information mi of x and y can be defined as follows 13 i x y s f x y x y log f x y x y f x x f y y the diti from information source x meteorological drought to information function point y groundwater drought is calculated as follows 14 diti x y i x y h y where x and y are the information source and information function point in this work meteorological drought and groundwater drought are used as the information source and information function point respectively 2 3 5 drought propagation rate as a result of the natural and social conditions of basin itself meteorological drought may not lead to groundwater drought zhou et al 2021 to measure the drought propagation degree the sensitivity of groundwater drought to meteorological drought and the drought propagation rate from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts were used to evaluate the characteristics of drought propagation guo et al 2020 15 t s n t n g 16 t t n t n m where ts and tt denotes the sensitivity of groundwater drought to meteorological drought and drought propagation rate respectively nt ng and nm is the total times of meteorological drought triggering groundwater drought the number of groundwater droughts and the total times of meteorological drought respectively 3 results 3 1 grace verification to validate the reliability of the grace twsa the gldas hydrological model and precipitation data were used the water storage change wsc was used to represent the sum of scwsa smsa and swea from gldas model the results showed that the twsa and wsc variations ranged from 233 50 to 92 23 mm and from 83 92 to 96 15 mm using grace and gldas during the 2003 2020 period respectively fig 2 a and 2b this difference of variation in twsa and wsc may be due to the sum of surface water and groundwater storages considered by grace whereas gldas includes only surface water in water storage monitoring wang et al 2020a the twsa of the whole ncp indicated an overall downward trend 0 027 mm month the downward trends were different for the two periods i e 2003 2014 0 024 mm month and 2015 2020 0 039 mm month fig 2a the wsc of the whole ncp also indicated an overall downward trend 0 003 mm month with different change trends for the two periods i e 2003 2014 0 01 mm month and 2015 2020 0 015 mm month fig 2b according to the monthly twsa and wsc values obtained during the 2003 2020 period in the ncp a significant positive correlation between twsa and wsc was observed r 0 51 p 0 05 fig 2c the correlation coefficient reached 0 83 p 0 01 and 0 38 p 0 01 for the 2003 2014 and 2015 2020 periods respectively fig 2c this may be because of marked increase of surface water storage from 2015 to 2020 since the south to north water diversion middle route project started however the soil moisture water storage showed no significant trends liu et al 2021 the correlation results also showed that there was a slight difference between the maximum precipitation and the maximum time point value of twsa the precipitation was in fact positively correlated with the twsa with one month lag in the ncp r 0 36 p 0 01 fig 2d 3 2 spei 1 and gdi drought characteristics 3 2 1 temporal evolution of drought fig 3 shows the spei and gdi at a one month scale obtained using the eemd method over 2003 to 2020 period in the ncp as shown in fig 3 the trend component res of monthly spei 1 first decreased to a minimum value of 0 05 in 2011 and then increased until 2020 meteorological drought in the ncp showed an aggravating trend before 2011 fig 3a regarding res of monthly gdi a negative trend was observed especially after 2008 indicating that groundwater drought in the ncp was more serious table 2 indicates that the periodic cycles of imf components of monthly spei 1 and gdi increased from 3 months imf 1 to 108 months imf 6 the strongest relationship observed between spei 1 and imf 1 r 0 77 p 0 01 suggested a significant seasonal meteorological drought table 2 whereas the significant correlation between gdi and res r 0 85 p 0 01 indicated significant interdecadal variation in groundwater drought table 2 3 2 2 spatial distribution of drought the year of associated with extreme point of the res component was used as the turning point results of eemd identified the 2011 and 2008 as the turning point according to monthly spei 1 and gdi before the observed turning points the area characterized by a downward trend of spei 1 accounted for 87 72 of the total area of ncp with 33 33 presenting a significant trend fig 4 a a large scale negative trend was observed in the central part of the ncp indicating that meteorological drought was more severe during the 2003 2011 period after the turning points the areas with positive trend of spei 1 accounted for 55 93 of the ncp with only 0 24 showing a significant positive trend fig 4b in terms of spatial variation in gdi during the 2003 2008 period areas with increasing and decreasing trends in gdi accounted for 64 50 39 90 significant and 45 50 11 24 significant respectively fig 4c additionally a large scale significant upward trend was revealed in the central and western ncp while a significant downward trend was observed at shandong peninsula and hebei provinces after the turning points the area with downward and upward trends in gdi accounted for 88 03 78 01 significant fig 4d and 11 97 7 41 significant fig 4d respectively moreover areas with a significant increasing trend were located in the southern ncp fig 4d 3 3 propagation characteristics from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts 3 3 1 the propagation time from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts fig 5 shows the diti values between the monthly gdi 1 12 months and spei 1 series with various lag time 0 to 24 months in the ncp it can be observed that the propagation time from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts in the ncp was significantly different throughout the year propagation time from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts was 15 23 13 12 18 7 6 5 14 15 10 and 17 months from january to december the maximum diti value observed in february was about 0 90 furthermore the propagation time from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts was about 12 18 5 7 10 15 and 15 23 months in spring summer autumn and winter seasons respectively fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of mditi maximum diti occurring month of mditi and the propagation time from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts it can be observed that the mditi values vary between 0 40 and 0 90 the lowest mditi values were mainly found in the southwest of hebei province and highest mditi values were found mainly in the southern part of the ncp fig 6a according to fig 6b mditi values were mainly from november to february 34 09 of all grids in the ncp and were located at the central part of ncp the cold and dry weather conditions in this period frequently brought drought to the ncp liu et al 2018a as a result ground water was over exploited to meet industrial or agricultural needs the propagation area ratio was lower from june to august 16 54 of all grids in the ncp and the area was mainly distributed in the central and northern parts of henan province propagation area ratio was about 23 34 during the september november period and was mainly found in the southern part of hebei province as well as the central and northern part of shandong province regarding the shandong jiangsu and anhui provinces propagation area ratio accounted for 26 87 during the december february period as reported in fig 6c the propagation time from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts was about 12 to 24 months 61 96 of all grids in the ncp ratio of propagation time for the 0 6 months period was 23 68 and was mainly observed in the central part of the ncp in hebei and henan provinces the ratio was about 36 40 for the 18 24 months period fig 6c 3 3 2 drought propagation rate fig 7 illustrates the spatial pattern of drought propagation rate and associated sensitivity in ncp in general the ts value of the whole ncp was 38 44 the high value ts 50 areas were distributed in the hebei central shandong and northwest henan provinces fig 7a in addition the results reported that northern part of the study area showed a higher effective drought propagation rate tt 50 than the southern part tt 25 specifically the percentage of area with lower drought propagation rate tt 25 was high up to 43 83 they were distributed mainly in the southern part of the ncp and the northern part of hebei province the percentage of area with higher drought propagation rate tt 50 was only 21 23 they area distributed mainly in beijing and central and southern hebei province fig 7b 4 discussion 4 1 possible driving factors of groundwater drought in the context of global warming precipitation and temperature are the key factors affecting drought duo et al 2016 the eemd indicated that groundwater drought has become increasingly severe in our study area results showed that there was a decreasing trend in mean annual precipitation 4 16 mm yr over the 2003 2019 period and an increasing trend in mean annual temperature 0 028 yr fig 8 and fig s2 groundwater drought in the ncp has become more severe due to the warm and dry climate which confirmed the findings by wang et al 2020 and zhao et al 2019a zhao et al 2019b in addition to climate factors human activities also had an important impact on groundwater drought the spatial temporal distribution of water resources in the ncp is extremely non uniform fang et al 2010 to meet the water demand of regional domestic industrial and agricultural activities groundwater has been extensively exploited in the ncp chen et al 2019 long et al 2020 the over exploitation of groundwater caused continuous drawdown of groundwater and increasing the risk of groundwater drought wang et al 2020a although the groundwater pumping control policy and artificial groundwater recharge projects e g south to north water transfer project are implemented in the ncp the increasing water demand presents a challenge to urban industrial and agricultural needs wang et al 2020a wu et al 2019 a significant upward trend was found in monthly wsc from 2015 to 2020 due to the implementation of the south to north water diversion middle route project in december 2014 this project was probably the main driver for increased surface water storage in the ncp liu et al 2021 the main reason for the serious groundwater decline from 2015 to 2020 was that beijing and tianjin are the key cities for water replenishment in the south to north water diversion project for most of the cities the amount of water replenished was far less than the sum of the domestic agricultural and industrial uses liu et al 2021 after 2014 severe droughts occurred in shandong henan and some other places leading to extensive exploitation of groundwater as a result groundwater reserves declined seriously liu et al 2021 the abrupt change of propagation time in fig 5 may be caused by groundwater depletion the ncp suffered from frequent droughts especially in the transition months such as february may and november from one season to another fig 5 groundwater depletion could occur with the drought as people pumped of groundwater to meet the agriculture industry and domestic uses wang et al 2020b zhao et al 2019a zhao et al 2019b groundwater depletion can affect the normal operation of drought propagation mechanism and shorten the drought transmission time quickly 4 2 comparison with other previous studies it has been increasingly popular to compare meteorological with groundwater droughts javadinejad et al 2020 used the spi and gri groundwater resources index to assess the relationship between meteorological drought and groundwater drought in the isfahan borkhar basin of iran han et al 2019 reported that the propagation from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts in the pearl river basin of china was about 8 months in terms of the spi and gwsa dsi liu et al 2016a liu et al 2016b liu et al 2016c assessed the response of groundwater drought to meteorological drought in the jiangsu province using cross correlation and reported the spatial variation in correlations in these studies either linear or nonlinear relationships have been assumed between different types of droughts some researchers argued that the ideal relationships were straightforward and the propagation threshold for each drought was similar edossa et al 2010 to some extent the linear methods such as correlation analysis can be used to reflect this relationship wu et al 2017 wu et al 2021 this assumption might be true in a purely natural setting but the groundwater drought has also been largely affected by factors including anthropogenic activities and the corresponding climate change wu et al 2017 wu et al 2021 these factors can significantly complicate the relationships between groundwater drought and meteorological drought that linear models can hardly deal with wu et al 2021 indicated propagation thresholds between different types of droughts were similar at all timescales by using the linear method it is unreasonable to obtain propagation thresholds by linear method as such the non linear models such as three parameter power function have been selected in more recent studies wu et al 2017 wu et al 2021 results showed that they were able to better characterize the relationships between different types of droughts in this study the non linear relationship between meteorological and groundwater droughts was calculated using diti diti can avoid overestimating the drought response time compared with other non linear methods zhou et al 2021 our results indicated that the propagation time from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts in summer was shorter than other seasons probably owing to the higher temperature and rainfall this result was consistent with the seasonal variation characteristics of meteorological propagation to hydrological drought han et al 2019 huang et al 2017 in the ncp annual precipitation most of which occurs during the summer from june to august ranges from about 400 mm in the north to 850 mm in the south chen et al 2020 wang et al 2020b this leads to sufficient water and relatively high soil moisture content that will accelerate the rate of precipitation infiltration for recharge of groundwater han et al 2019 propagation time observed in autumn and winter seasons was relatively long 10 23 months probably due to the presence of water stored in soils in the past few months huang et al 2017 on the other hand eemd results indicated that spei 1 values were first decreased during the 2003 2011 period and then increased during the 2011 2020 period whereas monthly gdi showed a steady downward trend during the 2003 2020 period fig 3 based on results reported in fig 4 the groundwater drought was found to be more frequent during the 2008 2020 period probably due to overuse of groundwater wang et al 2020a also the increase in deep rooted plants at ground surface as part of vegetation restoration program e g three north protection forest may cause an increase in groundwater consumption and consequently exacerbate water shortages shao et al 2019 yin et al 2015 4 3 uncertainties and future directions in the current study the spatial temporal pattern and propagation characteristics from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts using a nonlinear method were assessed several uncertainties remained in this study first post processing methods of grace satellite data affected the water storage change results grace datasets from different organizations jpl csr and gfz have uncertainties grace rl06 mascon model was used in this study to reduce the computational error of the earth s gravity field mode wang et al 2022 second filling missing data of grace data using linear interpolation technique resulted in uncertainties abhishek et al 2022 long et al 2015 this method may underestimate the actual tws in the peak of the wet or dry season abhishek et al 2022 the tws will also be overestimated or underestimated if the high short term fluctuations were existed abhishek et al 2022 using other nonlinear techniques such as machine learning deep learning techniques and artificial neural network with genetic algorithms may be an alternative to handle missing data and provide more accurate data abhishek et al 2022 sun et al 2020 the dense observation network for groundwater level data could be used to fill the missing data in the future study finally probability models and cross wavelet transformation were used to analyze the propagation from meteorological droughts to groundwater droughts han et al 2019 han et al 2021 further studies on the determination of the advantages and disadvantages of these methods are required in addition flash drought has become a major issue over the past decade as climate warming and human activities are continuously increasing christian et al 2021 liang and yuan 2021 wang and yuan 2021 yuan et al 2019 it is also suggested to assess the relationships between flash droughts and meteorological or groundwater drought in future studies zhou et al 2021 a denser observation network for groundwater level data in the ncp could be used to evaluate twas accuracy in the future study 5 conclusions in this study the eemd was used in the spatial temporal evolution patterns of meteorological and groundwater droughts during the 2003 2020 period in addition the idti was employed to assess the relationships between meteorological and groundwater droughts 1 the verification of grace showed good agreement between gravity satellite data gldas hydrological and previous monthly precipitation gdi can be used to accurately assess the groundwater drought information in the ncp 2 from the view of temporal variation the spei 1 was firstly decreased and then increased with the minimum value in 2011 the gdi was first increased and then decreased with the maximum value in 2008 the results also reported a significant decreasing trend in spei 1 p 0 01 over the 2003 2011 period mainly in the middle and west parts of the ncp during the 2011 2020 period the percentage of area with an upward trend of spei 1 was 55 93 only 0 24 significant mainly distributed in the north of the ncp 3 the areas characterized by significant upward and downward trends of gdi observed over the 2003 2008 period accounting for 39 90 p 0 05 and 11 24 p 0 05 of the total area of the ncp respectively while significant negative trend was found in the southern part of the ncp the areas characterized by significant downward and upward trends of gdi accounted for 78 01 p 0 05 and 7 41 p 0 05 of the total surface area of the ncp 4 the propagation time of meteorological to groundwater drought determined by the diti was long in both spring 12 18 months and winter 15 23 months and short in summer 5 7 months the maximum diti value was relatively high 0 4 0 9 and the most spread time was about 18 to 24 months in the northern and southern parts of hebei and northern part of henan province covering 36 40 of the total area of the ncp 5 the sensitivity and propagation rates of the entire ncp were higher in north and south lower in south the average value of ts and tt was 38 44 and 34 17 respectively the current research can help to understand the spatial temporal evolution patterns of groundwater drought and the propagation dynamics of meteorological to groundwater droughts in the ncp from the point of view of the nonlinear relationship it can also provide useful information for properly water resources management in similar regions credit authorship contribution

3346,the migration rate of ripples along the streambed has a profound effect on the hyporheic exchange and nitrogen dynamics however how the denitrification intermediate n2o is released in mobile bedforms still remain unclear in this study the ripple domains are established based on the sediment stability criteria by using the mean channel flow velocity u and the median sediment grain size d 50 a two dimensional numerical model coupling hyporheic flow ripple migration and n2o transformation is proposed to investigate how ripple celerity affects n2o dynamics in streambeds the results show that there are different patterns for the release of n2o from migrating ripples with different medium grain sizes d 50 0 06 0 3 mm n2o can be released via upwelling of anoxic pore water from the deeper area in immobile or slow mobile ripples however rapid ripple migration and the resulting fast vertical flow reversal can suppress the net pore water displacement and lead to the formation of a redox seal which separates the deeper anoxic area from the above oxic area and inhibits n2o emissions the magnitude of the nutrients concentration gradient and the n2o flux between these two areas depend only on the dispersive and diffusive transport therefore the controls of n2o emission flux hence shift from the pumping dominated regime in stable ripples to a grain size dominated regime of the migrating ripples the possible implications about the effects of hydrodynamic changes due to the migration of ripples are presented our results emphasize that knowledge of n2o production

have already been overstepped beyond a safe operating space due to anthropogenic activities rockström et al 2009 steffen et al 2015 modern agriculture is highly dependent on fertilizers and up to 30 of nitrogen fertilizers ultimately enter the rivers through runoff or groundwater flow rouse et al 1999 although an increase in anthropogenic nutrient inputs may cause eutrophication of water bodies conley et al 2009 the nitrogen level can be reduced by denitrification of nitrate however elevated emissions of nitrous oxide n2o a potent greenhouse gas responsible for climate change and stratospheric ozone depletion are also expected due to the higher denitrification rates crutzen 1970 streambeds are considered to be hotspots of nitrogen transformation due to the presence of active microbial communities and steep redox gradients krause et al 2013 boso et al 2018 jiang et al 2021b rivers and their sediments play an important role in controlling the fate of nitrogen and account for approximately 10 of n2o increase in the atmosphere beaulieu et al 2011 dwivedi et al 2018 krause et al 2013 marzadri et al 2014 a significant fraction of n2o in rivers is produced in hyporheic and riparian zones by microbial processes such as incomplete denitrification quick et al 2016 reeder et al 2018 which is primarily responsible for nitrate no3 removal and n2o emission in small rivers marzadri et al 2017 yao et al 2020 bedforms such as ripples and dunes are the result of complex interactions among stream flow sediment and bed geometry colombini and stocchino 2011 bedform morphology can strongly influence the spatial distribution of solutes within the sediment due to pumping driven convective exchange i e convective flow driven by dynamic head gradients at the bed surface packman and brooks 2001 cardenas and wilson 2007 jiang et al 2020 however fine to medium sand of 0 7 mm is mobile and migrating ripples are ubiquitous covering approximately 20 50 of streambeds in a reach verdonschot 2000 rabení et al 2005 turnover exchange occurs with the migration of bedforms so that water would be captured on the leeside and then released on the stoss side in the migration direction elliott and brooks 1997 zheng et al 2019 the contributions of pumping and turnover to hyporheic exchange have been well documented elliott and brooks 1997 packman and brooks 2001 bottacin busolin and marion 2010 bedform migration can significantly impact the oxygen and nitrogen dynamics ahmerkamp et al 2015 kessler et al 2015 wolke et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 kessler et al 2015 and zheng et al 2019 have investigated the effects of ripple celerity i e migration velocities of ripples along the riverbed fig 1 on the denitrification rate and no3 source sink function in the hyporheic zone and the final denitrification product was assumed to be n2 quick et al 2016 and reeder et al 2018 further considered the formation of the intermediate n2o and found that n2o emission in stable bedforms was dependent on the pore water flow path however the effect of migrating bedforms on the n2o dynamics in the hyporheic zone still remains unclear the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of ripple celerity on the production consumption and release of the denitrification intermediate n2o in small scale streambeds fig 1 a nitrogen cycling model is proposed and calibrated with data from the recirculating flume experiment of quick et al 2016 after that the model is coupled with migrating ripples induced by stream flow this study has focused on i n2o production consumption characteristic and its hotspot distribution in bedforms under the effect of migrating ripples ii n2o source sink function and net n2o production rate in the mobile hyporheic zone and iii n2o emission flux in stable and migrating ripples with different medium grain sizes d 50 2 methods ripples are steeper and shorter than dunes and their sizes e g wavelength and height depend only on particle diameter while the sizes of dunes are impacted by flow depth garcia 2008 both dunes and ripples are used in this study stable dunes deployed in the flume experiments of quick et al 2016 are only applied to test the flow and multicomponent reactive transport model in sections 2 2 and 2 3 and then the validated model is coupled with bedform migration induced by the stream flow to study the emission of n2o in the bedform under the effect of ripple celerity section 3 2 3 8 it should be noted that the dimensions of dunes in the flume experiments of quick et al 2016 are not designed to couple with the grain size and do not consider the sediment stability criteria theoretically we assume that dunes can be formed under their experimental conditions i e stream flow velocity and water depth of 30 cm table s2 however the ripple dimensions are coupled to the grain sizes for the later runs as shown in fig s1b we first examine whether ripples of different medium grain sizes d 50 can be formed under specific hydraulic conditions then determine the sizes and migration velocities of ripples and finally simulate n2o dynamics in the hyporheic zone in response to ripple celerity the description of each part is shown in text s1 2 1 description of the numerical model the ripple domains are established based on the criteria for ripple formation using the mean channel flow and the median sediment grain size then a series of nitrogen cycling models are developed to compare the spatial distribution of n2o interfacial flux incomplete and complete denitrification hotspots and production efficiency of n2o between mobile and immobile bedforms a simple conceptualization is used to elucidate the role of flow dynamics in bedform induced hyporheic exchange stonedahl et al 2010 singh et al 2019 jiang et al 2021b the modeling domain fig 2 a represents the stream ripples with a triangular sediment water interface swi as the idealized small scale topography i e geometry 1 5 determined in text s1 the elevation of the swi zswi l could be described as a piecewise functional form which is given as follows 1 z swi x δ λ c x x 0 λ c δ λ c λ x λ x λ c λ where λ c l is the horizontal location of the crest the model of the physical processes fig 1 involves two cases case 1 the two dimensional steady state pore water flow coupled with reactive transport in stable dunes c 0 is modeled and validated case 2 the two dimensional ripple and reactive transport models are coupled to explore the effect of bedform celerity on n2o dynamics fig 2b the coupled pore water flow and multicomponent reactive transport in the riverbed are simulated with a generic finite element method by using comsol multiphysics li et al 2009 at the dell precision t5500 workstation which provides an efficient way to implement batch simulations 2 2 pore water flow model in a migrating ripple the pore water flow in the ripple is modeled by the laplace equation fig 2a 2 2 h 0 where h l is the total hydraulic head the flow field in the ripple can be calculated by the darcy s law 3 q k h where k l t 1 is the hydraulic conductivity which is estimated using the empirical equation k 7 35 10 6 g d 50 2 ν based on the grain size table s1 gangi 1985 g l t 2 is the gravitational acceleration and ν l2 t 1 is the kinematic viscosity a frame of reference moving at the ripple migrating velocity c is introduced to represent the impact of celerity elliott and brooks 1997 kessler et al 2015 and this method works if the ripple can maintain its shape as it moves downstream at the velocity c ahmerkamp et al 2015 zheng et al 2019 in this frame of reference ripples appear to be stationary but pore water has an additional component of velocity in the streamwise direction that is equal to c the flow field with the celerity effect is given by 4 u x q x ϕ c u y q y ϕ where ϕ is the porosity which is assumed to be constant table s1 the subscripts x and y indicate the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity respectively the boundary conditions for pore water flow are shown in fig 2a the head distribution h x at the bed surface that assumes a linear combination of head fluctuations induced by bed topography in eq 5 wörman et al 2006 stonedahl et al 2010 jiang et al 2021b is assigned to boundaries bc and cd fig 2a thus the head distribution h x as the driver for the flow field in the porous bed and the resulting flux through the bed surface can be calculated by combining eqs 1 5 and 6 without the need to use a sequential coupling method for turbulent flow in the water column and then hyporheic flow in the porous media cardenas and wilson 2007 5 h x s x 2 h d δ z swi x λ 4 since the hydrodynamically driven hyporheic flow tends to have its greatest influence at finer scales of variability in stream velocity flowing over submerged bedforms which affects momentum transfer to the streambed boano et al 2014 the dynamic head in this study dominates the hyporheic zone and the hydrostatic head can be ignored in eq 6 h d l is the fluctuation intensity of the dynamic head elliott and brooks 1997 6 h d 0 28 u 2 2 g δ h 0 34 3 8 δ h 0 34 δ h 0 34 3 2 δ h 0 34 similar measured pressure distributions are observed along the sediment water interface for ripples janssen et al 2012 and dunes fehlman 1985 and both of which can be approximated by a sine function therefore the eq 6 developed by elliott and brooks 1997 for dune like bedforms also can be used for ripples boundaries ab and ed are set to be periodic boundaries 7 p 0 z t p λ z t δ p the pressure drop is derived from the bed slope s and the ripple wavelength λ by the equation δp ρgλs boundary ae 8 n ρ u 0 2 3 multicomponent reactive transport model a multicomponent reactive transport model is proposed to simulate the effect of ripple migration on n2o dynamics in the streambed the model frame proposed by van cappellen and wang 1996 and hunter et al 1998 has been widely applied to subsurface environments it is validated with the data collected in a marine sediment from skagerrak denmark and the flume experiments of n2o dynamics jiang et al 2021a four major biogeochemical processes including aerobic respiration nitrification incomplete denitrification i e conversion of no3 to n2o and complete denitrification i e conversion of n2o to n2 are considered in this study table 1 five reactive compounds doc o2 no3 nh4 and n2o from stream water are used as inputs at the swi table 1 formaldehyde ch2o is used to represent the complex doc substrate due to its simple chemical structure boano et al 2010 the transport of reactive compounds in the streambed is described by the steady convection dispersion reaction equation 9 d c i u c i r i i doc o 2 no 3 nh 4 n 2 o where ri m l 3 t 1 is the net reaction rate of compound i ci m l 3 is the concentration of reactive compounds in pore water and d l2 t 1 is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor which is calculated as described in previous studies jiang et al 2021a jiang et al 2020 although no measurements are available for anisotropic dispersion in dunes gelhar et al 1992 have revealed that the reliable estimates of longitudinal dispersivities range from 0 01 to 0 1 of the transport distance and transverse dispersivities are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude smaller than longitudinal dispersivities over the transport distances kapoor and gelhar 1994 and benekos et al 2006 even identified local transverse dispersion as a key factor smoothing the concentration fluctuation and controlling the dilution rate of solutes in line with previous studies the ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity αt αl in the model is assumed to be a constant 0 1 which is much closer to that in real transportation processes and can smooth concentration fluctuations in the bedform this is also consistent with the parameter settings of dispersivity in previous studies on streambed topography induced hyporheic exchange cardenas et al 2008 karwan and saiers 2012 qian et al 2008 the reaction kinetics is described as suggested in the study of hunter et al 1998 for instance for redox reactions r1 r3 and r4 table 1 the rate of doc oxidation and the rate of the i th reduction half reaction are considered separately doc oxidation i e aerobic respiration in reaction 1 table 1 severs as a direct source of chemical energy in this study doc oxidation is assumed to follow the first order kinetics kaufman et al 2017 10 r doc k doc c doc where k doc t 1 is the doc decay constant and c doc m l 3 is the doc concentration this formula has been adopted in other studies and calibrated by laboratory experiments kaufman et al 2017 the electrons produced from the oxidation of doc electron donor are transferred to potential electron acceptors such as o2 no3 and n2o following a given sequence for instance o2 no3 and n2o act as the primary secondary and third electron acceptor respectively aerobic respiration and nitrification are assumed to occur simultaneously while incomplete and complete denitrification occur only at o2 and no3 concentrations lower than the limit table s2 the reduction rate r red j of electron acceptor j j 1 for o2 j 2 for no3 and j 3 for n2o is described by 11 r red j e doc e j r doc f j where e doc and ej are the moles of electrons produced by the oxidation of per mole doc and the reduction of per mole acceptor j respectively table 1 fj is the fraction of electrons consumed by the j th reduction half reduction which is evaluated using a simplified monod kinetic equation hunter et al 1998 12 f j 1 n 1 j 1 f n α j where f0 0 the term in the parentheses accounts for the partial or complete inhibition of the reduction rate of electron acceptor j due to consumption by previous reduction half reactions and αj accounts for the limitation of rj due to the availability of electron acceptor j the reduction rate is independent on cj at concentrations higher than the limit but linearly proportional to cj at concentrations lower than the limit 13 α j c j c j l i m c j c j l i m 1 c j c j l i m the nitrification rate is described by a second order bimolecular expression 14 r n h 4 k n c nh 4 c o 2 where kn l m 1 t 1 is the second order nitrification rate coefficient values showed in table s2 hence the reaction rates of doc o2 no3 nh4 and n2o can be calculated from eq 15 15 r doc r doc r o 2 r red 1 2 r

simulation lagrange quadratic triangular elements are used in comsol multiphysics with node spacing between 0 2 cm the triangular mesh is constructed using the built in meshing algorithm for general physics application with sizes ranging from 1 2 10 5 m to 0 003 m the resultant mesh contains about 5627 elements with an average element quality a measure of element asymmetry of 0 95 a refined mesh close to the top boundaries is used to capture the physical and chemical processes occurring at the swi the boundary layer mesh functionality in comsol is utilized to further ensure the accuracy of results from the boundary finite element size is chosen to maintain numerical peclet numbers below one in both advection and diffusion dominated zones minimizing artificial oscillations or other numerical instabilities huyakorn et al 1983 dense spacing is maintained throughout the unstructured finite element mesh with triangular elements in this study to limit numerical dispersion the node spacing along the top boundary is 0 05 cm and the node spacing within the domain is 0 2 cm this corresponds to about 5627 triangular elements that minimize numerical dispersion and produce mesh independent solutions 2 4 metrics used to quantify nitrogen cycling within the riverbed multiple parameters are used to quantify the impact of ripple migration on the n2o dynamics in the hyporheic zone which are defined and described as follows 2 4 1 the ratio between pressure driven pore water velocity and ripple celerity the relative magnitude of ripple migration and pumping induced convective pore water flow can be expressed as a dimensionless parameter u r which relates the ripple celerity c and the pressure induced pore water velocity u p l t 1 19 u r ϕ c u s u p where u s l t

exchange when u r 1 2 4 2 the total n2o influx and outflux along the swi to further quantify the impact of ripple migration on the supply and emission rate of n2o the variation of the total water and n2o influx if n2o m t 1 and outflux emission flux of n2o m t 1 across the streambed is calculate as follows 22 i f water b l q in x z t d l in o f water b l q out x z t d l out i f n 2 o b l q in x z

the downwelling area for the influx l in and that of the upwelling area l out for the outflow are evaluated as described in previous studies singh et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 jin et al 2010 2 4 3 the reaction rate of n transformation the spatial patterns of nitrification incomplete denitrification and complete denitrification rates can profoundly influence the no3 n2o source sink function of the streambed the total incomplete denitrification rate idr m t 1 and the complete denitrification rate cdr m t 1 are calculated as follows 23 idr b ϕ a r red 2 d a c d r b ϕ a r red 3 d a where a l2 is the total area of the streambed for n2o production the net incomplete denitrification the difference between idr and cdr indicates whether the ripple acts as a net sink idr cdr 0 or a net source idr cdr 0 of n2o in order to further distinguish the net incomplete denitrification of n2o derived from stream water and incomplete denitrification of no3 r3 in table 1 the total n2o in the streambed is divided into w n2o n2o transported from stream water and n n2o n2o derived from incomplete denitrification of no3 24 c n 2 o c w n 2 o c n n 2 o hence the total reaction rate of n2o in eq 26 can be divided into two parts 25 r w n 2 o r red 3 c w n 2 o c n 2 o r n n 2 o r red 3 c n n 2 o c n 2 o r red 2 2 4 4 the production efficiency index and penetration depth of n2o the dimensionless n2o production efficiency index n pr is used to describe the ability of the hyporheic zone to produce n2o which is defined as the ratio of the net incomplete denitrification rate idr cdr to the total influx of n2o into the hyporheic zone 26 n pr idr cdr idr cdr i f n 2 o the penetration depth of n2o d n2o l is defined as the vertical depth of the plume center of mass jiang et al 2020 27 d n 2 o a z c n 2 o x z t d a a c n 2 o x z t d a 2 4 5 the species reaction and characteristic residence time scale in order to elucidate the role of hyporheic exchange in the n2o fate the combined effect of hydro morphological and biogeochemical characteristics of the stream on n2o emission is defined using a biogeochemical damköhler number 28 da τ t τ r where τ t t is a characteristic time scale for transport of species through a ripple as described in the study of azizian et al 2015 29 τ t λ ϕ π 2 u p it can be interpreted as the time it takes for a water parcel to travel the distance λ at the pore water velocity u p ϕ for migrating bedforms the characteristic time is assumed to be inversely proportional to the velocity ratio u r the reaction timescale τr t represents the time needed to consume the dissolved oxygen o2 of the hyporheic water to a prescribed threshold o2 lim marzadri et al 2011 30 τ r ln c o 2 0 c o 2 lim k doc this approach is based on the assumption that the potential for developing anaerobic conditions within the hyporheic zone as described by da can serve as a surrogate for n2o production because denitrification primarily occurs in anaerobic areas 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration the flume experiments of quick et al 2016 are conducted with steady flow over a homogeneous streambed with a fixed water depth of 0 3 m test s2 and table s2 which is in the range of the water depth 0 25 0 4 m of the bedform stability diagram fig s1a the model calibration results can be found in text s2 similar to the previous study jiang et al 2021a based on the same water depth the validated model is then coupled with ripple migration induced by the stream flow to study the production and consumption of n2o in the bedform under the effect of ripple celerity the ripple dimensions and migrating velocities are coupled to the grain sizes and stream flow velocities for the later modelling runs sections 3 1 3 8 as shown in table s1 3 2 comparison of n2o and n2 distributions between mobile and immobile ripples in order to understand the n2o cycling and distribution within the bedform and how they are affected by bedform migration the cases simulated with geometry 5 medium sand with d 50 0 3 mm and geometry 1 fine sand with d 50 0 06 mm are taken as examples table s1 the ripple migration velocity c is directly coupled to the shear velocity u and thus whether and how fast the ripple migrates are controlled by stream flow table s1 and fig 2b for the bedform with medium sand fig 3 the vertical extent of n2o and n2 is similar between mobile and immobile ripples at low stream flow velocity u 12 0 cm s 1 o2 n2o and n2 are distributed in the shallow middle and deep area of the riverbed respectively fig 3 a pumping dominates the exchange processes u r 0 table s1 and in this case ripple celerity c 0 1 cm h 1 can offset the horizontal flow velocity u s induced by the channel slope s 6 10 5 table s1 the o2 in the stream water penetrates from the stoss side into the ripple fig 3 a forming a conchoidal shaped distribution which is consistent with the experimental results of wolke et al 2019 the n2o and n2 produced in the deep area can be released through the upwelling anoxic flow path beneath the lee side of the bedform the ripple celerity begins to distort the convective flow field as the stream flow velocity increases u 13 0 and 14 0 cm s 1 but pumping still dominates the exchange processes u r 0 13 and 0 37 table s1 the substantial effect of ripple migration results in the reversal of the horizontal velocities in the deep area of the streambed fig 3 b and c the ripple migration and the resulting fast vertical flow reversal can suppress the net pore water displacement and lead to the formation of a redox seal which separates the deeper anoxic area from the above oxic area and inhibits n2o emissions the plume front of n2o and the top surface of n2 become more gentle in mobile ripples compared with that in immobile ripples fig 3 b and c the release path of n2o and n2 the chimney like structure is weakened in this case and they migrate slightly upstream to the crest of the bedform as the ripple migration velocity is further increased c 13 9 97 5 cm h 1 turnover exchange u r 1 10 4 09 would fully dominate the pressure driven pore water flow fig 3 d the reversal of the horizontal velocities occupies the whole area of the streambed the penetration of nutrients doc o2 and no3 from the stoss side is mostly hindered and a continuous oxic layer is even formed in the shallow area due to trap of pore water on the lee side at high ripple migration velocities e g c 97 5 cm h 1 this thin transition zone with steep o2 gradients which is also observed in the flume experiment with a ripple celerity of 67 cm h 1 wolke et al 2019 occupies the release path of n2o and n2 in the shallow area fig 3 d the n2o and n2 distributions become increasingly homogeneous in the horizontal direction as the pore water convection is unable to keep up with the moving ripple fig 3 d the magnitude of the nutrients concentration gradient and the n2o flux between these two areas depend only on the dispersive and diffusive transport in summary the production and consumption of n2o in the bedform are changed from two dimensional to one dimensional with increasing ripple migration and the reversal of the horizontal pore water flow suppresses the vertical advective transport of n2o underneath the ripple in the low permeability bedform with fine sand fig s3 a d o2 is quickly consumed due to the long residence time resulting in the upward movement of the n2o production zone compared with the case of medium sand fig 3 however turnover exchange dominates u r 1 1 the hyporheic exchange at lower stream flow velocities table s1 and fig s3 b hence a continuous oxic layer is formed and the n2o release path disappears at low reynolds numbers fig s3 c and d 3 3 impact of ripple migration on n2o flux across beds of different grain sizes to analyze the impact of ripple migration on the supply and release of n2o across beds with different medium grain sizes d 50 the total interfacial flux of water and n2o into if water and if n2o and out of water and of n2o of ripples are calculated using eq 22 fig 4 it is found that water influx increases monotonically with re and more specifically it is a power function of re fig 4a similar results are also obtained for stationary bedforms cardenas and wilson 2007 chen et al 2015 the pumping effect e g re 2560 on water influx in ripples with medium sand can be 2 orders of magnitude larger than that with fine sand fig 4a and table s3 due to the increase of the permeability and size of ripples while the turnover effect results in less water influx in ripples with medium sand e g d 50 0 3 mm for a given re due to the lower migrating velocity fig 2 the n2o influx pattern is the same as that of water influx due to the constant n2o input from the stream fig 4c in general both turnover and pumping contribute to n2o influx as the streambed migrates however the pumping effect can be negligible in comparison with turnover exchange in cases of d 50 0 1 mm and the latter accounts for almost all the interfacial flux of n2o into the ripple fig 4c however it should also be noted that the n2o influx would be underestimated using the pure turnover exchange model i e if n2o c n2o 0 hϕc λ proposed by elliott and brooks 1997 as expected the water outflux also increases monotonically with stream flow velocity for both mobile and immobile ripples with different grain sizes fig 4b however there is a marked difference in the emission flux of n2o of n2o from ripples into the river fig 4d and table s3 the stream flow has a noticeable impact on n2o emission in immobile ripples with d 50 0 1 mm as it is distributed in the shallow area of the bed as described in section 3 2 fig s3 however this effect is very weak in riverbeds with large particle size table s3 thus ripple celerity has a significant effect on n2o emission only in riverbeds with d 50 0 1 mm the release percentage is increased by 3 7 11 16 and 22 at d 50 0 06 mm but decreased by 2 13 11 11 and 13 at d 50 0 3 mm with the increase of u from 0 12 to 0 13 0 14 0 15 and 0 17 m s 1 respectively fig 4d and table s3 indicating that ripple celerity has a minor effect in beds with medium sand especially at high stream flow velocities the n2o emission flux in migrating ripples is lower than that in stationary ripples with d 50 0 1 mm and the pure turnover exchange can impede the release flux attributable to pumping exchange fig 4d 3 4 the effect of ripple celerity on the hotspots of n2o production and consumption the biogeochemical hotspots are characterized as the areas or patches with disproportionately high reaction rates relative to the surrounding areas mcclain et al 2003 in this study the hotspots of n2o production and consumption are defined as the areas where the reaction rates are 80 of the maximum incomplete mr red 2 and complete mr red 3 denitrification rate respectively here the results of case geometry 5 where d 50 0 3 mm λ 157 mm and δ 16 mm are discussed fig 5 for immobile bedforms a couple of n2o production hotspots are separated by the two hyporheic circulation cells fig 5a which are distributed at the left and right below the oxic anoxic boundary blue line in fig 5a one hotspot area located above the stagnant point red circle in fig 5a shrinks with increasing u fig 5a d indicating the decrease of the n2o production capacity in this area while the other hotspots on the right side of the bedform are slightly enlarged with increasing u similar results are observed for hotspots of n2o consumption located below the n2o production consumption boundary green line in fig 5b and eventually the maximum net incomplete denitrification rate is increased from 4 8 10 2 mg m 3 s 1 at 0 12 m s 1 to 5 0 10 2 mg m 3 s 1 at 0 16 m s 1 the incomplete and complete denitrification rates are less sensitive to the stream flow regime compared to temperature which can lead to a dramatic increase of the maximum denitrification rate from 5 c to 35 c zheng et al 2016 the area of n2o production and consumption hotspots in mobile bedforms becomes smaller compared with that in immobile bedforms and it is changed from a crescent shape to a continuous rectangular shape with increasing u where turnover exchange dominates in mobile ripples the spatial distribution of n2o production and consumption hotspots is heterogeneous at low celerity e g fig 5a but more homogeneous at high celerity e g fig 5a d the maximum net incomplete denitrification rate in mobile ripples is decreased by about 0 4 times from 5 1 10 2 mg m 3 s 1 at 0 12 m s 1 to 3 6 10 2 mg m 3 s 1 at 0 16 m s 1 this is consistent with the variation of emission percentage described in section 3 3 indicating that the weakening of n2o production hotspots can decrease n2o emissions 3 5 the effect of ripple celerity on the n2o source sink function and production efficiency in order to distinguish the total reaction rate of n2o r n2o from the stream water r w n2o or the coupled incomplete complete denitrification r n n2o the spatial distributions of these three rates calculated using eq 25 are analyzed fig 6 the n2o transported from the stream water is mainly consumed by complete denitrification in the bed resulting in the sink of n2o r w n2o 0 in both immobile and mobile ripples fig 7 however the river bed eventually acts as a net n2o source as evidence by the value of idr cdr fig 7a calculated using eq 23 this is because a significant fraction of n2o in the bed is derived from incomplete denitrification of no3 r n n2o the total reaction rate of n2o r n2o from the stream water is about 3 orders of magnitude lower than that from coupled incomplete complete denitrification in all mobile and immobile bedforms fig 7 this is because in our simulations the concentrations of n2o i e 0 2 ug l 1 from the stream are much lower compared with that of no3 2 mg l 1 table s2 as suggested by numerous field investigations clough et al 2007 cooper et al 2017 mwanake et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the effect of migration celerity on the n2o source sink function in ripples with different grain sizes is analyzed fig 7a the hyporheic zone acts as a n2o source in both stable and migrating ripples which would not change with the increase of stream flow velocity as the value of idr cdr is always 0 the stream flow velocity can enhance the n2o source role in stable ripples especially in ripples with d 50 0 1 mm fig 7a however the ripple celerity induced by the stream water has different impacts on idr cdr which is slightly increased in fine sand of d 50 0 1 mm but slightly decreased in medium sand of d 50 0 1 mm this may be related to the difference in sensitivity between incomplete and complete denitrification rate under different riverbed conditions table s3 the ratio of the total incomplete denitrification to the total complete denitrification can be calculated by idr cdr eq 23 as shown in table s3 it ranges from 1 07 to 1 41 in mobile ripples composed with different grain sizes 0 06 mm 0 3 mm indicating that the ratio of incomplete denitrification to complete denitrification can be highly variable due to the grain size effect in order to further estimate the contribution of n2o influx from stream water and coupled incomplete complete denitrification to n2o net production the n2o production efficiency index is calculated using eq 27 the n2o influx is about 4 orders of magnitude lower the net incomplete denitrification rate as a result the coupled incomplete complete denitrification is responsible for almost all n2o production in stable streambeds with d 50 0 1 mm fig 7b and the production efficiency shows a declining trend at high re numbers in streambeds with d 50 0 2 mm even in the case of high n2o input since the n2o influx in migrating ripples is 2 orders of magnitude larger than that in stable ripples and turnover exchange dominates table s3 e g d 50 0 06 mm the n2o production efficiency is found to decrease with increasing u in bedforms with fine sand the production efficiency in streambeds with medium sand is higher than that in streambeds with fine sand which is attributed to the lower n2o influx in streambeds with medium sand fig 7b 3 6 the impact of respiration rate on n2o penetration depth aerobic respiration in streambed is one of the most crucial processes in streams which has an effect on the chemical conditions e g o2 and no3 uptake in the hyporheic zone to evaluate the effect of respiration rate on the n2o penetration depth in migrating ripples 30 simulations are conducted for case geometry 5 at different doc decay constants k doc which indicate the autotrophic metabolism rate the depth of n2o plume calculated from eq 28 is a function of the consumption rate of oxygen in the hyporheic zone by microbes present in the sediment fig 8 a higher values of k doc lead to more rapid o2 consumption supported by high doc input to the streambed which can reduce the o2 penetration depth and make the conditions more favorable to incomplete denitrification close to the swi fig 8a the n2o production area is highly sensitive to oxygen distribution and the vertical depth of the n2o plume mass center becomes shallower with increasing respiration rate fig 8b it is also noted the plume shape is changed from rectangular to crescent in some stream flow regimes e g u 14 cm s 1 the n2o penetration depth exhibits a nonlinear relationship with asymptotic behaviors at higher respiration rates fig 8b and its depth in migrating ripples is decreased by 25 28 and 34 with the increase of k doc from 2 10 5 to 5 10 5 s 1 3 7 the relationship between n2o emission flux and da number previous studies have demonstrated the importance of the interaction between kinematics and timescales in demonstrating the chemical zonation in the streambed therefore the difference between the timescales of the hyporheic flow and those of the biogeochemical reactions controls the metabolic pathway of doc and the spatial pattern of nutrient concentration five representative medium grain sizes with different re of immobile and mobile ripples are used to calculate the da defined in section 2 4 5 to account for the effects of medium grain size on ripple geometry darcy flux and n2o emission flux the normalized n2o emission flux ofn2o of n2o b λ k c no3 0 is defined as the ratio between the emission mass flux of n2o of n2o and the total stream nitrate mass flux of no3 which are the main sources of n2o production the data of 58 cases with different medium grain sizes 0 06 mm 0 3 mm are analyzed and the results show that n2o emissions from bedforms ofn2o can be expressed as a power function of n2o ada b black dashed lines obtained by regression with the model data in fig 9a of the damköhler number da which is given by the ratio between the characteristic residence time of water in the hyporheic zone and the reactive characteristic time thus it is evident that the morphology and permeability of stable ripples is a key factor controlling n2o emissions from streambeds and streambeds with different grain sizes show a similar scaling pattern fig 9 a the ripples with fine sand e g d 50 0 06 mm show a steeper slope b 1 15 corresponding to the power law exponent indicating a higher sensitivity to streambed morphology and permeability this confirms that for a given inorganic n flux in a stream n2o emission is proportional to the median residence time of water in the hyporheic zone which in turn is dependent on the stream hydro morphology and penetration characteristics this is consistent with the findings of marzadri et al 2014 by using a large data set from field observations to further explore the role of ripple migration in n2o emissions the relationship between of n2o and da is examined it is found that the dimensionless n2o flux from streambeds as a result of coupled incomplete complete denitrification is not bedform morphology dependent the power relationship between n2o emission flux and da is changed into a constant function of n2o ada 0 fig 9b the n2o emission flux shows a layered distribution across different medium grain sizes and the da number has a minor impact on n2o emissions as turnover often dominates in migrating ripples the convective pore water flow is changed from two dimensional i e stable ripple to one dimensional because of the reformation of the redox seal all n2o exits at the sediment surface through upwelling pore water by molecular diffusion kessler et al 2015 have concluded that bedform migration has a negligible effect on the denitrification of the riverbed however their model was designed for a flatbed surface and imposed a ripple celerity decoupled with neither stream flow velocity nor sediment grain size in this study the ripple geometries were constructed following bedform stability regimes and other criteria for ripple formation ripple migration rates were determined by streamflow velocity the model results further show that the denitrification rates and n2o emissions are controlled by the grain size of the streambed for mobile bedforms 3 8 implications and limitations of this study this study investigates the effect of bedform migration on n2o dynamics in the hyporheic zone through the ripple domains based on sediment stability criteria the ripple migration rate dimensions and permeability are empirically estimated from the medium grain size and mean stream flow velocity the results e g the case with d 50 0 3 mm show three distinct modes for the release of denitrification intermediate n2o from bedforms fig 3 mode 1 for stable ripples and ripples with negligible celerity e g c 0 1 cm h 1 pumping exchange dominates the n2o cycling n2o can be released through the upwelling of anoxic pore water from the deeper area and its emission flux is a power function of da thus n2o emission is proportional to the residence time of water in the hyporheic zone which in turn is dependent on the streambed morphology and permeability mode 2 for ripples moving slower than pore water u r 0 13 and 0 37 ripple celerity begins to distort the convective flow field and the layer separation is viewed via the distinct orientation of the streamlines the resulting vertical flow reversal leads to a suppression the net pore water displacement and the formation of a redox seal which separates the deeper anoxic area from the above oxic area the n2o release path is hence weakened and migrates slightly to the crest mode 3 for ripples moving faster than pore water u r 1 10 4 09 the n2o release path disappears when turnover exchange fully dominate the pressure driven pore water flow and the reversal of the horizontal velocities occupies the whole area of the streambed n2o is released only through dispersion and diffusion therefore for mobile ripples dominated by turnover the n2o emission flux shows a layered distribution at different medium grain sizes and it is independent of da these three modes can not only disentangle the interactions among pumping turnover and n2o dynamics but they can also provide a predictive tool to quantify n2o emissions by measuring reach scale biogeochemical and hydro morphological parameters however only one or two of these three modes may exist in riverbeds with different particle sizes d 50 because different hydraulic conditions are required for the formation of these ripples table s1 the o2 dynamics is closely linked to n2o distribution fig 8 and the upwelling anoxic pore water channel and continuous oxic layer are also observed in flume experiments precht et al 2004 wolke et al 2019 the model proposed in this study can be used to determine n2o distribution and its production consumption hotspots based on only a few input parameters and good characterization of n2o production consumption hotspots within streambeds is essential to understanding the mechanisms of n2o emissions from sediment water interface to date there have been only two studies on the influence of bedform migration on the nitrogen dynamics in the hyporheic zone kessler et al 2015 demonstrated that bedform migration has a negligible effect on the net denitrification rate via a model with reduced parameter combination zheng et al 2019 explored the relationship between nitrate removal efficiency and damköhler number however neither of them considered the potential effect on the production and emission of denitrification intermediate n2o it is found in this study that ripple migration has a profound effect on denitrification and n2o emissions in the riverbed with different grain sizes some simplified assumptions are made in the model for the sake of computational efficiency similar to previous studies ahmerkamp et al 2015 kessler et al 2015 zheng et al 2019 detailed simplifications and limitations on model dimensionality and boundary conditions are described elsewhere jiang et al 2021b jiang et al 2020 and only those that are most relevant to the present study are discussed here in this study the ripples used are based on the bedform stability diagram and the water depth is 0 3 m shallow water the water depth can not only determine the formation of ripples as evident from equations s1 s6 but it can also indirectly impact the migrating velocities of ripples and the nitrogen cycling within the riverbed future studies should investigate the combined effects of water depth and grain size on ripple formation and the effect of the migrating velocities of ripples on n2o emissions although the geometries of ripples at the equilibrium state could be calculated from equations s8 and s9 they are idealized shapes that rarely occur in natural rivers very often the riverbeds exhibit fractal topographies coleman and nikora 2011 lee et al 2020 and small ripples are typically superimposed over large bedforms like dunes jerolmack and mohrig 2005 martin and jerolmack 2013 baas et al 2016 in future studies bedforms can be generated by using the method like power spectra to describe the statistical properties aubeneau et al 2015 lee et al 2020 the proposed model has focused only on homogeneous streambeds with the same grain size without considering streambed heterogeneity due to ripple migration and the accumulation of fine particulates in a layer beneath the bedform due to transport and deposition of fine particles harvey et al 2012 jiang et al 2020 which in turn change the sediment hydraulic properties at the centimeter scale teitelbaum et al 2021 for example clogged fine sediment particles can increase the surface area of streambeds forming a larger habitat for microbial communities nogaro et al 2010 however there is evidence that heterogeneity has a minor impact on nitrogen cycling in two real streambeds bardini et al 2013 sediments with a mixture of silts and sands can have a high nitrate removal efficiency as the high silt content can increase the residence time of water sawyer 2015 pescimoro et al 2019 additionally the grain size distribution is a major determinant of the content and distribution of organic carbon within these sediments organic carbon is progressively concentrated in finer grained sediments and the majority of organic material in the bulk sediment 79 90 is apparently related to the surface area bergamaschi et al 1997 yu et al 2021 since this factor is not considered in the model the different organic carbon loadings due to the different grain sizes may compensate for the observed effects in this study it should be noted that this study has focused on the transport controlled effects of n2o emissions from a hydrodynamic perspective and ripple celerity is assumed to have an impact only on the pore water flow and the nutrient supply from stream water however the microbiological aspects are highly simplified due to the effect of migrating ripples ripple migration may also alter the microbial communities involved in n2o cycling and the release of organic carbon ahmerkamp et al 2017 zlatanović et al 2017 showed that migrating bedforms could stress and abrade microbial communities and thus reduce their activities net community production and respiration were suppressed by 77 and 40 in migrating sediments compared to stationary sediments respectively scheidweiler et al 2021 a combination of mechanical stress light limitation and limited habitable area likely hampered microbial metabolism in migrating sediments future studies should also consider the response of denitrifying microbial consortia to migrating ripples and corresponding biogeochemical processes in the river system such knowledge is required to upscale the laboratory results to field conditions and estimate the consequences on a catchment scale 4 conclusions ripple migration occurs in 5 20 of bedforms in natural sand bed streams which can dramatically influence the hyporheic flow field and nitrogen cycling to better understand how stream flow induced ripple migration affects n2o cycling in a hyporheic zone a two dimensional model is proposed in this study by coupling hyporheic flow ripple migration and reactive solute transport to simulate n2o production and emission in bedforms with different grain sizes the results indicate that the n2o source within the streambed is distinguished from the overlying water and incomplete denitrification derived from no3 the net n2o production in the streambed through incomplete denitrification is about 3 orders of magnitude higher than n2o input from stream water and thus it is the main source of n2o emissions from streambeds the n2o cycling is dominated by pumping and then by turnover as the stream flow velocity increases in streambeds with medium sand but the latter does not substantially change the source role of n2o in streambeds with increasing migrating velocity distinct modes for the release of denitrification intermediate n2o from bedforms were found n2o can be released through the upwelling of anoxic pore water from the deeper area in immobile and slow mobile ripples however ripple celerity begins to distort the convective flow field u r 0 13 and the resulting fast vertical flow reversal suppress net pore water displacement and the formation of a redox seal which separates the deeper anoxic area from the above oxic area the n2o emission path disappears and is released only through dispersion and diffusion when turnover exchange fully dominate the pressure driven pore water flow i e the reversal of the horizontal velocities occupies the whole area of the streambed the controls of n2o emissions hence shift from a da number dominated regime in stable ripples to a grain size dominated regime in migrating ripples these results and the identified mechanism for n2o emissions in migrating riverbed reveal that these often unaccounted components e g grain sizes are likely a driver that is crucial to include in global n2o assessments grain sizes of sediment should not be ignored and it may strongly change the n2o flux estimates based on models assuming stationary bedforms or migrating beds future field measurements and modeling studies should take into account the effect of grain size on n2o release throughout the river continuum especially the reach with strong sediment transport the reactive tracers e g no3 and isotope technique e g 15n could be jointly used in order to better distinguish and measure incomplete 15n

3346,the migration rate of ripples along the streambed has a profound effect on the hyporheic exchange and nitrogen dynamics however how the denitrification intermediate n2o is released in mobile bedforms still remain unclear in this study the ripple domains are established based on the sediment stability criteria by using the mean channel flow velocity u and the median sediment grain size d 50 a two dimensional numerical model coupling hyporheic flow ripple migration and n2o transformation is proposed to investigate how ripple celerity affects n2o dynamics in streambeds the results show that there are different patterns for the release of n2o from migrating ripples with different medium grain sizes d 50 0 06 0 3 mm n2o can be released via upwelling of anoxic pore water from the deeper area in immobile or slow mobile ripples however rapid ripple migration and the resulting fast vertical flow reversal can suppress the net pore water displacement and lead to the formation of a redox seal which separates the deeper anoxic area from the above oxic area and inhibits n2o emissions the magnitude of the nutrients concentration gradient and the n2o flux between these two areas depend only on the dispersive and diffusive transport therefore the controls of n2o emission flux hence shift from the pumping dominated regime in stable ripples to a grain size dominated regime of the migrating ripples the possible implications about the effects of hydrodynamic changes due to the migration of ripples are presented our results emphasize that knowledge of n2o production

have already been overstepped beyond a safe operating space due to anthropogenic activities rockström et al 2009 steffen et al 2015 modern agriculture is highly dependent on fertilizers and up to 30 of nitrogen fertilizers ultimately enter the rivers through runoff or groundwater flow rouse et al 1999 although an increase in anthropogenic nutrient inputs may cause eutrophication of water bodies conley et al 2009 the nitrogen level can be reduced by denitrification of nitrate however elevated emissions of nitrous oxide n2o a potent greenhouse gas responsible for climate change and stratospheric ozone depletion are also expected due to the higher denitrification rates crutzen 1970 streambeds are considered to be hotspots of nitrogen transformation due to the presence of active microbial communities and steep redox gradients krause et al 2013 boso et al 2018 jiang et al 2021b rivers and their sediments play an important role in controlling the fate of nitrogen and account for approximately 10 of n2o increase in the atmosphere beaulieu et al 2011 dwivedi et al 2018 krause et al 2013 marzadri et al 2014 a significant fraction of n2o in rivers is produced in hyporheic and riparian zones by microbial processes such as incomplete denitrification quick et al 2016 reeder et al 2018 which is primarily responsible for nitrate no3 removal and n2o emission in small rivers marzadri et al 2017 yao et al 2020 bedforms such as ripples and dunes are the result of complex interactions among stream flow sediment and bed geometry colombini and stocchino 2011 bedform morphology

verdonschot 2000 rabení et al 2005 turnover exchange occurs with the migration of bedforms so that water would be captured on the leeside and then released on the stoss side in the migration direction elliott and brooks 1997 zheng et al 2019 the contributions of pumping and turnover to hyporheic exchange have been well documented elliott and brooks 1997 packman and brooks 2001 bottacin busolin and marion 2010 bedform migration can significantly impact the oxygen and nitrogen dynamics ahmerkamp et al 2015 kessler et al 2015 wolke et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 kessler et al 2015 and zheng et al 2019 have investigated the effects of ripple celerity i e migration velocities of ripples along the riverbed fig 1 on the denitrification rate and no3 source sink function in the hyporheic zone and the final denitrification product was assumed to be n2 quick et al 2016 and reeder et al 2018 further considered the formation of the intermediate n2o and found that n2o emission in stable bedforms was dependent on the pore water flow path however the effect of migrating bedforms on the n2o dynamics in the hyporheic zone still remains unclear the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of ripple celerity on the production consumption and release of the denitrification intermediate n2o in small scale streambeds fig 1 a nitrogen cycling model is proposed and calibrated with data from the recirculating flume experiment of quick et al 2016 after that the model is coupled with migrating ripples induced by stream flow this study has focused on i n2o production consumption characteristic and its hotspot distribution in bedforms under the effect of migrating ripples ii n2o source sink function and net n2o production rate in the mobile hyporheic zone and iii n2o emission flux in stable and migrating ripples with different medium grain sizes d 50 2 methods ripples are steeper and shorter than dunes and their sizes e g wavelength and height depend only on particle diameter while the sizes of dunes are impacted by flow depth garcia 2008 both dunes and ripples are used in this study stable dunes deployed in the flume experiments of quick et al 2016 are only applied to test the flow and multicomponent reactive transport model in sections 2 2 and 2 3 and then the validated model is coupled with bedform migration induced by the stream flow to study the emission of n2o in the bedform under the effect of ripple celerity section 3 2 3 8 it should be noted that the dimensions of dunes in the flume experiments of quick et al 2016 are not designed to couple with the grain size and do not consider the sediment stability criteria theoretically we assume that dunes can be formed under their experimental conditions i e stream flow velocity and water depth of 30 cm table s2 however the ripple dimensions are coupled to the grain sizes for the later runs as shown in fig s1b we first examine whether ripples of different medium grain sizes d 50 can be formed under specific hydraulic conditions then determine the sizes and migration velocities of ripples and finally simulate n2o dynamics in the hyporheic zone in response to ripple celerity the description of each part is shown in text s1 2 1 description of the numerical model the ripple domains are established based on the criteria for ripple formation using the mean channel flow and the median sediment grain size then a series of nitrogen cycling models are developed to compare the spatial distribution of n2o interfacial flux incomplete and complete denitrification hotspots and production efficiency of n2o between mobile and immobile bedforms a simple conceptualization is used to elucidate the role of flow dynamics in bedform induced hyporheic exchange stonedahl et al 2010 singh et al 2019 jiang et al

implement batch simulations 2 2 pore water flow model in a migrating ripple the pore water flow in the ripple is modeled by the laplace equation fig 2a 2 2 h 0 where h l is the total hydraulic head the flow field in the ripple can be calculated by the darcy s law 3 q k h where k l t 1 is the hydraulic conductivity which is estimated using the empirical equation k 7 35 10 6 g d 50 2 ν based on the grain size table s1 gangi 1985 g l t 2 is the gravitational acceleration and ν l2 t 1 is the kinematic viscosity a frame of reference moving at the ripple migrating velocity c is introduced to represent the impact of celerity elliott and brooks 1997 kessler et al 2015 and this method works if the ripple can maintain its shape as it moves downstream at the velocity c ahmerkamp et al 2015 zheng et al 2019 in this frame of reference ripples appear to be stationary but pore water has an additional component of velocity in the streamwise direction that is equal to c the flow field with the celerity effect is given by 4 u x q x ϕ c u y q y ϕ where ϕ is the porosity which is assumed to be constant table s1 the subscripts x and y indicate the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity respectively the boundary conditions for pore water flow are shown in fig 2a the head distribution h x at the bed surface that assumes a linear combination of head fluctuations induced by bed topography in eq 5 wörman et al 2006 stonedahl et al 2010 jiang et al 2021b is assigned to boundaries bc and cd fig 2a thus the head distribution h x as the driver for the flow field in the porous bed and the resulting flux through the bed surface can be calculated by combining eqs 1 5 and 6 without the need to use a sequential coupling method for turbulent flow in the water column and then hyporheic flow in the porous media cardenas and wilson 2007 5 h x s x 2 h d δ z swi x λ 4 since the hydrodynamically driven hyporheic flow tends to have its greatest influence at finer scales of variability in stream velocity flowing over submerged bedforms which affects momentum transfer to the streambed boano et al 2014 the dynamic head in this study dominates the hyporheic zone and the hydrostatic head can be ignored in eq 6 h d l is the fluctuation intensity of the dynamic head elliott and brooks 1997 6 h d 0 28 u 2 2 g δ h 0 34 3 8 δ h 0 34 δ h 0 34 3 2 δ h 0 34 similar measured pressure distributions are observed along the sediment water interface for ripples janssen et al 2012 and dunes fehlman 1985 and both of which can be approximated by a sine function therefore the eq 6 developed by elliott and brooks 1997 for dune like bedforms also can be used for ripples boundaries ab and ed are set to be periodic boundaries 7 p 0 z t p λ z t δ p the pressure drop is derived from the bed slope s and the ripple wavelength λ by the equation δp ρgλs boundary ae 8 n ρ u 0 2 3 multicomponent reactive transport model a multicomponent reactive transport model is proposed to simulate the effect of ripple migration on n2o dynamics in the streambed the model frame proposed by van cappellen and wang 1996 and hunter et al 1998 has been widely applied to subsurface environments it is validated with the data collected in a marine sediment from skagerrak denmark and the flume experiments of n2o dynamics jiang et al 2021a four major biogeochemical processes including aerobic respiration nitrification incomplete denitrification i e conversion of no3 to n2o and complete denitrification i e conversion of n2o to n2 are considered in this study table 1 five reactive compounds doc o2 no3 nh4 and n2o from stream water are used as inputs at the swi table 1 formaldehyde ch2o is used to represent the complex doc substrate due to its simple chemical structure boano et al 2010 the transport of reactive compounds in the streambed is described by the steady convection dispersion reaction equation 9 d c i u c i r i i doc o 2 no 3 nh 4 n 2 o where ri m l 3 t 1 is the net reaction rate of compound i ci m l 3 is the concentration of reactive compounds in pore water and d l2 t 1 is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor which is calculated as described in previous studies jiang et al 2021a jiang et al 2020 although no measurements are available for anisotropic dispersion in dunes gelhar et al 1992 have revealed that the reliable estimates of longitudinal dispersivities range from 0 01 to 0 1 of the transport distance and transverse dispersivities are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude smaller than longitudinal dispersivities over the transport distances kapoor and gelhar 1994 and benekos et al 2006 even identified local transverse dispersion as a key factor smoothing the concentration fluctuation and controlling the dilution rate of solutes in line with previous studies the ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity αt αl in the model is assumed to be a constant 0 1 which is much closer to that in real transportation processes and can smooth concentration fluctuations in the bedform this is also consistent with the parameter settings of dispersivity in previous studies on streambed topography induced hyporheic exchange cardenas et al 2008 karwan and saiers 2012 qian et al 2008 the reaction kinetics is described as suggested in the study of hunter et al 1998 for instance for redox reactions r1 r3 and r4 table 1 the rate of doc oxidation and the rate of the i th reduction half reaction are considered separately doc oxidation i e aerobic respiration in reaction 1 table 1 severs as a direct source of chemical energy in this study doc oxidation is assumed to follow the first order kinetics kaufman et al 2017 10 r doc k doc c doc where k doc t 1 is the doc decay constant and c doc m l 3 is the doc concentration this formula has been adopted in other studies and calibrated by laboratory experiments kaufman et al 2017 the electrons produced from the oxidation of doc electron donor are transferred to potential electron acceptors such as o2 no3 and n2o following a given sequence for instance o2 no3 and n2o act as the primary secondary and third electron acceptor respectively aerobic respiration and nitrification are assumed to occur simultaneously while incomplete and complete denitrification occur only at o2 and no3 concentrations lower than the limit table s2 the reduction rate r red j of electron acceptor j j 1 for o2 j 2 for no3 and j 3 for n2o is described by 11 r red j e doc e j r doc f j where e doc and ej are the moles of electrons produced by the oxidation of per mole doc and the reduction of per mole acceptor j respectively table 1 fj is the fraction of electrons consumed by the j th reduction half reduction which is evaluated using a simplified monod kinetic equation hunter et al 1998 12 f j 1 n 1 j 1 f n α j where f0 0 the term in the parentheses accounts for the partial or complete inhibition of the reduction rate of electron acceptor j due to consumption by previous reduction half reactions and αj accounts for the limitation of rj due to the availability of electron acceptor j the reduction rate is independent on cj at concentrations higher than the limit but linearly proportional to cj at concentrations lower than the limit 13 α j c j c j l i m c j c j l i m 1 c j c j l i m the nitrification rate is described by a second order bimolecular expression 14 r n h 4 k n c nh 4 c o 2 where kn l m 1 t 1 is the second order nitrification rate coefficient values showed in table s2 hence the reaction rates of doc o2 no3 nh4 and n2o can be calculated from eq 15 15 r doc r doc r o 2 r red 1 2 r

simulation lagrange quadratic triangular elements are used in comsol multiphysics with node spacing between 0 2 cm the triangular mesh is constructed using the built in meshing algorithm for general

close to the top boundaries is used to capture the physical and chemical processes occurring at the swi the boundary layer mesh functionality in comsol is utilized to further ensure the accuracy of results from the boundary finite element size is chosen to maintain numerical peclet numbers below one in both advection and diffusion dominated zones minimizing artificial oscillations or other numerical instabilities huyakorn et al 1983 dense spacing is maintained throughout the unstructured finite element mesh with triangular elements in this study to limit numerical dispersion the node spacing along the top boundary is 0 05 cm and the node spacing within the domain is 0 2 cm this corresponds to about 5627 triangular elements that minimize numerical dispersion and produce mesh independent solutions 2 4 metrics used to quantify nitrogen cycling within the riverbed multiple parameters are used to quantify the impact of ripple migration on the n2o dynamics in the hyporheic zone which are defined and described as follows 2 4 1 the ratio between pressure driven pore water velocity and ripple celerity the relative magnitude of ripple migration and pumping induced convective pore water flow can be expressed as a dimensionless parameter u r which relates the ripple celerity c and the pressure induced pore water velocity u p l t 1 19 u r ϕ c u s u p where u s l t 1 is the seepage velocity of the underflow for a stream gradient s and the characteristic horizontal velocity is c u s ϕ 20 u s k s u p ϕ l t 1 is the pumping induced pore water velocity elliott and brooks 1997 grant et al 2014 21 u p 0 28 k u 2 g λ δ h 0 34 3 8 δ h 0 34 δ h 0 34 3 2 δ h 0 34 it is anticipated that turnover will dominate the exchange when u r 1 while pumping will dominate the exchange when u r 1 2 4 2 the total n2o influx and outflux along the swi to further quantify the impact of ripple migration on the supply and emission rate of n2o the variation of the total water and n2o influx if n2o m t 1 and outflux emission flux of n2o m t 1 across the streambed is calculate as follows 22 i f water b l q in x z t d l in o f water b l q out x z t d l out i f n 2 o b l q in x z

the downwelling area for the influx l in and that of the upwelling area l out for the outflow are evaluated as described in previous studies singh et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 jin et al 2010 2 4 3 the reaction rate of n transformation the spatial patterns of nitrification incomplete denitrification and complete denitrification rates can profoundly influence the no3 n2o source sink function of the streambed the total incomplete denitrification rate idr m t 1 and the complete denitrification rate cdr m t 1 are calculated as follows 23 idr b ϕ a r red 2 d a c d r b ϕ a r red 3 d a where a l2 is the total area of the streambed for n2o production the net incomplete denitrification the difference between idr and cdr indicates whether the ripple acts as a net sink idr cdr 0 or a net source idr cdr 0 of n2o in order to further distinguish the net incomplete denitrification of n2o derived from stream water and incomplete denitrification of no3 r3 in table 1 the total n2o in the streambed is divided into w n2o n2o transported from stream water and n n2o n2o derived from incomplete denitrification of no3 24 c n 2 o c w n 2 o c n n 2 o hence the total reaction rate of n2o in eq 26 can be divided into two parts 25 r w n 2 o r red 3 c w n 2 o c n 2 o r n n 2 o r red 3 c n n 2 o c n 2 o r red 2 2 4 4 the production efficiency index and penetration depth of n2o the dimensionless n2o production efficiency index n pr is used to describe the ability of the hyporheic zone to produce n2o which is defined as the ratio of the net incomplete denitrification rate idr cdr to the total influx of n2o into the hyporheic zone 26 n pr idr cdr idr cdr i f n 2 o the penetration depth of n2o d n2o l is defined as the vertical depth of the plume center of mass jiang et al 2020 27 d n 2 o a z c n 2 o x z t d a a c n 2 o x z t d a 2 4 5 the species reaction and characteristic residence time scale in order to elucidate the role of hyporheic exchange in the n2o fate the combined effect of hydro morphological and biogeochemical characteristics of the stream on n2o emission is defined using a biogeochemical damköhler number 28 da τ t τ r where τ t t is a characteristic time scale for transport of species through a ripple as described in the study of azizian et al 2015 29 τ t λ ϕ π 2 u p it can be interpreted as the time it takes for a water parcel to travel the distance λ at the pore water velocity u p ϕ for migrating bedforms the characteristic time is assumed to be inversely proportional to the velocity ratio u r the reaction timescale τr t represents the time needed to consume the dissolved oxygen o2 of the hyporheic water to a prescribed threshold o2 lim marzadri et al 2011 30 τ r ln c o 2 0 c o 2 lim k doc this approach is based on the assumption that the potential for developing anaerobic conditions within the hyporheic zone as described by da can serve as a surrogate for n2o production because denitrification primarily occurs in anaerobic areas 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration the flume experiments of quick et al 2016 are conducted with steady flow over a homogeneous streambed with a fixed water depth of 0 3 m test s2 and table s2 which is in the range of the water depth 0 25 0 4 m of the bedform stability diagram fig s1a the model calibration results can be found in text s2 similar to the previous study jiang et al 2021a based on the same water depth the validated model is then coupled with ripple migration induced by the stream flow to study the production and consumption of n2o in the bedform under the effect of ripple celerity the ripple dimensions and migrating velocities are coupled to the grain sizes and stream flow velocities for the later modelling runs sections 3 1 3 8 as shown in table s1 3 2 comparison of n2o and n2 distributions between mobile and immobile ripples in order to understand the n2o cycling and distribution within the bedform and how they are affected by bedform migration the cases simulated with geometry 5 medium sand with d 50 0 3 mm and geometry 1 fine sand with d 50 0 06 mm are taken as examples table s1 the ripple migration velocity c is directly coupled to the shear velocity u and thus whether and how fast the ripple migrates are controlled by stream flow table s1 and fig 2b for the bedform with medium sand fig 3 the vertical extent of n2o and n2 is similar between mobile and immobile ripples at low stream flow velocity u 12 0 cm s 1 o2 n2o and n2 are distributed in the shallow middle and deep area of the riverbed respectively fig 3 a pumping dominates the exchange processes u r 0 table s1 and in this case ripple celerity c 0 1 cm h 1 can offset the horizontal flow velocity u s induced by the channel slope s 6 10 5 table s1 the o2 in the stream water penetrates from the stoss side into the ripple fig 3 a forming a conchoidal shaped distribution which is consistent with the experimental results of wolke et al 2019 the n2o and n2 produced in the deep area can be released through the upwelling anoxic flow path beneath the lee side of the bedform the ripple celerity begins to distort the convective flow field as the stream flow velocity increases u 13 0 and 14 0 cm s 1 but pumping still dominates the exchange processes u r 0 13 and 0 37 table s1 the substantial effect of ripple migration results in the reversal of the horizontal velocities in the deep area of the streambed fig 3 b and c the ripple migration and the resulting fast vertical flow reversal can suppress the net pore water displacement and lead to the formation of a redox seal which separates the deeper anoxic area from the above oxic area and inhibits n2o emissions the plume front of n2o and the top surface of n2 become more gentle in mobile ripples compared with that in immobile ripples fig 3 b and c the release path of n2o and n2 the chimney like structure is weakened in this case and they migrate slightly upstream to the crest of the bedform as the ripple migration velocity is further increased c 13 9 97 5 cm h 1 turnover exchange u r 1 10 4 09 would fully dominate the pressure driven pore water flow fig 3 d the reversal of the horizontal velocities occupies the whole area of the streambed the penetration of nutrients doc o2 and no3 from the stoss side is mostly hindered and a continuous oxic layer is even formed in the shallow area due to trap of pore water on the lee side at high ripple migration velocities e g c 97 5 cm h 1 this thin transition zone with steep o2 gradients which is also observed in the flume experiment with a ripple celerity of 67 cm h 1 wolke et al 2019 occupies the release path of n2o and n2 in the shallow area fig 3 d the n2o and n2 distributions become increasingly homogeneous in the horizontal direction as the pore water convection is unable to keep up with the moving ripple fig 3 d the magnitude of the nutrients concentration gradient and the n2o flux between these two areas depend only on the dispersive and diffusive transport in summary the production and consumption of n2o in the bedform are changed from two dimensional to one dimensional with increasing ripple migration and the reversal of the horizontal pore water flow suppresses the vertical advective transport of n2o underneath the ripple in the low permeability bedform with fine sand fig s3 a d o2 is quickly consumed due to the long residence time resulting in the upward movement of the n2o production zone compared with the case of medium sand fig 3 however turnover exchange dominates u r 1 1 the hyporheic exchange at lower stream flow velocities table s1 and fig s3 b hence a continuous oxic layer is formed and the n2o release path disappears at low reynolds numbers fig s3 c and d 3 3 impact of ripple migration on n2o flux across beds of different grain sizes to analyze the impact of ripple migration on the supply and release of n2o across beds with different medium grain sizes d 50 the total interfacial flux of water and n2o into if water and if n2o and out of water and of n2o of ripples are calculated using eq 22 fig 4 it is found that water influx increases monotonically with re and more specifically it is a power function of re fig 4a similar results are also obtained for stationary bedforms cardenas and wilson 2007 chen et al 2015 the pumping effect e g re 2560 on water influx in ripples with medium sand can be 2 orders of magnitude larger than that with fine sand fig 4a and table s3 due to the increase of the permeability and size of ripples while the turnover effect results in less water influx in ripples with medium sand e g d 50 0 3 mm for a given re due to the lower migrating velocity fig 2 the n2o influx pattern is the same as that of water influx due to the constant n2o input from the stream fig 4c in general both turnover and pumping contribute to n2o influx as the streambed migrates however the pumping effect can be negligible in comparison with turnover exchange in cases of d 50 0 1 mm and the latter accounts for almost all the interfacial flux of n2o into the ripple fig 4c however it should also be noted that the n2o influx would be underestimated using the pure turnover exchange model i e if n2o c n2o 0 hϕc λ proposed by elliott and brooks 1997 as expected the water outflux also increases monotonically with stream flow velocity for both mobile and immobile ripples with different grain sizes fig 4b however there is a marked difference in the emission flux of n2o of n2o from ripples into the river fig 4d and table s3 the stream flow has a noticeable impact on n2o emission in immobile ripples with d 50 0 1 mm as it is distributed in the shallow area of the bed as described in section 3 2 fig s3 however this effect is very weak in riverbeds with large particle size table s3 thus ripple celerity has a significant effect on n2o emission only in riverbeds with d 50 0 1 mm the release percentage is increased by 3 7 11 16 and 22 at d 50 0 06 mm but decreased by 2 13 11 11 and 13 at d 50 0 3 mm with the increase of u from 0 12 to 0 13 0 14 0 15 and 0 17 m s 1 respectively fig 4d and table s3 indicating that ripple celerity has a minor effect in beds with medium sand especially at high stream flow velocities the n2o emission flux in migrating ripples is lower than that in stationary ripples with d 50 0 1 mm and the pure turnover exchange can impede the release flux attributable to pumping exchange fig 4d 3 4 the effect of ripple celerity on the hotspots of n2o production and consumption the biogeochemical hotspots are characterized as the areas or patches with disproportionately high reaction rates relative to the surrounding areas mcclain et al 2003 in this study the hotspots of n2o production and consumption are defined as the areas where the reaction rates are 80 of the maximum incomplete mr red 2 and complete mr red 3 denitrification rate respectively here the results of case geometry 5 where d 50 0 3 mm λ 157 mm and δ 16 mm are discussed fig 5 for immobile bedforms a couple of n2o production hotspots are separated by the two hyporheic circulation cells fig 5a which are distributed at the left and right below the oxic anoxic boundary blue line in fig 5a one hotspot area located above the stagnant point red circle in fig 5a shrinks with increasing u fig 5a d indicating the decrease of the n2o production capacity in this area while the other hotspots on the right side of the bedform are slightly enlarged with increasing u similar results are observed for hotspots of n2o consumption located below the n2o production consumption boundary green line in fig 5b and eventually the maximum net incomplete denitrification rate is increased from 4 8 10 2 mg m 3 s 1 at 0 12 m s 1 to 5 0 10 2 mg m 3 s 1 at 0 16 m s 1 the incomplete and complete denitrification rates are less sensitive to the stream flow regime compared to temperature which can lead to a dramatic increase of the maximum denitrification rate from 5 c to 35 c zheng et al 2016 the area of n2o production and consumption hotspots in mobile bedforms becomes smaller compared with that in immobile bedforms and it is changed from a crescent shape to a continuous rectangular shape with increasing u where turnover exchange dominates in mobile ripples the spatial distribution of n2o production and consumption hotspots is heterogeneous at low celerity e g fig 5a but more homogeneous at high celerity e g fig 5a d the maximum net incomplete denitrification rate in mobile ripples is decreased by about 0 4 times from 5 1 10 2 mg m 3 s 1 at 0 12 m s 1 to 3 6 10 2 mg m 3 s 1 at 0 16 m s 1 this is consistent with the variation of emission percentage described in section 3 3 indicating that the weakening of n2o production hotspots can decrease n2o emissions 3 5 the effect of ripple celerity on the n2o source sink function and production efficiency in order to distinguish the total reaction rate of n2o r n2o from the stream water r w n2o or the coupled incomplete complete denitrification r n n2o the spatial distributions of these three rates calculated using eq 25 are analyzed fig 6 the n2o transported from the stream water is mainly consumed by complete denitrification in the bed resulting in the sink of n2o r w n2o 0 in both immobile and mobile ripples fig 7 however the river bed eventually acts as a net n2o source as evidence by the value of idr cdr fig 7a calculated using eq 23 this is because a significant fraction of n2o in the bed is derived from incomplete denitrification of no3 r n n2o the total reaction rate of n2o r n2o from the stream water is about 3 orders of magnitude lower than that from coupled incomplete complete denitrification in all mobile and immobile bedforms fig 7 this is because in our simulations the concentrations of n2o i e 0 2 ug l 1 from the stream are much lower compared with that of no3 2 mg l 1 table s2 as suggested by numerous field investigations clough et al 2007 cooper et al 2017 mwanake et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the effect of migration celerity on the n2o source sink function in ripples with different grain sizes is analyzed fig 7a the hyporheic zone acts as a n2o source in both stable and migrating ripples which would not change with the increase of stream flow velocity as the value of idr cdr is always 0 the stream flow velocity can enhance the n2o source role in stable ripples especially in ripples with d 50 0 1 mm fig 7a however the ripple celerity induced by the stream water has different impacts on idr cdr which is slightly increased in fine sand of d 50 0 1 mm but slightly decreased in medium sand of d 50 0 1 mm this may be related to the difference in sensitivity between incomplete and complete denitrification rate under different riverbed conditions table s3 the ratio of the total incomplete denitrification to the total complete denitrification can be calculated by idr cdr eq 23 as shown in table s3 it ranges from 1 07 to 1 41 in mobile ripples composed with different grain sizes 0 06 mm 0 3 mm indicating that the ratio of incomplete denitrification to complete denitrification can be highly variable due to the grain size effect in order to further estimate the contribution of n2o influx from stream water and coupled incomplete complete denitrification to n2o net production the n2o production efficiency index is calculated using eq 27 the n2o influx is about 4 orders of magnitude lower the net incomplete denitrification rate as a result the coupled incomplete complete denitrification is responsible for almost all n2o production in stable streambeds with d 50 0 1 mm fig 7b and the production efficiency shows a declining trend at high re numbers in streambeds with d 50 0 2 mm even in the case of high n2o input since the n2o influx in migrating ripples is 2 orders of magnitude larger than that in stable ripples and turnover exchange dominates table s3 e g d 50 0 06 mm the n2o production efficiency is found to decrease with increasing u in bedforms with fine sand the production efficiency in streambeds with medium sand is higher than that in streambeds with fine sand which is attributed to the lower n2o influx in streambeds with medium sand fig 7b 3 6 the impact of respiration rate on n2o penetration depth aerobic respiration in streambed is one of the most crucial processes in streams which has an effect on the chemical conditions e g o2 and no3 uptake in the hyporheic zone to evaluate the effect of respiration rate on the n2o penetration depth in migrating ripples 30 simulations are conducted for case geometry 5 at different doc decay constants k doc which indicate the autotrophic metabolism rate the depth of n2o plume calculated from eq 28 is a function of the consumption rate of oxygen in the hyporheic zone by microbes present in the sediment fig 8 a higher values of k doc lead to more rapid o2 consumption supported by high doc input to the streambed which can reduce the o2 penetration depth and make the conditions more favorable to incomplete denitrification close to the swi fig 8a the n2o production area is highly sensitive to oxygen distribution and the vertical depth of the n2o plume mass center becomes shallower with increasing respiration rate fig 8b it is also noted the plume shape is changed from rectangular to crescent in some stream flow regimes e g u 14 cm s 1 the n2o penetration depth exhibits a nonlinear relationship with asymptotic behaviors at higher respiration rates fig 8b and its depth in migrating ripples is decreased by 25 28 and 34 with the increase of k doc from 2 10 5 to 5 10 5 s 1 3 7 the relationship between n2o emission flux and da number previous studies have demonstrated the importance of the interaction between kinematics and timescales in demonstrating the chemical zonation in the streambed therefore the difference between the timescales of the hyporheic flow and those of the biogeochemical reactions controls the metabolic pathway of doc and the spatial pattern of nutrient concentration five representative medium grain sizes with different re of immobile and mobile ripples are used to calculate the da defined in section 2 4 5 to account for the effects of medium grain size on ripple geometry darcy flux and n2o emission flux the normalized n2o emission flux ofn2o of n2o b λ k c no3 0 is defined as the ratio between the emission mass flux of n2o of n2o and the total stream nitrate mass flux of no3 which are the main sources of n2o production the data of 58 cases with different medium grain sizes 0 06 mm 0 3 mm are analyzed and the results show that n2o emissions from bedforms ofn2o can be expressed as a power function of n2o ada b black dashed lines obtained by regression with the model data in fig 9a of the damköhler number da which is given by the ratio between the characteristic residence time of water in the hyporheic zone and the reactive characteristic time thus it is evident that the morphology and permeability of stable ripples is a key factor controlling n2o emissions from streambeds and streambeds with different grain sizes show a similar scaling pattern fig 9 a the ripples with fine sand e g d 50 0 06 mm show a steeper slope b 1 15 corresponding to the power law exponent indicating a higher sensitivity to streambed morphology and permeability this confirms that for a given inorganic n flux in a stream n2o emission is proportional to the median residence time of water in the hyporheic zone which in turn is dependent on the stream hydro morphology and penetration characteristics this is consistent with the findings of marzadri et al 2014 by using a large data set from field observations to further explore the role of ripple migration in n2o emissions the relationship between of n2o and da is examined it is found that the dimensionless n2o flux from streambeds as a result of coupled incomplete complete denitrification is not bedform morphology dependent the power relationship between n2o emission flux and da is changed into a constant function of n2o ada 0 fig 9b the n2o emission flux shows a layered distribution across different medium grain sizes and the da number has a minor impact on n2o emissions as turnover often dominates in migrating ripples the convective pore water flow is changed from two dimensional i e stable ripple to one dimensional because of the reformation of the redox seal all n2o exits at the sediment surface through upwelling pore water by molecular diffusion kessler et al 2015 have concluded that bedform migration has a negligible effect on the denitrification of the riverbed however their model was designed for a flatbed surface and imposed a ripple celerity decoupled with neither stream flow velocity nor sediment grain size in this study the ripple geometries were constructed following bedform stability regimes and other criteria for ripple formation ripple migration rates were determined by streamflow velocity the model results further show that the denitrification rates and n2o emissions are controlled by the grain size of the streambed for mobile bedforms 3 8 implications and limitations of this study this study investigates the effect of bedform migration on n2o dynamics in the hyporheic zone through the ripple domains based on sediment stability criteria the ripple migration rate dimensions and permeability are empirically estimated from the medium grain size and mean stream flow velocity the results e g the case with d 50 0 3 mm show three distinct modes for the release of denitrification intermediate n2o from bedforms fig 3 mode 1 for stable ripples and ripples with negligible celerity e g c 0 1 cm h 1 pumping exchange dominates the n2o cycling n2o can be released through the upwelling of anoxic pore water from the deeper area and its emission flux is a power function of da thus n2o emission is proportional to the residence time of water in the hyporheic zone which in turn is dependent on the streambed morphology and permeability mode 2 for ripples moving slower than pore water u r 0 13 and 0 37 ripple celerity begins to distort the convective flow field and the layer separation is viewed via the distinct orientation of the streamlines the resulting vertical flow reversal leads to a suppression the net pore water displacement and the formation of a redox seal which separates the deeper anoxic area from the above oxic area the n2o release path is hence weakened and migrates slightly to the crest mode 3 for ripples moving faster than pore water u r 1 10 4 09 the n2o release path disappears when turnover exchange fully dominate the pressure driven pore water flow and the reversal of the horizontal velocities occupies the whole area of the streambed n2o is released only through dispersion and diffusion therefore for mobile ripples dominated by turnover the n2o emission flux shows a layered distribution at different medium grain sizes and it is independent of da these three modes can not only disentangle the interactions among pumping turnover and n2o dynamics but they can also provide a predictive tool to quantify n2o emissions by measuring reach scale biogeochemical and hydro morphological parameters however only one or two of these three modes may exist in riverbeds with different particle sizes d 50 because different hydraulic conditions are required for the formation of these ripples table s1 the o2 dynamics is closely linked to n2o distribution fig 8 and the upwelling anoxic pore water channel and continuous oxic layer are also observed in flume experiments precht et al 2004 wolke et al 2019 the model proposed in this study can be used to determine n2o distribution and its production consumption hotspots based on only a few input parameters and good characterization of n2o production consumption hotspots within streambeds is essential to understanding the mechanisms of n2o emissions from sediment water interface to date there have been only two studies on the influence of bedform migration on the nitrogen dynamics in the hyporheic zone kessler et al 2015 demonstrated that bedform migration has a negligible effect on the net denitrification rate via a model with reduced parameter combination zheng et al 2019 explored the relationship between nitrate removal efficiency and damköhler number however neither of them considered the potential effect on the production and emission of denitrification intermediate n2o it is found in this study that ripple migration has a profound effect on denitrification and n2o emissions in the riverbed with different grain sizes some simplified assumptions are made in the model for the sake of computational efficiency similar to previous studies ahmerkamp et al 2015 kessler et al 2015 zheng et al 2019 detailed simplifications and limitations on model dimensionality and boundary conditions are described elsewhere jiang et al 2021b jiang et al 2020 and only those that are most relevant to the present study are discussed here in this study the ripples used are based on the bedform stability diagram and the water depth is 0 3 m shallow water the water depth can not only determine the formation of ripples as evident from equations s1 s6 but it can also indirectly impact the migrating velocities of ripples and the nitrogen cycling within the riverbed future studies should investigate the combined effects of water depth and grain size on ripple formation and the effect of the migrating velocities of ripples on n2o emissions although the geometries of ripples at the equilibrium state could be calculated from equations s8 and s9 they are idealized shapes that rarely occur in natural rivers very often the riverbeds exhibit fractal topographies coleman and nikora 2011 lee et al 2020 and small ripples are typically superimposed over large bedforms like dunes jerolmack and mohrig 2005 martin and jerolmack 2013 baas et al 2016 in future studies bedforms can be generated by using the method like power spectra to describe the statistical properties aubeneau et al 2015 lee et al 2020 the proposed model has focused only on homogeneous streambeds with the same grain size without considering streambed heterogeneity due to ripple migration and the accumulation of fine particulates in a layer beneath the bedform due to transport and deposition of fine particles harvey et al 2012 jiang et al 2020 which in turn change the sediment hydraulic properties at the centimeter scale teitelbaum et al 2021 for example clogged fine sediment particles can increase the surface area of streambeds forming a larger habitat for microbial communities nogaro et al 2010 however there is evidence that heterogeneity has a minor impact on nitrogen cycling in two real streambeds bardini et al 2013 sediments with a mixture of silts and sands can have a high nitrate removal efficiency as the high silt content can increase the residence time of water sawyer 2015 pescimoro et al 2019 additionally the grain size distribution is a major determinant of the content and distribution of organic carbon within these sediments organic carbon is progressively concentrated in finer grained sediments and the majority of organic material in the bulk sediment 79 90 is apparently related to the surface area bergamaschi et al 1997 yu et al 2021 since this factor is not considered in the model the different organic carbon loadings due to the different grain sizes may compensate for the observed effects in this study it should be noted that this study has focused on the transport controlled effects of n2o emissions from a hydrodynamic perspective and ripple celerity is assumed to have an impact only on the pore water flow and the nutrient supply from stream water however the microbiological aspects are highly simplified due to the effect of migrating ripples ripple migration may also alter the microbial communities involved in n2o cycling and the release of organic carbon ahmerkamp et al 2017 zlatanović et al 2017 showed that migrating bedforms could stress and abrade microbial communities and thus reduce their activities net community production and respiration were suppressed by 77 and 40 in migrating sediments compared to stationary sediments respectively scheidweiler et al 2021 a combination of mechanical stress light limitation and limited habitable area likely hampered microbial metabolism in migrating sediments future studies should also consider the response of denitrifying microbial consortia to migrating ripples and corresponding biogeochemical processes in the river system such knowledge is required to upscale the laboratory results to field conditions and estimate the consequences on a catchment scale 4 conclusions ripple migration occurs in 5 20 of bedforms in natural sand bed streams which can dramatically influence the hyporheic flow field and nitrogen cycling to better understand how stream flow induced ripple migration affects n2o cycling in a hyporheic zone a two dimensional model is proposed in this study by coupling hyporheic flow ripple migration and reactive solute transport to simulate n2o production and emission in bedforms with different grain sizes the results indicate that the n2o source within the streambed is distinguished from the overlying water and incomplete denitrification derived from no3 the net n2o production in the streambed through incomplete denitrification is about 3 orders of magnitude higher than n2o input from stream water and thus it is the main source of n2o emissions from streambeds the n2o cycling is dominated by pumping and then by turnover as the stream flow velocity increases in streambeds with medium sand but the latter does not substantially change the source role of n2o in streambeds with increasing migrating velocity distinct modes for the release of denitrification intermediate n2o from bedforms were found n2o can be released through the upwelling of anoxic pore water from the deeper area in immobile and slow mobile ripples however ripple celerity begins to distort the convective flow field u r 0 13 and the resulting fast vertical flow reversal suppress net pore water displacement and the formation of a redox seal which separates the deeper anoxic area from the above oxic area the n2o emission path disappears and is released only through dispersion and diffusion when turnover exchange fully dominate the pressure driven pore water flow i e the reversal of the horizontal velocities occupies the whole area of the streambed the controls of n2o emissions hence shift from a da number dominated regime in stable ripples to a grain size dominated regime in migrating ripples these results and the identified mechanism for n2o emissions in migrating riverbed reveal that these often unaccounted components e g grain sizes are likely a driver that is crucial to include in global n2o assessments grain sizes of sediment should not be ignored and it may strongly change the n2o flux estimates based on models assuming stationary bedforms or migrating beds future field measurements and modeling studies should take into account the effect of grain size on n2o release throughout the river continuum especially the reach with strong sediment transport the reactive tracers e g no3 and isotope technique e g 15n could be jointly used in order to better distinguish and measure incomplete 15n n2o and complete 15n n2 denitrification products in migrating bedforms credit authorship contribution statement qihao jiang conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis investigation data

3347,water quality is an important factor that affects aquaculture water quality parameters have the characteristics of a time series and display instability and nonlinearity and are coupled by complex relationships therefore accurate prediction of water quality parameters is challenging this paper constructs a water quality parameter prediction model combining the discrete hidden markov model dhmm and k means clustering methods the model was used to predict the dissolved oxygen saturation and turbidity of six marine ranches in the bohai rim based on the analysis of the correlations between the water quality parameters the hidden state of the dhmm that affects the target water quality parameters is determined and the adaptability of the model has been improved the number of hidden states is determined by k means clustering and a water quality parameter prediction model based on dhmm is established to realize the prediction of dissolved oxygen saturation and turbidity the model is of low complexity and has strong explanatory power experimental results show that compared with other water quality parameter prediction algorithms under the same conditions there are fewer training parameters proposed in the article in regard to the water quality parameter prediction method and better prediction performance is shown the results of this study can provide references for predicting water quality parameters of marine pastures and sustainable management of aquaculture ecosystems keywords hidden markov model dissolved oxygen saturation turbidity factor screening k means clustering 1 introduction water quality is one of the important factors affecting aquaculture usually physical parameters such as the saturation degree of dissolved oxygen and turbidity are used to estimate water quality rapid changes in these physical parameters will have adverse effects on hydrobionts tung and yaseen 2020 the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water is a limiting factor for the life phenomenon and life process of aquatic animals it can ensure the health and development of aquaculture fish and is one of the most important factors in aquaculture huang et al 2021 when the dissolved oxygen is low it is easy to cause hypoxia in fish which affects food intake and morbidity turbidity is an important non biological factor that creates conditions for the survival and growth of aquatic organisms it affects the ability of light to penetrate in water bodies which in turn affects photosynthesis and food webs lunt and smee 2020 accurate and reliable water quality parameter prediction models contribute to effective fishery management because the dissolved oxygen saturation has time series and is closely related to other water quality parameters such as water temperature and conductivity leading to its instability and nonlinear characteristics while the turbidity sequence has strong randomness weather environment and other factors as a result its value varies greatly so it is difficult to achieve accurate prediction of water quality parameters to achieve better water quality management requires an effective and robust method to accurately predict water quality parameters different water quality models have been developed in recent decades to improve the prediction accuracy of water quality parameters graf et al 2019 proposed a hybrid model that combines a discrete wavelet transform and artificial neural network to predict water temperature zhu et al 2020 developed two models for water temperature prediction in lake systems wen et al 2017 used a wavelet analysis artificial neural network to predict the monthly groundwater level ma et al 2021 used long and short term memory networks to predict real time water level depth liu et al 2016 proposed a new type of water temperature measurement based on empirical mode decomposition and a back propagation neural network temperature prediction model feigl et al 2021 used machine learning models to predict river water temperature gauch et al 2021 used a single long term short term memory network to forecast rainfall and runoff on multiple time scales noori et al 2020 developed a hybrid model that combines a watershed model and an artificial neural network to predict nitrate ammonium and phosphate loads zhou 2020 built up a frame to study the probability prediction of water quality under the condition of data missing cchen and chauhen and chau 2019 conducted an uncertainty analysis on the sediment load estimation model and for the first time applied the lower bound estimation lube method in the dual neural network model these neural network based methods have their own shortcomings such as obtaining a suitable network structure through experience and trial and error and obtaining the best combination of input variables in addition models based on the maximum likelihood method may not be able to capture the impact of drastic changes in the environment on water quality other models based on machine learning and heuristic algorithms such as guo et al 2020 developed a bayesian hierarchical statistical model to predict river water quality llu and mau and ma 2020 proposed two machine learning models based on hybrid decision trees to obtain more accurate short term water quality prediction results wang et al 2018 proposed a new dynamic firefly algorithm to predict water resources green et al 2021 used support vector machines and random forests to predict river solute concentrations willard et al 2021 used meta transfer learning to predict the water temperature of unmonitored lakes kargar et al 2020 used gaussian process regression gpr support vector regression svr the m5 model tree m5p and random forest rf to estimate the longitudinal dispersion coefficient ldc value in natural streams and rivers although this type of algorithm is easy to carry out it is usually supposed that the time series trend in the prediction relates to its nearest time series data only modeling based on the partial characteristics of the time series data cannot accurately reflect the internal generative mechanism of the time series and highly depends on the selection of parameters and requires a large amount of data to divide the training set and the test set if the data collected by drastic changes in the environment cannot be well trained then this results in a model with poor generalizability although traditional neural networks and other machine learning models have advantages and practicability because of the unstable and seasonal characteristics of water quality parameters water quality prediction is still limited by a large number of factors which makes their application in water quality parameter modeling difficult there are often limitations and the impact of other potential factors in the model on the target water quality parameters is not considered other factors in the water environment will affect the changes in water quality parameters therefore it is very important and meaningful to consider potential states and changes in the prediction of water quality parameters the hidden markov model hmm is a special case of the state space model which is a double random process of a hidden markov chain with a certain number of states and a set of displayed random functions the hmm can model hidden states based on ordered observational data and water quality prediction problems follow the same pattern changes in water quality parameters depend on many factors which are invisible to the observer hidden variables at the same time most traditional machine learning models need to divide the training set and the test set to adjust the performance of the model and prevent the model from overfitting the hmm parameters are obtained through the forward and backward algorithm the viterbi algorithm and the baum welch algorithm without manual intervention even if the training set and the test set are divided the results of the training set have no feedback effect on the parameters of the model and there is no need to divide the training set and the test set due to the advantages of hmm in describing state changes it has been widely used in speech recognition nagy and németh 2016 tabibian et al 2018 quan and ren 2016 bengio 2004 biomedical analysis kumar et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 yao et al 2020 ambrosini et al 2016

al 2020 belgacem et al 2017 among them in terms of hydrology bracken et al 2014 proposed a hidden markov model combined with a climate index for multi year runoff simulation liu et al 2018 proposed monthly runoff prediction based on hidden markov model and gaussian mixture regression kwon et al 2018 proposed a multivariate random soil moisture estimation method based on gaussian mixture non stationary hidden markov model when it comes to overcome the dependence of traditional prediction model parameters and solves the problems of high calculation cost and easy overfitting that often occur during neural network prediction based on the discrete hmm this paper uses the maximum information coefficient mic to determine the hidden state that affects dissolved oxygen saturation dos and turbidity td the number of hidden states is determined by k means clustering and the dos value and td value at the next moment is predicted by the dhmm combined with an effective sliding window thereby predicting the dos time series and the td time series the main contributions of this paper are 1 in this paper on the basis of discussing the correlation between water quality parameters an accurate prediction method of water quality parameters based on a dhmm is constructed by analyzing the influence of other water quality parameters on the target water quality parameters the primary factors affecting the target water quality parameters are determined converting the primary influencing factors into hidden states and integrating them into the dhmm to predict the target water quality parameters makes the dhmm more adaptable and more accurate 2 the conductivity change rate cr and dissolved oxygen saturation change rate dr temperature change rate tp and turbidity change rate tu are defined the k means clustering algorithm is used and the optimal number of clusters is obtained through mutual verification of the elbow method sum of squared errors sse and the contour coefficient method which provides a theoretical basis for the selection of the number of hidden states 3 in the prediction method this paper selects the model parameters based on the best prediction step size and uses the hidden state transition matrix and the observation state generation probability matrix to calculate the probability distribution of the observation value at the next moment so that the predicted value has more theoretical basis thereby avoiding the problem of a lack of theoretical support based only on the prediction method of finding the change trend in water quality parameters over the years the rest of this paper is organized as follows the second section introduces the markov stochastic process and how to build a hidden markov model the third section introduces the algorithm flow of predicting dos and td in detail and gives a comparison of the experimental results the fourth section summarizes the full text and the problems of the model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the bohai sea is located at the northern end of the eastern part of mainland china with a coastline of approximately 3 800 km because of its flat seabed and abundant bait it is a natural large scale marine aquaculture base therefore the prediction and research on the water quality parameters of the marine pastures in the bohai sea can provide important guidance for the sustainable development of aquaculture this paper respectively predicts the dissolved oxygen saturation and turbidity of the six marine ranches in the bohai rim shown in fig 1 2 2 hidden markov model hmm is an implicit double stochastic process that can treat nonlinear time varying systems and is used to describe a markov process with hidden unknown parameters 2 2 1 markov stochastic process a markov stochastic process is a random process with a markov property ye et al 2020 the typical characteristics are as follows under the premise that the current state is known the future state evolution does not depend on the evolution of its historical state that is given the current state of the markov stochastic process the historical state does not affect the future state assuming that i t t t is a random process and e is its state space if for any t 1 t 2 t n t any i 1 i 2 i n i e is a random process i t of known variables i t 1 i 1 i t n i n then the conditional distribution function below is only related to i t n i n but not is related to i t 1 i 1 i t n 1 x n 1 that is the conditional distribution function satisfies 1 f i t i n i n 1 i 2 i 1 t n t n 1 t 2 t 1 f i t i n t n which is 2 p i t i i t n i n i t 1 i 1 p i t i i t n i n this property is called the markov property if i t is a discrete random variable the markov property satisfies 3 p i t i i t n i n i t 1 i 1 p i t i i t n i n if the random process i t t t satisfies the markov property it is called a markov random process 2 2 2 hidden markov model a hmm is different from the markov stochastic process in that the state sequence of the hmm cannot be directly observed there is no one to one correspondence between the observed value of the hmm and the state but rather the states are related by statistical relationships through a set of probability distributions supposing q is the set of all possible hidden states and v is the set of all possible observed states namely q q 1 q 2 q n v v 1 v 2 v m here n is the number of possible hidden states and m is the number of possible observable states for a sequence of length t i corresponds to the state sequence and o corresponds to the observation sequence namely i i 1 i 2 i t o o 1 o 2 o t any hidden state i t q and any observation state o t v an hmm consists of a set of state transition probability matrices a a ij n n the initial probability of the state π π i n i 1 n π i 1 and the observed state generation probability matrix b b j k n n description as shown in fig 2 the hidden state is transferred to a state at the next moment according to the initial probability of the state the hidden state at time t t 1 is transferred to a state at a time according to the state transition probability matrix and the hidden state at time t t is generated according to the observed value of the observation value generation probability matrix at this moment a ij indicates that the hidden probability at time t is i t q i and the hidden state at time t 1 is the probability of i t 1 q j 4 a ij p i t 1 q j i t q i b j k represents the probability that the hidden state at time t is i t q j and the corresponding observation state at this time is o t v k 5 b j k p o t v k i t q j in the hmm model the transition between states has markov properties and the hidden state at any time depends only on the hidden state at the previous time the state is independent of the generation of observations and the observation state at any time depends only on the hidden state at the current time 2 3 discrete hidden markov model 2 3 1 observation sequence generation when the input sequence is a continuous sequence the probability b j k of the random observation value o t v k generated under a given hidden state i t q j should be expressed as a continuous probability density function most methods approximate this relationship with a normal distribution however due to the complexity of water bodies the normal distribution cannot accurately simulate the probability distribution of observations therefore this paper discretizes the data and the data collection method is once every hour 2 3 2 factor screening to determine the factors that can affect dos and td this paper will use chlorophyll content chl temperature temp wind speed ws oil content in water oil conductivity cond air pressure bp then these factors will be analyzed with dos and td using the maximum information coefficient mic for correlation analysis mic is an algorithm proposed by reshef et al 2011 that can examine the degree of correlation between two variables the main idea of this method is to use the principle of mutual information and the method of dividing the grid to obtain a scatter plot of two variables in a two dimensional plane divide a certain number of sub regions along the x and y directions and analyze the scattered points of the sub regions to replace the calculation of joint probability mic can capture more non linear relationships between two variables and has a wide range of versatility additionally using the method of dependency measurement and sorting according to the strength of the correlation between variables regardless of the type of correlation a higher robustness is obtained therefore this paper uses mic to obtain the primary factors affecting dos and td respectively for the data set d with 2 variables the mic is defined as 6 mic d max xy b n m d x y where n is the sample size and b n is the upper limit of the grid size of x y m d is the characteristic matrix of d that is defined by the following formula 7 m d x y i d x y log min x y i d x y represents the mutual information value under different grid divisions the mic value increases with stronger correlation between x and y if the two variables are independent of each other mic approaches 0 conversely with a stronger correlation between the two variables mic approaches 1 the prediction accuracy of the target water quality parameter may be affected by other water quality parameters in this paper the eight water quality parameters dos chl temp ws oil cond bp and td are analyzed for pairwise correlation fig 3 shows the correlation values between any two water quality parameters and the colors that they represent when the color is darker the correlation between the two corresponding water quality parameters is higher conversely when the color is lighter the correlation between the corresponding two water quality parameters is lower as shown in fig 3 dos and cond 0 7851 temp and td 0 9069 temp and cond 0 5471 td and cond 0 6149 all showed strong correlations mic 0 5 among these the water quality parameter with the highest correlation with dos td is cond temp because there is a relatively complex relationship among multiple water quality parameters it is necessary to consider whether the selected water quality parameters are correlated if the water quality parameters have a correlation or even a strong correlation it will easily affect the subsequent analysis and test and even cause large deviations in the test results to simplify the complexity of the model this paper only selects cond as the hidden state that affects dos and selects temp as the hidden state that affects td 2 3 3 determine the number of hidden states first to determine the number of hidden states this paper defines the conductivity change rate cr the dissolved oxygen saturation change rate dr the turbidity change rate tu and the temperature change rate tp as shown in the formula respectively representing the rates of changes in cond dos td temp at a given time 8 cr n cond n cond n 1 dond n 1 9 dr n dos n dos n 1 dos n 1 10 tu n tds n tds n 1 tds n 1 11 tp n temp n temp n 1 temp n 1 where cond 1 cond 2 cond n is the conductivity sequence dos 1 dos 2 dos n is the dissolved oxygen saturation sequence td 1 td 2 td n is the turbidity sequence and temp 1 temp 2 temp n is the temperature sequence second we use k means to cluster the cr dr sequence and tu tp sequences to determine the number of hidden states that affect dos and td finally the elbow method and contour coefficient silhouette score are used to evaluate the clustering results fig 4 shows a clustering effect diagram obtained by the elbow method and the contour coefficient method the clustering error sse is obtained by the elbow method and as the number of clusters k increases the degree of aggregation of each cluster gradually increases and sse gradually decreases when k reaches the true number of clusters 3 the aggregation obtained by k increases the improvement for each iteration of the algorithm will decrease rapidly so that the reduction in sse will sharply decrease the value of k will continue to increase and sse will level off for the cr dr sequence the average contour coefficient obtained by the contour coefficient method increases with the increase of the number of clusters k when the number of clusters is 3 the contour coefficient reaches the maximum value and the clustering effect is the best as the k value continues to increase the clustering effect becomes worse resulting in a rapid decline in the contour coefficient and tendency to saturate for the tu tp sequence the contour coefficient decreases with increasing number of clusters k when the number of clusters increases beyond 3 the contour coefficient decreases sharply and gradually saturates according to the results of the above two evaluation indicators the number of hidden states of dos and td is selected as 3 12 m cr dr 0 0005846 0 0030266 0 0000446 0 0002707 0 0008931 0 0043898 13 m tu tp 0 6877096 0 0382589 0 0108869 0 0012681 0 0638677 0 0072769 m is the cluster center and the change range is not very large so that the result is not very evident with the hidden state set q 0 1 2 for m cr dr each row represents the divided cluster center and the first row has a positive mean value the mean value of the second line is approximately zero the average value in the third line is negative that is dos and cond are positively correlated for m tu tp the two elements in each row represent the mean values of tp and tu respectively the mean value of the first row has a positive abscissa and a negative ordinate since the absolute value of the mean value in the second row is the smallest it is set to approximately zero the third row is opposite of the first row that is temp and td are negatively correlated fig 5 shows the clustering effect diagram of the cr dr sequence and the tu tp sequence the scattered points in the figure are well divided into three categories and each point has its own category which is the hidden state fig 5 also shows that there is a positive correlation between dos and cond and a negative correlation between temp and td according to the results of the above two evaluation indicators the number of clusters 3 is finally selected as the number of hidden states of dos and td 3 results and discussion 3 1 dhmm parameter training in this paper the discretized dos observation sequence o o 1 o 2 o n is used as the input of the dhmm to train the parameters of the model λ using the baum welch samanta et al 2018 algorithm solution since the initial values of the parameters of the baum welch algorithm are different and the different results will be obtained for different initial parmaeters 100 sets of different parameters are randomly initialized in the experiment the parameters of the model are estimated and the largest set of logp o λ is selected the parameters are used as the final initialization parameters fig 6 shows a flow chart of the entire algorithm that takes predictive dos as an example the input observation data include dos chl temp ws oil cond bp and td the forecasting process is as follows step 1 use the maximum information coefficient mic to determine the correlation between the target water quality parameter dos and the other water quality parameters and obtain the water quality parameter cond with the strongest correlation with the target water quality parameter step 2 formulas 8 and 9 are used to transform the dos sequence dos 1 dos 2 dos n and the cond sequence cond 1 cond 2 cond n to obtain the cr 1 dr 1 cr 2 dr 2 cr n dr n sequence step 3 use the k means algorithm to cluster the obtained cr dr sequences step 4 the optimal number of clusters obtained by the k means clustering algorithm is used as the dhmm hidden state number step 5 the target water quality parameter dos is divided into n k 1 groups of observation value sequences of equal length by using the optimal prediction step size grouping method and each group of observation value sequences is affected by the hidden state step 6 use the dhmm algorithm to obtain the parameter λ that satisfies where o is the observation sequence and λ is the dhmm parameter for each group of observation sequences step 7 the parameters obtained by training are used to calculate the probability distribution of the observation value at the next moment and then the observation value at the next moment is predicted 3 2 dissolved oxygen saturation prediction after obtaining the trained model we predict dos and td based on prediction method and prediction step size 3 2 1 choice of the forecasting method the state transition probability matrix a and the observation value generation probability matrix b of the model are used to calculate the probability distribution of the observed values in the future 1 through the observation sequence o o 1 o 2 o n use eq 14 to find the hidden state distribution probability at the last moment 14 p i n o p i n o p o p i n o i n p i n o i n q 2 use eq 15 to calculate the distribution probability of the hidden

to obtain the probability distribution of each discrete value p o n 1 o i n 1 p o n 1 i n 1 o i n 1 p o n 1 i n 1 o p i n 1 o 16 i n 1 p o n 1 i n 1 p i n 1 o here p o t 1 i t 1 generates a probability matrix b corresponding to the observed value by observing the hidden state sequence and the state transition matrix a it is found that there is a certain inertia in the state transition the same state is maintained for a long time and the probability of the current state transitioning to itself will be greater than the probability of transitioning to other states the above method transfers the hidden state i n q i at the current moment to the hidden state i n 1 q j as the weight to calculate the probability distribution of each discrete value this method can prevent the neglect of the current state and transfer to other states finally the product of each discrete value and its corresponding probability p i is accumulated to obtain the predicted dos at the next moment

as the prediction step size increases the values of mae mse rmse and mape continue to decrease and the goodness of fitting coefficient r 2 gradually improves when the number of steps is 8 the error is the smallest and the fit is the best with the increase in the number of steps the values of mae mse rmse mape gradually increase and the goodness of fitting coefficient r 2 gradually becomes worse therefore we choose 8 as the prediction step size of the dos prediction model similarly we choose 9 as the prediction step size of the td prediction model 3 3 results and discussion 3 3 1 analysis of the effectiveness of clustering method this paper compares the water quality parameter prediction model obtained by clustering the number of hidden states with the water quality parameter prediction model obtained without the clustering step to avoid the number of hidden states generated by the clustering algorithm from causing accidental prediction results this paper randomly selects the number of hidden states 1 10 for one hundred experiments and compares the average of the experimental results with the experimental results from using the clustering algorithm as shown in fig 7 the dhmm that does and does not use the k means clustering algorithm are compared and analyzed experimentally the experimental results show that the prediction results of the dhmm without the clustering algorithm have a strong lag accordingly its prediction accuracy is low in contrast the prediction accuracy of the dhmm that uses the k means clustering algorithm is higher and the values of mse rmse and r 2 are all lower than those of the non clustering model when the number of hidden states is set too small it does not reflect the changing law of the data which makes the dhmm prediction accuracy worse when the number of hidden states is set too large the dimension of the parameters increases making the dhmm model sensitive to the choice of initial parameters and the model is more likely to fall into local optimal solution therefore this paper uses the k means clustering method to effectively improve the prediction accuracy of the dhmm 3 3 2 forecast result analysis this paper takes the water quality and meteorological monitoring data of the marine ranches in the bohai rim region as the research object the collection time was 29 days from december 10 2019 to january 7 2020 the data were collected every hour including the eight water quality parameters of dos chl temp ws oil cond bp and td for a total of 584 data points for each water quality parameter since the results of the training set have no feedback effect on the test set this paper does not divide the training set and the test set this paper uses linear interpolation and the principle of 3 σ for data preprocessing we use python3 8 language to compile a simulation program for water quality parameter prediction based on dhmm according to the discrete hmm algorithm the discrete hmm forecast model with the optimal number of steps is established and compared with support vector machine svm differential integrated moving average autoregression model arima long and short term memory neural network lstm radial basis function neural network rbfnn and convolutional neural network cnn in order to fairly compare the model proposed in this article with other comparative models conductivity or temperature is added as a predictor variable through training the above comparison model and by using predictive evaluation indicators for evaluation and comparison including mae mse rmse mape and r 2 the results are shown in table 2 for dos under the same conditions compared with svm the values of mae mse rmse mape and 1 96 s e of the proposed model are reduced by 52 6 74 2 47 7 52 4 and 47 7 respectively compared with arima the values of the corresponding evaluation indices of the proposed model are reduced by 42 8 69 2 42 4 42 7 and 42 4 compared with lstm they are reduced by 63 5 83 6 58 4 63 3 and 48 5 compared with rbfnn the corresponding evaluation indices are reduced by 31 3 61 9 36 7 31 3 and 36 8 compared with cnn they are reduced by 62 1 81 3 55 6 62 1 and 51 1 for td compared with svm they are reduced by 52 7 40 9 23 6 52 and 21 1 compared with arima they are reduced by 68 1 90 7 69 8 67 6 and 69 8 compared with lstm they are reduced by 79 1 92 9 73 7 78 7 and 73 6 compared with rbfnn they are reduced by 4 14 2 8 1 1 9 and 8 1 compared with cnn they are reduced by 50 49 2 28 9 48 8 and 28 8 in table 2 the r 2 of dos and td predicted by dhmm is the closest to 1 indicating that the model has good precision in dos and td prediction mae mape 1 96 s e and r 2 focus on evaluating the prediction effect as a whole mae 1 96 s e and mape have a negative correlation with the prediction effect and r 2 has a positive correlation with the prediction effect the prediction effect on dos and td is better for the dhmm proposed in this paper than for the other comparison models in mae mape 1 96 s e and r 2 because the output of the dhmm proposed in this paper is the probability distribution of the observations and the prediction results will not have large deviations svm is very sensitive to the selection of parameters and the difference in parameter selection can easily lead to svm overfitting or underfitting which affects the prediction precision and generalization ability of svm arima can capture only linear relationships the drastic changes in the environment make water quality parameters nonlinear and unstable and there are complex coupling relationships among water quality parameters making it difficult to precisely predict water quality parameters for arima lstm rbfnn and cnn methods are all neural networks similar to any other network the demand for data is very large and the effect may not be obvious the mse and rmse evaluation indicators focus on the prediction results of abnormal points which are negatively correlated with the prediction results the prediction results for dos and td are superior for the dhmm proposed in this paper than for the other comparative models in terms of mse and rmse for svm the prediction effect is relatively poor because it is restricted by the selection of the kernel function and deviations will inevitably occur when processing dimension upgrades of the abnormal data arima requires differential processing of data and the process of restoring after differential prediction will certainly cause deviations especially for abnormal data and the deviations will inevitably be amplified in the situation of a relatively small amount of data rbfnn cannot predict normally and all of its internal inference processes are numerical calculations which will inevitably lose some information making the prediction effects unsatisfactory cnn itself is not an efficient algorithm the pooling layer will cause part of the information to be missing making the prediction results of cnn unable to reflect the fluctuation situation of the data fig 8 shows the comparison between the predicted values of the seven day dhmm and the five comparative models with the observed values of dissolved oxygen saturation it can be seen from the picture that the fitting effect of the observed value and the predicted value is better for the dhmm proposed in this paper than for the svm arima lstm cnn and rbfnn prediction models at the same time it can be seen on the left that the prediction results of the svm cnn and arima models have larger deviations than those of the dhmm cnn does not predict the fluctuating state of data well the prediction results of the lstm prediction model gradually deteriorate over time on the right svm and arima predict lower dissolved oxygen saturation than the higher predicted dissolved oxygen saturation rbfnn is more effective when predicting lower dissolved oxygen saturation and when the observed value fluctuates greatly the prediction result will have a larger deviation fig 9 shows the comparison between the predicted values of the seven day dhmm and the five comparison models with the observed values of turbidity it can be seen from the figure that the dhmm proposed in this paper has a better predictive effect overall and can predict the turbidity sequence better in the time period when the observed value fluctuates greatly among the other models the prediction models of lstm arima and rbfnn have large deviations in the prediction of outliers the svm arima and lstm prediction models have poor prediction performance during periods of continuous fluctuations in the observation sequence the overall prediction effect of rbfnn is good but the prediction performance becomes worse when the observed value changes suddenly when the data have large fluctuations the observation value and prediction value of cnn have a large deviation which is similar to the prediction of dos and cannot reflect the fluctuation status of the observation value accordingly the dhmm proposed in this paper can better predict the observation sequence of different changing trends and its prediction performance is better than that of the other comparison models 3 3 3 forecast validity analysis we respectively predict the dos and td of six marine ranches in the bohai rim in order to verify the stability and generalization ability of dhmm as shown in fig 10 the predicted value sequence of dhmm can fit the observed values of dos and td well and shows good predictive performance for different data sets fig 11 shows a taylor diagram barzegar et al 2020 of the prediction model performance for the haikuan marine ranch the scattered points in the figure represent the model the radial line represents the correlation coefficient the horizontal and vertical axis represents the standard deviation and the semicircular dashed line represents the root mean square error for the prediction of dos the correlation coefficient of the discrete hmm proposed in this paper is 0 9782 the standard deviation is 0 1619 the root mean square error is 0 0357 and the prediction result is the best the rbf prediction model with a correlation coefficient of 0 9378 a standard deviation of 0 1823 and a root mean square error of 0 0631 shows the worst performance for the other prediction models the correlation coefficient of svm is 0 9587 the standard deviation is 0 1415 and the root mean square error is 0 0537 for arima the correlation coefficient is 0 9719 the standard deviation is 0 1702 and the root mean square error is 0 0404 for lstm the correlation coefficient is 0 9717 the standard deviation is 0 1385 and the root mean square error is 0 0514 similar to the dos prediction effect the correlation coefficient of the td prediction model based on dhmm is 0 9597 the standard deviation is 0 3201 and the root mean square error is 0 0933 dhmm is the best model for predicting td the rbf model with a correlation coefficient of 0 9064 standard deviation of 0 3413 and root mean square error of 0 1458 shows the worst predictive performance among all of the models in summary the dhmm model proposed in this paper show the best performance for predicting dos and td 4 conclusions to solve the problem of too many factors affecting water quality and low prediction accuracy this paper proposes a water quality prediction method based on discrete hmm to predict the dos and td of the water bodies of a marine ranch in the bohai sea we use easy to measure water quality parameters namely chl bp ws cond temp oil dos and td we analyze the correlation between the water quality parameters by mining hidden relationships among the data and avoid prediction errors caused by the complex correlation between water quality parameters when training the model parameters the water quality parameter change rate is defined and the clustering algorithm is used to determine the number of hidden states of the dhmm using the state transition probability matrix and the observation value generation probability matrix the probability distribution of the predicted value at the next moment is calculated to obtain the prediction result compared with time series forecasting algorithms such as svm arima and lstm this model eliminates the interference of redundant data and has strong interpretability it is more robust in data processing and prediction and there is no need to divide the training set and the test set which avoids the problems of overfitting and underfitting moreover it can learn the essential characteristics of the data more comprehensively and can meet the requirements for the accurate prediction of dos and td the model is also suitable for the prediction of other water quality parameters without the manual adjustment of parameters has strong generalizability and can provide a scientific and effective model reference for aquaculture decision making systems however the method used in this paper still has some shortcomings for example the initialization parameters are randomly generated so that it cannot be guaranteed that the internal parameters of the model are optimal because the training parameters of the baum welch algorithm can easily fall into local optimal values second when using discrete hidden markov model to make predictions correlation analysis must be performed to determine the number of hidden states and the preparatory work before model construction is cumbersome responding to the above issues our future research will focus on the following aspects 1 explore a new method to solve the problem of easily falling into partial optimal solutions during the hmm parameter training process without being sensitive to the initial value setting 2 in regard to determining the hidden status of the hmm design or find other algorithms to determine the best hmm structure for given datasets 5 credit authorship contribution statement dashe li supervision conceptualization funding acquisition yuanwei sun

3347,water quality is an important factor that affects aquaculture water quality parameters have the characteristics of a time series and display instability and nonlinearity and are coupled by complex relationships therefore accurate prediction of water quality parameters is challenging this paper constructs a water quality parameter prediction model combining the discrete hidden markov model dhmm and k means clustering methods the model was used to predict the dissolved oxygen saturation and turbidity of six marine ranches in the bohai rim based on the analysis of the correlations between the water quality parameters the hidden state of the dhmm that affects the target water quality parameters is determined and the adaptability of the model has been improved the number of hidden states is determined by k means clustering and a water quality parameter prediction model based on dhmm is established to realize the prediction of dissolved oxygen saturation and turbidity the model is of low complexity and has strong explanatory power experimental results show that compared with other water quality parameter prediction algorithms under the same conditions there are fewer training parameters proposed in the article in regard to the water quality parameter prediction method and better prediction performance is shown the results of this study can provide references for predicting water quality parameters of marine pastures and sustainable management of aquaculture ecosystems keywords hidden markov model dissolved oxygen saturation turbidity factor screening k means clustering 1 introduction water quality is one of the important factors affecting aquaculture usually physical parameters such as the saturation degree of dissolved oxygen and turbidity are used to estimate water quality rapid changes in these physical parameters will have adverse effects on hydrobionts tung and yaseen 2020 the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water is a limiting factor for the life phenomenon and life process of aquatic animals it can ensure the health and development of aquaculture fish and is one of the most important factors in aquaculture huang et al 2021 when the dissolved oxygen is low it is easy to cause hypoxia in fish which affects food intake and morbidity turbidity is an important non biological factor that creates conditions for the survival and growth of aquatic organisms it affects the ability of light to penetrate in water bodies which in turn affects photosynthesis and food webs lunt and smee 2020 accurate and reliable water quality parameter prediction models contribute to effective fishery management because the dissolved oxygen saturation has time series and is closely related to other water quality parameters such as water temperature and conductivity leading to its instability and nonlinear characteristics while the turbidity sequence has strong randomness weather environment and other factors as a result its value varies greatly so it is difficult to achieve accurate prediction of water quality parameters to achieve better water quality management requires an effective and robust method to accurately predict water quality parameters different water quality models have been developed in recent decades to improve the prediction accuracy of water quality parameters graf et al 2019 proposed a hybrid model that combines a discrete wavelet transform and artificial neural network to predict water temperature zhu et al 2020 developed two models for water temperature prediction in lake systems wen et al 2017 used a wavelet analysis artificial neural network to predict the monthly groundwater level ma et al 2021 used long and short term memory networks to predict real time water level depth liu et al 2016 proposed a new type of water temperature measurement based on empirical mode decomposition and a back propagation neural network temperature prediction model feigl et al 2021 used machine learning models to predict river water temperature gauch et al 2021 used a single long term short term memory network to forecast rainfall and runoff on multiple time scales noori et al 2020 developed a hybrid model that combines a watershed model and an artificial neural network to predict nitrate ammonium and phosphate loads zhou 2020 built up a frame to study the probability prediction of water quality under the condition of data missing cchen and chauhen and chau 2019 conducted an uncertainty analysis on the sediment load estimation model and for the first time applied the lower bound estimation lube method in the dual neural network model these neural network based methods have their own shortcomings such as obtaining a suitable network structure through experience and trial and error and obtaining the best combination of input variables in addition models based on the maximum likelihood method may not be able to capture the impact of drastic changes in the environment on water quality other models based on machine learning and heuristic algorithms such as guo et al 2020 developed a bayesian hierarchical statistical model to predict river water quality llu and mau and ma 2020 proposed two machine learning models based on hybrid decision trees to obtain more accurate short term water quality prediction results wang et al 2018 proposed a new dynamic firefly algorithm to predict water resources green et al 2021 used support vector machines and random forests to predict river solute concentrations willard et al 2021 used meta transfer learning to predict the water temperature of unmonitored lakes kargar et al 2020 used gaussian process regression gpr support vector regression svr the m5 model tree m5p and random forest rf to estimate the longitudinal dispersion coefficient ldc value in natural streams and rivers although this type of algorithm is easy to carry out it is usually supposed that the time series trend in the prediction relates to its nearest time series data only modeling based on the partial characteristics of the time series data cannot accurately reflect the internal generative mechanism of the time series and highly depends on the selection of parameters and requires a large amount of data to divide the training set and the test set if the data collected by drastic changes in the environment cannot be well trained then this results in a model with poor generalizability although traditional neural networks and other machine learning models have advantages and practicability because of the unstable and seasonal characteristics of water quality parameters water quality prediction is still limited by a large number of factors which makes their application in water quality parameter modeling difficult there are often limitations and the impact of other potential factors in the model on the target water quality parameters is not considered other factors in the water environment will affect the changes in water quality parameters therefore it is very important and meaningful to consider potential states and changes in the prediction of water quality parameters the hidden markov model hmm is a special case of the state space model which is a double random process of a hidden markov chain with a certain number of states and a set of displayed random functions the hmm can model hidden states based on ordered observational data and water quality prediction problems follow the same pattern changes in water quality parameters depend on many factors which are invisible to the observer hidden variables at the same time most traditional machine learning models need to divide the training set and the test set to adjust the performance of the model and prevent the model from overfitting the hmm parameters are obtained through the forward and backward algorithm the viterbi algorithm and the baum welch algorithm without manual intervention even if the training set and the test set are divided the results of the training set have no feedback effect on the parameters of the model and there is no need to divide the training set and the test set due to the advantages of hmm in describing state changes it has been widely used in speech recognition nagy and németh 2016 tabibian et al 2018 quan and ren 2016 bengio 2004 biomedical analysis kumar et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 yao et al 2020 ambrosini et al 2016

al 2020 belgacem et al 2017 among them in terms of hydrology bracken et al 2014 proposed a hidden markov model combined with a climate index for multi year runoff simulation liu et al 2018 proposed monthly runoff prediction based on hidden markov model and gaussian mixture regression kwon et al 2018 proposed a multivariate random soil moisture estimation method based on gaussian mixture non stationary hidden markov model when it comes to overcome the dependence of traditional prediction model parameters and solves the problems of high calculation cost and easy overfitting that often occur during neural network prediction based on the discrete hmm this paper uses the maximum information coefficient mic to determine the hidden state that affects dissolved oxygen saturation dos and turbidity td the number of hidden states is determined by k means clustering and the dos value and td value at the next moment is predicted by the dhmm combined with an effective sliding window thereby predicting the dos time series and the td time series the main contributions of this paper are 1 in this paper on the basis of discussing the correlation between water quality parameters an accurate prediction method of water quality parameters based on a dhmm is constructed by analyzing the influence of other water quality parameters on the target water quality parameters the primary factors affecting the target water quality parameters are determined converting the primary influencing factors into hidden states and integrating them into the dhmm to predict the target water quality parameters makes the dhmm more adaptable and more accurate 2 the conductivity change rate cr and dissolved oxygen saturation change rate dr temperature change rate tp and turbidity change rate tu are defined the k means clustering algorithm is used and the optimal number of clusters is obtained through mutual verification of the elbow method sum of squared errors sse and the contour coefficient method which provides a theoretical basis for the selection of the number of hidden states 3 in the prediction method this paper selects the model parameters based on the best prediction step size and uses the hidden state transition matrix and the observation state generation probability matrix to calculate the probability distribution of the observation value at the next moment so that the predicted value has more theoretical basis thereby avoiding the problem of a lack of theoretical support based only on the prediction method of finding the change trend in water quality parameters over the years the rest of this paper is organized as follows the second section introduces the markov stochastic process and how to build a hidden markov model the third section introduces the algorithm flow of predicting dos and td in detail and gives a comparison of the experimental results the fourth section summarizes the full text and the problems of the model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the bohai sea is located at the northern end of the eastern part of mainland china with a coastline of approximately 3 800 km because of its flat seabed and abundant bait it is a natural large scale marine aquaculture base therefore the prediction and research on the water quality parameters of the marine pastures in the bohai sea can provide important guidance for the sustainable development of aquaculture this paper respectively predicts the dissolved oxygen saturation and turbidity of the six marine ranches in the bohai rim shown in fig 1 2 2 hidden markov model hmm is an implicit double stochastic process that can treat nonlinear time varying systems and is used to describe a markov process with hidden unknown parameters 2 2 1 markov stochastic process a markov stochastic process is a random process with a markov property ye et al 2020 the typical characteristics are as follows under the premise that the current state is known the future state evolution does not depend on the evolution of its historical state that is given the current state of the markov stochastic process the historical state does not affect the future state assuming that i t t t is a random process and e is its state space if for any t 1 t 2 t n t any i 1 i 2 i n i e is a random process i t of known variables i t 1 i 1 i t n i n then the conditional distribution function below is only related to i t n i n but not is related to i t 1 i 1 i t n 1 x n 1 that is the conditional distribution function satisfies 1 f i t i n i n 1 i 2 i 1 t n t n 1 t 2 t 1 f i t i n t n which is 2 p i t i i t n i n i t 1 i 1 p i t i i t n i n this property is called the markov property if i t is a discrete random variable the markov property satisfies 3 p i t i i t n i n i t 1 i 1 p i t i i t n i n if the random process i t t t satisfies the markov property it is called a markov random process 2 2 2 hidden markov model a hmm is different from the markov stochastic process in that the state sequence of the hmm cannot be directly observed there is no one to one correspondence between the observed value of the hmm and the state but rather the states are related by statistical relationships through a set of probability distributions supposing q is the set of all possible hidden states and v is the set of all possible observed states namely q q 1 q 2 q n v v 1 v 2 v m here n is the number of possible hidden states and m is the number of possible observable states for a sequence of length t i corresponds to the state sequence and o corresponds to the observation sequence namely i i 1 i 2 i t o o 1 o 2 o t any hidden state i t q and any observation state o t v an hmm consists of a set of state transition probability matrices a a ij n n the initial probability of the state π π i n i 1 n π i 1 and the observed state generation probability matrix b b j k n n description as shown in fig 2 the hidden state is transferred to a state at the next moment according to the initial probability of the state the hidden state at time t t 1 is transferred to a state at a time according to the state transition probability matrix and the hidden state at time t t is generated according to the observed value of the observation value generation probability matrix at this moment a ij indicates that the hidden probability at time t is i t q i and the hidden state at time t 1 is the probability of i t 1 q j 4 a ij p i t 1 q j i t q i b j k represents the probability that the hidden state at time t is i t q j and the corresponding observation state at this time is o t v k 5 b j k p o t v k i t q j in the hmm model the transition between states has markov properties and the hidden state at any time depends only on the hidden state at the previous time the state is independent of the generation of observations and the observation state at any time depends only on the hidden state at the current time 2 3 discrete hidden markov model 2 3 1 observation sequence generation when the input sequence is a continuous sequence the probability b j k of the random observation value o t v k generated under a given hidden state i t q j should be expressed as a continuous probability density function most methods approximate this relationship with a normal distribution however due to the complexity of water bodies the normal distribution cannot accurately simulate the probability distribution of observations therefore this paper discretizes the data and the data collection method is once every hour 2 3 2 factor screening to determine the factors that can affect dos and td this paper will use chlorophyll content chl temperature temp wind speed ws oil content in water oil conductivity cond air pressure bp then these factors will be analyzed with dos and td using the maximum information coefficient mic for correlation analysis mic is an algorithm proposed by reshef et al 2011 that can examine the degree of correlation between two variables the main idea of this method is to use the principle of mutual information and the method of dividing the grid to obtain a scatter plot of two variables in a two dimensional plane divide a certain number of sub regions along the x and y directions and analyze the scattered points of the sub regions to replace the calculation of joint probability mic can capture more non linear relationships between two variables and has a wide range of versatility additionally using the method of dependency measurement and sorting according to the strength of the correlation between variables regardless of the type of correlation a higher robustness is obtained therefore this paper uses mic to obtain the primary factors affecting dos and td respectively for the data set d with 2 variables the mic is defined as 6 mic d max xy b n m d x y where n is the sample size and b n is the upper limit of the grid size of x y m d is the characteristic matrix of d that is defined by the following formula 7 m d x y i d x y log min x y i d x y represents the mutual information value under different grid divisions the mic value increases with stronger correlation between x and y if the two variables are independent of each other mic approaches 0 conversely with a stronger correlation between the two variables mic approaches 1 the prediction accuracy of the target water quality parameter may be affected by other water quality parameters in this paper the eight water quality parameters dos chl temp ws oil cond bp and td are analyzed for pairwise correlation fig 3 shows the correlation values between any two water quality parameters and the colors that they represent when the color is darker the correlation between the two corresponding water quality parameters is higher conversely when the color is lighter the correlation between the corresponding two water quality parameters is lower as shown in fig 3 dos and cond 0 7851 temp and td 0 9069 temp and cond 0 5471 td and cond 0 6149 all showed strong correlations mic 0 5 among these the water quality parameter with the highest correlation with dos td is cond temp because there is a relatively complex relationship among multiple water quality parameters it is necessary to consider whether the selected water quality parameters are correlated if the water quality parameters have a correlation or even a strong correlation it will easily affect the subsequent analysis and test and even cause large deviations in the test results to simplify the complexity of the model this paper only selects cond as the hidden state that affects dos and selects temp as the hidden state that affects td 2 3 3 determine the number of hidden states first to determine the number of hidden states this paper defines the conductivity change rate cr the dissolved oxygen saturation change rate dr the turbidity change rate tu and the temperature change rate tp as shown in the formula respectively representing the rates of changes in cond dos td temp at a given time 8 cr n cond n cond n 1 dond n 1 9 dr n dos n dos n 1 dos n 1 10 tu n tds n tds n 1 tds n 1 11 tp n temp n temp n 1 temp n 1 where cond 1 cond 2 cond n is the conductivity sequence dos 1 dos 2 dos n is the dissolved oxygen saturation sequence td 1 td 2 td n is the turbidity sequence and temp 1 temp 2 temp n is the temperature sequence second we use k means to cluster the cr dr sequence and tu tp sequences to determine the number of hidden states that affect dos and td finally the elbow method and contour coefficient silhouette score are used to evaluate the clustering results fig 4 shows a clustering effect diagram obtained by the elbow method and the contour coefficient method the clustering error sse is obtained by the elbow method and as the number of clusters k increases the degree of aggregation of each cluster gradually increases and sse gradually decreases when k reaches the true number of clusters 3 the aggregation obtained by k increases the improvement for each iteration of the algorithm will decrease rapidly so that the reduction in sse will sharply decrease the value of k will continue to increase and sse will level off for the cr dr sequence the average contour coefficient obtained by the contour coefficient method increases with the increase of the number of clusters k when the number of clusters is 3 the contour coefficient reaches the maximum value and the clustering effect is the best as the k value continues to increase the clustering effect becomes worse resulting in a rapid decline in the contour coefficient and tendency to saturate for the tu tp sequence the contour coefficient decreases with increasing number of clusters k when the number of clusters increases beyond 3 the contour coefficient decreases sharply and gradually saturates according to the results of the above two evaluation indicators the number of hidden states of dos and td is selected as 3 12 m cr dr 0 0005846 0 0030266 0 0000446 0 0002707 0 0008931 0 0043898 13 m tu tp 0 6877096 0 0382589 0 0108869 0 0012681 0 0638677 0 0072769 m is the cluster center and the change range is not very large so that the result is not very evident with the hidden state set q 0 1 2 for m cr dr each row represents the divided cluster center and the first row has a positive mean value the mean value of the second line is approximately zero the average value in the third line is negative that is dos and cond are positively correlated for m tu tp the two elements in each row represent the mean values of tp and tu respectively the mean value of the first row has a positive abscissa and a negative ordinate since the absolute value of the mean value in the second row is the smallest it is set to approximately zero the third row is opposite of the first row that is temp and td are negatively correlated fig 5 shows the clustering effect diagram of the cr dr sequence and the tu tp sequence the scattered points in the figure are well divided into three categories and each point has its own category which is the hidden state fig 5 also shows that there is a positive correlation between dos and cond and a negative correlation between temp and td according to the results of the above two evaluation indicators the number of clusters 3 is finally selected as the number of hidden states of dos and td 3 results and discussion 3 1 dhmm parameter training in this paper the discretized dos observation sequence o o 1 o 2 o n is used as the input of the dhmm to train the parameters of the model λ using the baum welch samanta et al 2018 algorithm solution since the initial values of the parameters of the baum welch algorithm are different and the different results will be obtained for different initial parmaeters 100 sets of different parameters are randomly initialized in the experiment the parameters of the model are estimated and the largest set of logp o λ is selected the parameters are used as the final initialization parameters fig 6 shows a flow chart of the entire algorithm that takes predictive dos as an example the input observation data include dos chl temp ws oil cond bp and td the forecasting process is as follows step 1 use the maximum information coefficient mic to determine the correlation between the target water quality parameter dos and the other water quality parameters and obtain the water quality parameter cond with the strongest correlation with the target water quality parameter step 2 formulas 8 and 9 are used to transform the dos sequence dos 1 dos 2 dos n and the cond sequence cond 1 cond 2 cond n to obtain the cr 1 dr 1 cr 2 dr 2 cr n dr n sequence step 3 use the k means algorithm to cluster the obtained cr dr sequences step 4 the optimal number of clusters obtained by the k means clustering algorithm is used as the dhmm hidden state number step 5 the target water quality parameter dos is divided into n k 1 groups of observation value sequences of equal length by using the optimal prediction step size grouping method and each group of observation value sequences is affected by the hidden state step 6 use the dhmm algorithm to obtain the parameter λ that satisfies where o is the observation sequence and λ is the dhmm parameter for each group of observation sequences step 7 the parameters obtained by training are used to calculate the probability distribution of the observation value at the next moment and then the observation value at the next moment is predicted 3 2 dissolved oxygen saturation prediction after obtaining the trained model we predict dos and td based on prediction method and prediction step size 3 2 1 choice of the forecasting method the state transition probability matrix a and the observation value generation probability matrix b of the model are used to calculate the probability distribution of the observed values in the future 1 through the observation sequence o o 1 o 2 o n use eq 14 to find the hidden state distribution probability at the last moment 14 p i n o p i n o p o p i n o i n p i n o i n q 2 use eq 15 to calculate the distribution probability of the hidden state i n 1 at the next moment through the hidden state i n at the last moment and the state transition probability matrix p i n 1 o i n p i n 1 i n o i n p i n 1 i n o p i n o 15 i n p i n 1 i n p i n o here p i n 1 i n corresponds to the state transition probability matrix a 3 combine the observation values corresponding to the hidden state i n 1 to generate a probability matrix b and use eq 16 to obtain the probability distribution of each discrete value p o n 1 o i n 1 p o n 1 i n 1 o i n 1 p o n 1 i n 1 o p i n 1 o 16 i n 1 p o n 1 i n 1 p i n 1 o here p o t 1 i t 1 generates a probability matrix b corresponding to the observed value by observing the hidden state sequence and the state transition matrix a it is found that there is a certain inertia in the state transition the same state is maintained for a long time and the probability of the current state transitioning to itself will be greater than the probability of transitioning to other states the above method transfers the hidden state i n q i at the current moment to the hidden state i n 1 q j as the weight to calculate the probability distribution of each discrete value this method can prevent the neglect of the current state and transfer to other states finally the product of each discrete value and its corresponding probability p i is accumulated to obtain the predicted dos at the next moment 17 o n 1 i 1 n o i p i 3 2 2 selection of the number of prediction steps to study the impact of the number of predictions on the model performance this paper tests different numbers of prediction steps the mean absolute error mae wang et al 2021 mean squared error mse cortés ibáñez et al 2020 root mean square error rmse kumar et al 2018 mean absolute percentage error mape vakili et al 2021 width of uncertainty band 1 96 s e shamshirband et al 2019 alizadeh et al 2018 and fitting coefficient r 2 nattino et al 2020 are calculated as follows 18 mae 1 n i 1 n o i o i 19 mse 1 n i 1 n o i o

time i and o i is the mean observed value e i o i o i e 1 n i 1 n e i represent the prediction error and mean error respectively table 1 shows the prediction error of the asynchronous length for dos as the prediction step size increases the values of mae mse rmse and mape continue to decrease and the goodness of fitting coefficient r 2 gradually improves when the number of steps is 8 the error is the smallest and the fit is the best with the increase in the number of steps the values of mae mse rmse mape gradually increase and the goodness of fitting coefficient r 2 gradually becomes worse therefore we choose 8 as the prediction step size of the dos prediction model similarly we choose 9 as the prediction step size of the td prediction model 3 3 results and discussion 3 3 1 analysis of the effectiveness of clustering method this paper compares the water quality parameter prediction model obtained by clustering the number of hidden states with the water quality parameter prediction model obtained without the clustering step to avoid the number of hidden states generated by the clustering algorithm from causing accidental prediction results this paper randomly selects the number of hidden states 1 10 for one hundred experiments and compares the average of the experimental results with the experimental results from using the clustering algorithm as shown in fig 7 the dhmm that does and does not use the k means clustering algorithm are compared and analyzed experimentally the experimental results show that the prediction results of the dhmm without the clustering algorithm have a strong lag accordingly its prediction accuracy is low in contrast the prediction accuracy of the dhmm that uses the k means clustering algorithm is higher and the values of mse rmse and r 2 are all lower than those of the non clustering model when the number of hidden states is set too small it does not reflect the changing law of the data which makes the dhmm prediction accuracy worse when the number of hidden states is set too large the dimension of the parameters increases making the dhmm model sensitive to the choice of initial parameters and the model is more likely to fall into local optimal solution therefore this paper uses the k means clustering method to effectively improve the prediction accuracy of the dhmm 3 3 2 forecast result analysis this paper takes the water quality and meteorological monitoring data of the marine ranches in the bohai rim region as the research object the collection time was 29 days from december 10 2019 to january 7 2020 the data were collected every hour including the eight water quality parameters of dos chl temp ws oil cond bp and td for a total of 584 data points for each water quality parameter since the results of the training set have no feedback effect on the test set this paper does not divide the training set and the test set this paper uses linear interpolation and the principle of 3 σ for data preprocessing we use python3 8 language to compile a simulation program for water quality parameter prediction based on dhmm according to the discrete hmm algorithm the discrete hmm forecast model with the optimal number of steps is established and compared with support vector machine svm differential integrated moving average autoregression model arima long and short term memory neural network lstm radial basis function neural network rbfnn and convolutional neural network cnn in order to fairly compare the model proposed in this article with other comparative models conductivity or temperature is added as a predictor variable through training the above comparison model and by using predictive evaluation indicators for evaluation and comparison including mae mse rmse mape and r 2 the results are shown in table 2 for dos under the same conditions compared with svm the values of mae mse rmse mape and 1 96 s e of the proposed model are reduced by 52 6 74 2 47 7 52 4 and 47 7 respectively compared with arima the values of the corresponding evaluation indices of the proposed model are reduced by 42 8 69 2 42 4 42 7 and 42 4 compared with lstm they are reduced by 63 5 83 6 58 4 63 3 and 48 5 compared with rbfnn the corresponding evaluation indices are reduced by 31 3 61 9 36 7 31 3 and 36 8 compared with cnn they are reduced by 62 1 81 3 55 6 62 1 and 51 1 for td compared with svm they are reduced by 52 7 40 9 23 6 52 and 21 1 compared with arima they are reduced by 68 1 90 7 69 8 67 6 and 69 8 compared with lstm they are reduced by 79 1 92 9 73 7 78 7 and 73 6 compared with rbfnn they are reduced by 4 14 2 8 1 1 9 and 8 1 compared with cnn they are reduced by 50 49 2 28 9 48 8 and 28 8 in table 2 the r 2 of dos and td predicted by dhmm is the closest to 1 indicating that the model has good precision in dos and td prediction mae mape 1 96 s e and r 2 focus on evaluating the prediction effect as a whole mae 1 96 s e and mape have a negative correlation with the prediction effect and r 2 has a positive correlation with the prediction effect the prediction effect on dos and td is better for the dhmm proposed in this paper than for the other comparison models in mae mape 1 96 s e and r 2 because the output of the dhmm proposed in this paper is the probability distribution of the observations and the prediction results will not have large deviations svm is very sensitive to the selection of parameters and the difference in parameter selection can easily lead to svm overfitting or underfitting which affects the prediction precision and generalization ability of svm arima can capture only linear relationships the drastic changes in the environment make water quality parameters nonlinear and unstable and there are complex coupling relationships among water quality parameters making it difficult to precisely predict water quality parameters for arima lstm rbfnn and cnn methods are all neural networks similar to any other network the demand for data is very large and the effect may not be obvious the mse and rmse evaluation indicators focus on the prediction results of abnormal points which are negatively correlated with the prediction results the prediction results for dos and td are superior for the dhmm proposed in this paper than for the other comparative models in terms of mse and rmse for svm the prediction effect is relatively poor because it is restricted by the selection of the kernel function and deviations will inevitably occur when processing dimension upgrades of the abnormal data arima requires differential processing of data and the process of restoring after differential prediction will certainly cause deviations especially for abnormal data and the deviations will inevitably be amplified in the situation of a relatively small amount of data rbfnn cannot predict normally and all of its internal inference processes are numerical calculations which will inevitably lose some information making the prediction effects unsatisfactory cnn itself is not an efficient algorithm the pooling layer will cause part of the information to be missing making the prediction results of cnn unable to reflect the fluctuation situation of the data fig 8 shows the comparison between the predicted values of the seven day dhmm and the five comparative models with the observed values of dissolved oxygen saturation it can be seen from the picture that the fitting effect of the observed value and the predicted value is better for the dhmm proposed in this paper than for the svm arima lstm cnn and rbfnn prediction models at the same time it can be seen on the left that the prediction results of the svm cnn and arima models have larger deviations than those of the dhmm cnn does not predict the fluctuating state of data well the prediction results of the lstm prediction model gradually deteriorate over time on the right svm and arima predict lower dissolved oxygen saturation than the higher predicted dissolved oxygen saturation rbfnn is more effective when predicting lower dissolved oxygen saturation and when the observed value fluctuates greatly the prediction result will have a larger deviation fig 9 shows the comparison between the predicted values of the seven day dhmm and the five comparison models with the observed values of turbidity it can be seen from the figure that the dhmm proposed in this paper has a better predictive effect overall and can predict the turbidity sequence better in the time period when the observed value fluctuates greatly among the other models the prediction models of lstm arima and rbfnn have large deviations in the prediction of outliers the svm arima and lstm prediction models have poor prediction performance during periods of continuous fluctuations in the observation sequence the overall prediction effect of rbfnn is good but the prediction performance becomes worse when the observed value changes suddenly when the data have large fluctuations the observation value and prediction value of cnn have a large deviation which is similar to the prediction of dos and cannot reflect the fluctuation status of the observation value accordingly the dhmm proposed in this paper can better predict the observation sequence of different changing trends and its prediction performance is better than that of the other comparison models 3 3 3 forecast validity analysis we respectively predict the dos and td of six marine ranches in the bohai rim in order to verify the stability and generalization ability of dhmm as shown in fig 10 the predicted value sequence of dhmm can fit the observed values of dos and td well and shows good predictive performance for different data sets fig 11 shows a taylor diagram barzegar et al 2020 of the prediction model performance for the haikuan marine ranch the scattered points in the figure represent the model the radial line represents the correlation coefficient the horizontal and vertical axis represents the standard deviation and the semicircular dashed line represents the root mean square error for the prediction of dos the correlation coefficient of the discrete hmm proposed in this paper is 0 9782 the standard deviation is 0 1619 the root mean square error is 0 0357 and the prediction result is the best the rbf prediction model with a correlation coefficient of 0 9378 a standard deviation of 0 1823 and a root mean square error of 0 0631 shows the worst performance for the other prediction models the correlation coefficient of svm is 0 9587 the standard deviation is 0 1415 and the root mean square error is 0 0537 for arima the correlation coefficient is 0 9719 the standard deviation is 0 1702 and the root mean square error is 0 0404 for lstm the correlation coefficient is 0 9717 the standard deviation is 0 1385 and the root mean square error is 0 0514 similar to the dos prediction effect the correlation coefficient of the td prediction model based on dhmm is 0 9597 the standard deviation is 0 3201 and the root mean square error is 0 0933 dhmm is the best model for predicting td the rbf model with a correlation coefficient of 0 9064 standard deviation of 0 3413 and root mean square error of 0 1458 shows the worst predictive performance among all of the models in summary the dhmm model proposed in this paper show the best performance for predicting dos and td 4 conclusions to solve the problem of too many factors affecting water quality and low prediction accuracy this paper proposes a water quality prediction method based on discrete hmm to predict the dos and td of the water bodies of a marine ranch in the bohai sea we use easy to measure water quality parameters namely chl bp ws cond temp oil dos and td we analyze the correlation between the water quality parameters by mining hidden relationships among the data and avoid prediction errors caused by the complex correlation between water quality parameters when training the model parameters the water quality parameter change rate is defined and the clustering algorithm is used to determine the number of hidden states of the dhmm using the state transition probability matrix and the observation value generation probability matrix the probability distribution of the predicted value at the next moment is calculated to obtain the prediction result compared with time series forecasting algorithms such as svm arima and lstm this model eliminates the interference of redundant data and has strong interpretability it is more robust in data processing and prediction and there is no need to divide the training set and the test set which avoids the problems of overfitting and underfitting moreover it can learn the essential characteristics of the data more comprehensively and can meet the requirements for the accurate prediction of dos and td the model is also suitable for the prediction of other water quality parameters without the manual adjustment of parameters has strong generalizability and can provide a scientific and effective model reference for aquaculture decision making systems however the method used in this paper still has some shortcomings for example the initialization parameters are randomly generated so that it cannot be guaranteed that the internal parameters of the model are optimal because the training parameters of the baum welch algorithm can easily fall into local optimal values second when using discrete hidden markov model to make predictions correlation analysis must be performed to determine the number of hidden states and the preparatory work before model construction is cumbersome responding to the above issues our future research will focus on the following aspects 1 explore a new method to solve the problem of easily falling into partial optimal solutions during the hmm parameter training process without being sensitive to the initial value setting 2 in regard to determining the hidden status of the hmm design or find other algorithms to determine the best hmm structure for given datasets 5 credit authorship contribution statement dashe li supervision conceptualization funding acquisition yuanwei sun

3348,glacier mass balance mb and runoff relationship is poorly explored in the himalaya due to limited in situ data a simplified glacio hydrological model is used to reconstruct the long term mb and runoff on dokriani bamak glacier dbg in the monsoon regime and chhota shigri glacier csg catchments in the alpine regime of the himalaya since 1950 dbg and csg show limited mass wastage with mean annual glacier wide mb of 0 09 0 35 m w e a 1 and 0 12 0 28 m w e a 1 respectively the mean annual catchment wide runoff are also almost similar 0 13 0 01 106 m3 a 1 and 0 14 0 01 106 m3 a 1 from dbg and csg catchments respectively over 1950 2020 available in situ short term mb and runoff data from eight glacierized catchments do not show any significant mb runoff relationship except for csg the long term modelled mb and runoff data on both dbg and csg catchments suggest that the higher catchment wide runoff corresponds to more negative mb and vice versa this is in contrast to the previously suggested mb runoff relationship on dbg catchment present detailed analysis also indicates that the hydrology of the dbg catchment is mainly dominated by the summer precipitation while in csg catchment it is mainly controlled by the glacier wide annual mb in dry years the corresponding negative annual mb on both the glaciers provides additional glacier degraded runoff to the catchment streams that can be as high as 13 and 38 of total runoff on dbg and csg catchments respectively keywords himalaya glacier mass balance glacier runoff glacier buffer system 1 introduction the himalaya contains a large amount of snow ice and permafrost that are essential water resources to over 1 billion people in the indus ganga and brahmaputra river basins for irrigation hydropower industries and municipal sector azam et al 2021 these basins cover an area of 2 75 million m km2 with indian sovereignty over most of the area with 1 50 m km2 followed by pakistan 0 52 m km2 china 0 39 m km2 nepal 0 15 m km2 bangladesh 0 09 m km2 afghanistan 0 07 m km2 and bhutan 0 04 m km2 the region hosts some of the largest irrigated areas of the world with a total irrigated area of 0 58 m km2 and an installed hydropower capacity of 26432 mw azam et al 2021 ganga is the most densely populated basin with the maximum irrigated area over 0 16 m km2 glaciers regulate the headwaters of the himalayan river basins therefore any glacial change can modify the runoff characteristics from daily to multi century scales lutz et al 2014 depending on regional climate maussion et al 2014 daily seasonal and inter annual runoff variations are of critical importance at micro scale for local water supplies and hydropower generation at high altitudes whereas long term changes are significant at macro scale at lower altitudes mainly for irrigation in the indo gangetic plains biemans et al 2019 azam et al 2021 the relative contribution of glacier runoff to total river runoff depends on the percentage of glacierized area at any given basin outlet hence the fraction of glacier runoff increases with elevation kaser et al 2010 azam et al 2021 the solid to liquid precipitation ratio depends on climatic regimes and is important in any basin jennings et al 2018 snow can be deposited as seasonal perennial snow firn or glacier ice and remains in the basin for a long time whereas rain generally runs off from the basin comparatively faster in situ measurements and application of remote sensing and models suggest that the himalayan glaciers have been losing mass since the 1970s azam et al 2018 however glacier wastage is heterogeneous along the himalayan mountain range brun et al 2017 azam et al 2018 implying that the climate change impacts on glacier melt runoff production depend on the local regional climate maussion et al 2014 sakai fujita 2017 glacier melt runoff contribution in the himalaya also has strong seasonality immerzeel et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 azam et al 2021 it is suggested that the glacier runoff reduces during positive mass balance mb years because some water is stored on the glaciers while it increases during negative mb years as some water is released from long term glacier storage hock 2005 over the recent decades in situ glacier wide annual mb observations were started on several glaciers in bhutan china india and nepal yet the catchment wide runoff observations were often overlooked azam et al 2018 azam et al 2021 consequently the joint in situ observations of glacier wide annual mb and catchment wide runoff are not available from the recent decade therefore the relationship between in situ glacier wide annual mb and catchment wide runoff has been discussed for a limited number of glaciers using very sparse and short term data mostly from the pre 2000 period thayyen gergan 2010 the mb runoff relationship is not straightforward as a universal definition of glacier runoff is difficult to frame in the literature several definitions have been used depending on the authors expertise and research objectives the most commonly used definitions are 1 glacier runoff can be thought of as all the water coming out at the glacier terminus whether it is from glacier melt snow melt rain or any other source radić hock 2014 2 glacier runoff generated from the melting of glacier snow firn and ice cogley 2011 3 glacier runoff produced only from glacier firn and ice with the concept that all other components snow melt rain etc would exist in the basin even if the glaciers are gone 4 glacier runoff produced due to glacier net wastage kääb et al 2012 brun et al 2017 which can also be termed as glacier degraded runoff net water withdrawal from glacier storage at the end of the hydrological year and do not exist if the glacier mb is balanced or positive thayyen gergan 2010 the glacier runoff from definition 1 can directly be measured while the runoff in the other three scenarios can only be indirectly estimated modelled bringing in larger uncertainties in data sparse regions azam et al 2021 in the present study the long term relationships between glacier wide annual mb and catchment wide runoff have been analysed on two reference catchments dokriani bamak glacier dbg and chhota shigri glacier csg in the himalaya using the long term output from a simple glacio hydrological model since 1950 further the available short term in situ glacier mb and runoff data have been exploited to understand the mb runoff relationship in eight glacierized catchments of the himalaya glacier runoff definition 1 is used in the present study for investigating the mb runoff relationship however it is emphasized that glacier changes in any case will influence river runoff though the perceived impact would vary with the adopted glacier runoff definition 2 climate study area and existing data 2 1 climate and climatic regimes the himalayan climate is controlled by indian summer monsoon ism and western disturbances wds maussion et al 2014 ism strength decreases westward while wds weaken eastward along with the himalayan mountain range this spatio temporal distribution in precipitation and different river runoff composition lutz et al 2014 azam et al 2021 along the himalayan range provide three major glacio hydrological regimes 1 himalayan catchments 2 alpine catchments and 3 cold arid catchments thayyen gergan 2010 the himalayan catchments central and eastern catchments of the ganga and brahmaputra basins receive their major annual precipitation from ism during summer months and glacier meltwater contribution to the river runoff is maximum during the peak flow period in these catchments the glacier ablation period coincides with snow accumulation at high elevations thus the glaciers of himalayan catchments are called summer accumulation type glaciers maussion et al 2014 alpine catchments winter snow dominated regions south of the western himalaya and karakoram receive their major annual precipitation from winter snow falls from the wds therefore the glaciers in these catchments are called winter accumulation type glaciers maussion et al 2014 azam et al 2014a cold arid catchments of the ladakh north west of the western himalaya are extremely dry due to the decrepit reach of ism and wds therefore glaciers snow and permafrost melting are the major sources of water in these catchments thayyen gergan 2010 wani et al 2020 2 2 study area dbg catchment 30o51 n 78o49 e covering an area of 15 71 km2 is located in the upper ganga basin of the central himalaya garhwal range uttarakhand india fig 1 table

1 and table 1 present the location and characteristics of eight glacierized catchments dbg csg dunagiri tipra bank hamtah gara neh nar and shaune garang in the himalaya respectively where in situ glacier wide annual mb and catchment wide runoff are available and discussed in this study see section 2 3 all these catchments are from the indian himalaya and are concentrated in the indus and ganga basins the glacierized area varies from 14 to 45 at their runoff sites in different catchments these catchments are classified as monsoon catchments ism dominated regime and alpine catchments wds dominated alpine regime table 1 for ism dominated catchments the term monsoon catchment is preferred in this study instead of himalayan catchment as suggested previously thayyen gergan 2010 in order to avoid any confusion with the himalaya further it is more appropriate to use monsoon catchment for monsoon dominated catchments glacier wide mb and catchment wide runoff data are not yet available from the cold arid region 2 3 mb and runoff data during the 1970s and 80s the geological survey of india gsi was the primary organisation responsible for collecting the annual glacier wide mb and catchment wide runoff data on several catchments in the indian himalaya fig 1 shows the location of all these catchments where both mb and runoff data are available in september 1974 gsi conducted the first in situ annual glacier wide mb observations on the gara glacier western himalaya raina et al 1977 gradually gsi expanded the glacier monitoring network in different climatic regimes of the himalaya out of 26 observed glaciers in the himalaya during different time periods 1 10 years 11 glaciers have been monitored by the gsi azam et al 2018 the annual glacier wide mb measurements were often taken over september end to september end of a consecutive year using the traditional stake pit method østrem stanley 1969 however the available literature annual expedition reports or short abstracts sometimes lack the important details such as distribution of stakes accumulation methods pit vs snow firn coring snow firn density measurements map details and measurements dates which make it difficult to estimate the uncertainties in mb measurements azam et al 2018 gsi had generally developed integrated glacier monitoring programmes and therefore glacier runoff measurements were also carried out for a few catchments runoff measurements were often performed during the core monsoon period i e july to september the length of the observation period mainly depends on access roads are sometimes snow covered even up to june july and was not always uniform in some cases the observations were started in the first or second week of august gsi 2001 runoff sites were developed as close as possible to the glacier terminus in the case of neh nar glacier a rectangular weir was erected across the glacier stream gsi 2001 in shaune garang catchment the runoff was measured at ratia thatch where the basin area is 35 5 km2 with 26 glaciered cover nine glaciers above ratia thatch including shaune garang usually the runoff was measured by the standard area velocity method the stream velocity was measured either with the float method or current meter and the water levels were continuously measured by using an automatic water level recorder in turbulent streams runoff were measured by using the salt dilution method gsi 2001 hamtah neh nar and dunagiri glacier catchments were surveyed by gsi and mb and runoff data are available over 2000 2008 1978 1984 and 1985 1990 periods respectively gsi 2001 csg runoff measurements were performed from may through september and were available for 2010 2016 period azam et al 2019 the associated uncertainties in runoff measurements were not estimated in the original sources hence are not available for this study however focusing on the runoff measurements in similar conditions the uncertainties can be up to 25 of the measured runoff eeckman et al 2017 3 methods 3 1 climate data and bias correction glacio hydrological models for the dbg and csg catchments were forced with long term daily temperature and precipitation data from bias corrected era5 over 1950 2020 https cds climate copernicus eu home the data were downloaded at the nearest grids and bias corrected using available in situ meteorological data for dbg and csg catchments from previous studies verma et al 2018 azam et al 2016 mandal et al 2020 for the dbg catchment the daily temperature was bias corrected using linear regression equation between raw era5 and off glacier automatic weather station aws 3774 m a s l mean monthly data while for precipitation monthly factors were used between raw era5 and aws data verma et al 2018 the details of these bias corrections were given in azam srivastava 2020 for the csg catchment a linear regression equation developed between mean monthly temperature from raw era5 and an off glacier aws 4863 m a s l fig 2 data over 2009 2016 azam et al 2016 was applied to bias correct the era5 temperature series while monthly scale factors were applied to bias correct the era5 precipitation series using precipitation data from an automated rain snow gauge geonor t 200b installed at csg base camp fig 2 since 2012 3 2 glacio hydrological model long term glacier wide mb and catchment wide runoff on dbg monsoon regime and csg catchments alpine regime were reconstructed using a simple glacio hydrological model at daily temporal resolution including an accumulation module rain module and a temperature index melt module the reconstructions were already performed on dbg catchment over 1979 2018 azam srivastava 2020 and csg catchment over 1969 2016 azam et al 2019 using the same model and were extended over the 1950 2020 period in the present study the details about the model can be found in previous studies azam et al 2014b azam et al 2019 azam srivastava 2020 however a brief description of the model is as follows the daily snow accumulation sacc mm w e d 1 is computed at each 50 m elevation range of the catchment glacierized and non glacierized as 1 s acc p w h e n t t p 0 w h e n t t p where p and t denote daily precipitation mm and temperature oc respectively which are extrapolated at each 50 m elevation range applying the temperature and precipitation gradients respectively and tp is the threshold temperature oc for snow rain the daily rainfall r mm w e d 1 is computed at each 50 m elevation range of the catchment glacierized and non glacierized as 2 r 0 w h e n t t p p w h e n t t p the computed rainfall and all other computed runoff components mentioned hereafter are assumed to arrive at the catchment outlet at the end of each day the daily melt m mm w e d 1 from each 50 m elevation range is computed as 3 m s i d ddf s i d t t m w h e n t t m 0 w h e n t t m where ddf is the degree day factor mm d 1 c 1 which is different for different surface conditions snow s ice i and debris covered ice d and tm is the threshold temperature oc for melt mean altitudinal mb for each 50 m elevation range bz m w e is estimated using the accumulation and the ablation terms as 4 b z s acc m daily glacier wide mb ba m w e is calculated using the mean elevation mb as 5 b a a z b z a where az m2 and bz m w e are the 50 m elevation glacier area and mean altitudinal mb respectively and a is the total glacier area m2 annual glacier wide mb are calculated using daily mb for the hydrological year from 1 november through 31 october of next the year for dbg dobhal et al 2008 and hydrological year from 1 october through 30 september of the next year for csg wagnon et al 2007 the daily catchment wide snow melt runoff qs m3 s is computed as 6 q s m sg m sng where m sg and msng denote snow melt runoff from the glacierized and non glacierized areas respectively the daily catchment wide rainfall runoff qr m3 s is computed as 7 q r r g r ng where rg and rng denote rainfall runoff from the glacierized and non glacierized areas respectively the daily catchment wide total runoff q m3 s is computed as 8 q q s q r q i where qs qr and qi are the catchment wide snow melt runoff rainfall runoff and ice melt runoff clean and debris covered ice the overall structure of model is shown in fig 3 3 3 model parameters and extrapolation of climate data temperature plays an important role in mb runoff modelling as it determines the distribution of snowfall rain over the catchment temperature was extrapolated at every 50 m elevation range applying the mean monthly temperature lapse rates tlrs for dbg catchment estimated in azam srivastava 2020 while for csg catchment estimated using in situ temperature data recorded using automatic temperature sensors with solar radiations shields hobo u23 002 at csg base camp 3850 m a s l and aws site 4863 m a s l fig 2 over three hydrological years from october 2016 to september 2019 tp values of 0 7 c and 1 1 c were used corresponding to 70 80 and 60 70 relative humidity ranges for dbg and csg respectively at which 90 to 100 precipitation was considered as snow jennings et al 2018 the ddfs for snow clean ice and debris cover ice surfaces were adopted from previous studies for both dbg and csg catchments azam et al 2019 azam srivastava 2020 the glacio hydrological models were found to be highly sensitive to tm an unknown in the himalayan catchments engelhardt et al 2017 azam et al 2019 azam srivastava 2020 further precipitation distribution over the himalayan region is spatially non uniform due to valley specific precipitation gradients pg sakai et al 2015 immerzeel et al 2015 hence in this study the calibrated values of tm and pg have been adopted for the dbg catchment from azam srivastava 2020 while for the csg catchment these parameters were calibrated against the in situ mb and runoff data details are mentioned in table 2 precipitation at every 50 m elevation range was then extrapolated using calibrated pg for both the catchments the rainfall over the glacier was assumed to contribute directly to the runoff and refreezing of rain water or melt water was assumed negligible seasonal snow melt water refreezing is more than 30 of total melt in the himalaya saloranta et al 2019 stigter et al 2021 but ignored in this study as we have used a simplified model for more details about the parameters readers are invited to go through previous publications azam et al 2014b 2019 azam srivastava 2020 3 4 model calibration and validation the dbg model was forced with meteorological data from era5 copernicus climate change service c3s 2017 and calibrated validated using in situ data over the recent years azam srivastava 2020 therefore in this study no further calibration and validation were performed the csg model was forced with meteorological data from the indian meteorological department station at bhuntar town 50 km away other side of the orographic barrier and calibrated validated with the available in situ data azam et al 2019 in this study era5 bias corrected data was used for mb and runoff reconstructions in the csg catchment since 1950 hence new calibration and validation processes were performed for the model calibration the pg and tm parameters were varied over the plausible parameter s limits pg from 0 to 100 km 1 and tm from 4 c to 4 c in both the catchments the model run with minimized rmse root mean square error between modelled and in situ annual mb and monthly runoff were selected for both the catchments the selected run showed rmses of 0 28 m w e a 1 1993 1995 1998 2000 and 0 43 m w e a 1 2003 2012 between modelled and in situ mb and 0 79 106 m3 a 1 1994 1998 2000 and 1 22 106 m3 a 1 2010 2012 between modelled and in situ runoff for the dbg and csg catchments respectively fig 4 the model was validated against the snow line altitudes slas derived from model and satellite images the satellite derived slas were obtained for dbg from azam and srivastava 2020 and for csg from chandrasekharan et al 2018 the modelled slas showed a good agreement with satellite derived slas for both dbg and csg catchments with rmses of 157 and 156 m respectively fig 4 another validation was performed using modelled and in situ monthly runoff with rmse of 1 11 106 m3 a 1 1997 1998 from singh et al 2006 and 1 66 106 m3 a 1 2013 2015 from azam et al 2019 for dbg and csg catchments respectively multiple criteria calibration validation has been suggested in azam et al 2021 for reducing the equifinality problem in the hydrological models in line we have used multiple datasets for model calibration mb and runoff and validation runoff and slas in the present study on both the catchments to check the model performance nash sutcliffe efficiency test nash and sutcliffe 1970 was also performed this test is described in equation 9 9 e 1 i 1 n q o q m 2 i 1 n q m ǭ 2 where e is the efficiency of the model qo and qm are the in situ and modelled runoff respectively for a particular year and ǭ is the mean in situ runoff during the period of consideration e ranges between 1 to with e 1 being the favourable value efficiencies of 0 85 and 0 81 between in situ and modelled runoff for dbg and csg catchments respectively suggest a good performance of the model 3 5 uncertainty estimation to estimate the uncertainties in the reconstructed mb and runoff the model was rerun by changing the input parameters one by one within the plausible ranges and keeping all other input model parameters as calibrated the minimum and maximum values of ddf for ice snow and debris covered ice for dbg and csg catchments were taken from azam and srivastava 2020 and azam et al 2019 respectively for tlrs the upper and lower uncertainty bounds were estimated as the mean monthly standard deviations after eliminating the seasonality in monthly tlrs the uncertainties in pg tm and tp were unknown therefore to get the upper and lower values they were changed by 10 and 10 respectively from their original calibrated values table 3 all these parametric uncertainties were added by applying the error propagation law to compute the total uncertainties in mb and runoff the mean annual uncertainties for mb were estimated to be 0 35 and 0 28 m w e a 1 for dbg and csg catchments respectively while the uncertainties for runoff were the same with a value of 0 01 106 m3 a 1 for both the catchments tlr and tm contributed maximum uncertainty to mb estimates over dbg catchment while ddfs and ddfi to csg catchment table 3 the glacier and catchment hypsometries fig 2 were manually delineated from cnes airbus data 10 07 2017 at google earth platform azam and srivastava 2020 for dbg catchment and using a digital elevation model developed exploiting pléiades stereo pair 18 08 2014 azam et al 2016 for csg catchment in the present study static glacier surfaces have been assumed for the mb and runoff reconstructions on both the glaciers the estimated area shrinkage rates were very low on dbg 0 2 a 1 over 1962 2007 dobhal and mehta 2010 and csg 0 01 a 1 over 1980 2010 pandey and venkataraman 2013 therefore the model uncertainties related to the static area assumption were expected to be much smaller than the already computed uncertainties hence ignored in addition to these uncertainties the static area assumption also gives uncertainties due to temperature changes at each elevation range resulting from glacier thickness changes not included in the modelling scheme a previous study found that these uncertainties were very small compared to total computed uncertainty in mb on csg azam et al 2014b thus also ignored in our study another source of model uncertainty could be from avalanching snow blowing or snow drift there are very limited studies models that involve these processes azam et al 2021 in langtang catchment 360 km2 central himalaya nepal avalanche contribution was 5 to the runoff ragettli et al 2015 dbg and csg are the benchmark glaciers catchments that were selected carefully for long term mb and runoff studies wagnon et al 2007 dobhal et al 2008 an ice flow modelling study investigated the role of avalanches on several glaciers and reported that dbg and csg are not receiving significant avalanche accumulation as compared to the annual mb laha et al 2017 given that both the catchments are relatively less affected by avalanching we assumed that its role is insignificant azam et al 2019 azam and srivastava 2020 another source of uncertainty could be from sublimation and other wind driven ablation processes that can be significant on himalayan glaciers but cannot be resolved in simple temperature index models stigter et al 2018 azam et al 2021 3 6 glacier mb runoff relationship concept glacier mb runoff relationship can simply be described by the following equation cuffey paterson 2010 10 r g a g p g e g b a where rg is annual glacier wide runoff ag is glacier area pg and eg are annual precipitation and evaporation on from glacier surface and ba is annual glacier wide mb groundwater fluxes and changes of stored water within the glacier are assumed negligible here for a steady state ba 0 glacier wide runoff corresponding to annual precipitation and evaporation over the glacier can be defined as mass balanced runoff ag pg eg in other situations ba positive or negative the runoff is therefore imbalanced runoff the imbalanced runoff from negative glacier wide mb ba 0 can also be defined as glacier degraded runoff thayyen gergan 2010 if the glacier disappears the catchment would still release certain runoff a p e and changes in this runoff would solely depend on the precipitation and evaporation during negative mb years in addition to balanced runoff perennial glacier storage also generates glacier degraded runoff that results in increased glacier melt runoff on the other hand during positive mb years glacier melt runoff decreases as some snow is accumulated on the glacier hock 2005 on mountain valley glaciers this mb runoff relationship more runoff with more negative mb may not always be true because of two major reasons 1 glacier catchments are not completely glacierized and there would always be some runoff as a result of precipitation and evaporation over non glacierized parts of the catchment contributing to the total runoff at the glacier terminus and 2 on the ground runoff is generally measured downstream of the glacier terminus further increasing the impact of non glacierized parts on runoff therefore in the case of mountain valley glaciers the runoff r at glacier snout or downstream runoff site can be defined as 11 r r g r ng a g p g e g b a a ng p ng e ng where ang is the non glacierized area at glacier catchment outlet and rng png and eng are runoff precipitation and evaporation from the non glacierized area respectively this is a simplified runoff equation and ignores all the sub surface water fluxes as well as avalanche snow blowing and refreezing processes 4 results 4 1 catchment wide runoff the mean annual catchment wide runoff were 0 13 0 01 106 m3 a 1 and 0 14 0 01 106 m3 a 1 from dbg and csg catchments over 1950 2020 respectively fig 5 the year 2012 13 and 1993 94 showed maximum annual runoff of 0 17 0 01 106 m3 and 0 19 0 02 m w e while the year 1964 65 and 2000 01 showed similar minimum annual runoff of 0 08 0 01 106 m3 for dbg and csg respectively fig 5 fig 5 shows the mean monthly evolution of glacier melt snow melt rainfall and total runoff at both the catchments runoff in the winter months october to march april were negligible in both the catchments runoff generation started in march with the inception of snow melt in the dbg catchment and in april in the csg catchment fig 5 both catchments received rainfall runoff over may october and glacier ice melt over june october snow melt runoff peaked in july while august experienced the maximum glacier ice melt and maximum rainfall runoff that resulted in maximum total catchment wide runoff in august in dbg catchment and in july in csg catchment fig 5 the glacier ice melt contribution was almost same with 21 to the total catchment wide runoff in both dbg and csg catchments however snow melt and rainfall runoff contributions were quite different dbg catchment generated 41 of rainfall runoff 15 from glacierized and 26 from un glacierized area and 38 of snow melt runoff 17 from glacierized and 21 from un glacierized area conversely csg catchment produced only 10 of rainfall runoff 5 from glacierized and 5 from un glacierized area and 69 of snow melt runoff 34 from glacier snow melt and 35 from snow melt from un glacierized area thus the total runoff was dominated by rainfall in the dbg catchment and snow melt in the csg catchment fig 5 in accordance with monsoon and alpine regimes respectively 4 2 glacier wide mb and annual mass turn over the mean modelled annual mb were 0 09 0 35 m w e a 1 and 0 12 0 28 m w e a 1 with cumulative mass wastage of 6 33 m w e and 8 61 m w e on dbg and csg over 1950 2020 respectively the year 1974 75 and 1950 51 showed maximum annual mb of 1 24 0 32 m w e and 1 03 0 20 m w e while the year 2015 16 and 2000 01 showed minimum annual mb of 0 95 0 40 m w e and 1 23 0 33 m w e for dbg and csg respectively fig 6 summer mass balance smb have been considered from may to october and april to september while winter mass balance smb have been considered from november to april and october to march on dbg and csg catchments respectively modelled seasonal mb ranged from 0 29 to 1 48 m w e a 1 and 0 45 to 1 73 m w e a 1 for winter and 1 68 to 0 12 w e a 1 and 1 98 to 0 08 w e a 1 for summer on dbg and csg respectively fig 6 though the mean annual wastage was almost same on both the glaciers the annual mass turnover on dbg was smaller with a value of 1 83 m w e a 1 corresponding to a mean winter and summer mb of 0 87 and 0 96 m w e a 1 respectively compared to csg which had a slightly higher annual mass turnover of 2 04 m w e a 1 corresponding to the mean winter and summer mb of 0 96 and 1 08 m w e a 1 respectively fig 6 although the difference in annual mass turnovers on both the glaciers is small it is statistically different p 0 005 and might be linked with the climate regimes dbg in the monsoon regime receives a significant amount of accumulation during the summer monsoon period that limits the mass wastage during the peak melting season july september azam srivastava 2020 csg in the alpine regime receives its major accumulation during winter months while summer accumulation was very limited mandal et al 2020 consequently has stronger seasonality of accumulation and ablation that result in a higher mass turnover compared to dbg 4 3 glacier wide mb and catchment wide runoff patterns over the last two five decades several studies have modelled the glacier mb and runoff at the glacier to basin scales in the himalaya azam et al 2018 azam et al 2021 present reconstructed glacier wide mb and catchment wide runoff in dbg and csg catchments since 1950 are the longest known reconstructions in the himalaya and allow this study to investigate the mb and runoff patterns over the last seven decades three periods were arbitrarily defined in the present study period i 1950 1975 period ii 1976 2000 and period iii 2001 2020 table 4 for each period the glacier wide mb and catchment wide runoff were estimated using annual data period i 1950 1975 showed positive mb on both dbg 0 16 m w e a 1 and csg 0 12 m w e a 1 corresponding to lowest summer mb on both the glaciers and highest and moderate winter mb on dbg and csg respectively table 4 period ii 1976 2000 experienced moderate mass loss 0 21 m w e a 1 with the highest summer and moderate winter mb on dbg and close to balance mb on csg 0 11 m w e a 1 with moderate summer and highest winter mb table 3 period iii 2001 2020 showed the highest mass wastage on both dbg 0 26 m w e a 1 and csg 0 45 m w e a 1 corresponding to moderate and highest summer mb and lowest winter mb on both the glaciers respectively table 4 in agreement with increasing mass loss over the three selected periods catchment wide runoff also increased systematically from 0 11 to 0 14 106 m3 a 1 in dbg and 0 13 to 0 14 106 m3 a 1 in csg catchment table 4 on dbg the mb over period i was statistically different than period ii p 0 001 and iii p 0 001 while the mb over period ii and iii were statistically similar p 0 33 conversely on csg the mb over period i and ii were statistically similar p 0 08 and the mb over period i and iii p 0 001 and period ii and iii p 0 02 were statistically different the runoff over period i ii and iii were statistically different on dbg p 0 05 while runoff over period i was statistically different than period ii p 0 01 and period iii p 0 04 and period ii and iii were statistically same p 0 27 on csg though the arbitrarily selected periods were not always statistically different for mb and runoff but provide a simplified analysis of the 70 years mb and runoff series and an inter comparison of dbg and csg as well as other studies mostly focusing on pre and post 2000 periods the glacier wide mb records in situ reconstructed or geodetic are often available post 1975 with very limited knowledge of glacier behaviour before 1975 azam et al 2018 previously a possible close to balance state was proposed over the 1990s on both dbg and csg as well as on mera glacier central himalaya nepal shea et al 2015 azam srivastava 2020 during period ii 1976 2000 the reconstructed moderate and close to balance mb wastage on dbg and csg respectively is in agreement with the suggested short term steady state over the 1990s however with the present 7 decade long reconstruction it is clear that both the glaciers gained some mass during period i 1951 1975 the accelerated mass wastage over period iii 2001 2020 observed on dbg and csg are also in agreement with several remote sensing as well as modelling studies that suggest a rapid post 2000 mass wastage bhattacharya et al 2016 maurer et al 2019 mandal et al 2020 the present study together with other studies suggest a slightly positive mb period 1950 1975 a near steady state 1976 2000 and an accelerated wastage post 2020 on dbg and csg however given the large uncertainties in our study as well as other studies compared here shea et al 2015 bhattacharya et al 2016 maurer et al 2019 azam srivastava 2020 these inferred mb states should be viewed with caution 5 discussion 5 1 glacier mb runoff relationship in himalaya short term historical data in dbg catchment the mb runoff relationship was discussed using four years 1994 1998 2000 of observed annual mb and mean daily summer runoff fig 7 a and it was surmised that higher catchment wide runoff were associated with less negative glacier wide mb while lower runoff with higher negative mb thayyen gergan 2010 though based on very limited data this relationship higher catchment wide runoff with lower negative or positive mb and vice versa was thought to be a characteristic of the monsoon catchment regime where monsoon coincides with peak glacier melt runoff this idea was further propagated by some other studies singh et al 2016 kumar et al 2016 all possible in situ data from the literature table 1 has been collected and carefully investigated for the mb runoff relationship on eight glacierized catchments in the himalaya fig 7 dbg gara neh nar and hamtah catchments showed higher runoff at catchment outlets with less negative glacier wide mb conversely tipra bank dunagiri and csg showed higher runoff with more negative mb shaune garang catchment showed no relationship between glacier wide mb and catchment wide runoff fig 7b at the outlet of shaune garang glacier catchment alpine catchment regime the runoff comes from 9 glaciers including shaune garang table 1 that is compared with the annual mb of shaune garang glacier indeed in the same climatic settings the mb behaviour of neighbouring glaciers may be different depending on the local topography and debris cover sherpa et al 2017 therefore the comparison of catchment wide runoff including runoff from 9 glaciers with annual glacier wide mb of shaune garang glacier is questionable further neh nar and hamtah glaciers in the alpine catchment regime showed higher runoff with less negative mb while tipra bank and dunagiri glaciers in the monsoon catchment regime showed higher runoff with more negative mb fig 7 these examples cannot be explained with the previous explanation of the monsoon catchment regime based on the dbg catchment thayyen gergan 2010 as already discussed section 2 3 the uncertainties in mb and runoff measurements are mostly unknown strong negative mb 1 43 m w e yr 1 during 2000 2012 on hamtah glacier was three times more negative than the estimated geodetic mb 0 45 0 16 m w e yr 1 1999 2011 vincent et al 2013 csg mb series was the only series which was systematically corrected for area changes and validated against the geodetic mb azam et al 2016 in fact except for csg catchment alpine catchment regime the mb runoff relationships were very weak and insignificant in all other catchments fig 7 such insignificant relationships together with unknown uncertainties in the measurements make it very difficult to interpret the mb runoff relationship in the himalaya using the available short term in situ runoff and mb data glaciohydrological models calibrated using short term in situ observations provide an alternative to understand the long term mb runoff relationship however the length of in situ observations plays a critical role for the model calibration therefore in situ measurements should be continued for a long time on a few selected glacierized catchments in the himalaya azam 2021 5 2 glacier mb runoff relationship in studied reference catchments long term modelled data the long term relationship between mb and runoff was investigated using the modelled annual mb and runoff data section 4 2 and 4 1 dbg catchment in the monsoon regime showed a weak but significant correlation r 0 30 p 0 02 with increasing catchment wide runoff corresponding to more negative mb and vice versa fig 8 a the correlation was average in the csg catchment r 0 47 p 0 001 fig 8b unlike associated challenges with in situ observations of the runoff section 5 1 model output also permits to estimate the glacier wide runoff the correlations between annual glacier wide mb and annual glacier wide runoff on dbg r 0 53 p 0 001 and csg r 0 75 p 0 001 were stronger compared to catchment wide runoff fig 8 stronger relationships with increasing catchment wide runoff corresponding to more negative mb and vice versa of annual glacier wide mb with glacier wide runoff compared to catchment wide runoff are expected as modelled glacier wide runoff does not involve the non glacierized runoff fig 8 which is often rainfall or snow melt that has no contribution in the modelled mb in line another long term model based study on 6 glaciers of nuuk region of the greenland ice sheet alpine regime also showed higher annual glacier wide runoff accompanying more negative mb during 1960 2012 van as et al 2014 singh et al 2016 though the glacierized areas are the same in dbg 44 6 and csg 44 7 catchments table 1 the weaker mb runoff relationships in the dbg catchment compared to csg catchment is probably linked to their climatic regimes to further investigate the mb runoff relationship and to understand the functioning of both the catchments the inter relationships among mb annual winter and summer runoff glacierized non glacierized and catchment wide and climatic parameters annual winter and summer temperatures and precipitations were investigated by developing the correlation matrix fig 9 as expected annual and seasonal mb showed negative correlations with the annual and seasonal temperatures in both the catchments conversely catchment wide runoff showed positive correlations with seasonal and annual temperatures fig 9 annual mb on dbg showed moderate correlation with winter precipitation r 0 64 but no significant relationship was found with summer precipitation while annual mb on csg showed moderate correlations with winter r 0 60 as well as summer r 0 61 precipitations on the other hand catchment wide runoff in dbg showed weak correlation r 0 24 with winter precipitation and strong correlation r 0 85 with summer precipitation while in csg catchment runoff showed no significant correlation with summer or winter precipitations fig 9 this analysis figs 8 and 9 clearly indicates that the hydrology of the dbg catchment is mainly controlled by the summer precipitation while hydrology in the csg catchment is mainly controlled by the glacier wide annual mb the different control of hydrology is because of the different precipitation regimes in both the catchments dbg in the monsoon catchment regime receives monsoonal rainfall and snowfalls that often melt quickly due to high summer temperature that make up a significant runoff contribution therefore the catchment hydrology is mainly controlled by the summer precipitation conversely csg in the alpine catchment regime receives most of the precipitation through snowfall during winter months that contributes to the glacier mb and then during summer months glacier melt snow and ice is generated that contributes to the catchment runoff hence providing a strong relationship between glacier mb and catchment runoff however for some specific years the higher catchment wide runoff was found to be associated with higher precipitation in both the catchments fig 6 during these specific years dbg 1983 2010 2013 csg 1956 1959 1988 the catchments received much higher precipitations than average fig 6 that resulted in a direct contribution as rainfall or snowfall during summer that melts quickly due to higher summer temperatures providing higher runoff at catchment outlet this phenomenon was already discussed on csg azam et al 2019 contrasting to the previously suggested mb runoff relationship in the monsoon catchment regime thayyen gergan 2010 present analysis based on long term data shows that the catchment wide runoff increases with more negative mb and vice versa in agreement with the concept of hock 2005 however in line with thayyen gergan 2010 the analysis also suggests that the hydrology of the dbg in the monsoon catchment regime is mainly controlled by the summer precipitation in the csg catchment higher annual and seasonal temperatures were negatively correlated with annual and seasonal precipitations respectively this is probably due to the moisture holding capacity of the air parcel at higher temperature hornberger et al 2014 in line the winter temperature was negatively correlated with winter precipitation in the dbg catchment while annual and summer temperatures showed positive correlations with annual and summer precipitations fig 9 we could not find any concrete reason for these positive correlations but these may be linked with monsoon dynamics which is not yet clearly understood duan et al 2004 mishra 2015 5 3 glacier buffer system glacier degraded runoff glaciers and snow cover act as an important buffer system for downstream rivers by storing snow during accumulation periods whereas producing glacier snow melt in ablation periods in order to understand the relative importance of the glacier buffer system in the monsoon and alpine catchment regimes of the himalaya the glacier degraded runoff from dbg and csg catchments are computed using the modelled annual mb data thayyen gergan 2010 fig 6 indeed the glacier degraded runoff contribution to catchment runoff is zero for balanced or positive mb years fig 6 runoff from non glacierized regions in both the catchments is strongly and moderately correlated with annual precipitation of dbg r 0 93 and csg r 0 52 catchments fig 9 respectively and therefore during dry years non glacierized runoff drastically reduced fig 6 in such dry years the corresponding negative annual mb on both the glaciers provided additional glacier degraded runoff to the catchment stream fig 6 for highly negative mb years glacier degraded runoff can be quite high for instance glacier degraded runoff were as high as 13 2015 16 and 38 1999 2000 and 2000 2001 of total catchment wide runoff on dbg and csg catchments respectively fig 6 however the mean annual glacier degraded runoff was 3 for negative mb years 6 and 10 for negative mb years 17 of total catchment wide runoff at dbg and csg catchments over 1951 2020 respectively almost three fold higher contribution of glacier degraded runoff in the csg catchment compared to dbg catchment confirms the control of glacier wide mb on csg catchment hydrology and suggests that the glacier buffer system is more important in the alpine catchment regime compared to the monsoon catchment regime where precipitation mainly controls the catchment wide runoff section 5 2 further more glacier degraded runoff from csg compared to dbg with almost similar mean annual mb section 4 2 again suggests the high mass turn over on csg compared to dbg section 4 2 5 4 hydrological years daily mean glacier wide mb and catchment wide runoff the hydrological year for glacier mb is thought to be starting from the end of summer when the glacier wide mb is normally close to balance following the previous studies dobhal et al 2008 wagnon et al 2007 the glacier wide mb and runoff in this study were computed for the hydrological year from 1 november to 31 october for the following year on dbg and hydrological year from 1 october to 30 september of the following year on csg section 3 2 in this section the suitability of aforesaid hydrological years on both the glaciers is discussed fig 10 shows the daily mean glacier wide mb and catchment wide runoff for dbg and csg for all julian days starting from 1 october to 30 september of the next year estimated from modelled daily mb and runoff data over 1950 2020 on both dbg and csg the daily mean glacier wide mb are positive during winter months october to march and start decreasing over pre monsoon april may and become negative during summer monsoon months june september the transition from positive to negative daily mean mb takes place in the month of may on dbg and in june on csg fig 10 on csg in accordance with the alpine regime winter accumulation type glacier the daily mean glacier wide mb showed a clear pattern of accumulation 1 october to 31 may and ablation 1 june to 30 september justifying the selection of hydrological year from 1 october to 30 september while on dbg daily mean glacier wide mb subdued as soon as the monsoon arrives in june that probably provided snow accumulation at high altitudes and rain at lower altitudes with the concurrence of melt season hence reduced daily mean mb at glacier wide scale with the progression of the monsoon in september when the temperatures are low hence low melting the daily mean glacier wide mb even become positive however as soon as the monsoon retreats the daily mean glacier wide mb again become slightly negative in the month of october further in november the temperature is very low and the glacier experiences positive daily mb the daily mean glacier wide mb pattern on dbg confirms the selection of hydrological year from 1 november to 31 october the daily mean catchment wide runoff hydrographs in both the catchments indicate negligible runoff in winter months from october to mid april while almost all runoff is produced in the summer months from mid april to end september with a peak in early august fig 10 the hydrographs in both the catchments show a sharp rising limb with the progression of the summer season however the rising limb of dbg hydrograph is subdued at the arrival of monsoon around the end of june and again shows a sharp rise from mid august to end august before an abrupt decrease in september fig 10 though the runoff commencing dates are different from mid april in dbg catchment and from may in csg catchment both the catchments show a simultaneous reduction in runoff in september the reduction in runoff at the arrival of monsoon around end of june followed by a sharp rise in runoff from mid august in the dbg catchment is probably because of monsoonal snow falls that accumulate in june july and then due to highest temperatures of august produces strong melt runoff hence a sharp rise the present study based on a temperature index melt model cannot investigate the physical process explaining the impact of monsoonal snow falls on runoff generation however previous studies using surface energy balance models suggested that these summer monsoon snowfall events increase the glacier surface albedo hence reducing the energy available at glacier surface for melting in the peak ablation period and control the melt production fujita 2008 mölg et al 2014 azam et al 2014a 6 conclusion understanding of the mb runoff relationship is weak in the himalaya due to limited in situ glacier mb and runoff measurements a simplified glacio hydrological model is used to reconstruct the long term mb and runoff on two small glacierized catchments of dbg and csg having similar glacier cover dbg falls in the monsoon regime while csg is in the alpine regime of the himalaya the modelled mb and runoff data since 1950 are used to understand the mb patterns as well as mb runoff relationships in both the catchments over the last seven decades dbg and csg show similar limited mass wastage with mean annual glacier wide mb of 0 09 0 35 m w e a 1 and 0 12 0 28 m w e a 1 respectively both the glaciers show positive mb over 1950 1975 and moderate mass loss over 1976 2000 followed by an accelerated mass wastage post 2000 though the mb are similar the mass turn over on csg is slightly higher than dbg the mean catchment wide runoff are also almost similar 0 13 0 01 106 m3 a 1 and 0 14 0 01 106 m3 a 1 from dbg and csg catchments respectively over 1950 2020 the catchment wide runoff is dominated by rainfall in the dbg catchment and snow melt in the csg catchment in accordance with monsoon and alpine regimes respectively short term historical mb and runoff data available from eight glacierized catchments do not show any significant mb runoff relationship except for csg catchment such insignificant relationships and associated unknown uncertainties in in situ measurements do not allow interpretation of the mb runoff relationship in the himalaya using short term in situ data the long term modelled mb and runoff data on both dbg and csg catchments suggests that the higher catchment wide runoff correspond to more negative mb and vice versa in agreement to hock 2005 this is in contrast to the previously suggested mb runoff relationship based on very limited in situ data on dbg thayyen gergan 2010 present long term analysis suggests that the hydrology of the dbg catchment is mainly dominated by the summer precipitation while in csg catchment it is mainly controlled by the glacier wide annual mb the mb runoff relationship being different with the adopted glacier runoff definition suggests that the relationship depends on the relative amount of glacierized and non glacierized runoff in a catchment however it is also stressed that any change in glacier mb will influence the river runoff irrespective of the adopted glacier runoff definition the mean annual glacier degraded runoff are 3 and 10 of total catchment wide runoff at dbg and csg catchments respectively over 1951 2020 in dry years the corresponding negative annual mb on both the glaciers provided additional glacier degraded runoff to the catchment stream higher glacier degraded runoff in the csg catchment compared to dbg catchment confirms the control of glacier wide mb on catchment hydrology and also suggests that the glacier buffer system is more critical in the alpine catchment regime compared to the monsoon catchment regime where precipitation mainly controls the catchment wide runoff the mean daily glacier wide mb series also confirms the hydrological years used on both the glaciers for in situ mb measurements declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

3348,glacier mass balance mb and runoff relationship is poorly explored in the himalaya due to limited in situ data a simplified glacio hydrological model is used to reconstruct the long term mb and runoff on dokriani bamak glacier dbg in the monsoon regime and chhota shigri glacier csg catchments in the alpine regime of the himalaya since 1950 dbg and csg show limited mass wastage with mean annual glacier wide mb of 0 09 0 35 m w e a 1 and 0 12 0 28 m w e a 1 respectively the mean annual catchment wide runoff are also almost similar 0 13 0 01 106 m3 a 1 and 0 14 0 01 106 m3 a 1 from dbg and csg catchments respectively over 1950 2020 available in situ short term mb and runoff data from eight glacierized catchments do not show any significant mb runoff relationship except for csg the long term modelled mb and runoff data on both dbg and csg catchments suggest that the higher catchment wide runoff corresponds to more negative mb and vice versa this is in contrast to the previously suggested mb runoff relationship on dbg catchment present detailed analysis also indicates that the hydrology of the dbg catchment is mainly dominated by the summer precipitation while in csg catchment it is mainly controlled by the glacier wide annual mb in dry years the corresponding negative annual mb on both the glaciers provides additional glacier degraded runoff to the catchment streams that can be as high as 13 and 38 of total runoff on dbg and csg catchments respectively keywords himalaya glacier mass balance glacier runoff glacier buffer system 1 introduction the himalaya contains a large amount of snow ice and permafrost that are essential water resources to over 1 billion people in the indus ganga and brahmaputra river basins for irrigation hydropower industries and municipal sector azam et al 2021 these basins cover an area of 2 75 million m km2 with indian sovereignty over most of the area with 1 50 m km2 followed by pakistan 0 52 m km2 china 0 39 m km2 nepal 0 15 m km2 bangladesh 0 09 m km2 afghanistan 0 07 m km2 and bhutan 0 04 m km2 the region hosts some of the largest irrigated areas of the world with a total irrigated area of 0 58 m km2 and an installed hydropower capacity of 26432 mw azam et al 2021 ganga is the most densely populated basin with the maximum irrigated area over 0 16 m km2 glaciers regulate the headwaters of the himalayan river basins therefore any glacial change can modify the runoff characteristics from daily to multi century scales lutz et al 2014 depending on regional climate maussion et al 2014 daily seasonal and inter annual runoff variations are of critical importance at micro scale for local water supplies and hydropower generation at high altitudes whereas long term changes are significant at macro scale at lower altitudes mainly for irrigation in the indo gangetic plains biemans et al 2019 azam et al 2021 the relative contribution of glacier runoff to total river runoff depends on the percentage of glacierized area at any given basin outlet hence the fraction of glacier runoff increases with elevation kaser et al 2010 azam et al 2021 the solid to liquid precipitation ratio depends on climatic regimes and is important in any basin jennings et al 2018 snow can be deposited as seasonal perennial snow firn or glacier ice and remains in the basin for a long time whereas rain generally runs off from the basin comparatively faster in situ measurements and application of remote sensing and models suggest that the himalayan glaciers have been losing mass since the 1970s azam et al 2018 however glacier wastage is heterogeneous along the himalayan mountain range brun et al 2017 azam et al 2018 implying that the climate change impacts on glacier melt runoff production depend on the local regional climate maussion et al 2014 sakai fujita 2017 glacier melt runoff contribution in the himalaya also has strong seasonality immerzeel et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 azam et al 2021 it is suggested that the glacier runoff reduces during positive mass balance mb years because some water is stored on the glaciers while it increases during negative mb years as some water is released from long term glacier storage hock 2005 over the recent decades in situ glacier wide annual mb observations were started on several glaciers in bhutan china india and nepal yet the catchment wide runoff observations were often overlooked azam et al 2018 azam et al 2021 consequently the joint in situ observations of glacier wide annual mb and catchment wide runoff are not available from the recent decade therefore the relationship between in situ glacier wide annual mb and catchment wide runoff has been discussed for a limited number of glaciers using very sparse and short term data mostly from the pre 2000 period thayyen gergan 2010 the mb runoff relationship is not straightforward as a universal definition of glacier runoff is difficult to frame in the literature several definitions have been used depending on the authors expertise and research objectives the most commonly used definitions are 1 glacier runoff can be thought of as all the water coming out at the glacier terminus whether it is from glacier melt snow melt rain or any other source radić hock 2014 2 glacier runoff generated from the melting of glacier snow firn and ice cogley 2011 3 glacier runoff produced only from glacier firn and ice with the concept that all other components snow melt rain etc would exist in the basin even if the glaciers are gone 4 glacier runoff produced due to glacier net wastage kääb et al 2012 brun et al 2017 which can also be termed as glacier degraded runoff net water withdrawal from glacier storage at the end of the hydrological year and do not exist if the glacier mb is balanced or positive thayyen gergan 2010 the glacier runoff from definition 1 can directly be measured while the runoff in the other three scenarios can only be indirectly estimated modelled bringing in larger uncertainties in data sparse regions azam et al 2021 in the present study the long term relationships between glacier wide annual mb and catchment wide runoff have been analysed on two reference catchments dokriani bamak glacier dbg and chhota shigri glacier csg in the himalaya using the long term output from a simple glacio hydrological model since 1950 further the available short term in situ glacier mb and runoff data have been exploited to understand the mb runoff relationship in eight glacierized catchments of the himalaya glacier runoff definition 1 is used in the present study for investigating the mb runoff relationship however it is emphasized that glacier changes in any case will influence river runoff though the perceived impact would vary with the adopted glacier runoff definition 2 climate study area and existing data 2 1 climate and climatic regimes the himalayan climate is controlled by indian summer monsoon ism and western disturbances wds maussion et al 2014 ism strength decreases westward while wds weaken eastward along with the himalayan mountain range this spatio temporal distribution in precipitation and different river runoff composition lutz et al 2014 azam et al 2021 along the himalayan range provide three major glacio hydrological regimes 1 himalayan catchments 2 alpine catchments and 3 cold arid catchments thayyen gergan 2010 the himalayan catchments central and eastern catchments of the ganga and brahmaputra basins receive their major annual precipitation from ism during summer months and glacier meltwater contribution to the river runoff is maximum during the peak flow period in these catchments the glacier ablation period coincides with snow accumulation at high elevations thus the glaciers of himalayan catchments are called summer accumulation type glaciers maussion et al 2014 alpine catchments winter snow dominated regions south of the western himalaya and karakoram receive their major annual precipitation from winter snow falls from the wds therefore the glaciers in these catchments are called winter accumulation type glaciers maussion et al 2014 azam et al 2014a cold arid catchments of the ladakh north west of the western himalaya are extremely dry due to the decrepit reach of ism and wds therefore glaciers snow and permafrost melting are the major sources of water in these catchments thayyen gergan 2010 wani et al 2020 2 2 study area dbg catchment 30o51 n 78o49 e covering an area of 15 71 km2 is located in the upper ganga basin of the central himalaya garhwal range uttarakhand india fig 1 table

is partially debris covered 0 90 km2 13 of dbg area fig 2 the proglacial stream released is called din gad that contributes to the bhagirathi river of the ganga river system dbg catchment is one of the best studied catchments in the himalaya for mb meteorology and hydrology thayyen et al 2005 dobhal et al 2008 kumar et al 2014 pratap et al 2015 yadav et al 2019 the runoff station is located on the proglacial stream around 1 25 km below the glacier terminus thayyen et al 2005 csg catchment 32 28 n 77 52 e covering an area of 34 7 km2 3840 m a s l wagnon et al 2007 is located in the upper indus basin of the western himalaya lahaul valley himachal pradesh india fig 1 table 1 this catchment falls in the wds dominated region table 1 csg flows over a length of 9 km and covers an area of 15

the south and a peak devachan 6263 m a s l in the east fig 2 csg has extensively been studied for various aspects including mb dynamics ice thickness energy balance and hydrology wagnon et al 2007 azam et al 2014b azam et al 2016 ramsankaran et al 2018 mandal et al 2020 haq et al 2021 csg issues a single proglacial stream that drains to the chandra river a tributary of the indus river fig 2 fig 1 and table 1 present the location and characteristics of eight glacierized catchments dbg csg dunagiri tipra bank hamtah gara neh nar and shaune garang in the himalaya respectively where in situ glacier wide annual mb and catchment wide runoff are available and discussed in this study see section 2 3 all these catchments are from the indian himalaya and are concentrated in the indus and ganga basins the glacierized area varies from 14 to 45 at their runoff sites in different catchments these catchments are classified as monsoon catchments ism dominated regime and alpine catchments wds dominated alpine regime table 1 for ism dominated catchments the term monsoon catchment is preferred in this study instead of himalayan catchment as suggested previously thayyen gergan 2010 in order to avoid any confusion with the himalaya further it is more appropriate to use monsoon catchment for monsoon dominated catchments glacier wide mb and catchment wide runoff data are not yet available from the cold arid region 2 3 mb and runoff data during the 1970s and 80s the geological survey of india gsi was the primary organisation responsible for collecting the annual glacier wide mb and catchment wide runoff data on several catchments in the indian himalaya fig 1 shows the location of all these catchments where both mb and runoff data are available in september 1974 gsi conducted the first in situ annual glacier wide mb observations on the gara glacier western himalaya raina et al 1977 gradually gsi expanded the glacier monitoring network in different climatic regimes of the himalaya out of 26 observed glaciers in the himalaya during different time periods 1 10 years 11 glaciers have been monitored by the gsi azam et al 2018 the annual glacier wide mb measurements were often taken over september end to september end of a consecutive year using the traditional stake pit method østrem stanley 1969 however the available literature annual expedition reports or short abstracts sometimes lack the important details such as distribution of stakes accumulation methods pit vs snow firn coring snow firn density measurements map details and measurements dates which make it difficult to estimate the uncertainties in mb measurements azam et al 2018 gsi had generally developed integrated glacier monitoring programmes and therefore glacier runoff measurements were also carried out for a few catchments runoff measurements were often performed during the core monsoon period i e july to september the length of the observation period mainly depends on access roads are sometimes snow covered even up to june july and was not always uniform in some cases the observations were started in the first or second week of august gsi 2001 runoff sites were developed as close as possible to the glacier terminus in the case of neh nar glacier a rectangular weir was erected across the glacier stream gsi 2001 in shaune garang catchment the runoff was measured at ratia thatch where the basin area is 35 5 km2 with 26 glaciered cover nine glaciers above ratia thatch including shaune garang usually the runoff was measured by the standard area velocity method the stream velocity was measured either with the float method or current meter and the water levels were continuously measured by using an automatic water level recorder in turbulent streams runoff were measured by using the salt dilution method gsi 2001 hamtah neh nar and dunagiri glacier catchments were surveyed by gsi and mb and runoff data are available over 2000 2008 1978 1984 and 1985 1990 periods respectively gsi 2001 csg runoff measurements were performed from may through september and were available for 2010 2016 period azam et al 2019 the associated uncertainties in runoff measurements were not estimated in the original sources hence are not available for this study however focusing on the runoff measurements in similar conditions the uncertainties can be up to 25 of the measured runoff eeckman et al 2017 3 methods 3 1 climate data and bias correction glacio hydrological models for the dbg and csg catchments were forced with long term daily temperature and precipitation data from bias corrected era5 over 1950 2020 https cds climate copernicus eu home the data were downloaded at the nearest grids and bias corrected using available in situ meteorological data for dbg and csg catchments from previous studies verma et al 2018 azam et al 2016 mandal et al 2020 for the dbg catchment the daily temperature was bias corrected using linear regression equation between raw era5 and off glacier automatic weather station aws 3774 m a s l mean monthly data while for precipitation monthly factors were used between raw era5 and aws data verma et al 2018 the details of these bias corrections were given in azam srivastava 2020 for the csg catchment a linear regression equation developed between mean monthly temperature from raw era5 and an off glacier aws 4863 m a s l fig 2 data over 2009 2016 azam et al 2016 was applied to bias correct the era5 temperature series while monthly scale factors were applied to bias correct the era5 precipitation series using precipitation data from an automated rain snow gauge geonor t 200b installed at csg base camp fig 2 since 2012 3 2 glacio hydrological model long term glacier wide mb and catchment wide runoff on dbg monsoon regime and csg catchments alpine regime were reconstructed using a simple glacio hydrological model at daily temporal resolution including an accumulation module rain module and a temperature index melt module the reconstructions were already performed on dbg catchment over 1979 2018 azam srivastava 2020 and csg catchment over 1969 2016 azam et al 2019 using the same model and were extended over the 1950 2020 period in the present study the details about the model can be found in previous studies azam et al 2014b azam et al 2019 azam srivastava 2020 however a brief description of the model is as follows the daily snow accumulation sacc mm w e d 1 is computed at each 50 m elevation range of the catchment glacierized and non glacierized as 1 s acc p w h e n t t p 0 w h e n t t p where p and t denote daily precipitation mm and temperature oc respectively which are extrapolated at each 50 m elevation range applying the temperature and precipitation gradients respectively and tp is the threshold temperature oc for snow rain the daily rainfall r mm w e d 1 is computed at each 50 m elevation range of the catchment glacierized and non glacierized as 2 r 0 w h e n t t p p w h e n t t p the computed rainfall and all other computed runoff components mentioned hereafter are assumed to arrive at the catchment outlet at the end of each day the daily melt m mm w e d 1 from each 50 m elevation range is computed as 3 m s i d ddf s i d t t m w h e n t t m 0 w h e n t t m where ddf is the degree day factor mm d 1 c 1 which is different for different surface conditions snow s ice i and debris covered ice d and tm is the threshold temperature oc for melt mean altitudinal mb for each 50 m elevation range bz m w e is estimated using the accumulation and the ablation terms as 4 b z s acc m daily glacier wide mb ba m w e is calculated using the mean elevation mb as 5 b a a z b z a where az m2 and bz m w e are the 50 m elevation glacier area and mean altitudinal mb respectively and a is the total glacier area m2 annual glacier wide mb are calculated using daily mb for the hydrological year from 1 november through 31 october of next the year for dbg dobhal et al 2008 and hydrological year from 1 october through 30 september of the next year for csg wagnon et al 2007 the daily catchment wide snow melt runoff qs m3 s is computed as 6 q s m sg m sng where m sg and msng denote snow melt runoff from the glacierized and non glacierized areas respectively the daily catchment wide rainfall runoff qr m3 s is computed as 7 q r r g r ng where rg and rng denote rainfall runoff from the glacierized and non glacierized areas respectively the daily catchment wide total runoff q m3 s is computed as 8 q q s q r q i where qs qr and qi are the catchment wide snow melt runoff rainfall runoff and ice melt runoff clean and debris covered ice the overall structure of model is shown in fig 3 3 3 model parameters and extrapolation of climate data temperature plays an important role in mb runoff modelling as it determines the distribution of snowfall rain over the catchment temperature was extrapolated at every 50 m elevation range applying the mean monthly temperature lapse rates tlrs for dbg catchment estimated in azam srivastava 2020 while for csg catchment estimated using in situ temperature data recorded using automatic temperature sensors with solar radiations shields hobo u23 002 at csg base camp 3850 m a s l and aws site 4863 m a s l fig 2 over three hydrological years from october 2016 to september 2019 tp values of 0 7 c and 1 1 c were used corresponding to 70 80 and 60 70 relative humidity ranges for dbg and csg respectively at which 90 to 100 precipitation was considered as snow jennings et al 2018 the ddfs for snow clean ice and debris cover ice surfaces were adopted from previous studies for both dbg and csg catchments azam et al 2019 azam srivastava 2020 the glacio hydrological models were found to be highly sensitive to tm an unknown in the himalayan catchments engelhardt et al 2017 azam et al 2019 azam srivastava 2020 further precipitation distribution over the himalayan region is spatially non uniform due to valley specific precipitation gradients pg sakai et al 2015 immerzeel et al 2015 hence in this study the calibrated values of tm and pg have been adopted for the dbg catchment from azam srivastava 2020 while for the csg catchment these parameters were calibrated against the in situ mb and runoff data details are mentioned in table 2 precipitation at every 50 m elevation range was then extrapolated using calibrated pg for both the catchments the rainfall over the glacier was assumed to contribute directly to the runoff and refreezing of rain water or melt water was assumed negligible seasonal snow melt water refreezing is more than 30 of total melt in the himalaya saloranta et al 2019 stigter et al 2021 but ignored in this study as we have used a simplified model for more details about the parameters readers are invited to go through previous publications azam et al 2014b 2019 azam srivastava 2020 3 4 model calibration and validation the dbg model was forced with meteorological data from era5 copernicus climate change service c3s 2017 and calibrated validated using in situ data over the recent years azam srivastava 2020 therefore in this study no further calibration and validation were performed the csg model was forced with meteorological data from the indian meteorological department station at bhuntar town 50 km away other side of the orographic barrier and calibrated validated with the available in situ data azam et al 2019 in this study era5 bias corrected data was used for mb and runoff reconstructions in the csg catchment since 1950 hence new calibration and validation processes were performed for the model calibration the pg and tm parameters were varied over the plausible parameter s limits pg from 0 to 100 km 1 and tm from 4 c to 4 c in both the catchments the model run with minimized rmse root mean square error between modelled and in situ annual mb and monthly runoff were selected for both the catchments the selected run showed rmses of 0 28 m w e a 1 1993 1995 1998 2000 and 0 43 m w e a 1 2003 2012 between modelled and in situ mb and 0 79 106 m3 a 1 1994 1998 2000 and 1 22 106 m3 a 1 2010 2012 between modelled and in situ runoff for the dbg and csg catchments respectively fig 4 the model was validated against the snow line altitudes slas derived from model and satellite images the satellite derived slas were obtained for dbg from azam and srivastava 2020 and for csg from chandrasekharan et al 2018 the modelled slas showed a good agreement with satellite derived slas for both dbg and csg catchments with rmses of 157 and 156 m respectively fig 4 another validation was performed using modelled and in situ monthly runoff with rmse of 1 11 106 m3 a 1 1997 1998 from singh et al 2006 and 1 66 106 m3 a 1 2013 2015 from azam et al 2019 for dbg and csg catchments respectively multiple criteria calibration validation has been suggested in azam et al 2021 for reducing the equifinality problem in the hydrological models in line we have used multiple datasets for model calibration mb and runoff and validation runoff and slas in the present study on both the catchments to check the model performance nash sutcliffe efficiency test nash and sutcliffe 1970 was also performed this test is described in equation 9 9 e 1 i 1 n q o q m 2 i 1 n q m ǭ 2 where e is the efficiency of the model qo and qm are the in situ and modelled runoff respectively for a particular year and ǭ is the mean in situ runoff during the period of consideration e ranges between 1 to with e 1 being the favourable value efficiencies of 0 85 and 0 81 between in situ and modelled runoff for dbg and csg catchments respectively suggest a good performance of the model 3 5 uncertainty estimation to estimate the uncertainties in the reconstructed mb and runoff the model was rerun by changing the input parameters one by one within the plausible ranges and keeping all other input model parameters as calibrated the minimum and maximum values of ddf for ice snow and debris covered ice for dbg and csg catchments were taken from azam and srivastava 2020 and azam et al 2019 respectively for tlrs the upper and lower uncertainty bounds were estimated as the mean monthly standard deviations after eliminating the seasonality in monthly tlrs the uncertainties in pg tm and tp were unknown therefore to get the upper and lower values they were changed by 10 and 10 respectively from their original calibrated values table 3 all these parametric uncertainties were added by applying the error propagation law to compute the total uncertainties in mb and runoff the mean annual uncertainties for mb were estimated to be 0 35 and 0 28 m w e a 1 for dbg and csg catchments respectively while the uncertainties for runoff were the same with a value of 0 01 106 m3 a 1 for both the catchments tlr and tm contributed maximum uncertainty to mb estimates over dbg catchment while ddfs and ddfi to csg catchment table 3 the glacier and catchment hypsometries fig 2 were manually delineated from cnes airbus data 10 07 2017 at google earth platform azam and srivastava 2020 for dbg catchment and using a digital elevation model developed exploiting pléiades stereo pair 18 08 2014 azam et al 2016 for csg catchment in the present study static glacier surfaces have been assumed for the mb and runoff reconstructions on both the glaciers the estimated area shrinkage rates were very low on dbg 0 2 a 1 over 1962 2007 dobhal and mehta 2010 and csg 0 01 a 1 over 1980 2010 pandey and venkataraman 2013 therefore the model uncertainties related to the static area assumption were expected to be much smaller than the already computed uncertainties hence ignored in addition to these uncertainties the static area assumption also gives uncertainties due to temperature changes at each elevation range resulting from glacier thickness changes not included in the modelling scheme a previous study found that these uncertainties were very small compared to total computed uncertainty in mb on csg azam et al 2014b thus also ignored in our study another source of model uncertainty could be from avalanching snow blowing or snow drift there are very limited studies models that involve these processes azam et al 2021 in langtang catchment 360 km2 central himalaya nepal avalanche contribution was 5 to the runoff ragettli et al 2015 dbg and csg are the benchmark glaciers catchments that were selected carefully for long term mb and runoff studies wagnon et al 2007 dobhal et al 2008 an ice flow modelling study investigated the role of avalanches on several glaciers and reported that dbg and csg are not receiving significant avalanche accumulation as compared to the annual mb laha et al 2017 given that both the catchments are relatively less affected by avalanching we assumed that its role is insignificant azam et al 2019 azam and srivastava 2020 another source of uncertainty could be from sublimation and other wind driven ablation processes that can be significant on himalayan glaciers but cannot be resolved in simple temperature index models stigter et al 2018 azam et al 2021 3 6 glacier mb runoff relationship concept glacier mb runoff relationship can simply be described by the following equation cuffey paterson 2010 10 r g a g p g e g b a where rg is annual glacier wide runoff ag is glacier area pg and eg are annual precipitation and evaporation on from glacier surface and ba is annual glacier wide mb groundwater fluxes and changes of stored water within the glacier are assumed negligible here for a steady state ba 0 glacier wide runoff corresponding to annual precipitation and evaporation over the glacier can be defined as mass balanced runoff ag pg eg in other situations ba positive or negative the runoff is therefore imbalanced runoff the imbalanced runoff from negative glacier wide mb ba 0 can also be defined as glacier degraded runoff thayyen gergan 2010 if the glacier disappears the catchment would still release certain runoff a p e and changes in this runoff would solely depend on the precipitation and evaporation during negative mb years in addition to balanced runoff perennial glacier storage also generates glacier degraded runoff that results in increased glacier melt runoff on the other hand during positive mb years glacier melt runoff decreases as some snow is accumulated on the glacier hock 2005 on mountain valley glaciers this mb runoff relationship more runoff with more negative mb may not always be true because of two major reasons 1 glacier catchments are not completely glacierized and there would always be some runoff as a result of precipitation and evaporation over non glacierized parts of the catchment contributing to the total runoff at the glacier terminus and 2 on the ground runoff is generally measured downstream of the glacier terminus further increasing the impact of non glacierized parts on runoff therefore in the case of mountain valley glaciers the runoff r at glacier snout or downstream runoff site can be defined as 11 r r g r ng a g p g e g b a a ng p ng e ng where ang is the non glacierized area at glacier catchment outlet and rng png and eng are runoff precipitation and evaporation from the non glacierized area respectively this is a simplified runoff equation and ignores all the sub surface water fluxes as well as avalanche snow blowing and refreezing processes 4 results 4 1 catchment wide runoff the mean annual catchment wide runoff were 0 13 0 01 106 m3 a 1 and 0 14 0 01 106 m3 a 1 from dbg and csg catchments over 1950 2020 respectively fig 5 the year 2012 13 and 1993 94 showed maximum annual runoff of 0 17 0 01 106 m3 and 0 19 0 02 m w e while the year 1964 65 and 2000 01 showed similar minimum annual runoff of 0 08 0 01 106 m3 for dbg and csg respectively fig 5 fig 5 shows the mean monthly evolution of glacier melt snow melt rainfall and total runoff at both the catchments runoff in the winter months october to march april were negligible in both the catchments runoff generation started in march with the inception of snow melt in the dbg catchment and in april in the csg catchment fig 5 both catchments received rainfall runoff over may october and glacier ice melt over june october snow melt runoff peaked in july while august experienced the maximum glacier ice melt and maximum rainfall runoff that resulted in maximum total catchment wide runoff in august in dbg catchment and in july in csg catchment fig 5 the glacier ice melt contribution was almost same with 21 to the total catchment wide runoff in both dbg and csg catchments however snow melt and rainfall runoff contributions were quite different dbg catchment generated 41 of rainfall runoff 15 from glacierized and 26 from un glacierized area and 38 of snow melt runoff 17 from glacierized and 21 from un glacierized area conversely csg catchment produced only 10 of rainfall runoff 5 from glacierized and 5 from un glacierized area and 69 of snow melt runoff 34 from glacier snow melt and 35 from snow melt from un glacierized area thus the total runoff was dominated by rainfall in the dbg catchment and snow melt in the csg catchment fig 5 in accordance with monsoon and alpine regimes respectively 4 2 glacier wide mb and annual mass turn over the mean modelled annual mb were 0 09 0 35 m w e a 1 and 0 12 0 28 m w e a 1 with cumulative mass wastage of 6 33 m w e and 8 61 m w e on dbg and csg over 1950 2020 respectively the year 1974 75 and 1950 51 showed maximum annual mb of 1 24 0 32 m w e and 1 03 0 20 m w e while the year 2015 16 and 2000 01 showed minimum annual mb of 0 95 0 40 m w e and 1 23 0 33 m w e for dbg and csg respectively fig 6 summer mass balance smb have been considered from may to october and april to september while winter mass balance smb have been considered from november to april and october to march on dbg and csg catchments respectively modelled seasonal mb ranged from 0 29 to 1 48 m w e a 1 and 0 45 to 1 73 m w e a 1 for winter and 1 68 to 0 12 w e a 1 and 1 98 to 0 08 w e a 1 for summer on dbg and csg respectively fig 6 though the mean annual wastage was almost same on both the glaciers the annual mass turnover on dbg was smaller with a value of 1 83 m w e a 1 corresponding to a mean winter and summer mb of 0 87 and 0 96 m w e a 1 respectively compared to csg which had a slightly higher annual mass turnover of 2 04 m w e a 1 corresponding to the mean winter and summer mb of 0 96 and 1 08 m w e a 1 respectively fig 6 although the difference in annual mass turnovers on both the glaciers is small it is statistically different p 0 005 and might be linked with the climate regimes dbg in the monsoon regime receives a significant amount of accumulation during the summer monsoon period that limits the mass wastage during the peak melting season july september azam srivastava 2020 csg in the alpine regime receives its major accumulation during winter months while summer accumulation was very limited mandal et al 2020 consequently has stronger seasonality of accumulation and ablation that result in a higher mass turnover compared to dbg 4 3 glacier wide mb and catchment wide runoff patterns over the last two five decades several studies have modelled the glacier mb and runoff at the glacier to basin scales in the himalaya azam et al 2018 azam et al 2021 present reconstructed glacier wide mb and catchment wide runoff in dbg and csg catchments since 1950 are the longest known reconstructions in the himalaya and allow this study to investigate the mb and runoff patterns over the last seven decades three periods were arbitrarily defined in the present study period i 1950 1975 period ii 1976 2000 and period iii 2001 2020 table 4 for each period the glacier wide mb and catchment wide runoff were estimated using annual data period i 1950 1975 showed positive mb on both dbg 0 16 m w e a 1 and csg 0 12 m w e a 1 corresponding to lowest summer mb on both the glaciers and highest and moderate winter mb on dbg and csg respectively table 4 period ii 1976 2000 experienced moderate mass loss 0 21 m w e a 1 with the highest summer and moderate winter mb on dbg and close to balance mb on csg 0 11 m w e a 1 with moderate summer and highest winter mb table 3 period iii 2001 2020 showed the highest mass wastage on both dbg 0 26 m w e a 1 and csg 0 45 m w e a 1 corresponding to moderate and highest summer mb and lowest winter mb on both the glaciers respectively table 4 in agreement with increasing mass loss over the three selected periods catchment wide runoff also increased systematically from 0 11 to 0 14 106 m3 a 1 in dbg and 0 13 to 0 14 106 m3 a 1 in csg catchment table 4 on dbg the mb over period i was statistically different than period ii p 0 001 and iii p 0 001 while the mb over period ii and iii were statistically similar p 0 33 conversely on csg the mb over period i and ii were statistically similar p 0 08 and the mb over period i and iii p 0 001 and period ii and iii p 0 02 were statistically different the runoff over period i ii and iii were statistically different on dbg p 0 05 while runoff over period i was statistically different than period ii p 0 01 and period iii p 0 04 and period ii and iii were statistically same p 0 27 on csg though the arbitrarily selected periods were not always statistically different for mb and runoff but provide a simplified analysis of the 70 years mb and runoff series and an inter comparison of dbg and csg as well as other studies mostly focusing on pre and post 2000 periods the glacier wide mb records in situ reconstructed or geodetic are often available post 1975 with very limited knowledge of glacier behaviour before 1975 azam et al 2018 previously a possible close to balance state was proposed over the 1990s on both dbg and csg as well as on mera glacier central himalaya nepal shea et al 2015 azam srivastava 2020 during period ii 1976 2000 the reconstructed moderate and close to balance mb wastage on dbg and csg respectively is in agreement with the suggested short term steady state over the 1990s however with the present 7 decade long reconstruction it is clear that both the glaciers gained some mass during period i 1951 1975 the accelerated mass wastage over period iii 2001 2020 observed on dbg and csg are also in agreement with several remote sensing as well as modelling studies that suggest a rapid post 2000 mass wastage bhattacharya et al 2016 maurer et al 2019 mandal et al 2020 the present study together with other studies suggest a slightly positive mb period 1950 1975 a near steady state 1976 2000 and an accelerated wastage post 2020 on dbg and csg however given the large uncertainties in our study as well as other studies compared here shea et al 2015 bhattacharya et al 2016 maurer et al 2019 azam srivastava 2020 these inferred mb states should be viewed with caution 5 discussion 5 1 glacier mb runoff relationship in himalaya short term historical data in dbg catchment the mb runoff relationship was discussed using four years 1994 1998 2000 of observed annual mb and mean daily summer runoff fig 7 a and it was surmised that higher catchment wide runoff were associated with less negative glacier wide mb while lower runoff with higher negative mb thayyen gergan 2010 though based on very limited data this relationship higher catchment wide runoff with lower negative or positive mb and vice versa was thought to be a characteristic of the monsoon catchment regime where monsoon coincides with peak glacier melt runoff this idea was further propagated by some other studies singh et al 2016 kumar et al 2016 all possible in situ data from the literature table 1 has been collected and carefully investigated for the mb runoff relationship on eight glacierized catchments in the himalaya fig 7 dbg gara neh nar and hamtah catchments showed higher runoff at catchment outlets with less negative glacier wide mb conversely tipra bank dunagiri and csg showed higher runoff with more negative mb shaune garang catchment showed no relationship between glacier wide mb and catchment wide runoff fig 7b at the outlet of shaune garang glacier catchment alpine catchment regime the runoff comes from 9 glaciers including shaune garang table 1 that is compared with the annual mb of shaune garang glacier indeed in the same climatic settings the mb behaviour of neighbouring glaciers may be different depending on the local topography and debris cover sherpa et al 2017 therefore the comparison of catchment wide runoff including runoff from 9 glaciers with annual glacier wide mb of shaune garang glacier is questionable further neh nar and hamtah glaciers in the alpine catchment regime showed higher runoff with less negative mb while tipra bank and dunagiri glaciers in the monsoon catchment regime showed higher runoff with more negative mb fig 7 these examples cannot be explained with the previous explanation of the monsoon catchment regime based on the dbg catchment thayyen gergan 2010 as already discussed section 2 3 the uncertainties in mb and runoff measurements are mostly unknown strong negative mb 1 43 m w e yr 1 during 2000 2012 on hamtah glacier was three times more negative than the estimated geodetic mb 0 45 0 16 m w e yr 1 1999 2011 vincent et al 2013 csg mb series was the only series which was systematically corrected for area changes and validated against the geodetic mb azam et al 2016 in fact except for csg catchment alpine catchment regime the mb runoff relationships were very weak and insignificant in all other catchments fig 7 such insignificant relationships together with unknown uncertainties in the measurements make it very difficult to interpret the mb runoff relationship in the himalaya using the available short term in situ runoff and mb data glaciohydrological models calibrated using short term in situ observations provide an alternative to understand the long term mb runoff relationship however the length of in situ observations plays a critical role for the model calibration therefore in situ measurements should be continued for a long time on a few selected glacierized catchments in the himalaya azam 2021 5 2 glacier mb runoff relationship in studied reference catchments long term modelled data the long term relationship between mb and runoff was investigated using the modelled annual mb and runoff data section 4 2 and 4 1 dbg catchment in the monsoon regime showed a weak but significant correlation r 0 30 p 0 02 with increasing catchment wide runoff corresponding to more negative mb and vice versa fig 8 a the correlation was average in the csg catchment r 0 47 p 0 001 fig 8b unlike associated challenges with in situ observations of the runoff section 5 1 model output also permits to estimate the glacier wide runoff the correlations between annual glacier wide mb and annual glacier wide runoff on dbg r 0 53 p 0 001 and csg r 0 75 p 0 001 were stronger compared to catchment wide runoff fig 8 stronger relationships with increasing catchment wide runoff corresponding to more negative mb and vice versa of annual glacier wide mb with glacier wide runoff compared to catchment wide runoff are expected as modelled glacier wide runoff does not involve the non glacierized runoff fig 8 which is often rainfall or snow melt that has no contribution in the modelled mb in line another long term model based study on 6 glaciers of nuuk region of the greenland ice sheet alpine regime also showed higher annual glacier wide runoff accompanying more negative mb during 1960 2012 van as et al 2014 singh et al 2016 though the glacierized areas are the same in dbg 44 6 and csg 44 7 catchments table 1 the weaker mb runoff relationships in the dbg catchment compared to csg catchment is probably linked to their climatic regimes to further investigate the mb runoff relationship and to understand the functioning of both the catchments the inter relationships among mb annual winter and summer runoff glacierized non glacierized and catchment wide and climatic parameters annual winter and summer temperatures and precipitations were investigated by developing the correlation matrix fig 9 as expected annual and seasonal mb showed negative correlations with the annual and seasonal temperatures in both the catchments conversely catchment wide runoff showed positive correlations with seasonal and annual temperatures fig 9 annual mb on dbg showed moderate correlation with winter precipitation r 0 64 but no significant relationship was found with summer precipitation while annual mb on csg showed moderate correlations with winter r 0 60 as well as summer r 0 61 precipitations on the other hand catchment wide runoff in dbg showed weak correlation r 0 24 with winter precipitation and strong correlation r 0 85 with summer precipitation while in csg catchment runoff showed no significant correlation with summer or winter precipitations fig 9 this analysis figs 8 and 9 clearly indicates that the hydrology of the dbg catchment is mainly controlled by the summer precipitation while hydrology in the csg catchment is mainly controlled by the glacier wide annual mb the different control of hydrology is because of the different precipitation regimes in both the catchments dbg in the monsoon catchment regime receives monsoonal rainfall and snowfalls that often melt quickly due to high summer temperature that make up a significant runoff contribution therefore the catchment hydrology is mainly controlled by the summer precipitation conversely csg in the alpine catchment regime receives most of the precipitation through snowfall during winter months that contributes to the glacier mb and then during summer months glacier melt snow and ice is generated that contributes to the catchment runoff hence providing a strong relationship between glacier mb and catchment runoff however for some specific years the higher catchment wide runoff was found to be associated with higher precipitation in both the catchments fig 6 during these specific years dbg 1983 2010 2013 csg 1956 1959 1988 the catchments received much higher precipitations than average fig 6 that resulted in a direct contribution as rainfall or snowfall during summer that melts quickly due to higher summer temperatures providing higher runoff at catchment outlet this phenomenon was already discussed on csg azam et al 2019 contrasting to the previously suggested mb runoff relationship in the monsoon catchment regime thayyen gergan 2010 present analysis based on long term data shows that the catchment wide runoff increases with more negative mb and vice versa in agreement with the concept of hock 2005 however in line with thayyen gergan 2010 the analysis also suggests that the hydrology of the dbg in the monsoon catchment regime is mainly controlled by the summer precipitation in the csg catchment higher annual and seasonal temperatures were negatively correlated with annual and seasonal precipitations respectively this is probably due to the moisture holding capacity of the air parcel at higher temperature hornberger et al 2014 in line the winter temperature was negatively correlated with winter precipitation in the dbg catchment while annual and summer temperatures showed positive correlations with annual and summer precipitations fig 9 we could not find any concrete reason for these positive correlations but these may be linked with monsoon dynamics which is not yet clearly understood duan et al 2004 mishra 2015 5 3 glacier buffer system glacier degraded runoff glaciers and snow cover act as an important buffer system for downstream rivers by storing snow during accumulation periods whereas producing glacier snow melt in ablation periods in order to understand the relative importance of the glacier buffer system in the monsoon and alpine catchment regimes of the himalaya the glacier degraded runoff from dbg and csg catchments are computed using the modelled annual mb data thayyen gergan 2010 fig 6 indeed the glacier degraded runoff contribution to catchment runoff is zero for balanced or positive mb years fig 6 runoff from non glacierized regions in both the catchments is strongly and moderately correlated with annual precipitation of dbg r 0 93 and csg r 0 52 catchments fig 9 respectively and therefore during dry years non glacierized runoff drastically reduced fig 6 in such dry years the corresponding negative annual mb on both the glaciers provided additional glacier degraded runoff to the catchment stream fig 6 for highly negative mb years glacier degraded runoff can be quite high for instance glacier degraded runoff were as high as 13 2015 16 and 38 1999 2000 and 2000 2001 of total catchment wide runoff on dbg and csg catchments respectively fig 6 however the mean annual glacier degraded runoff was 3 for negative mb years 6 and 10 for negative mb years 17 of total catchment wide runoff at dbg and csg catchments over 1951 2020 respectively almost three fold higher contribution of glacier degraded runoff in the csg catchment compared to dbg catchment confirms the control of glacier wide mb on csg catchment hydrology and suggests that the glacier buffer system is more important in the alpine catchment regime compared to the monsoon catchment regime where precipitation mainly controls the catchment wide runoff section 5 2 further more glacier degraded runoff from csg compared to dbg with almost similar mean annual mb section 4 2 again suggests the high mass turn over on csg compared to dbg section 4 2 5 4 hydrological years daily mean glacier wide mb and catchment wide runoff the hydrological year for glacier mb is thought to be starting from the end of summer when the glacier wide mb is normally close to balance following the previous studies dobhal et al 2008 wagnon et al 2007 the glacier wide mb and runoff in this study were computed for the hydrological year from 1 november to 31 october for the following year on dbg and hydrological year from 1 october to 30 september of the following year on csg section 3 2 in this section the suitability of aforesaid hydrological years on both the glaciers is discussed fig 10 shows the daily mean glacier wide mb and catchment wide runoff for dbg and csg for all julian days starting from 1 october to 30 september of the next year estimated from modelled daily mb and runoff data over 1950 2020 on both dbg and csg the daily mean glacier wide mb are positive during winter months october to march and start decreasing over pre monsoon april may and become negative during summer monsoon months june september the transition from positive to negative daily mean mb takes place in the month of may on dbg and in june on csg fig 10 on csg in accordance with the alpine regime winter accumulation type glacier the daily mean glacier wide mb showed a clear pattern of accumulation 1 october to 31 may and ablation 1 june to 30 september justifying the selection of hydrological year from 1 october to 30 september while on dbg daily mean glacier wide mb subdued as soon as the monsoon arrives in june that probably provided snow accumulation at high altitudes and rain at lower altitudes with the concurrence of melt season hence reduced daily mean mb at glacier wide scale with the progression of the monsoon in september when the temperatures are low hence low melting the daily mean glacier wide mb even become positive however as soon as the monsoon retreats the daily mean glacier wide mb again become slightly negative in the month of october further in november the temperature is very low and the glacier experiences positive daily mb the daily mean glacier wide mb pattern on dbg confirms the selection of hydrological year from 1 november to 31 october the daily mean catchment wide runoff hydrographs in both the catchments indicate negligible runoff in winter months from october to mid april while almost all runoff is produced in the summer months from mid april to end september with a peak in early august fig 10 the hydrographs in both the catchments show a sharp rising limb with the progression of the summer season however the rising limb of dbg hydrograph is subdued at the arrival of monsoon around the end of june and again shows a sharp rise from mid august to end august before an abrupt decrease in september fig 10 though the runoff commencing dates are different from mid april in dbg catchment and from may in csg catchment both the catchments show a simultaneous reduction in runoff in september the reduction in runoff at the arrival of monsoon around end of june followed by a sharp rise in runoff from mid august in the dbg catchment is probably because of monsoonal snow falls that accumulate in june july and then due to highest temperatures of august produces strong melt runoff hence a sharp rise the present study based on a temperature index melt model cannot investigate the physical process explaining the impact of monsoonal snow falls on runoff generation however previous studies using surface energy balance models suggested that these summer monsoon snowfall events increase the glacier surface albedo hence reducing the energy available at glacier surface for melting in the peak ablation period and control the melt production fujita 2008 mölg et al 2014 azam et al 2014a 6 conclusion understanding of the mb runoff relationship is weak in the himalaya due to limited in situ glacier mb and runoff measurements a simplified glacio hydrological model is used to reconstruct the long term mb and runoff on two small glacierized catchments of dbg and csg having similar glacier cover dbg falls in the monsoon regime while csg is in the alpine regime of the himalaya the modelled mb and runoff data since 1950 are used to understand the mb patterns as well as mb runoff relationships in both the catchments over the last seven decades dbg and csg show similar limited mass wastage with mean annual glacier wide mb of 0 09 0 35 m w e a 1 and 0 12 0 28 m w e a 1 respectively both the glaciers show positive mb over 1950 1975 and moderate mass loss over 1976 2000 followed by an accelerated mass wastage post 2000 though the mb are similar the mass turn over on csg is slightly higher than dbg the mean catchment wide runoff are also almost similar 0 13 0 01 106 m3 a 1 and 0 14 0 01 106 m3 a 1 from dbg and csg catchments respectively over 1950 2020 the catchment wide runoff is dominated by rainfall in the dbg catchment and snow melt in the csg catchment in accordance with monsoon and alpine regimes respectively short term historical mb and runoff data available from eight glacierized catchments do not show any significant mb runoff relationship except for csg catchment such insignificant relationships and associated unknown uncertainties in in situ measurements do not allow interpretation of the mb runoff relationship in the himalaya using short term in situ data the long term modelled mb and runoff data on both dbg and csg catchments suggests that the higher catchment wide runoff correspond to more negative mb and vice versa in agreement to hock 2005 this is in contrast to the previously suggested mb runoff relationship based on very limited in situ data on dbg thayyen gergan 2010 present long term analysis suggests that the hydrology of the dbg catchment is mainly dominated by the summer precipitation while in csg catchment it is mainly controlled by the glacier wide annual mb the mb runoff relationship being different with the adopted glacier runoff definition suggests that the relationship depends on the relative amount of glacierized and non glacierized runoff in a catchment however it is also stressed that any change in glacier mb will influence the river runoff irrespective of the adopted glacier runoff definition the mean annual glacier degraded runoff are 3 and 10 of total catchment wide runoff at dbg and csg catchments respectively over 1951 2020 in dry years the corresponding negative annual mb on both the glaciers provided additional glacier degraded runoff to the catchment stream higher glacier degraded runoff in the csg catchment compared to dbg catchment confirms the control of glacier wide mb on catchment hydrology and also suggests that the glacier buffer system is more critical in the alpine catchment regime compared to the monsoon catchment regime where precipitation mainly controls the catchment wide runoff the mean daily glacier wide mb series also confirms the hydrological years used on both the glaciers for in situ mb measurements declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

3349,groundwater extraction influences water redistribution and hydrothermal processes which significantly affect the water cycle and the sustainable development of the economy and environment in this study a high resolution 1 km land surface model that considered groundwater lateral flow and groundwater extraction was used to investigate the impacts of groundwater extraction on hydrological process simulations with and without groundwater extraction were conducted for the beijing tianjin hebei bth region for the period 2000 2012 the comparison of the simulated results and measurements from water wells automatic weather stations and satellite observations demonstrated the good performance of the model our results showed that groundwater extraction deepened the groundwater table depth by approximately 0 5 2 m across the plains and rapidly reduced terrestrial water storage tws exceeding 24 cm per unit area from 2000 to 2012 both surface 2 cm and deep 100 cm soil moisture showed an increase of 0 01 0 02 m3 m 3 due to groundwater extraction used for irrigation groundwater extraction changed the water and energy budgets leading to a significant cooling effect in the irrigated areas of bth the latent heat flux showed an increase of 30 w m 2 across the plains caused by the long term exploitation the surface soil moisture and latent heat flux increased mainly within the growing season due to farmland irrigation the reduction in tws was mainly due to the combined effects of over exploitation and climate while the contribution of extraction could not be ignored across the bth region keywords groundwater extraction hydrological process beijing tianjin hebei region land surface model 1 introduction the increase in population the expansion of irrigated area and economic development have driven a nearly eight fold increase in global water demand during the past 100 years vörösmarty et al 2000 wisser et al 2010 pokhrel et al 2012 haddeland et al 2014 wada et al 2016 to meet the increasing water demand humans have extracted a large amount of groundwater global groundwater extraction has nearly doubled from 570 billion to 1 000 billion tons between 2000 and 2007 pokhrel et al 2013 due to rapid urbanization and intensive agricultural irrigation china has extracted vast amounts of groundwater over the past few years according to the china water resources bulletin 111 7 billion tons of groundwater were extracted and the six northern regions including the songhua liaohe haihe yellow and huaihe river basins and the northwest area basin alone accounted for 98 93 billion tons in 2014 on the north china plain groundwater extraction has increased particularly rapidly with an average annual groundwater extraction of 3 9 billion tons in the 1960 s and 20 billion tons in the 21st century li et al 2013 excessive groundwater extraction often leads to water depletion that may affect ecological and hydrological processes konikow and kendy 2005 leng et al 2015 for example excessive groundwater extraction lowers groundwater tables reduces soil water content affects the absorption by vegetation roots and may even destroy the ecosystem wada et al 2013 wada and heinrich 2013 zeng et al 2017a extraction of groundwater for irrigation increases local latent heat flux and reduces sensible heat flux affecting local and regional climate zhang et al 2007 zou et al 2015 zeng et al 2016 zeng et al 2017b moreover unreasonable exploitation and use of groundwater also lead to a number of environmental problems such as land subsidence soil salinization reduction of wetlands seawater intrusion and groundwater pollution sundell et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to fully understand and assess the hydrological effects caused by groundwater extraction at the same time it also promotes the search for a balance between the regulation of water resources and the sustainable development of natural ecosystems however information regarding groundwater extraction is limited and extensive observations for monitoring groundwater extraction are lacking moreover it is not easy to separate out the effects of human activities and climate change in observations in recent decades multiple land surface and hydrological models have been developed to study the impacts of groundwater extraction on hydrological and ecological processes haddeland et al 2006 döll et al 2012 zou et al 2015 zeng et al 2016 zeng et al 2017b for example hanasaki et al 2008 incorporated reservoir operation and human water withdrawal schemes into a global water resources model to evaluate global water availability and use at a subannual timescale pokhrel et al 2012 developed a land surface model that considered a human water regulation module and found that irrigation increased latent heat flux by up to 50 w m 2 in the summer zeng et al 2017b used an earth system model incorporated with a groundwater extraction scheme and found that the increase in precipitation in the north china plain is related to increasing evapotranspiration caused by irrigation most of the above studies have been carried out at the global scale at regional scales a higher resolution modeling framework is needed to simulate and predict the impacts of water extraction on hydrological processes wood et al 2011 wada et al 2016 to better represent water and energy heterogeneity at regional scales groundwater lateral flow cannot be ignored in high resolution simulations ji et al 2017 some studies have shown that groundwater lateral flow can replenish the groundwater depletion caused by excessive exploitation especially for plains the recharge efficiency can reach up to 40 zeng et al 2016 wang et al 2020 this shows that anthropogenic activities are inseparable from the lateral flow processes zeng et al 2016 the region of interest in this study is beijing tianjin hebei bth fig 1 which is a city cluster in northern china with beijing as its core as an ecological barrier in the north china plain bth is of great significance to the protection of the human living environment zheng and cao 2015 cao et al 2016 the rapid development of agriculture and industry has resulted in great water demand based on the china water resources bulletin groundwater accounted for 61 26 and 80 of the total water supply in beijing tianjin and hebei in 2009 respectively feng et al 2013 excessive extraction and consumption of groundwater have led to severe groundwater depletion over the past decades with a depletion of 8 3 1 1 km3 year 1 during 2003 2010 feng et al 2018 long et al 2020 this groundwater depletion can be detected using the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data feng et al 2013 2018 huang et al 2015 pan et al 2017 zhong et al 2019 previous studies have evaluated the influences of climate change and human water use on water storage in bth using hydrological or land surface models li et al 2017 xia et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 these works were mainly focused on changes in the groundwater level and water storage caused by human water withdrawal however the impact of groundwater extraction on water and energy fluxes has not been considered thoroughly in addition the spatial resolution of the datasets and models used in previous studies is relatively coarse such as 0 5 0 5 grace mascon product used in zhong et al 2019 which is insufficient to provide local information and thus could not represent the water and energy heterogeneity making a comprehensive assessment of the human impacts more difficult the objective of this paper is to quantify and evaluate the impact of human groundwater withdrawal on terrestrial water and energy cycles in the bth region with high resolution simulations from a land surface model that

show the validation and evaluation we also discuss the advantages of the model and limitations and finally draw conclusions this provided a useful tool for water managers to investigate the human effects on hydrological process with more accurate information on regional water availability 2 domain of study the bth region is the political economic and cultural center of china extending from 36 03 n to 42 40 n and 113 27 e to 119 50 e and including hebei province beijing and tianjin with an area of 21 8000 km2 cai et al 2018 it is located in the southern part of the yanshan mountains in the eastern part of the taihang mountain and in the western part of the bohai rim the terrain rises from the southeast to the northwest fig 1a and the main land cover types include cropland woodland shrub and construction land with crop land accounting for the largest proportion quaternary strata are widely distributed in the bth according to the burial characteristics and hydraulic properties groundwater can be divided into four aquifers from top to bottom the first aquifer is shallow groundwater and the second to fourth layers are confined aquifers yang et al 2021 the bth region belongs to the littoral and semi arid climatic zone with four distinct seasons and nearly 70 of the rainfall occurring in summer feng et al 2013 annual precipitation is about 400 600 mm per year while less than 400 mm of rain falls in the plateau and hilly areas in the northwest of the bth liu et al 2002 due to a suitable environment human activities and agricultural production dominate the water consumption is concentrated on the plains which contains the main agricultural areas and cities agricultural irrigation depends largely on groundwater extraction and the amount of groundwater extraction in the bth region has doubled based on statistics of the water resources bulletin wrb the contradiction between water supply and demand in the bth is prominent the per capita volume of water resources in bth is less than 200 m3 calculated based on the administrative area which is less than one ninth of the national average liu and xia 2004 xia et al 2007 however the groundwater

taihang mountain and mainly from groundwater extraction for non irrigated water the proportion of industrial water was relatively large and mainly located in beijing tianjin and shijiazhuang 3 2 experimental design in this work two simulations were established from 2000 to 2012 to investigate the influence of hwr on the water and energy cycles two reasons led to the choice of the study period the first is that the statistical data of human water use from the water resources bulletin of tianjin and hebei are only available after 2000 the other is that the east route of the south to north water diversion project delivering water to tianjin began to operate in 2013 this has some effects on the hydrological cycle over the bth but our model did not take into consideration the south to north water diversion project therefore we used data from 2000 to 2012 the first simulation ltf included the glf module and the second simulation ltf gw considered both glf and hwr modules the spatial resolution of all simulations was set to 0 0083 1 km at the equator over the bth region and the time steps were 1800 s the atmospheric forcing dataset was obtained from the data assimilation and modeling center for tibetan multi spheres institute of tibetan plateau research chinese academy of sciences yang et al 2010 all simulations were run for 300 years by recycling the meteorological forcing with each configuration for example with and without the hwr module before the formal simulations to reach equilibrium we also used the equilibrium groundwater table depth obtained from fan et al 2013 as the initial value before the spin up in addition to match the surface parameters with the high resolution simulations we collected three datasets the first was the multi source integrated chinese land cover map available at a 1 km resolution ran et al 2012 the second data source was the soil characteristics database which was developed for use in the land surface modeling with a 1 km resolution shangguan et al 2013 the third dataset was the leaf area index with a 1 km resolution yuan et al 2011 then using these datasets we modified the land cover the percentage of clay and sand and the leaf area index in the surface data 3 3 validation data we collected data from water wells eddy covariance ec and automatic weather station aws systems to validate the performance of the model table 1 shows the validation data in this study the first dataset includes groundwater table depth observations in the year 2000 from 296 water wells which were provided by the ministry of water resources we also collected monthly groundwater table depth data for the years 2005 2012 at 17 stations from the geological environment monitoring institute of china geological survey in this study only the unconfined groundwater system was considered the groundwater well data used for validation come from unconfined groundwater wells we normalized the values of observed and simulated groundwater table depths to eliminate errors associated with the scale mismatch between the two values after standardization the variability of groundwater table depth was preserved the ec and aws data were from the multi scale surface flux and meteorological element observation dataset from the hai river basin jia et al 2012 liu et al 2013 the three stations are daxing station in the south of beijing miyun station in the northeast of beijing and guantao station in the southeast of hebei as shown in fig 1b other observation data applied in this study included tws derived from zhong et al 2019 that reconstructed tws for china based on precipitation and combined the grace csr rl06 and jpl rl06 mascon products which have been processed into a 0 25 0 25 resolution gridded format in addition grace tellus jpl rl05 mascon products with a spatial resolution of 1 1 landerer and swenson 2012 were used to validate the simulated results 4 results 4 1 validation before studying the effect of groundwater extraction on hydrological process and energy cycle we used a variety of observational data including groundwater table depth tws ground temperature heat fluxes and soil moisture to evaluate the model simulations fig 3 shows the comparison of observed groundwater table depth and the simulation results from ltf gw in 2000 in general ltf gw showed good performance in reproducing the spatial distribution and temporal changes of groundwater table depth the simulated groundwater table depth by ltf gw was much shallower fig 3b than the observations in fig 3a over the plains these biases occurred because the observations in 2000 included the effects of human activities in previous years and the model requires a warm up process for the simulation of the effects of human activities thus the simulated groundwater table depth is shallower the scatter plot of fig 3c shows good consistency between the simulations and observations the linear regression of observations and simulation results see fig 3c showed that the correlation coefficient was 0 76 the simulated groundwater table depth using ltf gw fit better with the observations the root mean square errors of ltf gw and ltf were 3 82 and 5 71 respectively the comparison of groundwater table depth between ltf gw simulations and observations from the wrb of hebei province further highlighted the advantages ltf gw after considering the hwr scheme the locations of simulated groundwater funnels caused by groundwater extraction are close to the locations provided by the wrb fig s1 the map of simulated groundwater table depth fig 3b showed shallow depths in the plains which is related to the water convergence after considering the glf these results emphasized the importance of including glf and groundwater extraction in the current hydrological modeling considering that the observation well is a single point and the simulated groundwater table depth represents the average value of a grid wada et al 2016 large deviations may occur in the direct comparison between observations and simulations the main point of the validation was to evaluate the performance of the model in simulating groundwater dynamics therefore we compared the normalized groundwater table depth time series to avoid the influence of systematic deviations on the analysis results fig 4 compared the monthly groundwater table depth from the ltf gw with observations results indicate that the ltf gw captured the deepening trends of groundwater table depth in bth while the ltf was less consistent with observations fig s2 good agreement was obtained from 2005 to 2010 for most stations including major groundwater extraction regions such as shijiazhuang handan and southeast of beijing the correlation coefficient was greater than 0 8 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse was close to 1 however the biases were relatively large even with a high correlation coefficient for stations in langfang in hebei province imprecisely prescribed irrigated areas and uncertainty in the match between observations and simulations may have caused the discrepancy in the results to show the improvement of ltf gw after considering the hwr scheme we compared the simulated tws anomalies twsa with grace satellite data the spatial distribution of the temporal correlation coefficients between the simulated monthly twsa and the grace data over the period 2002 2012 is shown in fig 5 the model that included human groundwater extraction was able to capture the seasonal changes in tws for most regions fig 5b fig 5c compares the time series of the mean monthly twsa of both simulations ltf and ltf gw and observations the trend of twsa simulated by the ltf gw was 0 02 cm month 1 which was much closer to the trend indicated by the grace data 0 1 cm month 1 conversely the trend of twsa predicted by the ltf was 0 07 cm month 1 which is consistent with the annual variation trend of precipitation 0 08 mm month 1 at the beginning of the study period 2002 2006 the twsa trend simulated by ltf gw 0 03 cm month 1 was consistent with the observation 0 05 cm month 1 the twsa trend simulated by ltf gw was less than the observation which was mainly associated with the uncertainty in the grace data processing the resolution of grace data is 0 25 and the resolution of ltf gw is 1 km which will cause uncertainty during spatial averaging as shown in fig 5c moreover surface water use accounting for 22 26 of total water use also affects twsa which was not considered the comparisons displayed in fig 5 illustrate the rationality of including hwr in the model furthermore we compared the simulated results with in site observations from the ec and aws systems fig 6 shows the comparison of the simulated daily hydrological variables and energy fluxes from the ltf gw and ltf with daily observations from daxing guantao and miyun stations during 2010 to clarify the comparison of the results precipitation from the meteorological forcing data and observations are shown in fig 6a 6c fig 6d 6f show that the simulated ground temperature from both simulations matched well with the observations for guantao and daxing stations where groundwater extraction was large due to farmland irrigation the model performance was improved when human water use was considered the results from ltf gw simulation and the observations were almost equal from may to october this improvement was particularly evident for simulated heat fluxes during the growing season from april to october fig 6g 6l for miyun station the effect of groundwater extraction was less obvious the heat fluxes were hardly affected because of forest land cover and less groundwater use from fig 6m 6o both simulations underestimated the magnitude of the seasonal changes in soil moisture while accurately capturing the timing of the variations during the year in winter the deviation of ltf gw simulated soil moisture was greater than that of ltf which is related to the bias of winter crop water consumption in the model although there is no observed groundwater data at these three stations we compared the available groundwater table depth observation at the nearest daxing station as fig 4k shows ltf gw accurately captures the increasing trend of groundwater table depth in irrigated areas the correlation coefficient between ltf gw and observation is 0 71 in 2010 and the correlation coefficient between ltf and observation is 0 12 these comparison results indicate that our model has improved the performance in simulating water and energy variables after considering human activities and demonstrates the necessity of incorporating more complete irrigation modules such as winter crop water consumption in land surface models 4 2 spatial variations in land water and energy the climatologic differences the differences between the long term means in the hydrological variables between the ltf gw and ltf simulations are shown in fig 7 it can be seen that the groundwater table depth was significantly deepened in the plain area in front of the taihang mountain fig 7a where patterns of groundwater changes corresponded with the groundwater extraction rate fig 2c the groundwater table depth deepened by about 0 5 2 m in most of the extraction areas while in the more serious extraction areas like baoding shijiazhuang and southeast of beijing the groundwater table depth has fallen by more than 4 m and tws has also been affected seriously fig 7b illustrates that the tws of bth significantly reduced in areas with excessive groundwater extraction for beijing shijiazhuang and baoding the water deficiency caused by groundwater pumping per unit area could exceed 24 cm more than 160 000 tons per grid unit the increase in the groundwater table depth indicated that groundwater extraction in regions with intensive human activities has caused a deficit in the groundwater budget which may cause conflicts between water supply and demand fig 7c and 7d show the differences in the surface 2 cm and deep 100 cm soil moisture between ltf gw and ltf respectively in most irrigated areas both surface and deep soil moisture increased from 2000 2010 comparing fig 7c and 7d with fig 2c shows that agricultural irrigation caused the wetted soil on the plains of the bth and that the response of surface soil was stronger than that of deep soil in addition the deep soil moisture decreased in beijing tangshan and baoding where the high groundwater extraction rate caused the rapid drop of the groundwater table and the hydraulic relationship between the soil and aquifer altered it should be emphasized that the changes of soil moisture were significant while the value was small compared to natural soil moisture the changes in runoff were similar to the spatial distribution of non irrigation water use for example the industry and urban public water use fig 7e the reason was that the wastewater produced from these activities was added to the runoff the increased runoff was up to 32 mm per year in major industrial cities beijing baoding shijiazhuang tianjin changes in groundwater will affect land heat fluxes so we further analyzed the simulated heat fluxes the differences between the ltf gw and ltf simulations are shown in fig 8 we can see that the latent heat flux shows an increase and the sensible heat flux shows a decrease on the plain region which is related to the wetting effect of irrigation consistent with the increased near surface soil moisture fig 7c the latent heat flux was enhanced the average latent heat flux in the bth region increased by less than 4 w m 2 while it increased by 8 w m 2 in the regions with excessive extraction fig 8a the energy into the soil decreased and the resistance to temperature increased more caused by the increased specific heat capacity due to the wetting soil thus sensible heat flux and the ground temperature decreased changes in ground temperature correspond to the varied heat fluxes just described fig 8c cooling effects appeared in areas where the soil was wetted by irrigation although the effect was weak and could not pass the significance test the differences in heat fluxes were correlated with the water demand to further understand how hwr affected the energy fluxes in bth we analyzed the spatial distribution of the differences in the radiation fluxes fig 8d 8f the surface net radiation was approximately equal to the sum of the latent and sensible heat fluxes fig 8d showed that the variation of absorbed solar radiation was not obvious after groundwater extraction thus the spatial distribution of the changes in the sensible heat flux was in accord with the latent heat flux patterns and the value was slightly smaller than that in the latent heat flux fig 8a this was related to a decrease in the upward longwave radiation associated with the cooling effect of irrigation fig 8e and an increase in net radiation from the ground surface fig 8f 4 3 annual and intra annual variations in land water and energy we also compared the intra annual and annual changes in the land hydrological variables between the ltf gw and ltf to highlight the impact of groundwater extraction only the values of grid cells with a groundwater extraction rate exceeding 2 000 m3 yr 1 were averaged fig 9 a shows that the groundwater table dropped almost linearly by more than 2 5 m from 2000 to 2012 and the changes occurred throughout the year with a slightly greater impact in summer fig 9b the annual and intra annual time series of tws are shown in fig 9c and 9d human groundwater extraction significantly decreased tws as shown in fig 9c furthermore a deficiency in tws could be distinguished in the growing season fig 9d fig 9e and 9f show the annual and intra annual changes in surface soil moisture it can be seen that surface soil moisture was 0 01 m3m 3 greater than its natural state this was because the groundwater extraction used for irrigation was introduced as effective precipitation into the topsoil in the hwr schemes as described in section 3 1 we can see that the increase in surface soil moisture in the growing season about 0 02 m3m 3 was greater than that in the nongrowing season less than 0 01 m3 m 3 fig 9g and 9h show the variation of deep soil moisture the changes in annual deep soil moisture were smaller than that of the surface soil similar to the surface soil deep soil moisture increased by about 0 01 m3 m 3 during the growing season due to irrigation fig 9i indicates that the trend of latent heat flux is in accord with precipitation comparing the red and black lines in fig 9i and 9j human groundwater withdrawal led to increased soil moisture and enhanced latent heat flux the annual latent heat flux increased by about 8 w m 2 in areas with irrigation and the increase occurred mainly within the growing season 4 4 contributions of climate and groundwater extraction to tws the above evaluations highlighted that excessive groundwater extraction could negatively affect tws and amplify the water shortage therefore we further studied the contributions of climate factors and groundwater extraction to tws to generalize the attribution of tws from the ltf gw simulations from 2000 to 2012 we used the regression method wu et al 2020 with precipitation et snowmelt and groundwater extraction changes as predictor variables via the following equation 5 y a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a 3 x 3 a 4 x 4 b where y is the standardized annual tws subtracting the mean and dividing by its standard deviation x i is standardized annual precipitation snowmelt and evapotranspiration and groundwater extraction at each grid cell a i and b denote the regression coefficients and the intercept the contributions were calculated with regression coefficients ranging between 0 and 1 as follows 6 con i a i i 1 4 a i first we analyzed the spatial distribution of the linear trends for the climate factors tws and groundwater extraction from 2000 to 2012 obtained from ltf gw simulation fig 10 for tws the decreasing trends were mainly found in most areas of bth regions with a decreasing trend of tws always coincided with groundwater over exploitation fig 2 this result is inconsistent with increasing precipitation this could be explained by the increased evaporation due to irrigation the results show that 32 of the significant decreasing trends of tws were related to gw extraction the contributions of climate factors were 19 21 and 28 for precipitation snowmelt and et respectively fig 11 the groundwater extraction was the dominant factor suggesting that the bth region experienced rapid tws depletion due to irrigated agriculture from 2000 to 2012 in beijing langfang xingtai and handan a significant increase in groundwater extraction outweighed the increasing precipitation over 2000 2012 figs 10 and 11 more precipitation increased infiltration and led to an increasing tws in these regions if pumping was overlooked however serious exploitation of groundwater in these areas reduced tws even abundant precipitation cannot compensate for the evaporation loss of irrigation therefore a decrease in the difference of precipitation minus evapotranspiration led to a decrease in infiltration and thus a decrease in tws fig 10 in urban areas taking beijing as an example as shown in fig 11 the contribution of evapotranspiration is great in the southeast of beijing which is mainly associated with the combined effects of ecosystem construction and industrial and urban public water use fig 2 shows that the non irrigation water use accounts for a large proportion of the total groundwater extraction in the southeast of beijing as is described in section 3 1 the water used for ecosystem construction was served as precipitation into the surface soil part of the water for livestock industry and urban public use was treated as evapotranspiration according to the data provided by the water resources bulletin the ratio is 0 45 0 73 thus the combined effect of ecosystem construction and industrial water use makes the contribution of evapotranspiration great in the southeast of beijing fig 11 tws changes in 52 of urbanized areas are dominated by groundwater extraction and 20 of urbanized areas are dominated by et overall changes in tws were dominated by groundwater extraction in the bth region purple colors in fig 11 the regions dominated by snowfall depended on the altitude green colors in fig 11 in humid areas changes in precipitation were the dominant factor in tws blue colors in fig 11 5 discussion 5 1 model performance we compared the simulated hydrological variables and heat fluxes with various observations results highlight the necessity of considering glf and hwr in high resolution land surface models figs 3 and 4 show that the simulated groundwater table depth by ltf gw fits better with the observations in terms of spatial distribution and temporal changes it should be noted that only unconfined aquifers were considered in this study and the groundwater observations are from unconfined wells in reality groundwater is not only extracted from unconfined aquifers but also from confined aquifers in the land surface model groundwater is usually as an unconfined aquifer added below the soil this simplified approach can be further improved in the large scale model as more hydrogeological information is available in the future fig 5 shows that ltf gw can capture the loss of tws caused by excessive groundwater extraction although this loss was underestimated in the end of the study period uncertainties caused by data processing when comparing the coarse resolution observations and high resolution simulation is one of the difficulties faced by high resolution model validation the comparison of simulation results and energy flux further emphasizes the advantages of the ltf gw simulation but the simulated soil moisture is not ideal on the whole although the observations we have collected are limited and there are uncertainties associated with the mismatch between the observation and the simulated results the advantages of applying the model in typical areas with frequent human activities are obvious 5 2 impact of groundwater extraction on land water and energy cycles the results in sections 4 1 and 4 2 show that human water use has a significant impact on land water and energy cycles in the bth region especially in densely populated urban areas agricultural land accounts for the highest proportion in the bth region and farmland irrigation has reduced water storage with economic development and population growth domestic and industrial water consumption are also increasing which exacerbates water stress fig 4 shows that agricultural irrigation consumed large amounts of groundwater resources and regional groundwater funnels were formed this severely restricted the sustainable development of regional water resources this model can provide an effective platform for water resource managers to monitor and assess water resources and for decision making the model in this study can also be used for other groundwater extraction hotspots around the world wada et al 2010 such as europe southern iran central united states northern india and pakistan to study the impact of human water use 5 3 limitations and uncertainties the model established in this work was successfully applied to assess the impacts of groundwater extraction on water and energy cycles however it should be noted that there are still some limitations in the present study the estimation of the groundwater extraction rate for each grid cell was based on a simple bottom up representation which overestimates the irrigation water demand to bring the soil to saturation a more realistic definition of irrigation water demand such as a definition based on the difference between potential evapotranspiration and water availability is needed even the results indicate the reasonableness of the current estimation besides the uncertainties within the simplified glf and hwr schemes the effects of land use change and other water regulation activities such as reservoir scheduling and water transfer projects long et al 2020 have not been fully considered to alleviate the water scarcity the middle route of the south to north water diversion project was conducted and achieved great success in northern china only the impacts of human groundwater exploitation were assessed in this work and the results are relatively reasonable in order to provide scientific guidance for policy making more comprehensive it is necessary to complete the description of human activities in the model in addition the observational data used for the evaluation were still limited these aspects will be the focus of future studies 6 conclusions in this study the effects of groundwater extraction on hydrological process and energy cycle in bth from 2000 to 2012 were estimated by high resolution simulations from a land surface model that included glf and hwr schemes comparing the simulations with the in situ observational groundwater table depth surface energy fluxes ground temperature and soil moisture demonstrated that the model can reliably represent the temporal and spatial variations in the hydrothermal variables the results illustrated the hydrothermal effects of groundwater extraction human groundwater extraction deepened the groundwater table depth by approximately 0 5 2 m between 2000 and 2012 across the plains in front of taihang mountain and rapidly reduced tws the water deficiency caused by groundwater pumping exceeded 24 cm per unit area the groundwater extraction used for irrigation increased surface soil moisture by about 12 and the wastewater produced from non irrigation water use increased runoff by 26 in baoding shijiazhuang and southeast of beijing groundwater extraction changed the water and energy budgets leading to a significant cooling effect in the irrigated areas of bth the latent heat flux increased by approximately 18 on the plains due to the long term groundwater extraction the changes in the latent heat flux were slightly larger than the sensible heat flux which was associated with a decrease in the upward longwave radiation caused by the cooling effect of irrigation and an increase in net radiation from the ground surface in addition the groundwater table depth deepened by approximately 0 1 m year 1 over groundwater exploited areas of the bth from 2000 to 2012 the changes in the groundwater table depth and tws occurred throughout the year with a slightly greater impact in summer the increase in surface soil moisture was most significant during the growing season by about 0 02 m3 m 3 due to irrigation the annual latent heat flux in irrigation areas has increased by almost a quarter compared to the natural amount which mainly occurred in the growing season the reduction in tws was mainly due to the combined effects of excessive exploitation and climate while the contribution of extraction cannot be ignored this model provided an efficient framework that can be used in other hotspots to assess human impacts on land processes credit authorship contribution statement longhuan wang conceptualization formal

3349,groundwater extraction influences water redistribution and hydrothermal processes which significantly affect the water cycle and the sustainable development of the economy and environment in this study a high resolution 1 km land surface model that considered groundwater lateral flow and groundwater extraction was used to investigate the impacts of groundwater extraction on hydrological process simulations with and without groundwater extraction were conducted for the beijing tianjin hebei bth region for the period 2000 2012 the comparison of the simulated results and measurements from water wells automatic weather stations and satellite observations demonstrated the good performance of the model our results showed that groundwater extraction deepened the groundwater table depth by approximately 0 5 2 m across the plains and rapidly reduced terrestrial water storage tws exceeding 24 cm per unit area from 2000 to 2012 both surface 2 cm and deep 100 cm soil moisture showed an increase of 0 01 0 02 m3 m 3 due to groundwater extraction used for irrigation groundwater extraction changed the water and energy budgets leading to a significant cooling effect in the irrigated areas of bth the latent heat flux showed an increase of 30 w m 2 across the plains caused by the long term exploitation the surface soil moisture and latent heat flux increased mainly within the growing season due to farmland irrigation the reduction in tws was mainly due to the combined effects of over exploitation and climate while the contribution of extraction could not be ignored across the bth region keywords groundwater extraction hydrological process beijing tianjin hebei region land surface model 1 introduction the increase in population the expansion of irrigated area and economic development have driven a nearly eight fold increase in global water demand during the past 100 years vörösmarty et al 2000 wisser et al 2010 pokhrel et al 2012 haddeland et al 2014 wada et al 2016 to meet the increasing water demand humans have extracted a large amount of groundwater global groundwater extraction has nearly doubled from 570 billion to 1 000 billion tons between 2000 and 2007 pokhrel et al 2013 due to rapid urbanization and intensive agricultural irrigation china has extracted vast amounts of groundwater over the past few years according to the china water resources bulletin 111 7 billion tons of groundwater were extracted and the six northern regions including the songhua liaohe haihe yellow and huaihe river basins and the northwest area basin alone accounted for 98 93 billion tons in 2014 on the north china plain groundwater extraction has increased particularly rapidly with an average annual groundwater extraction of 3 9 billion tons in the 1960 s and 20 billion tons in the 21st century li et al 2013 excessive groundwater extraction often leads to water depletion that may affect ecological and hydrological processes konikow and kendy 2005 leng et al 2015 for example excessive groundwater extraction lowers groundwater tables reduces soil water content affects the absorption by vegetation roots and may even destroy the ecosystem wada et al 2013 wada and heinrich 2013 zeng et al 2017a extraction of groundwater for irrigation increases local latent heat flux and reduces sensible heat flux affecting local and regional climate zhang et al 2007 zou et al 2015 zeng et al 2016 zeng et al 2017b moreover unreasonable exploitation and use of groundwater also lead to a number of environmental problems such as land subsidence soil salinization reduction of wetlands seawater intrusion and groundwater pollution sundell et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to fully understand and assess the hydrological effects caused by groundwater extraction at the same time it also promotes the search for a balance between the regulation of water resources and the sustainable development of natural ecosystems however information regarding groundwater extraction is limited and extensive observations for monitoring groundwater extraction are lacking moreover it is not easy to separate out the effects of human activities and climate change in observations in recent decades multiple land surface and hydrological models have been developed to study the impacts of groundwater extraction on hydrological and ecological processes haddeland et al 2006 döll et al 2012 zou et al 2015 zeng et al 2016 zeng et al 2017b for example hanasaki et al 2008 incorporated reservoir operation and human water withdrawal schemes into a global water resources model to evaluate global water availability and use at a subannual timescale pokhrel et al 2012 developed a land surface model that considered a human water regulation module and found that irrigation increased latent heat flux by up to 50 w m 2 in the summer zeng et al 2017b used an earth system model incorporated with a groundwater extraction scheme and found that the increase in precipitation in the north china plain is related to increasing evapotranspiration caused by irrigation most of the above studies have been carried out at the global scale at regional scales a higher resolution modeling framework is needed to simulate and predict the impacts of water extraction on hydrological processes wood et al 2011 wada et al 2016 to better represent water and energy heterogeneity at regional scales groundwater lateral flow cannot be ignored in high resolution simulations ji et al 2017 some studies have shown that groundwater lateral flow can replenish the groundwater depletion caused by excessive exploitation especially for plains the recharge efficiency can reach up to 40 zeng et al 2016 wang et al 2020 this shows that anthropogenic activities are inseparable from the lateral flow processes zeng et al 2016 the region of interest in this study is beijing tianjin hebei bth fig 1 which is a city cluster in northern china with beijing as its core as an ecological barrier in the north china plain bth is of great significance to the protection of the human living environment zheng and cao 2015 cao et al 2016 the rapid development of agriculture and industry has resulted in great water demand based on the china water resources bulletin groundwater accounted for 61 26 and 80 of the total water supply in beijing tianjin and hebei in 2009 respectively feng et al 2013 excessive extraction and consumption of groundwater have led to severe groundwater depletion over the past decades with a depletion of 8 3 1 1 km3 year 1 during 2003 2010 feng et al 2018 long et al 2020 this groundwater depletion can be detected using the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data feng et al 2013 2018 huang et al 2015 pan et al 2017 zhong et al 2019 previous studies have evaluated the influences of climate change and human water use on water storage in bth using hydrological or land surface models li et al 2017 xia et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 these works were mainly focused on changes in the groundwater level and water storage caused by human water withdrawal however the impact of groundwater extraction on water and energy fluxes has not been considered thoroughly in addition the spatial resolution of the datasets and models used in previous studies is relatively coarse such as 0 5 0 5 grace mascon product used in zhong et al 2019 which is insufficient to provide local information and thus could not represent the water and energy heterogeneity making a comprehensive assessment of the human impacts more difficult the objective of this paper is to quantify and evaluate the impact of human groundwater withdrawal on terrestrial water and energy cycles in the bth region with high resolution simulations from a land surface model that includes groundwater lateral flow and groundwater extraction in the next section the model description and equations as well as experimental design and validation data are presented in section 4 we show the validation and evaluation we also discuss the advantages of the model and limitations and finally draw conclusions this provided a useful tool for water managers to investigate the human effects on hydrological process with more accurate information on regional water availability 2 domain of study the bth region is the political economic and cultural center of china extending from 36 03 n to 42 40 n and 113 27 e to 119 50 e and including hebei province beijing and tianjin with an area of 21 8000 km2 cai et al 2018 it is located in the southern part of the yanshan mountains in the eastern part of the taihang mountain and in the western part of the bohai rim the terrain rises from the southeast to the northwest fig 1a and the main land cover types include cropland woodland shrub and construction land with crop land accounting for the largest proportion quaternary strata are widely distributed in the bth according to the burial characteristics and hydraulic properties groundwater can be divided into four aquifers from top to bottom the first aquifer is shallow groundwater and the second to fourth layers are confined aquifers yang et al 2021 the bth region belongs to the littoral and semi arid climatic zone with four distinct seasons and nearly 70 of the rainfall occurring in summer feng et al 2013 annual precipitation is about 400 600 mm per year while less than 400 mm of rain falls in the plateau and hilly areas in the northwest of the bth liu et al 2002 due to a suitable environment human activities and agricultural production dominate the water consumption is concentrated on the plains which contains the main agricultural areas and cities agricultural irrigation depends largely on groundwater extraction and the amount of groundwater extraction in the bth region has doubled based on statistics of the water resources bulletin wrb the contradiction between water supply and demand in the bth is prominent the per capita volume of water resources in bth is less than 200 m3 calculated based on the administrative area which is less than one ninth of the national average liu and xia 2004 xia et al 2007 however the groundwater levels stabilized in recent years under the south to north water diversion conducted by the government long et al 2020 3 model data and experimental design 3 1 model description the land surface model

taihang mountain and mainly from groundwater extraction for non irrigated water the proportion of industrial water was relatively large and mainly located in beijing tianjin and shijiazhuang 3 2 experimental design in this work two simulations were established from 2000 to 2012 to investigate the influence of hwr on the water and energy cycles two reasons led to the choice of the study period the first is that the statistical data of human water use from the water resources bulletin of tianjin and hebei are only available after 2000 the other is that the east route of the south to north water diversion project delivering water to tianjin began to operate in 2013 this has some effects on the hydrological cycle over the bth but our model did not take into consideration the south to north water diversion project therefore we used data from 2000 to 2012 the first simulation ltf included the glf module and the second simulation ltf gw considered both glf and hwr modules the spatial resolution of all simulations was set to 0 0083 1 km at the equator over the bth region and the time steps were 1800 s the atmospheric forcing dataset was obtained from the data assimilation and modeling center for tibetan multi spheres institute of tibetan plateau research chinese academy of sciences yang et al 2010 all simulations were run for 300 years by recycling the meteorological forcing with each configuration for example with and without the hwr module before the formal simulations to reach equilibrium we also used the equilibrium groundwater table depth obtained from fan et al 2013 as the initial value before the spin up in addition to match the surface parameters with the high resolution simulations we collected three datasets the first was the multi source integrated chinese land cover map available at a 1 km resolution ran et al 2012 the second data source was the soil characteristics database which was developed for use in the land surface modeling with a 1 km resolution shangguan et al 2013 the third dataset was the leaf area index with a 1 km resolution yuan et al 2011 then using these datasets we modified the land cover the percentage of clay and sand and the leaf area index in the surface data 3 3 validation data we collected data from water wells eddy covariance ec and automatic weather station aws systems to validate the performance of the model table 1 shows the validation data in this study the first dataset includes groundwater table depth observations in the year 2000 from 296 water wells which were provided by the ministry of water resources we also collected monthly groundwater table depth data for the years 2005 2012 at 17 stations from the geological environment monitoring institute of china geological survey in this study only the unconfined groundwater system was considered the groundwater well data used for validation come from unconfined groundwater wells we normalized the values of observed and simulated groundwater table depths to eliminate errors associated with the scale mismatch between the two values after standardization the variability of groundwater table depth was preserved the ec and aws data were from the multi scale surface flux and meteorological element observation dataset from the hai river basin jia et al 2012 liu et al 2013 the three stations are daxing station in the south of beijing miyun station in the northeast of beijing and guantao station in the southeast of hebei as shown in fig 1b other observation data applied in this study included tws derived from zhong et al 2019 that reconstructed tws for china based on precipitation and combined the grace csr rl06 and jpl rl06 mascon products which have been processed into a 0 25 0 25 resolution gridded format in addition grace tellus jpl rl05 mascon products with a spatial resolution of 1 1 landerer and swenson 2012 were used to validate the simulated results 4 results 4 1 validation before studying the effect of groundwater extraction on hydrological process and energy cycle we used a variety of observational data including groundwater table depth tws ground temperature heat fluxes and soil moisture to evaluate the model simulations fig 3 shows the comparison of observed groundwater table depth and the simulation results from ltf gw in 2000 in general ltf gw showed good performance in reproducing the spatial distribution and temporal changes of groundwater table depth the simulated groundwater table depth by ltf gw was much shallower fig 3b than the observations in fig 3a over the plains these biases occurred because the observations in 2000 included the effects of human activities in previous years and the model requires a warm up process for the simulation of the effects of human activities thus the simulated groundwater table depth is shallower the scatter plot of fig 3c shows good consistency between the simulations and observations the linear regression of observations and simulation results see fig 3c showed that the correlation coefficient was 0 76 the simulated groundwater table depth using ltf gw fit better with the observations the root mean square errors of ltf gw and ltf were 3 82 and 5 71 respectively the comparison of groundwater table depth between ltf gw simulations and observations from the wrb of hebei province further highlighted the advantages ltf gw after considering the hwr scheme the locations of simulated groundwater funnels caused by groundwater extraction are close to the locations provided by the wrb fig s1 the map of simulated groundwater table depth fig 3b showed shallow depths in the plains which is related to the water convergence after considering the glf these results emphasized the importance of including glf and groundwater extraction in the current hydrological modeling considering that the observation well is a single point and the simulated groundwater table depth represents the average value of a grid wada et al 2016 large deviations may occur in the direct comparison between observations and simulations the main point of the validation was to evaluate the performance of the model in simulating groundwater dynamics therefore we compared the normalized groundwater table depth time series to avoid the influence of systematic deviations on the analysis results fig 4 compared the monthly groundwater table depth from the ltf gw with observations results indicate that the ltf gw captured the deepening trends of groundwater table depth in bth while the ltf was less consistent with observations fig s2 good agreement was obtained from 2005 to 2010 for most stations including major groundwater extraction regions such as shijiazhuang handan and southeast of beijing the correlation coefficient was greater than 0 8 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse was close to 1 however the biases were relatively large even with a high correlation coefficient for stations in langfang in hebei province imprecisely prescribed irrigated areas and uncertainty in the match between observations and simulations may have caused the discrepancy in the results to show the improvement of ltf gw after considering the hwr scheme we compared the simulated tws anomalies twsa with grace satellite data the spatial distribution of the temporal correlation coefficients between the simulated monthly twsa and the grace data over the period 2002 2012 is shown in fig 5 the model that included human groundwater extraction was able to capture the seasonal changes in tws for most regions fig 5b fig 5c compares the time series of the mean monthly twsa of both simulations ltf and ltf gw and observations the trend of twsa simulated by the ltf gw was 0 02 cm month 1 which was much closer to the trend indicated by the grace data 0 1 cm month 1 conversely the trend of twsa predicted by the ltf was 0 07 cm month 1 which is consistent with the annual variation trend of precipitation 0 08 mm month 1 at the beginning of the study period 2002 2006 the twsa trend simulated by ltf gw 0 03 cm month 1 was consistent with the observation 0 05 cm month 1 the twsa trend simulated by ltf gw was less than the observation which was mainly associated with the uncertainty in the grace data processing the resolution of grace data is 0 25 and the resolution of ltf gw is 1 km which will cause uncertainty during spatial averaging as shown in fig 5c moreover surface water use accounting for 22 26 of total water use also affects twsa which was not considered the comparisons displayed in fig 5 illustrate the rationality of including hwr in the model furthermore we compared the simulated results with in site observations from the ec and aws systems fig 6 shows the comparison of the simulated daily hydrological variables and energy fluxes from the ltf gw and ltf with daily observations from daxing guantao and miyun stations during 2010 to clarify the comparison of the results precipitation from the meteorological forcing data and observations are shown in fig 6a 6c fig 6d 6f show that the simulated ground temperature from both simulations matched well with the observations for guantao and daxing stations where groundwater extraction was large due to farmland irrigation the model performance was improved when human water use was considered the results from ltf gw simulation and the observations were almost equal from may to october this improvement was particularly evident for simulated heat fluxes during the growing season from april to october fig 6g 6l for miyun station the effect of groundwater extraction was less obvious the heat fluxes were hardly affected because of forest land cover and less groundwater use from fig 6m 6o both simulations underestimated the magnitude of the seasonal changes in soil moisture while accurately capturing the timing of the variations during the year in winter the deviation of ltf gw simulated soil moisture was greater than that of ltf which is related to the bias of winter crop water consumption in the model although there is no observed groundwater data at these three stations we compared the available groundwater table depth observation at the nearest daxing station as fig 4k shows ltf gw accurately captures the increasing trend of groundwater table depth in irrigated areas the correlation coefficient between ltf gw and observation is 0 71 in 2010 and the correlation coefficient between ltf and observation is 0 12 these comparison results indicate that our model has improved the performance in simulating water and energy variables after considering human activities and demonstrates the necessity of incorporating more complete irrigation modules such as winter crop water consumption in land surface models 4 2 spatial variations in land water and energy the climatologic differences the differences between the long term means in the hydrological variables between the ltf gw and ltf simulations are shown in fig 7 it can be seen that the groundwater table depth was significantly deepened in the plain area in front of the taihang mountain fig 7a where patterns of groundwater changes corresponded with the groundwater extraction rate fig 2c the groundwater table depth deepened by about 0 5 2 m in most of the extraction areas while in the more serious extraction areas like baoding shijiazhuang and southeast of beijing the groundwater table depth has fallen by more than 4 m and tws has also been affected seriously fig 7b illustrates that the tws of bth significantly reduced in areas with excessive groundwater extraction for beijing shijiazhuang and baoding the water deficiency caused by groundwater pumping per unit area could exceed 24 cm more than 160 000 tons per grid unit the increase in the groundwater table depth indicated that groundwater extraction in regions with intensive human activities has caused a deficit in the groundwater budget which may cause conflicts between water supply and demand fig 7c and 7d show the differences in the surface 2 cm and deep 100 cm soil moisture between ltf gw and ltf respectively in most irrigated areas both surface and deep soil moisture increased from 2000 2010 comparing fig 7c and 7d with fig 2c shows that agricultural irrigation caused the wetted soil on the plains of the bth and that the response of surface soil was stronger than that of deep soil in addition the deep soil moisture decreased in beijing tangshan and baoding where the high groundwater extraction rate caused the rapid drop of the groundwater table and the hydraulic relationship between the soil and aquifer altered it should be emphasized that the changes of soil moisture were significant while the value was small compared to natural soil moisture the changes in runoff were similar to the spatial distribution of non irrigation water use for example the industry and urban public water use fig 7e the reason was that the wastewater produced from these activities was added to the runoff the increased runoff was up to 32 mm per year in major industrial cities beijing baoding shijiazhuang tianjin changes in groundwater will affect land heat fluxes so we further analyzed the simulated heat fluxes the differences between the ltf gw and ltf simulations are shown in fig 8 we can see that the latent heat flux shows an increase and the sensible heat flux shows a decrease on the plain region which is related to the wetting effect of irrigation consistent with the increased near surface soil moisture fig 7c the latent heat flux was enhanced the average latent heat flux in the bth region increased by less than 4 w m 2 while it increased by 8 w m 2 in the regions with excessive extraction fig 8a the energy into the soil decreased and the resistance to temperature increased more caused by the increased specific heat capacity due to the wetting soil thus sensible heat flux and the ground temperature decreased changes in ground temperature correspond to the varied heat fluxes just described fig 8c cooling effects appeared in areas where the soil was wetted by irrigation although the effect was weak and could not pass the significance test the differences in heat fluxes were correlated with the water demand to further understand how hwr affected the energy fluxes in bth we analyzed the spatial distribution of the differences in the radiation fluxes fig 8d 8f the surface net radiation was approximately equal to the sum of the latent and sensible heat fluxes fig 8d showed that the variation of absorbed solar radiation was not obvious after groundwater extraction thus the spatial distribution of the changes in the sensible heat flux was in accord with the latent heat flux patterns and the value was slightly smaller than that in the latent heat flux fig 8a this was related to a decrease in the upward longwave radiation associated with the cooling effect of irrigation fig 8e and an increase in net radiation from the ground surface fig 8f 4 3 annual and intra annual variations in land water and energy we also compared the intra annual and annual changes in the land hydrological variables between the ltf gw and ltf to highlight the impact of groundwater extraction only the values of grid cells with a groundwater extraction rate exceeding 2 000 m3 yr 1 were averaged fig 9 a shows that the groundwater table dropped almost linearly by more than 2 5 m from 2000 to 2012 and the changes occurred throughout the year with a slightly greater impact in summer fig 9b the annual and intra annual time series of tws are shown in fig 9c and 9d human groundwater extraction significantly decreased tws as shown in fig 9c furthermore a deficiency in tws could be distinguished in the growing season fig 9d fig 9e and 9f show the annual and intra annual changes in surface soil moisture it can be seen that surface soil moisture was 0 01 m3m 3 greater than its natural state this was because the groundwater extraction used for irrigation was introduced as effective precipitation into the topsoil in the hwr schemes as described in section 3 1 we can see that the increase in surface soil moisture in the growing season about 0 02 m3m 3 was greater than that in the nongrowing season less than 0 01 m3 m 3 fig 9g and 9h show the variation of deep soil moisture the changes in annual deep soil moisture were smaller than that of the surface soil similar to the surface soil deep soil moisture increased by about 0 01 m3 m 3 during the growing season due to irrigation fig 9i indicates that the trend of latent heat flux is in accord with precipitation comparing the red and black lines in fig 9i and 9j human groundwater withdrawal led to increased soil moisture and enhanced latent heat flux the annual latent heat flux increased by about 8 w m 2 in areas with irrigation and the increase occurred mainly within the growing season 4 4 contributions of climate and groundwater extraction to tws the above evaluations highlighted that excessive groundwater extraction could negatively affect tws and amplify the water shortage therefore we further studied the contributions of climate factors and groundwater extraction to tws to generalize the attribution of tws from the ltf gw simulations from 2000 to 2012 we used the regression method wu et al 2020 with precipitation et snowmelt and groundwater extraction changes as predictor variables via the following equation 5 y a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a 3 x 3 a 4 x 4 b where y is the standardized annual tws subtracting the mean and dividing by its standard deviation x i is standardized annual precipitation snowmelt and evapotranspiration and groundwater extraction at each grid cell a i and b denote the regression coefficients and the intercept the contributions were calculated with regression coefficients ranging between 0 and 1 as follows 6 con i a i i 1 4 a i first we analyzed the spatial distribution of the linear trends for the climate factors tws and groundwater extraction from 2000 to 2012 obtained from ltf gw simulation fig 10 for tws the decreasing trends were mainly found in most areas of bth regions with a decreasing trend of tws always coincided with groundwater over exploitation fig 2 this result is inconsistent with increasing precipitation this could be explained by the increased evaporation due to irrigation the results show that 32 of the significant decreasing trends of tws were related to gw extraction the contributions of climate factors were 19 21 and 28 for precipitation snowmelt and et respectively fig 11 the groundwater extraction was the dominant factor suggesting that the bth region experienced rapid tws depletion due to irrigated agriculture from 2000 to 2012 in beijing langfang xingtai and handan a significant increase in groundwater extraction outweighed the increasing precipitation over 2000 2012 figs 10 and 11 more precipitation increased infiltration and led to an increasing tws in these regions if pumping was overlooked however serious exploitation of groundwater in these areas reduced tws even abundant precipitation cannot compensate for the evaporation loss of irrigation therefore a decrease in the difference of precipitation minus evapotranspiration led to a decrease in infiltration and thus a decrease in tws fig 10 in urban areas taking beijing as an example as shown in fig 11 the contribution of evapotranspiration is great in the southeast of beijing which is mainly associated with the combined effects of ecosystem construction and industrial and urban public water use fig 2 shows that the non irrigation water use accounts for a large proportion of the total groundwater extraction in the southeast of beijing as is described in section 3 1 the water used for ecosystem construction was served as precipitation into the surface soil part of the water for livestock industry and urban public use was treated as evapotranspiration according to the data provided by the water resources bulletin the ratio is 0 45 0 73 thus the combined effect of ecosystem construction and industrial water use makes the contribution of evapotranspiration great in the southeast of beijing fig 11 tws changes in 52 of urbanized areas are dominated by groundwater extraction and 20 of urbanized areas are dominated by et overall changes in tws were dominated by groundwater extraction in the bth region purple colors in fig 11 the regions dominated by snowfall depended on the altitude green colors in fig 11 in humid areas changes in precipitation were the dominant factor in tws blue colors in fig 11 5 discussion 5 1 model performance we compared the simulated hydrological variables and heat fluxes with various observations results highlight the necessity of considering glf and hwr in high resolution land surface models figs 3 and 4 show that the simulated groundwater table depth by ltf gw fits better with the observations in terms of spatial distribution and temporal changes it should be noted that only unconfined aquifers were considered in this study and the groundwater observations are from unconfined wells in reality groundwater is not only extracted from unconfined aquifers but also from confined aquifers in the land surface model groundwater is usually as an unconfined aquifer added below the soil this simplified approach can be further improved in the large scale model as more hydrogeological information is available in the future fig 5 shows that ltf gw can capture the loss of tws caused by excessive groundwater extraction although this loss was underestimated in the end of the study period uncertainties caused by data processing when comparing the coarse resolution observations and high resolution simulation is one of the difficulties faced by high resolution model validation the comparison of simulation results and energy flux further emphasizes the advantages of the ltf gw simulation but the simulated soil moisture is not ideal on the whole although the observations we have collected are limited and there are uncertainties associated with the mismatch between the observation and the simulated results the advantages of applying the model in typical areas with frequent human activities are obvious 5 2 impact of groundwater extraction on land water and energy cycles the results in sections 4 1 and 4 2 show that human water use has a significant impact on land water and energy cycles in the bth region especially in densely populated urban areas agricultural land accounts for the highest proportion in the bth region and farmland irrigation has reduced water storage with economic development and population growth domestic and industrial water consumption are also increasing which exacerbates water stress fig 4 shows that agricultural irrigation consumed large amounts of groundwater resources and regional groundwater funnels were formed this severely restricted the sustainable development of regional water resources this model can provide an effective platform for water resource managers to monitor and assess water resources and for decision making the model in this study can also be used for other groundwater extraction hotspots around the world wada et al 2010 such as europe southern iran central united states northern india and pakistan to study the impact of human water use 5 3 limitations and uncertainties the model established in this work was successfully applied to assess the impacts of groundwater extraction on water and energy cycles however it should be noted that there are still some limitations in the present study the estimation of the groundwater extraction rate for each grid cell was based on a simple bottom up representation which overestimates the irrigation water demand to bring the soil to saturation a more realistic definition of irrigation water demand such as a definition based on the difference between potential evapotranspiration and water availability is needed even the results indicate the reasonableness of the current estimation besides the uncertainties within the simplified glf and hwr schemes the effects of land use change and other water regulation activities such as reservoir scheduling and water transfer projects long et al 2020 have not been fully considered to alleviate the water scarcity the middle route of the south to north water diversion project was conducted and achieved great success in northern china only the impacts of human groundwater exploitation were assessed in this work and the results are relatively reasonable in order to provide scientific guidance for policy making more comprehensive it is necessary to complete the description of human activities in the model in addition the observational data used for the evaluation were still limited these aspects will be the focus of future studies 6 conclusions in this study the effects of groundwater extraction on hydrological process and energy cycle in bth from 2000 to 2012 were estimated by high resolution simulations from a land surface model that included glf and hwr schemes comparing the simulations with the in situ observational groundwater table depth surface energy fluxes ground temperature and soil moisture demonstrated that the model can reliably represent the temporal and spatial variations in the hydrothermal variables the results illustrated the hydrothermal effects of groundwater extraction human groundwater extraction deepened the groundwater table depth by approximately 0 5 2 m between 2000 and 2012 across the plains in front of taihang mountain and rapidly reduced tws the water deficiency caused by groundwater pumping exceeded 24 cm per unit area the groundwater extraction used for irrigation increased surface soil moisture by about 12 and the wastewater produced from non irrigation water use increased runoff by 26 in baoding shijiazhuang and southeast of beijing groundwater extraction changed the water and energy budgets leading to a significant cooling effect in the irrigated areas of bth the latent heat flux increased by approximately 18 on the plains due to the long term groundwater extraction the changes in the latent heat flux were slightly larger than the sensible heat flux which was associated with a decrease in the upward longwave radiation caused by the cooling effect of irrigation and an increase in net radiation from the ground surface in addition the groundwater table depth deepened by approximately 0 1 m year 1 over groundwater exploited areas of the bth from 2000 to 2012 the changes in the groundwater table depth and tws occurred throughout the year with a slightly greater impact in summer the increase in surface soil moisture was most significant during the growing season by about 0 02 m3 m 3 due to irrigation the annual latent heat flux in irrigation areas has increased by almost a quarter compared to the natural amount which mainly occurred in the growing season the reduction in tws was mainly due to the combined effects of excessive exploitation and climate while the contribution of extraction cannot be ignored this model provided an efficient framework that can be used in other hotspots to assess human impacts on land processes credit authorship contribution statement longhuan wang conceptualization formal
